While the new bill \u2013 a top priority of the new House Democratic majority \u2013 is expected to pass the House, it is likely to be blocked from becoming law by the Republican-controlled Senate. Still, even the partial passage of what Democrats are calling a \u201cuniversal background checks bill\u201d represents a significant step forward for American gun control advocates, as well as a sign of how far the Democratic party has moved to embrace gun control as a winning issue.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort shared polling data on the 2016 election with a Russian man linked to Moscow\u2019s intelligence agencies, according to special counsel Robert Mueller. Manafort, 69, is also accused of covering up other meetings and contacts with the Russian, an elusive consultant named Konstantin Kilimnik who worked for Manafort on election campaigns for pro-Kremlin politicians in eastern Europe. Attorneys for Manafort disclosed the allegations in a court filing in Washington on Tuesday. They appeared in sections of the filing that were meant to be redacted, but where text underneath blacked-out lines could be copied and viewed. A spokesman for Manafort\u2019s team did not respond to a message asking if the faulty redactions were accidental. The document was later refiled to court with effective redactions. Mueller, who is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and any coordination with Trump\u2019s team, said in a court filing last year that the FBI assesses that Kilimnik \u201chas ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016\u201d. Kilimnik, 48, trained at a university connected to Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, formerly known as the GRU, which allegedly spearheaded the Kremlin\u2019s effort to disrupt the US election in 2016. The US has concluded that the Russian operation was ordered by President Vladimir Putin to help Trump\u2019s campaign. Mueller has also previously said that Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s deputy on the Trump campaign, described Kilimnik as \u201ca former Russian intelligence officer with the GRU\u201d, which Kilimnik denies. In the court document made public on Tuesday, Manafort\u2019s attorneys denied allegations that the former Trump aide lied to Mueller\u2019s team about several topics since he began cooperating with the inquiry. They blamed his false statements on a failure to recall certain details and his lack of access in jail to records that could jog his memory. In a section of their filing meant to have been redacted, the attorneys referred to an allegation from Mueller that Manafort \u201clied about sharing polling data with Mr Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign\u201d. They did not elaborate. Manafort\u2019s attorneys did not deny that Manafort gave Kilimnik the data, instead stating that he had not lied about it but was merely \u201cunable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed\u201d. The attorneys also confirmed that Manafort had met Kilimnik in Madrid, claiming he \u201chad not initially remembered\u201d the meeting but recalled it when confronted with records showing the two were in the Spanish capital at the same time. It was previously known that Kilimnik and Manafort had met twice during 2016 in the US. The date of the Madrid meeting was not stated, but a source familiar with Manafort\u2019s team said it was in early 2017 after Trump had entered office. Manafort\u2019s attorneys also said on Tuesday that when presented with other records by Mueller\u2019s team, he conceded \u201che discussed or may have discussed a Ukraine peace plan with Mr Kilimnik on more than one occasion\u201d. Investigators have been looking into whether Trump associates took any action relating to Russia\u2019s 2014 military intervention in Ukraine, and subsequent US sanctions against Moscow. Trump advisers reportedly worked to broker a backchannel deal for Trump to lift the sanctions around the time he entered office. Kilimnik was reported in February 2017 to be working on a Ukraine peace plan but denied Manafort was involved. Tuesday\u2019s filing was Manafort\u2019s response to allegations from Mueller that he had continued to lie to investigators even after signing a cooperation agreement. The alleged lies led Mueller to tear up the deal, under which prosecutors would have recommended a reduced prison sentence for crimes Manafort has admitted. Manafort was also accused of lying about contacts with Trump administration officials since they entered office in January 2017. His attorneys said on Tuesday he had not intentionally lied and was asked only about his contacts with two specific administration officials. In another poorly redacted section, the attorneys said Mueller specifically alleged Manafort was in contact with someone who asked him permission to use Manafort\u2019s name \u201cas an introduction\u201d in the event that the person met the president. A second alleged contact with a Trump official was based on \u201chearsay purportedly offered by an undisclosed third party\u201d, according to Manafort\u2019s attorneys. They also disclosed on Tuesday that Mueller had discovered several additional contacts between Manafort and the administration, which they described as \u201cmostly indirect\u201d. Mueller alleged that Manafort also lied about a $125,000 payment from a pro-Trump \u201csuper Pac\u201d, a payment he variously described as a reimbursement for money he was owed, payment for work he did, and a loan. Manafort\u2019s team on Tuesday blamed confusion about how the money was recorded by his accountants.",

The armed forces were called in to protect the UK\u2019s busiest airport as Scotland Yard said on Tuesday evening its officers were among those who had seen the device in the air. The Metropolitan police commander Stuart Cundy said: \u201cWe are carrying out extensive searches around the Heathrow area to identify any people who may be responsible for the operation of the drone. \u201cI want to be clear that the illegal operation of drones at an airfield is extremely dangerous.

Inbound flights were not affected. While the disruption at airport on Tuesday evening was less severe than that caused in the run-up to Christmas, when 140,000 people were affected by repeated closures at Gatwick, the latest incident raises further questions about the UK authorities\u2019 preparedness to protect vital infrastructure from the devices.

So at the moment I don\u2019t think the English referees are able to use the system. If you are not sure with the system you have to follow the ball, but he stopped, and so for our defenders he was offside. I don\u2019t know about the keeper, but I know about our defenders. They have to study the system. It is very strange that there is no system in the Premier League but in the Carabao Cup there is. It is very strange for us, the players, and I think also the referees.

To get the benefit is nice, of course, but I am not happy to win games like this. I am pro-technology because you cannot stop evolution. But waiting how we wait ... the rules are not clear. I am watching every week in La Liga and no-one is happy, whether they are fighting for the title or against relegation.

I\u2019m sure they got it right. VAR is part of the game, a big part of football going forward. Chelsea had a point to prove, we knew it was going to be tough.

We\u2019ll be off in a minute!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"216ca42127751055575d2226147c3eef5223130b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/216ca42127751055575d2226147c3eef5223130b/0_131_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tottenham players applaud their fans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tottenham players applaud their fans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-08T20:02:26.104Z\">at 8.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c34fe8fe4b02fb91ff10b14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-08T19:50:19.046Z\">7.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mauricio Pochettino talks!</strong> \u201cIt is a semi-final and we are trying to win.

Chelsea lost to Stoke in the final.</p> <p><strong>In the 1991 quarters of the Rumbelows Cup, Chelsea thrashed a dismal Tottenham side 0-0 at Stamford Bridge, then did what they should have done in the replay at White Hart Lane. </strong>A 3-0 rout, with Andy Townsend, Kerry Dixon and Dennis Wise in the goals. Chelsea lost to Sheffield Wednesday in the semis.</p> <p><strong>The 2002 Worthington Cup semis saw Chelsea win the first leg at Stamford Bridge 2-1 thanks to a pair of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink goals, but were steamrollered 5-1 in the White Hart Lane return. </strong>Steffen Iversen, Tim Sherwood, Teddy Sheringham, Simon Davies and Sergei Rebrov did the business for Spurs, while Hasselbaink was sent off for pushing his hand in Sheringham\u2019s grid (even though it was Mario Melchiot who did the dirty deed). Spurs lost to Blackburn in the final.</p> <p><strong>They\u2019ve since won a final showdown apiece. </strong>Jonathan Woodgate was the extra-time hero for Tottenham in 2008; John Terry and Diego Costa doing the damage for Chelsea in 2015.</p> <p><strong>So what does this tell us? </strong>That on balance, Chelsea have the upper hand over Spurs in this tournament. And that the winners of this two-legged semi will, if history is any guide, go on to lose the final to either Manchester City or Burton Albion. But history isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all, and records are there to be broken. So who will gain the upper hand tonight as Mauricio Pochettino and Maurizio Sarri go on the hunt for the first trophy of their managerial careers? We\u2019ll find out soon enough, because tonight, at Wembley, it\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>8pm GMT.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b136efeb3f59e49c29e3e787d3be3d4fd4c0fcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b136efeb3f59e49c29e3e787d3be3d4fd4c0fcc/0_0_3500_2315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the pitch before the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of the pitch before the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-08T19:01:14.571Z\">at 7.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s your lot. Spurs take a one-goal lead to Stamford Bridge in a fortnight, with both managers fuming about VAR. It promises to be an exciting second leg. Until then, thanks for reading, and goodnight! And now a word with a seething Maurizio Sarri. \u201cI saw a few minutes ago the video, and it was offside. But it\u2019s not important. The linesman stopped his run, he didn\u2019t follow the ball, and had a big influence on our defenders. So at the moment I don\u2019t think the English referees are able to use the system. If you are not sure with the system you have to follow the ball, but he stopped, and so for our defenders he was offside. I don\u2019t know about the keeper, but I know about our defenders. They have to study the system. It is very strange that there is no system in the Premier League but in the Carabao Cup there is. It is very strange for us, the players, and I think also the referees. We played very well, I am really very happy with my players.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino speaks in a full and frank manner about VAR. \u201cI don\u2019t like VAR. Today we got the benefit, but watching the World Cup or another league like La Liga, no-one is happy from day one that they started to use it. To get the benefit is nice, of course, but I am not happy to win games like this. I am pro-technology because you cannot stop evolution. But waiting how we wait ... the rules are not clear. I am watching every week in La Liga and no-one is happy, whether they are fighting for the title or against relegation. It should be a good example for us, because we still have six months to prove the system, and there is still a lot of work to do.\u201d David Hytner was our man at Wembley. Here\u2019s his report. Harry Kane talks to Sky Sports! \u201cI made the run, played to the whistle, nicked it round the keeper. It was a clear penalty, just a matter of whether it was offside or not. Obviously I wasn\u2019t sure, I was just running through on goal, but VAR is there for a reason. I\u2019m sure they got it right. VAR is part of the game, a big part of football going forward. Chelsea had a point to prove, we knew it was going to be tough. It\u2019s a win, it\u2019s what we came here to do. Now we can go for it.\u201d Danny Rose, who has won the man-of-the-match award, adds: \u201cIt was hard work, and it\u2019ll be even harder when we play them in the return leg. But it was a great team performance and I think we deserved it in the end. We tried to get the second, but it was one of those games, Chelsea played really well. There\u2019s going to be pressure on them to come at us in the second leg, but we\u2019re one of the best counter-attacking teams in the league. We\u2019re not going to try to protect, we\u2019re going to try to win it.\u201d Meanwhile some dispiriting news from Wembley ... That second leg will be played at Stamford Bridge on Thursday 24 January. The final comes along a month later, on Sunday 24 February. Spurs are in the box seat, but Chelsea will take heart from their performance tonight - they hit the woodwork twice, and had the better of the possession, territory and chances created. They\u2019ll fancy their chances of turning this one around. Put another way: this semi-final is beautifully poised. Gotta love the League Cup! Don\u2019t you dare listen to the miserable buggers who keep talking a good competition down. And that\u2019s it! Spurs hang on for victory, and they\u2019ll take a one-goal lead to Stamford Bridge in a fortnight\u2019s time! Chelsea were probably the better team on balance, but that man Harry Kane was the difference. There\u2019s a bit of a face-off between Rose and Rudiger after the final whistle, but everyone calms down soon enough. 90 min +3: Hazard dribbles down the left and earns a corner off Kane. It\u2019s all hands to the pump for Spurs. Hazard takes the corner himself, and again it\u2019s not up to much. Spurs whack clear. 90 min +2: Kovacic bursts down the left, then slips the ball inside for Hazard, who shuttles it further to Kante. This is a glorious flowing move, but just as it looks like Chelsea are about to do something both pretty and pretty dramatic, Rose crunches into Kante with great power. What a saving tackle! 90 min +1: Spurs make their final change in the game-management style. Eriksen is replaced by Llorente. 90 min: Winks is replaced by Skipp. Hazard, down the left, pulls a ball back for Pedro. But Pedro\u2019s swarmed by white shirts before he can get a shot away. There will be three added minutes. 88 min: Chelsea continue to press forward. But suddenly Spurs break, and Kane has the ball out on the left. He curls a low pass into the centre for Lamela, who seems to have got the better of Alonso. He\u2019d be free, but the ball clanks between his legs. Eventually he\u2019s forced to drag Alonso, who has recovered, to the ground. Spurs so close to a priceless two-goal first-leg advantage! 86 min: Hazard stands stock still, just to the right of the Spurs box. He suddenly bursts past Alli and Rose to reach the byline and stands one up in the middle. Gazzaniga fumbles. Sanchez hacks out with Giroud lurking. The ball breaks left for Alonso, whose shot is deflected into the air harmlessly. 84 min: Pedro dinks one in from the right. Sanchez eyebrows it away, but only to Alonso on the left. Alonso looks to flash a cross to Giroud at the near post, but gets too much on it; the ball misses the striker and Gazzaniga claims. 83 min: Hazard\u2019s free kick is easily dealt with by Sanchez. His set-piece delivery hasn\u2019t been all that tonight. 82 min: Hazard looks to turn down the inside-right channel and is unceremoniously clattered to the floor by Lamela. The substitute, only just on, is booked. 80 min: Both teams make a change. Son is replaced by Lamela, while the very promising Hudson-Odoi makes way for Giroud, who as an erstwhile employee of Arsenal gets the reception you\u2019d expect. 78 min: Chelsea have enjoyed 65% of the ball in this second half. The majority of the play\u2019s been in the Spurs half, too. The visitors must wonder how they\u2019re not on terms. Hudson-Odoi barrels down the left, Alonso tries to turn the resulting cross in at the near post, but it\u2019s blocked out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 76 min: Barkley is replaced by Kovacic. 74 min: Hazard cuts in from the right and flicks a pass down the channel for Kante. The ball slaps Alderweireld\u2019s arm. You\u2019ve seen those given - he\u2019s close, but not super-close - but the referee isn\u2019t interested. Neither is the VAR dude. In fairness to Alderweireld, upon second view, he might have been trying to take his arm away. 72 min: It\u2019s been a fast-paced match pretty much from the get-go. Hazard makes good ground down the right but is stopped by Alli; Kane flicks a pass down the left which Son busts a gut in trying to reach. Nothing\u2019s quite coming off at the moment, for either team, but you can\u2019t mark anyone down for effort. It\u2019s made for a great spectacle. 70 min: Good work by Azpilicueta down the right earns Chelsea a corner. But Hazard\u2019s delivery is uncharacteristically dismal, failing to beat the first man. 68 min: Wembley is bubbling away. This has been a highly entertaining semi so far, and the crowd are doing their bit. It\u2019s a great atmosphere. And people say the League Cup doesn\u2019t count for anything. Don\u2019t listen to them, kids. 66 min: Sissoko powers down the right. Kane takes over and hooks the ball further down the wing. Son nearly breaks into the box. He can\u2019t get a shot away. But Sissoko has kept going, and nearly gets the ball under control on the penalty spot. Nearly, but not quite. A hectic, seat-of-pants attack finally comes to an end. But Chelsea were nearly opened up for the first time in a while. That break for Kane\u2019s treatment has done Spurs some good. 65 min: The Spurs physio gives Kane the thumbs up, despite the star striker mumbling something about his calf. Kane\u2019s back in the action soon enough. 64 min: Kane is down looking pained. As he gets treatment, it\u2019s a chance for Spurs to regroup. They\u2019ve been second best since the restart. 63 min: Willian is replaced by Pedro, who scored here for Barcelona in the 2011 Champions League final, the opening goal of their 3-1 victory over Manchester United. 62 min: Hazard dribbles down the right, enters the Spurs box, and takes a shot. It\u2019s high and wide, but the ref decides it\u2019s come off Alderweireld for a corner. Replays aren\u2019t conclusive, so it\u2019s probably for the best that the set piece comes to nought. 61 min: Chelsea are pressing Spurs back. The home side can\u2019t get out of their final third. Hudson-Odoi, Willian, Kante and Hazard are seeing an awful lot of the ball down the right, but can\u2019t prise the hosts open. There\u2019s a sense that it might only be a matter of time, though. 59 min: Sanchez comes straight through the back of Hazard in the centre circle and goes into the referee\u2019s notebook. 58 min: Hazard jinks down the right and crosses. It loops off Rose and over the crossbar. For a second, Gazzaniga was worried about the freak looper there. It\u2019s a corner from the right. Hazard whips it to the near post, where Barkley flicks to the far post. Christensen is haring in, unchallenged. But he clanks his volley wide left from close range. What a chance that was! 57 min: Azpilicueta has three goes at delivering a cross into the Spurs box from the right. The third attempt hits the arm of Rose, and the Chelsea man wants a penalty. But the ref\u2019s not interested; there wasn\u2019t much space between the two players, and no reaction time. 55 min: Good work by Hudson-Odoi down the right. His deep cross is chested down by Trippier and gathered by Gazzaniga. Chelsea are beginning to dominate this. 54 min: Another fine save by Gazzaniga, who denies Kante\u2019s dipper, turning the ball away from his right-hand post. Chelsea will soon start wondering what they have to do to score. 53 min: Hazard skedaddles in from the left , waltzes past Eriksen, and sends a dipping screamer straight down Gazzaniga\u2019s gullet. There have been precious few signs that this game will end with just the one goal scored. 52 min: Alli and Sissoko exchange passes as the ball\u2019s shuttled in from the Spurs right. Kane is teed up, 30 yards out, and pearls one towards the bottom left. Kepa does extremely well to save. The resulting corner isn\u2019t up to much. 51 min: ... nowt. Gazzaniga plucks the corner from the sky. No sweat. 50 min: Kante drives forward, and slips the ball right for Hudson-Odoi, who offloads to Hazard. Chelsea\u2019s star man drops a shoulder and very nearly makes room for a shot from the edge of the box. But he\u2019s crowded out so meanders right, then chips left towards Alonso at the far post. Sanchez rises to concede a corner. From which ... 48 min: Sanchez impedes Hazard as he dribbles down the middle of the park. Willian takes the free kick, wedging the ball down the inside-right channel. Hudson-Odoi very nearly brings it down in acres of space - the rest of the box was loaded on the left - but just misses it. Gazzaniga gathers, and the flag had gone up for offside anyway. 47 min: ... the ball\u2019s worked to Eriksen, 20 yards out. He has a shot which Kepa gathers, but not in a wholly convincing style. For a second, it looked like he was in the process of fumbling it, but recovered his composure in time. 46 min: Kane slips a reverse pass down the inside-right channel for Alli, who is stopped from shooting by the outstretched leg of Rudiger. Alli went over in the area, but it was a perfectly timed tackle. Corner, from which ... And we\u2019re off again! Chelsea get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. Meanwhile here\u2019s Ed Wall. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m unclear about with the VAR decision on the offside - if the assistant referee has raised his flag during the buildup, doesn\u2019t that completely affect how the players (especially on the defensive side) react? Shouldn\u2019t he be keeping his flag down if the decision is marginal and leaving the decision to the VAR team? It strikes me that Kepa was completely baffled for a split second as to what to do, and this might have been poor keeping, or because he was unsure if Kane was really offside.\u201d It\u2019s almost as though VAR is just replacing one set of problems with another. But most people seem happy enough with it, so here we are. Half-time reading. And that\u2019s that for the first half. Chelsea shaded it in terms of possession, and have hit the post twice. But it\u2019s Spurs who have the lead thanks to the power running of Harry Kane. The second half is poised perfectly. Don\u2019t you go anywhere! 45 min +2: So nearly a sensational equaliser! Hudson-Odoi Crosses from the right. The ball deflects off Rose and looks like looping over Gazzaniga and into the top left! But the keeper fingertips the ball onto the left-hand post. As the ball bounces across the face of goal, Alderweireld slams the ball clear. Spurs escape! 45 min: Hudson-Odoi hasn\u2019t stopped running all half. Here he doesn\u2019t stop running into Rose, and earns a brief lecture from the referee. 43 min: Alonso, deep on the left, curls into the box for Hazard, who can\u2019t control. But the ball nearly drops to Hudson-Odoi, who momentarily considers van Bastening a volley goalwards from a position out right. But the ball deflects through to Gazzaniga. 41 min: Chelsea are beginning to regain their early rhythm. Hudson-Odoi drifts in from the right, opens up his body, and looks to whip a curler into the top left. He overcooks it, but not by so much. It was Chelsea\u2019s eighth attempt on goal so far; Spurs have just had the two. But look at the scoreline. 40 min: A little space for Alonso, set clear down the left by Willian. Alonso curls the ball to the near post, where Kante nips in ahead of Alderweireld and Trippier, and clips a first-time effort off the bottom of the left-hand post! Goal kick. 38 min: Plenty of pantomime booing after a few firm challenges by both sides. Spurs take the sting out of proceedings again with some calm passing around the back. Both sets of fans are enjoying this battle, though. 36 min: Hudson-Odoi and Hazard take turns to dribble down the right. The ball\u2019s switched to Willian out on the left, but his low cross is easily dealt with by Alderweireld. 34 min: Kante has a dig from 25 yards. It\u2019s deflected, but only straight down the throat of Gazzaniga. 33 min: Kante and Hudson-Odoi confuse each other in playing out from the back. Rose steps in and should release Kane down the left, but his pass is poor and Chelsea get away with the mistake. 31 min: Harry Kane has now overtaken Cliff Jones into fourth spot on the all-time Spurs scorers list, with 160 goals. Only Martin Chivers (174), Bobby Smith (208) and Jimmy Greaves (266) ahead of him now. Meanwhile Chelsea have a free kick out on the right. Hazard whips it diagonally to Alonso, who runs it straight out of play for a goal kick. That goal has robbed Chelsea of a little of their early confidence. 29 min: Well that\u2019s got Wembley bouncing. As has a booking for home hero Winks, who cuts across the front of Hazard, a clumsy challenge. Kane shapes to shoot into the bottom right, but twists and slots the ball into the bottom left. Kepa read it correctly, but Kane gave the kick a good belt and it settles into the net. First blood in the semi to Spurs, slightly against the run of play! 26 min: Penalty to Spurs! Kane timed his run from deep to perfection - though there was very little in it - and then it\u2019s just down to whether it\u2019s a foul in the box or not. Kane played the ball forward with too much pace - it was flying out for a goal kick - but he was definitely taken out by Kepa, who is booked. 24 min: But this gets the Spurs fans screaming again. Kane romps off down the inside-left channel after Alderweireld\u2019s long ball. He makes to round Kepa on the outside, and goes over the keeper\u2019s wild lunge. This is going to VAR, because Kane might have been offside. 22 min: Spurs are struggling to get anything going in attack. Chelsea look very comfortable right now, and the home crowd are getting a little worried, if not yet totally agitated. 20 min: Hazard drops a shoulder, 25 yards out, down the inside-right channel. He sends a whipping, dipping, swerving shot goalwards. Gazzaniga does very well to claim a tricky ball without embarrassment. 19 min: After such a fast start, some sort of lull was inevitable at some point. And here it is. 17 min: Barkley has a dig from 30 yards. It flies 30 yards high and 30 yards wide. 16 min: Spurs enjoy a little period of possession without going anywhere in particular. Only 13% of the play so far has been in the Chelsea final third. 14 min: Spurs take a little of the early sting from the game by passing it around the back awhile in the 1980s style. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m as neutral-ish as one can be on a football match, but as that\u2019s no fun I\u2019m cheering for Spurs out of a certain sense of justice,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cIt would be a crying shame if a squad that has played so well and entertained so mightily for four seasons has the window close and curtains drawn on their era without at least one mad night of \u2018We\u2019re Number One!\u2019\u201d 12 min: Chelsea are beginning to get the upper hand. Jorginho latches onto a loose ball in midfield and should set Hudson-Odoi free down the right, but his pass forward is uncharacteristically clumpish, and flies out of play for a goal kick. Hudson-Odoi, who has looked very lively in these opening exchanges, looks irritated at the lost opportunity. 10 min: Willian\u2019s work down the left, and Hazard\u2019s presence in the box, forces Sanchez into conceding a corner. Willian flashes the set piece to the near post, where Barkley attempts an elaborate backflick from a tight angle. The ball nestles on the top of the net. 9 min: The atmosphere at Wembley is magnificent. The fans are being rewarded with a basketball-style end-to-end rhythm. It\u2019s marvellously open with both sides on the front foot. 7 min: Willian strips Trippier of possession and sprays a glorious left-to-right pass towards Hudson-Odoi, who sashays in from the wing and belts low and hard towards the bottom right. Gazzaniga handles it well. 5 min: Yes, a bright, open, end-to-end start. Barkley sends a shot into the side netting to the left of the Spurs goal. Then Kane sends a spectacular overhead kick straight at Kepa. This is great. 3 min: Well this is a bright start by both sides, and here\u2019s the first major talking point, as Alli rakes a long pass down the inside-right channel for Son to chase. For a second, it looks as though Son\u2019s going to burst clear into the Chelsea area, but he\u2019s stopped in his tracks by Christensen. Son, sailing across the turf on the old nips, wants either a penalty kick or a free kick, and whatever punishment for the defender. But it was shoulder to shoulder, with minimal tugging, and neither the ref nor the VAR operators are interested. 2 min: Hudson-Odoi sails in from the Chelsea right and one-twos with Hazard. He very nearly breaks into the Spurs area, but lets the ball run away from him, allowing the hosts to clear. Here we go, then! Spurs get the first leg of this League Cup semi-final underway! And they\u2019re immediately on the attack, Rose turning on the jets down the left. But he can\u2019t quite squeak through a gap, and ends up fouling Azpilicueta. Both sets of fans giving it plenty. The teams are out! Spurs are in their famous lilywhite, while Chelsea sport their storied royal blue. A fine atmosphere at Wembley, as befits a London derby, never mind a major semi-final. Spurs will be hoping for the sort of fast start that blew Chelsea away in the Premier League in November. Chelsea will be looking for a result that\u2019ll set them up nicely for the second leg, to be played at Stamford Bridge on Thursday 24th. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Mauricio Pochettino talks! \u201cIt is a semi-final and we are trying to win. We are in a good condition to give different players an opportunity, but our challenge is to be good and fight for this competition. Of course it will be tough because Chelsea are a very good team. I expect it to be a very good game.\u201d Maurizio Sarri speaks! \u201cIn the last match here against Tottenham, we lost without playing. Theirs was a different approach, they were more aggressive. We didn\u2019t play. Alvaro Morata has a problem with his hamstring and we prefer him to rest. Hudson-Odoi is on the pitch because in the last match he did very well. I prefer to start with the young players.\u201d A quick look inside the dressing rooms before the big game. Tottenham have long made themselves at home at Wembley, each player with their own personal cubby-hole. The lighting quite brash and businesslike, you\u2019ll notice. The away team are presented with an altogether different vibe. A stark contrast to the home dressing room, this one is lit like a treatment room at a luxury spa. You can almost hear the relaxing sounds of the pan-pipes. Chelsea will do well not to fall asleep in their plush robes and slippers. I hope they don\u2019t miss kick-off. Unsurprisingly, given the strange state of cup football in this country these days, both teams make many, many, many changes. Spurs won 7-0 at Tranmere Rovers on Friday night, and there are seven changes to the team named at Prenton Park. Out go Kyle Walker-Peters, Juan Foyth, Serge Aurier, Ben Davies, Lucas Moura, Oliver Skipp and Fernando Llorente; in come Kieran Trippier, Toby Alderweireld, Danny Rose, Harry Winks, Moussa Sissoko, Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane. Chelsea make eight changes to the side sent out to beat Nottingham Forest 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Out go Willy Caballero, Davide Zappacosta, David Luiz, Emerson, Ethan Ampadu, Alvaro Morata, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and the departing Cesc Fabregas; in come Kepa, Cesar Azpilicueta, Antonio Rudiger, Marcos Alonso, Jorginho, N\u2019Golo Kante, Willian and Eden Hazard. Stronger sides than the ones fielded in the FA Cup third round against lower-league opposition, then. Which is about right, given everyone\u2019s three matches away from silvery glory. Tottenham recall their big names - Kane, Eriksen, Alderweireld, Sissoko - while Willian returns for Chelsea after a hamstring injury. Callum Hudson-Odoi starts despite the rumours surrounding a move to Bayern Munich, but Alvaro Morata is injured and doesn\u2019t make the squad. Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Trippier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Rose, Winks, Sissoko, Eriksen, Alli, Kane, Son. Subs: Lamela, Walker-Peters, Llorente, Davies, Skipp, Lloris, Foyth. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Rudiger, Christensen, Alonso, Kante, Jorginho, Barkley, Willian, Hazard, Hudson-Odoi. Subs: Pedro, Caballero, Giroud, Zappacosta, Ampadu, Luiz, Kovacic. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea have a long tradition of meeting at the business end of the League Cup. They first clashed in the 1972 semis, a last-gasp John Hollins penalty giving Chelsea a 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge in the first leg, the deal sealed in a 2-2 draw at White Hart Lane thanks to some late confusion between Cyril Knowles and Pat Jennings on the Spurs goalline. Chelsea lost to Stoke in the final. In the 1991 quarters of the Rumbelows Cup, Chelsea thrashed a dismal Tottenham side 0-0 at Stamford Bridge, then did what they should have done in the replay at White Hart Lane. A 3-0 rout, with Andy Townsend, Kerry Dixon and Dennis Wise in the goals. Chelsea lost to Sheffield Wednesday in the semis. The 2002 Worthington Cup semis saw Chelsea win the first leg at Stamford Bridge 2-1 thanks to a pair of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink goals, but were steamrollered 5-1 in the White Hart Lane return. Steffen Iversen, Tim Sherwood, Teddy Sheringham, Simon Davies and Sergei Rebrov did the business for Spurs, while Hasselbaink was sent off for pushing his hand in Sheringham\u2019s grid (even though it was Mario Melchiot who did the dirty deed). Spurs lost to Blackburn in the final. They\u2019ve since won a final showdown apiece. Jonathan Woodgate was the extra-time hero for Tottenham in 2008; John Terry and Diego Costa doing the damage for Chelsea in 2015. So what does this tell us? That on balance, Chelsea have the upper hand over Spurs in this tournament. And that the winners of this two-legged semi will, if history is any guide, go on to lose the final to either Manchester City or Burton Albion. But history isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all, and records are there to be broken. So who will gain the upper hand tonight as Mauricio Pochettino and Maurizio Sarri go on the hunt for the first trophy of their managerial careers? We\u2019ll find out soon enough, because tonight, at Wembley, it\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm GMT.",

The club\u2019s Belgian captain, who joined from Hamburg in 2008, has a deal that expires in the summer, by which time he will be 33. He is due to have a testimonial in the close season and is keen to sign on again. \u201cWe are talking about that \u2013 I would like it,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe\u2019s our captain, 11 years here, we saw in the last two [league] games the huge quality and personality he has to play. The only problem with Vincent is one: his injury problems.\u201d The matches Guardiola was referring to were the wins over Southampton and Liverpool, for which Kompany was recalled. Asked whether his defence is stronger when Kompany plays the manager said: \u201cOne against one absolutely we\u2019re better when Vincent plays.

      "bodyText": "Mauricio Pochettino wants to scream when he is told that he must win a trophy to validate his work at Tottenham. The manager wants supporters to see the bigger picture; how he has the club punching above their weight when it comes to things like balance sheets. Pochettino wants to win the Carabao Cup purely for the thrill of winning and his team put their noses in front at the halfway stage of the semi-final before the Stamford Bridge second leg, which has been scheduled for Thursday 24 January. It was far from the most free-flowing performance of a season that promises so much for them and Pochettino was left to enjoy the grit they showed to keep Chelsea out. The visitors were the team that pushed and they created the chances to have taken reward. But Maurizio Sarri \u2013 who is also without a trophy from his managerial career \u2013 could lament Chelsea\u2019s lack of cutting edge. Sarri gave a start on the right wing to Callum Hudson-Odoi, the 18-year-old who is the subject of a \u00a335m offer from Bayern Munich, and he had some nice moments, including a deflected cross in first-half stoppage time that Paulo Gazzaniga clawed against the post and to safety. \u00c1lvaro Morata had been ruled out with a slight hamstring injury and Sarri preferred Eden Hazard to the fit-again Olivier Giroud in the central attacking role. Hazard was dangerous, as always, but he could not find a way to goal. Sarri sent on Pedro for Willian and Giroud for Hudson-Odoi but, whichever way he sliced it, Chelsea were blunt where it mattered the most. There was bad finishing, particularly from the centre-half Andreas Christensen when gloriously placed on a set piece on 58 minutes, but also bad luck. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 was denied in the 40th minute by the same post that would thwart Hudson-Odoi. It was Harry Kane, inevitably, who made the difference and when he banged home from the penalty spot midway through the first half it was his 160th goal in Spurs colours, lifting him above Cliff Jones into fourth place on the all-time list. A reminder: Kane is only 25. The execution was nerveless and clinical. Kane had won the kick when he fastened on to Toby Alderweireld\u2019s long ball and touched decisively past the outrushing Kepa Arrizabalaga before being clattered by him. It was a clear foul.

      "bodyText": "The names, faces and \u201cgeneral\u201d location of child sex offenders could be publicly available online under a proposal from Peter Dutton to establish a national child-sex offender register. However the nation\u2019s law council has warned any public sex offender register is not \u201ca silver bullet\u201d, while researchers for the Australian criminal intelligence body most likely to administer any register have previously questioned the effectiveness of such a proposal. The states and territories, as well as non-government stakeholders, including the Law Council and advocacy groups such as the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, have been asked their views on the register, which would be the first of its kind in Australia. In a statement released early on Wednesday morning, Dutton said consultation was underway, with the register potentially including identifying details of convicted abusers, including the type of crime, birthdate and postcode. Juvenile offenders would not be included on the register. \u201cIt would have a strong deterrent effect on offenders and ensure that parents are not in the dark about whether a registered sex offender has access to their children,\u201d Dutton said. Speaking to Sydney radio 2GB, Dutton said the proposal was a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t identify the individual addresses, so I think we avoid the problem of vigilante groups or people forming outside particular residences that might be occupied by a register sex offender, but we do propose to give the person\u2019s locality by postcode,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026Families would have a better idea of who is living within their postcode, to either have an awareness in discussions with their children, make sure that they knew about somebody who had unsupervised contact of their children in a sporting sense, or in another group activity within the community.\u201d While the Daniel Morcombe Foundation welcomed the idea, child safety advocate Hetty Johnson slammed the proposed register as \u201ca political ploy\u201d. \u201cElections are going to be run on fear or hope,\u201d she said, after listening to a press conference held by Dutton on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThis is going to be run on fear. It is winning votes on the backs of children\u2019s very lives and I get upset about that. That annoys me and I know this is a political thing and they all do it. But I think Mr Dutton is better than that and I am disappointed.\u201d Dutton was questioned at the press conference on the timing of the announcement, given the Coalition has been in power since 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for some time \u2026 we\u2019ve been looking at ways in which it has been operating overseas and we have been looking at ways in which we can collaborate with the states,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an extreme measure, it is not too soft, it is not too hard.\u201d The Law Council of Australia has not objected to the idea, but believes it should only apply to \u201coffenders who pose a demonstrated risk to children\u201d, while stressing inclusion on any public register \u201cshould never be automatic\u201d. Responding to Dutton\u2019s proposal, council president Arthur Moses said the register would have to be \u201cstringently monitored to avoid unintentional errors\u201d and only apply to the highest levels of offending, and done through the discretion of the courts. \u201cInclusion brings onerous reporting obligations like ongoing police monitoring of and involvement in a person\u2019s activities, the risk of adverse community attention and vigilantism,\u201d Moses said. \u201cTherefore only offenders posing a demonstrated risk should be required to register. \u201c\u2026Child sex offences are amongst the most abhorrent that come before our courts and, as the recent royal commission illustrated, for too long offenders were placed in a position where they could re-offend,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why we need to get it right. We must be careful to ensure laws are not enacted that create negative unintended consequences that impact the wider community.\u201d The Northern Territory government announced similar plans in 2014, but was ultimately unable to bring it to fruition. At the time, then-prime minister Tony Abbott said he was \u201cdisinclined\u201d for a national register. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a national murderers register, we don\u2019t have a national thieves register, we don\u2019t have a national white collar criminals register,\u201d Abbott said in October 2014. \u201cI think the most important thing is to do what we can to have strong and effective law enforcement agencies, to have strong and effective laws, and I think if we\u2019ve got strong and effective police forces, strong and effective criminal intelligence, if we\u2019ve got judges and prosecuting services that are taking swift action when criminals or potential criminals are arrested, I think that is the best way forward.\u201d In 2015, the NT Law Society concluded a register was \u201cnot right\u201d for the territory, citing a lack of evidence. \u201cThere is no evidence that public registers of this nature are successful in increasing community safety or reducing the rates of offending or re-offending,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. It also said \u201cvictims of crime may well feel shamed by the publication, especially if the offender is a family member.\u201d Last year the Australian Institute of Criminology, which has since merged with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and would be the government body most likely tasked with administrating any public register, released a report which found no evidence public registers resulted in reduced recidivism. It also raised the issue of teenagers caught \u2018sexting\u2019, which can be prosecuted as a child sex crime, finding their way onto any register, given the broad sweep of Australia\u2019s laws. \u201cOne of the key lessons learned from the US experience is that policies introduced rapidly in response to single, widely publicised incidences are generally not successful in achieving their aims,\u201d the AIC report concluded. \u201cPolicy responses to sexual offending need to be carefully considered and must be based on strong, theoretical foundations, supported by evidence.\u201d A spokesman for opposition leader Bill Shorten said Labor would wait to see what the states and territories had to say, as well as look at the proposal which was being put forward, once it included more detail. Legislation passed by each individual state and territory established the Australian Child Protection Offender Reporting scheme in the early 2000s, giving police access to registered sex offenders and their movements, once any jail sentence has been completed. Last year, following a campaign by Derryn Hinch, the register\u2019s powers were extended to allow authorities to cancel the passport of registered sex offenders, who were suspected of traveling overseas for child sex.",

Two hundred avocets, feeding at low tide, on the far side of the River Parrett. And a quintet of jack snipe \u2013 tiny, short-billed versions of their commoner relative \u2013 rising up from under my feet as I squish across the waterlogged marsh. Best of all, a young peregrine, which having taken half-hearted aim at a redshank, circles around me in the morning sunshine, before flying away over the river, in search of easier prey. I end my walk with 55 species \u2013 equalling last year\u2019s record. But this is not about numbers, but the way in which the birds I\u2019ve encountered in my corner of Somerset grace me with their sheer life-force on this, the opening day of the year.",

It should be technical, without any significant marks on the labour market. In fact, there are still plenty of reasons to remain optimistic, even for German industry: despite the recent deflation of new orders, order books are still richly filled and companies still report assured production close to record highs and while capacity utilisation has dropped to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2017, the lack of equipment still is a more limiting factor to production than the lack of skilled workers.</p> <p>In addition to this, the recent pick-up in orders in the automotive industry and favourable financing conditions in the entire economy also bode well for at least solid industrial and investment activity in 2019.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ING_Economics/status/1082539020687691777\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Industrial production data today has clearly increased the risk of a technical recession in Germany in the second half of 2018, says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carstenbrzeski?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@carstenbrzeski</a><a href=\"https://t.co/7jCP3zC8sx\">https://t.co/7jCP3zC8sx</a></p>&mdash; ING Economics (@ING_Economics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ING_Economics/status/1082539020687691777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c3456bbe4b02fb91ff10329\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-08T07:56:55.150Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Teis Knuthsen </strong>of <strong>Kirk Kapital</strong> is also worried by the sharp slump in German factory output:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TeisKnuthsen/status/1082540106546900992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">German industrial production fell by 1.9% in November, down 4.7% y/y, the worst result since 2009.

      "bodyText": "PS: And finally, the US stock market has closed higher for the third day running. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 256 points, or 1.1%, to finish the day at 23,788. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both also picked up roughly 1%. Wall Street remains hopeful that the US and China will strike a trade deal soon, with president Trump tweeting earlier that talks are going very well. Goodnight! GW Uh oh. The World Bank has just cut its growth forecasts. In a new report, the World Bank has warned that dark clouds are gathering menacingly over the global economy. It now expects global growth to slow to 2.9% this year, down from 3% in 2018, dipping again to 2.8% in 2020. Significantly, it expects that both the US and China will slow over the next couple of years, as Beijing\u2019s structural reforms kick in and Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts fade. Bloomberg has the lowdown on what\u2019s moving on Wall Street today, with the main indices up around 1% in late trading. All major indexes were higher, led by the small-cap Russell 2000 Index for a second day. The S&amp;P 500 Index gained, as transportation companies, telephone stocks and technology hardware makers pushed the benchmark higher. Financials were only major industry group to decline. Boeing Co. helped lift large-caps with a strong fourth-quarter delivery report. PG&amp;E Corp. was the biggest decliner, dropping 10 % amid reports that the California utility giant is considering bankruptcy. Brexit uncertainly is clouding over the UK economy, but today\u2019s data suggests Germany, not Britain, is more likely to slide into recession in the months ahead. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says: News that German industrial production fell by 1.9% in November came as a nasty shock. The stock response to the contraction in the third quarter was that it was due to the tightening up of European vehicle emission standards which led to one-off problems for its carmakers that would quickly be overcome. While the bounce-back has been delayed rather than cancelled, Europe\u2019s biggest economy faces significant headwinds. The growth spurt generated by monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank has run its course. Hopes of a trade war breakthrough are keeping shares higher in New York. The Dow is currently up 0.8%, or 191 points, at 23,723. The broader S&amp;P 500 index of US companies is 0.6% higher, on track for its third daily rise in a row. Investors are speculating that markets could be heading higher, following the heavy losses at the back end of 2018. Some are making comparisons with 2016, when early losses were followed by strong gains. Jeffrey Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments, has pointed out several similarities (via Marketwatch): If you think what was plaguing the market at that time, you had a strong dollar that was choking off not only U.S. earnings but also the global economy. Oil was plunging\u2026You had a Fed that was ending quantitative easing and they were projected to do four rate hikes in 2016. and then lastly you had very weak Chinese economic data.\u201d In other news, Brexit may mean millions of pound of lost revenue for telecoms giant BT. Our Brussels bureau chief Dan Boffey explains: BT is facing a post-Brexit battle to maintain access to a number of multimillion-pound EU contracts and avoid the premature termination of a \u00a324m deal with the European parliament. The BT Group has won a slew of contracts with the EU\u2019s institutions in the last decade worth more than \u00a3150m. But the potential for the EU to scrap \u201csensitive\u201d contracts such as that struck with BT was raised during a recent meeting of EU officials and senior MEPs discussing Brexit preparations, according to leaked minutes obtained by the Guardian. The risk to the EU in honouring contracts and allowing the BT Group to provide telecommunications services, when the UK is no longer an EU member state, was said to require examination. More here: Trade Optimism Trumped Weak European Economic Sentiment today, says Fiona Cincotta of City Index. She explains Global markets bounced higher on Tuesday as optimism grows over a US \u2013 Sino trade deal. A strong Asian session spilled into Europe, although markets pared gains as Wall Street opened owing to increasing tech concerns. US and China extending trade talks for another day has been interpreted as a positive sign by the markets. Whilst no reason was given for the extension, Trump\u2019s tweet that the talks \u201cwere going very well\u201d was sufficient to lift sentiment boosting appetite for riskier assets such as stocks, whilst safe haven gold declined. With US and China working to resolve their issues, the Fed promising to remain flexible and the US economy firing on all cylinders it is easy to see why sentiment is on the up. Obviously, this is not the end of US \u2013 China trade tensions by a long shot, ad there will almost certainly be further bumps and twists along the way but for now the markets are happy with the slow steady progress which it perceives has been achieved. Even the Dax rallied, gaining 0.5% despite this morning\u2019s dismal factory data, she adds. This comes hot on heels of downbeat German factory orders, which dropped by -4.3% in November. These are the latest signs that the eurozone economy is slowing, as trade tensions sap momentum for the powerhouse of Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of top shares has closed 50 points higher at 6861 points, a gain of 0.75% today. Optimism that Beijing and Washington are making progress in their trade negotiations lured investors into buying shares, following the recent sell off. Many traders are still anxious, though, as this chart shows: Top US banker Jamie Dimon has added to the optimism on Wall Street, by suggesting that investors got carried away with recession fears in recent weeks. CNBC has the details: Markets from equities to high-yield bonds that have been flashing warning signs are probably an overreaction to slowing growth rather than a precursor of imminent recession, according to J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. \u201cI think markets are overreacting to short-term sentiment around a whole bunch of complex issues,\u201d Dimon said in a Fox Business interview released Tuesday. He quickly added that the market moves were a \u201crational response\u201d to slower growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever tweets: US stocks are now trading at a three-week high, Bloomberg flags up. Boom! The New York stock market has opened higher, as traders try to claw back recent losses. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by nearly 300 points, or over 1%, at the open. Hopes of a trade war breakthrough are lifting technology stocks. European stock markets are all surging higher, after president Trump tweeted that the trade negotiations with China were going \u201cvery well\u201d. The French CAC is leading the charge, up almost 2%. Hu Xijin, editor of China\u2019s Global Times, tweets: Trump\u2019s trade war optimism is pushing the stock markets up. The FTSE 100 is now up 70 points, or 1%, at 6880, and Wall Street is expected to open higher too. Newsflash: Donald Trump has declared that negotiations with China to resolve the trade impasse are going well. Trump also tweeted that the US economy is looking strong, and promptly taken aother pop at the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates over the last couple of years. JP Morgan has now voiced its alarm over Germany\u2019s economy. J.P.Morgan economist Greg Fuzesi fears that the economy may not have grown in the last quarter, following its small contraction over the summer. Fuzesi told clients: The very bad run is continuing and it is now possible that German gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2018,\u201d \u201cOf course, the German industrial production data are very noisy, but even with a big rebound in December, it is no longer possible to rule out even a small GDP contraction in the fourth quarter of 2018.\u201d In another worrying sign, eurozone economic confidence has dropped to its lowest level since Donald Trump became US president. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator has fallen to 107.3, down from 109.5 in November. That\u2019s a 23-month low, adding to concerns about the eurozone following this morning\u2019s slide in German factory output. Economic morale fell in the five largest euro-area countries, led by Spain (\u22123.0), France (\u22122.0), Germany (\u22121.9) and Italy (\u22121.4) and then the Netherlands (\u22120.3). The EC reports that company managers are more pessimistic about production expectations, the current level of overall order books, and their stocks of finished products. This knocked industry confidence measure down by 2.3 points Consumer confidence has also \u201cdecreased markedly\u201d (also by 2.3 points), the EC adds, as people become gloomier about their unemployment and savings prospects, and the future financial situation. Germany\u2019s once fast-pumping economic engine is misfiring, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO and founder of Sun Global Investments. Kapadia blames the ongoing trade war between the US and China, which has hurt economic demand: Industrial output from Europe\u2019s largest economy has been slowing down each consecutive month, since September 2018, with the drop accounting to 4.7% on an annualised basis. The shortfall in the output underscores the impact on the global economy - wounded and reserved under hostile trade rhetoric. The German economy is expected to be strained in the last quarter of 2018 as the weakness from Industrial output has also matched with a slump in German factory orders, down by 4.3% year-on-year in November. This is in line with global trends, as global risk factors have led to a cautious undertone in the markets. Unless a more welcoming approach is led, especially from the US, the cracks will only widen further globally. The UK economy isn\u2019t looking too hot either. Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon has flagged up that business morale has hit a five-year low, which probably signals a slowdown. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets UK, spies optimism over the US-China trade talks: Traders are hopeful that some sort of progress can be made, and the fact China sent, Liu He - a top tier trade negotiator, the market is viewing this as a sign that Beijing means business. The FTSE 100 is enjoying a broad based rally, as financial, mining, and consumer stocks are all higher this morning. However, the German factory slowdown is weighing on the euro, he adds: EUR/USD is the red after Germany revealed poor industrial output figures. The November report showed a 1.9% decline, while economists were expecting a 0.3% rise, and the October report was revised lower to -0.8%, from -0.5%. This is a poor update from the largest economy in Europe, and it doesn\u2019t bode well for the region. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says today\u2019s German industrial output figures are \u201cterrible\u201d. This morning\u2019s main piece of new economic news was a 1.9% [month-on-month] fall in November industrial production, accompanied by a downward revision to October that leaves Q4 GDP growth looking close to zero. European stock markets are pushing higher this morning, despite the growing fears that Germany could be sliding into recession. All the main indices are in positive territory, although Frankfurt\u2019s DAX (+0.2%) is lagging behind. Shares are getting a currency boost, with both the pound and the euro down around 0.3% against the US dollar. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: A troublesome German industrial production figure, one that suggests the country could be slipping into a technical recession, was the most overt challenge to sentiment after the bell. However, it only ended up impacting the euro, sending the single currency down 0.4% against the dollar and 0.3% against the pound. Celebrating this euro pull-back instead of lingering on Germany\u2019s economic woes, the DAX added half a percent, once again climbing back towards the 10800 it failed to burst past at the start of the week. The CAC was even more chipper, rising 0.8% to tickle 4750. As for the FTSE, a 0.6% helped push the UK index above 6850. The main driver of this optimism appears to be the ongoing trade talks between the US and China in Beijing. Not that there is anything too substantial to justify such positivity, but rather a lack of mood-dampening comments has green-lit an early European rebound Back to Germany.... and Chris Williamson of data firm Markit also fears weak growth in the final three months of 2018 (following a 0.2% contraction in July-September). Back in the UK, house prices have unexpectedly jumped in December - at least according to the Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices spiked by 2.2% in December, up from a 1.2% drop in November. This lifted the annual rate of house price growth to 1.3% in the three months to December, up from just 0.3% in November. That\u2019s stronger than expected, and completely at odds with rival data from Nationwide. It reported last week that house prices fell by 0.7% between November and December, with annual growth of only 0.5%. Both surveys are based on transactions at Halifax and Nationwide, so are susceptible to volatility. Germany\u2019s economy minister, Peter Altmaier, insists that its economy remains healthy. Speaking to the ARD TV network, Altmaier also took at pop at those who \u2018badmouth\u2019 Germany\u2019s economy, rather than helping it. Reuters has the details: The German economy is in a good shape and order books are full, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Tuesday, adding that he expects the economic upswing to continue. \u201cAs economy minister, my role is not to badmouth the good current economic mood but to contribute so that there are more investments in Germany and new jobs are created,\u201d Altmaier said to German broadcaster ARD. Here\u2019s Bloomberg economist Jamie Murray: ING economist Carsten Brzeski also sees a significant risk that Germany is heading into a recession, following the unexpected slide in industrial output. However, Brzeski also argues that Germany\u2019s economy is fundamentally sound: At face value, today\u2019s industrial production data has clearly increased the risk of a technical recession in Germany in the second half of 2018. Watch out for tomorrow\u2019s trade data. Another disappointment, combined with the high inventory build-up in 2Q and 3Q, would clearly increase the likelihood of a technical recession. On the other hand, private and public consumption still have the potential to offset recession forces. Looking ahead, however, even a technical recession should be nothing to be too worried about. It should be technical, without any significant marks on the labour market. In fact, there are still plenty of reasons to remain optimistic, even for German industry: despite the recent deflation of new orders, order books are still richly filled and companies still report assured production close to record highs and while capacity utilisation has dropped to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2017, the lack of equipment still is a more limiting factor to production than the lack of skilled workers. In addition to this, the recent pick-up in orders in the automotive industry and favourable financing conditions in the entire economy also bode well for at least solid industrial and investment activity in 2019. Teis Knuthsen of Kirk Kapital is also worried by the sharp slump in German factory output: Bloomberg says the decline in German industrial output underlines \u201cthe subdued pace of expansion in Europe\u2019s largest economy during the final quarter of 2018\u201d. It adds: Consumer goods output declined 4.1 percent, while energy was down 3.1 percent. The Economy Ministry said the slump was exacerbated by calendar effects as workers took extra time off around public holidays close to the weekend. Germany\u2019s automakers continued to struggle to adjust to new emissions-test procedures, the ministry said. Several financial analysts fear that November\u2019s 4.7% tumble in German industrial output could signal a technical recession (two quarters of negative growth). Here\u2019s Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Denmark\u2019s Nordea bank. Economist Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet is also concerned: Here\u2019s financial blogger Jeroen Blokland: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is Germany heading into recession? Industrial output across Europe\u2019s largest economy unexpectedly fell in November for the third consecutive month. New data from the Federal Statistics Office show that industrial output at German factories shrank by 1.9% month-on-month in November, dashing hopes of a 0.3% increase. On an annual basis, industrial output slumped by an alarming 4.7% in November. In another blow, October\u2019s decline has been revised down too, from -0.5% month-on-month to -0.8%. We already knew that Germany\u2019s economy slowed last summer, with GDP shrinking by 0.2% in July-September 2018. This morning\u2019s data suggests the fourth quarter of 2018 may also have been weak, as trade tensions and weakness in the global economy hurt demand for German-made goods. It\u2019s the second weak set of German data in as many days. On Monday we learned that German factory orders slumped by 4.3% year-on-year in November.

Britain, which has been forecast to grow at 1.3% this year and 1.4% in 2020 following a successful Brexit deal, would see its meagre GDP expansion evaporate should it leave the European Union without a transition deal. The World Bank has come into focus this week following the resignation of its president, Jim Yong Kim, who quit to join a private investment firm with more than three years of his second term left to run. Kim has become increasingly frustrated with traditional forms of aid and the failure of the bank\u2019s efforts to dramatically cut poverty rates, especially in Africa. At the bank\u2019s annual conference in Bali last year he said he wanted to focus on improving the education of young people in the developing world as the most effective way to boost jobs and incomes, moving away from large-scale infrastructure projects and disaster relief efforts. Georgieva, who has become interim president, and Ohnsorge declined to comment on Kim\u2019s departure, which sources inside the bank described as a sudden and \u201cpersonal decision\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May faces a concerted campaign of parliamentary warfare from a powerful cross-party alliance of MPs determined to use every lever at their disposal to prevent Britain leaving the EU without a deal in March. The former staunch loyalist Sir Oliver Letwin signalled that he and other senior Conservatives would defy party whips, repeatedly if necessary, to avoid a no-deal Brexit, as the government suffered a humiliating defeat during a debate on the finance bill in the Commons. Letwin and 16 other former government ministers were among 20 Conservatives who banded together with the home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, and the Labour leadership to pass an anti no-deal amendment. They defeated the government by 303 votes to 296 \u2013 a majority of seven \u2013 making May the first prime minister in 41 years to lose a vote on a government finance bill. The move came after the PM conceded to senior ministers she was on course to lose next week\u2019s historic Brexit vote, as the first cabinet meeting of the new year exposed deep divisions about the best way out of the deadlock. May told her cabinet she would respond swiftly with a statement to the House of Commons if she failed to win MPs\u2019 backing for her deal next Tuesday. But cabinet sources said it was unclear what course she planned to take \u2013 and the general mood was of how \u201cboxed in\u201d the government was. Several pro-remain ministers, including David Gauke, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark, used the meeting to stress the importance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit, with Rudd saying that would have to mean reaching out across the House of Commons. Rudd told her colleagues: \u201cMore than ever we need to find the centre, reach across the house and find a majority for what will be agreed. Anything will need legislation.\u201d However, opponents of a softer Brexit, including the House of Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, played down the risks of no deal and joined May in strongly rejecting the idea that has gained traction in Westminster in recent days of extending article 50. Leadsom has told friends she would refuse to table the legislation necessary to extend article 50, so that May would have to sack her if she wished to pursue such a policy. But Tuesday\u2019s rebellion by erstwhile Tory loyalists underlined parliament\u2019s determination to take control of the next steps in the Brexit process. Letwin, who gave an emotional speech saying he had almost never rebelled against his party, made clear Tuesday\u2019s vote was the first step in a concerted effort by parliament to bind the government\u2019s hands in the run-up to Brexit day. \u201cThe majority tonight that is expressed in this house will sustain itself,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not allow a no-deal exit to occur at the end of March.\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the vote was an important step to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIt shows that there is no majority in parliament, the cabinet or the country for crashing out of the EU without an agreement\u201d, he said. \u201cThat is why we are taking every opportunity possible in parliament to prevent no deal. \u201cTheresa May must now rule out no deal once and for all.\u201d At cabinet earlier on Tuesday, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, had warned that too many MPs were holding out for the ideal Brexit deal, instead of facing the reality that there was no alternative to May\u2019s approach. One source said he had compared MPs hoping for a better deal to \u201cmid-50s swingers,\u201d wishing Scarlett Johansson would turn up to one of their parties. \u201cOr Pierce Brosnan,\u201d said Rudd. Later in the discussion Gauke, the justice secretary, compared Labour\u2019s Brexit position to Johansson turning up on a unicorn, the Whitehall source said. Clark stressed his determined opposition to a no-deal Brexit publicly on Tuesday, telling MPs, \u201cI\u2019ve always been very clear representing the views of small business and large business that no deal should not be contemplated.\u201d The prime minister was expected to announce fresh reassurances on her deal in the coming days, including a beefed-up role for parliament in framing the next stage of negotiations on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Downing Street has also been expecting the EU27 to offer further written reassurances about the Irish backstop, which has proved the most controversial aspect of the exit deal among Brexiters. However, they appeared likely to fall short of the legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement the Democratic Unionist party has demanded. French EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said on Tuesday, \u201cregarding the Irish backstop no one wants to activate it\u201d, adding, \u201cthese are political assurances but there is nothing more that we can do\u201d. Loiseau also stressed that the deal MPs would vote on next week represented \u201cthe best possible agreement\u201d, and \u201cthe only one\u201d. Tory MPs were whipped to vote against the no-deal amendment on Tuesday evening, despite rumours that the government would concede. Privately, some cabinet Brexiters believe May would rather exit with no deal than tack towards a permanent customs union, or single market membership. But Tuesday\u2019s vote suggested MPs were resolved not to let that happen. Before the vote, the prime minister had addressed a packed room of MPs, mostly from Labour and other opposition parties, who had signed a letter urging her to rule out no deal. Those present said that the prime minister tried to sell her Brexit deal, arguing that no Brexit would have \u201cserious consequences for our democracy\u201d and that the best way to avoid no deal \u201cwas to back a deal\u201d. One Labour MP said after the meeting she was \u201ca lot more concerned about no deal\u201d because she had heard several other MPs warning of the risks of it in their constituencies. Those behind the amendment\u2019s success conceded it may have little material effect on no-deal preparations. Instead, its purpose had been to galvanise MPs across the house and prove there was a parliamentary majority to oppose no deal. The rebels said they could seek to amend any and every piece of legislation the government brings to parliament between now and March. Cooper, speaking in the Commons, said MPs across the house agreed on the dangers of no deal. \u201cI\u2019m worried we could come to the crunch and parliament will not have the powers to stop [no deal] happening,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we have a responsibility not to just stand by.\u201d Letwin, during his speech in the Commons, sounded almost tearful as he said he would rebel against the Tory whip. \u201cI will be voting with [Cooper] against my own government, very much against my own will, and I will continue to do so right up until the end of March in the hope we can put paid to this disastrous proposal.\u201d The government also confirmed on Tuesday that there would be five more days of debate on the Brexit deal, starting on Wednesday, with the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, opening the debate. However, the business motion tabled by the government suggested it would effectively be a resumption of the debate that was unexpectedly paused on 10 December, when May conceded she was likely to lose \u201cby a significant margin\u201d.",

The \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d was revealed to <strong>Sir Vince Cable</strong>, leader of the Liberal Democrats, as he visited Portsmouth International Port to learn of preparations for the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union. </p> <p>As the Press Association reports, the Hampshire port currently handles 500 lorries a day, but this is set to at least double in the case of a no-deal as it is set to relieve some of the burden faced by Dover. Port director<strong> Mike Sellers</strong> said the distance from the freight gates to the motorway network was only 13 lorry lengths, and the introduction of any delays to processing vehicles on to ferries could lead to lorries backing up on to the motorways. He warned this could cause major traffic problems for the city, including the naval base and hospitals. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Portsmouth is seen as one of the high-risk ports that could be impacted from the no-deal and we want to be Brexit-ready even in a no-deal. </p> <p>There is an awful lot of infrastructure that needs to be put in place, and the cost, and whether that will be in place by the end of March is another question, and who is going to pay for it. </p> <p>If the M275 motorway is blocked with lorries, this is the main route into the city, it does impact on people getting in and out of the city, this is a naval port as well, you have the Royal Navy, people getting into work, the hospitals, it would very quickly impact on the whole of the Portsmouth city area.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7a948ae3d77837312d780d21ae55534c78be372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7a948ae3d77837312d780d21ae55534c78be372/0_175_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Vince Cable (centre) at a briefing with Portsmouth International Port director Mike Sellers (left) and the leader of Portsmouth city council Gerald Vernon-Jackson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Vince Cable (centre) at a briefing with Portsmouth International Port director Mike Sellers (left) and the leader of Portsmouth city council Gerald Vernon-Jackson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-08T15:54:43.517Z\">at 3.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c34b924e4b0cebe76182373\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jennifer-rankin\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-08T14:54:36.696Z\">2.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK 'in complete denial' about likely need to extend article 50, EU source claims</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An EU source has rejected reports that British officials are putting out the feelers for an extension of article 50.

But the spokesman would not give further details about the procedure for the debate (in particular, whether MPs will be debating a new motion, or just resuming the debate started in December), saying this would be set out in the business motion (which will be laid tonight).</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman refused to say when the government would update MPs on the fresh assurances about the withdrawal agreement it is seeking.</strong> \u201cIn terms of the assurances that we are seeking from the EU, that work is ongoing,\u201d he said. But he suggested that MPs would get details before the PM winds up on Tuesday, so that they can be discussed during the debate.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman said the government \u201cwill not be extending article 50\u201d. </strong>Recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/07/brexit-latest-commons-vote-boris-johnson-claims-no-deal-is-closest-to-what-people-voted-for-politics-live?page=with:block-5c338fd1e4b0cebe76181b31#block-5c338fd1e4b0cebe76181b31\">some government comments on this have implied that the government is softening its opposition to an extension. </a>But the spokesman said that, during cabinet this morning, May said it was not government policy to extend article 50. During the briefing the spokesman went further, saying: \u201cWe will not be extending article 50.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman insisted that government officials have not been asking the EU about the possibility of extending article 50</strong>. He suggested that today\u2019s Telegraph story saying that they have been \u201cputting out feelers\u201d on this could be based on what EU officials think might happen. (<strong>Adam Fleming</strong>, the BBC\u2019s Brussels reporter, was interesting on this topic on the World at One. He said that, while in London it is assumed that, if there is no deal, the default would be for the UK to leave the EU with no deal, in Brussels it is assumed that the default would be for article 50 to be extended.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman said that the main focus at today\u2019s cabinet was on how the government might win the vote next week.</strong> But he refused to say whether there was an discussion about what might happen if the government loses. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman refused to rule out the UK leaving the EU with no deal. </strong>But he stressed that this is not what May wants.

He went on: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From a policing perspective, policing Brexit is always going to be very challenging.

You will see a visible policing presence (near parliament). We\u2019ve had a policing presence there for a number of months with ongoing protest. </p> <p>We recognise the challenges there at the moment and certainly leading up to the vote next week we will be enhancing the policing presence and we will ensure that we have appropriate measures in place to attempt as far as possible to reassure people that they can go about their lives without fear of harassment or alarm.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c34a4c4e4b0cebe76182270\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-08T13:27:55.532Z\">1.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greg Clark says no-deal Brexit 'should not be contemplated'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greg Clark,</strong> the business secretary, told MPs during business questions earlier that a no-deal Brexit \u201cshould not be contemplated\u201d.

There is of course a right to protest and that is important. However, it\u2019s one thing demonstrating from a distance with placards, or calling out slogans - and another, where the protester invades the personal space of a member, subjects him or her to a tirade of menacing, racist, sexist and misogynistic abuse, and follows them back to their place of work. </p> <p>I politely suggest that the present situation is not only intolerable but untenable. Matters cannot stand as they do today. A change in policy is required.

Davis got the main 8.10 slot on the programme, outranking the current Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, who was on a bit earlier. </p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Davis claimed that the EU would be willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The claim that the deal on the table is the only deal available] will not prove to be true.

And then, if we hold fast to our line, then they will actually come back and renegotiate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis also claimed that today\u2019s Telegraph story, saying EU sources are saying British officials have been \u201cputting out feelers\u201d about extending article 50 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/08/brexit-minister-stephen-barclay-rules-out-article-50-extension-beyond-29-march\">(a story played down by the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, but not categorically denied</a>) confirmed his theory.

That\u2019s a false assertion, I\u2019m afraid ... The best guideline on this is the constitutional committee of the House of Lords right back at the beginning of this process who looked at all [arguments] ... they said, \u2018No, this is a matter of negotiation\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis was actually referring to<a href=\"https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/12502.htm\"> a report from the Lords European Union committee (pdf) </a>published in 2017 which concluded: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although there are competing interpretations, we conclude that if agreement is not reached, all EU law\u2014including provisions concerning ongoing financial contributions and machinery for adjudication\u2014will cease to apply, and the UK would be subject to no enforceable obligation to make any financial contribution at all.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Geoffrey Cox</strong>, the Brexiter attorney general, challenged this when asked about it <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-12-03/debates/67B4BC40-0578-417D-9467-F737BDD5079C/WithdrawalAgreementLegalPosition#contribution-A3121A66-7152-457E-BD71-E0E53FDF0CB8\">in the Commons in December. </a>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The view of the government, and my view, is that we would have obligations to pay a certain amount of money were we to leave the European Union without a deal. The House of Lords European Union committee concluded that there would be no obligation under EU law. That is a stronger argument\u2014not necessarily an incontestable one\u2014as to our obligations under EU law, but the committee also concluded that we might have obligations under public international law, and with that I agree. There is an argument that we would not have an obligation under public international law, but it is an argument unlikely to be accepted by any international tribunal.</p> <p>My view is therefore that we would owe a presently unquantifiable sum were we to leave the European Union without a deal. It is impossible at this stage to say how much. It is true that the European Union is not a member state and is not a state, and therefore it is unable to take the case to the international court of justice. It might therefore be difficult to enforce the public international law obligation that existed. However, I ask the House to reflect on the fact that if this country, acknowledging that such obligations probably exist or do exist, did not pay them, it would be likely to cause the deepest resentment, just as it would to any of us who were unpaid a debt. If we leave a club, we pay the bar bill. If we do not pay the bill, we are not likely to get a lot of consideration from the other side. <br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1293ef9489eed6ab460fcac6ffd25f6a77adcbd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1293ef9489eed6ab460fcac6ffd25f6a77adcbd4/0_75_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Davis, the former Brexit secretary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Davis, the former Brexit secretary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c347e2de4b02fb91ff10438\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-08T10:44:34.047Z\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Today the government is launching a radio advertising campaign intended to give people information they might need in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

My colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot </strong>has previewed it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/labour-backs-cross-party-amendment-to-block-no-deal-brexit\">here.</a> I say \u201cmay\u201d because a) there is no 100% guarantee yet that the amendment will get \u201ccalled\u201d (ie, selected for debate and a vote), although it is very likely that it will; and b) the government could decide to accept it anyway rather than go down to inevitable defeat.</p> <p>At the weekend <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/mps-threaten-trump-style-shutdown-over-brexit-x0tkr3xs7\">the Sunday Times (paywall) </a>rather ingeniously suggested that this amendment was could \u201cderail a no-deal Brexit this week by starving the government of cash and creating a Donald Trump-style shutdown\u201d. In truth, it is nowhere near as significant as that (although a second amendment, tabled by the Lib Dems, would be much more likely to hamstring the government in the event of a no-deal Brexit, although that is much less likely to get called\u201d). The Daily Mail quotes a Treasury source saying the government is \u201cpretty relaxed\u201d about the amendment because it would only \u201cstop us doing some little things to make the tax system work better\u201d, suggesting that around lunchtime we could well get an announcement saying the government will accept the amendment.</p> <p>But that would still be awkward for the government because the amendment, tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Nicky Morgan, effectively provides a template for stopping the government exercising all manner of powers in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (It says certain no-deal related powers in clause 89 of the finance bill could only be exercised if there is either a) a deal; b) an extension to article 50; or c) a Commons vote authorising a no-deal Brexit. It is easy to imagine more amendments being tabled attaching these three conditions to a huge range of government bills.)</p> <p>And <strong>Liam Fox</strong>, the international trade secretary, has said it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d for the government to have its hands tied in this way. Speaking in California, where he is on a trade trip, he said the amendment would not stop a no-deal Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46789565\">As the BBC reports</a>, he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has to ensure that all eventualities are covered.

Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: The prime minister suffered a humiliating defeat as 20 of her own MPs voted against the government over an amendment to the finance bill that will curb some of the government\u2019s tax administration powers in the event of no deal. Their number included six former cabinet ministers and 11 former junior ministers. May\u2019s opponents said the defeat meant a no-deal Brexit was unworkable and that May should explicitly rule it out. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the vote was an \u201cimportant step to prevent a no deal Brexit\u201d. Three Labour MPs rebelled against their own party and sided with the government. You can see a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events here. Thanks for reading this live blog. For those who want more, the Guardian has set out its view on the process of exiting the European Union this evening: The Lib Dems\u2019 Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, has a similar view to Lammy, insisting the prime minister must now rule out a no-deal Brexit: The Conservative government\u2019s defeat this evening shows Parliament\u2019s rejection of a no-deal. This amendment goes some way to taking no deal off the table, but it is crucial it is removed as an option entirely. Theresa May must stop gambling with our future. It is entirely within her power to take no deal off the table, however she is recklessly keeping it there as a scare tactic due to the lack of support for her deal. The only real alternative to get us out of this mess is to legislate for a people\u2019s vote, with the option to remain in the EU. There were some rumours around earlier about an incident on the Parliamentary estate. The Metropolitan police have said the following: At around 7.20pm on Tuesday, 8 January, a man was arrested on suspicion of trespassing on a protected site as he tried to gain entry to the Palace of Westminster via Carriage Gates. He has been taken to a police station. No officers were injured. The incident is not being treated as terror-related. A little more detail on those Tory rebels \u2013 from the Daily Telegraph\u2019s chief political correspondent, Christopher Hope: Labour\u2019s David Lammy, who campaigns for the pro-remain Best for Britain group, says the prime minister\u2019s Commons defeat means she must now rule out a no-deal Brexit. No-deal would be catastrophic for the country and Theresa May\u2019s fourth defeat in four weeks shows a majority in Parliament will do all it can to block it. No-deal is now no option and the prime minister must rule it out. If the government is defeated again next week in the meaningful vote on her deal, the question of EU membership has to be handed back to the people. The government will have failed and the 2016 mandate will have expired. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has put out this statement about the result, from the Labour MP Ian Murray. The threat of a no deal Brexit has cynically used by the government for many months as part of their campaign to bully and intimidate parliament into voting for a bad deal that would leave us worse off and offers less control. Parliament has now asserted its authority and sovereignty and effectively exposed the threat of no deal as an empty one. The real choice facing parliament and the country is now clear. We can leave the EU under the terms of some version of the prime minister\u2019s bad deal or we can keep all our rights, powers, influence and op-outs in our current deal as full members of the EU. Parliament remains gridlocked between these two choices, but, and as today has demonstrated, it can still act decisively. What it now must do is hand the decision back to the people. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is picking up the blog now. My colleague Polly Toynbee wonders whether Theresa May might secretly be relieved by that defeat. And here are the figures showing how MPs voted on amendment 7, party by party. I\u2019ve taken then from the very useful CommonsVotes app. For the amendment Labour: 229 (out of a potential 257 MPs) SNP: 35 (out of 35) Conservatives: 20 (out of 317) Lib Dems: 11 (out of 11) Plaid Cymru: 4 (out of 4) Independents: 3 (out of 7) Greens: 1 (out of 1) Against the amendment Conservatives: 282 (out of a potential 317 MPs) DUP: 10 (out of 10) Labour: 3 (out of 257) Independent: 1 (out of 7) You can find a full voting list here. And here are the three Labour MPs who voted with the government against amendment 7. Ronnie Campbell Kate Hoey Graham Stringer Here is the full list of Conservative MP who voted for amendment 7 - the no-deal amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper. Heidi Allen Guto Bebb Richard Benyon Nick Boles Ken Clarke Jonathan Djanogly Sir Michael Fallon George Freeman Justine Greening Dominic Grieve Sam Gyimah Phillip Lee Sir Oliver Letwin Nicky Morgan Bob Neill Antoinette Sandbach Sir Nicholas Soames Anna Soubry Ed Vaizey Sarah Wollaston These are from the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman. After the vote Jesse Norman, a transport minister, rose on a point of order. Referring to Sir Vince Cable\u2019s comment earlier about the possibility of part of the M3 being closed in the event of a no-deal Brexit (see 6.26pm), Norman said that Cable was wrong and that there were no plans to do this. The Tory MP Marcus Jones also rises to make a point of order. He says his name has been wrongly included on a letter signed by MPs who say they would vote against a no-deal Brexit. The result of the third vote in this group of amendments has been announced. It was on an amendment tabled by the Labour MP Chris Leslie, saying some powers in the finance bill should not be used without there being a vote in the Commons. It was defeated by 303 votes to 292 - a majority of 11. Here is Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam on the significance of the vote. Here is Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper on her victory in the vote. This is from the Press Association\u2019s Alain Tolhurst. Jeremy Corbyn has welcomed the result and, in a statement, urged Theresa May to now rule out a no-deal Brexit. He says: This vote is an important step to prevent a no deal Brexit. It shows that there is no majority in parliament, the cabinet or the country for crashing out of the EU without an agreement. That is why we are taking every opportunity possible in parliament to prevent no deal. Theresa May must now rule out no deal once and for all. Theresa May has lost. The amendment was passed by 303 votes to 296 - a majority of seven. Here is an extract from Sir Oliver Letwin\u2019s speech earlier. (See 6.02pm and 6.08pm.) I have been in awesome detail through the papers produced. I have listened to the briefing for the privy council. I have consulted senior officials across Whitehall. I know that the RAG ratings of green and yellow and red mean. I know that it is actually to have prepared for dealing with the gas interconnectors, the electricity interconnectors, the many other details that are of concern. Now, some of my honourable friends, and some others in the country, believe that they can be sure that under circumstances where they wreck the deal, we refuse to make all payments to the EU that are expected, we falsify their expectations of a reasonable departure, that they will then very reasonably set out to work with us in a calm and grown-up way to ensure a smooth departure. It may be so. I\u2019m in no position to deny that it will be so. I don\u2019t make lurid predictions. Anybody who believes they know it will be so is, I think, deluded. You can watch the full speech here. The government has won the first vote, on the Labour amendment (see 6.29pm), by 314 votes to 292 - a majority of 22. MPs are now voting on the no-deal amendment. MPs are now voting. But the first vote is on new clause 3, a Labour amendment calling for a review of the economic impact of the clause 89 no-deal powers in the bill to be carried out before they can be used. The vote on amendment 7 will probably come next. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says his own \u201cmore brutal\u201d amendment on this, which would have limited the ability of the Treasury to levy income tax in the event of a no-deal Brexit, was not called. But he backs amendment 7, he says. He mentions his visit to Portsmouth this morning. (See 3.34pm.) He says the police told him that a stretch of the M3 between Winchester and Basingstoke would have to be closed in the event of a no-deal Brexit to create space for lorries held up by delays at the port. Ken Clarke, the Tory former chancellor, also intervenes. He asks Jenrick if the Treasury has an assessment of how much it will lose in tax revenues in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Jenrick says the government is planning for all eventualities, but he won\u2019t go into details of the tax impact. Jenrick says, if there is no deal, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March without one. That is what MPs voted for when they backed the article 50 bill. Sarah Wollaston, a Conservative who has backed amendment 7, asks Jenrick if going ahead with a no-deal Brexit will be the government\u2019s policy if it loses the vote next week. Jenrick says he is just explaining the position. All this amendment would achieve would be to make make the government \u201csomewhat less prepared\u201d for a no-deal Brexit if it were passed, he says. Sir Oliver Letwin intervenes. He says Jenrick is right to say a no-deal Brexit would happen by default under the law. But MPs have the power to change the law, he says. Robert Jenrick, a Treasury minister, is winding up for the government now. He says it is neither the government\u2019s \u201cpreference or expectation\u201d that it will leave the EU without a deal. But it has to prepare for all eventualities, he says. He says the finance bill gives the government the power to make minor amendments to tax law in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Nick Boles, another Conservative supporter of amendment 7, is speaking now. He says he will join Letwin in saying he will vote for any amendment, to any legislation, proposed by anyone, to ensure that the UK either leaves the EU on 29 March with a deal or not at all. Oliver Letwin has now finished. As he spoke, at times he seemed almost tearful. Whether that was prompted by the prospect of having to vote against his own government, or just his horror as he contemplated a no deal Brexit, was not clear. But it was a highly effective and memorable speech. Letwin is reputed to be one of the cleverest people in the Commons, he is the ultimate policy wonk, and having looked in detail at the implications of a no-deal Brexit, he appears to be petrified. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister, is speaking now. He is sitting alongside Sir Nicholas Soames. He says between them they have been in the Commons for 56 years. Between them, they have only voted against the government once, he says. But they are both backing the amendment. He says the amendment will not have a significant impact on what the government can do. But it will set a precedent. It will shows how MPs can attach amendments to other pieces of government legislation stopping powers being exercised in a no-deal situation. And he goes further. It is my proposal that we should indeed do that. Oliver Letwin says MPs should attach no-deal amendments like this more government bills. He says for five years as a minister he was in charge of resilience on government. He says two years ago he argued that the government should seriously prepare for a no-deal Brexit. But that was not done, he says. He says he has been through the briefings in \u201cawesome detail\u201d. He has attended the privy council briefings. Letwin says the government ignored his call two years ago for it to prepare properly for a no-deal Brexit. He knows exactly what the problems are with things like gas connectors, he says. He says some people assume that, if the UK goes for no-deal, the EU will then cooperate on managing a no-deal Brexit. That may be so, he says. But nobody can know that it will be the case, he says. Letwin mocks claims that the EU would definitely want to cooperate with the UK to mitigate the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He says it would not be acceptable to submit the country to that. He says he will vote for amendment 7 tonight. And he will go on voting for amendments like this if necessary until March 29. UPDATE: Cooper says this amendment will not lead the Commons to the best way forward. But it will allow them to rule out the worst way forward, she says. Cooper says some people argue that the threat of a no-deal could persuade MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s deal. But that is irresponsible, she says. This is too serious for us to play a massive game of Brexit chicken. The country cannot afford to wait to see who blinks first. So I hope ministers, as has been rumoured, will accept this amendment and I hope they will accept the principle behind it that either the government should get agreement on a deal before March 29, or get explicit agreement to no deal before March 29. Or if that fails, commit to seeking an extension to Article 50 so there is time to sort things out. John Bercow, the speaker, urges Cooper to wind up. He says he needs to call at least four more MPs, and there are only 31 minutes left before the vote, he says. Sir John Redwood, the Tory Brexiter, intervenes. He says under a no-deal Brexit the UK could set zero tariffs. That would make things cheaper for consumers. Cooper says she does not see how that would help the UK secure good trade deals. But conceding zero tariffs, it would have given up its negotiating leverage, she says. She says, under a no-deal Brexit, the police would lose powers to arrest and extradite foreigners. John Baron, a Conservative Brexiter, says there were predictions about unemployment soaring if the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. They did not materialise. So why should MPs believe what Cooper is saying about the impact of a no-deal Brexit? Cooper says she is not talking about macro-economic forecasts. She says she is quoting what actual manufacturers have told her about how they would be affected by a no-deal Brexit. MPs have a duty not to make life harder for manufacturers and consumers, she says. Crispin Blunt, a Conservative, intervenes. He says Cooper cited Nestle. But Nestle is a Swiss company, and an agreement has been reached with the Swiss saying trade could continue after Brexit. Cooper says people like Blunt displayed the same \u201ccheery optimism\u201d about the prospect of getting a good deal. But that did happen, she says. Marcus Fysh, a Tory Brexiter, asks Cooper what her amendment will achieve. He says he does not see how it will stop a no-deal Brexit. Cooper says what her amendment does is provide a parliamentary safeguard. This amendment provides a parliamentary safeguard, so this amendment doesn\u2019t in itself actually solve any of the many Brexit issues that we\u2019ve got, but what it does is it provides an additional parliamentary safeguard that says the government cannot use the powers in clause 89 to implement no deal without coming back to parliament to ask permission and support for no deal first. She addresses some objections to her amendment. People say it might stop the government functioning. But it would only stop the government using clause 89 powers under the finance bill in the event of a no-deal Brexit. And, if the government wanted to use those powers, it could - provided it got MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit. People say a no-deal Brexit would be acceptable, she says. But she rejects that argument. She says one factory told her the cost of their imports would double under a no-deal Brexit. Another told her it would have to move production to the continent. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee and the person who tabled amendment 7, is speaking now. She says MPs should rule out a no-deal Brexit, because that would be the worst way forward. I\u2019ve laid this amendment because I am really worried that delays, drift or brinkmanship mean that there is now a serious risk we will end up crashing out of the EU with no deal in just 80 days\u2019 time and I\u2019m worried that we could come to the crunch and parliament wouldn\u2019t have the powers to stop it happening. And I think we have a responsibility not to just stand by. I believe the government should rule out no deal, but I think if it won\u2019t then parliament must make sure that it has the powers to do so if it comes to the crunch. Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative, asks Cooper if he will support Theresa May\u2019s deal to avoid a no deal. Cooper says she will vote against it. She explained why in her speech in the debate in December, she says. She says the deal amounts to a blindfold Brexit. Morgan says a no-deal Brexit would be a very bad deal. She says MPs should make it clear to the government that a no-deal Brexit is totally unacceptable. Many of the MPs who have signed the amendment are select committee chairs, she says. She says her own committee has investigated this. A no-deal Brexit would reduce GDP by 7.7%. That would be worse than what happened during the financial crisis, she says. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee, is speaking now. She and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper are the lead signatories of amendment 7. There are 10 Conservatives in total who have signed the amendment. The others are: Sir Oliver Letwin, Nick Boles, Jonathan Djanogly, Ed Vaizey, Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston, George Freeman, Sir Nicholas Soames and Dominic Grieve. Theresa May is facing defeat because, even with the DUP voting with the government, she only has a majority of around 13. If all 10 Tories who have signed the amendment actually vote for it, and all the opposition parties join them, then that should be enough to ensure a government defeat. (But it doesn\u2019t always work like that, which is why at this point it is not yet clear what will happen.) Jonathan Reynolds, a shadow Treasury minister, is opening the debate. Amendment 7 is not an official Labour amendment, but Labour is supporting it. Reynolds says the opposition is doing so because it thinks a no-deal Brexit should not be seen as an acceptable option. To leave the EU having not secured a deal - essentially an acrimonious departure - would damage our relationship with our most important trading partner for years to come and, as well as that, fundamentally undermine our credibility on the world stage. I cannot think how any serious-minded member of this House would understand that that would not be something of severe consequence in the history of the UK. Therefore, I believe, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important this House makes a clear statement today on the dangers of a no deal. He says there have been rumours that the government might accept the amendment. [There were this morning, but government sources are now saying Tory MPs will be told to vote against. See 1.21pm.) If the government were to accept the amendment, he says, that would be worrying because it would show the government has no strategy apart from trying to survive. You can read all the amendments to the finance bill here (pdf). The Cooper/Morgan no-deal amendment, amendment 7, is (conveniently) on page 7. Here is the \u201cexplanatory statement\u201d saying what it would achieve. This amendment would prevent the government implementing the \u201cno deal\u201d provisions of clause 89 without the explicit consent of parliament for such an outcome. It would provide three options for the provisions of clause 89 to come into force: if the House of Commons has approved a negotiated withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship; if the government has sought an extension of the article 50 period; or the House of Commons has approved leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and framework for the future relationship. MPs are now starting the debate on the no-deal amendment to the finance bill. (See 9.11am.) It is being debated along with various other amendments during a report stage devoted to amendments related to Brexit. Under the terms of the programme motion, this section of the debate has to end at around 6.20pm, when the votes will take place. The government will oppose the amendment although Downing Street has suggested that it won\u2019t matter too much if it loses. (See 2.36pm.) Others, of course, may take a different view. In truth, any whip who\u2019s honest will tell you that there\u2019s no such thing as defeat on legislation that does not matter. If the government loses tonight, that will be seen as clear evidence that the Commons will do what it can to stop Theresa May taking the UK out of the EU without a Brexit deal. At one point it was thought that Brexit would encourage other countries to leave the EU. Michael Gove, who is now environment secretary, even implied as much in a prominent speech in 2016, saying Brexit could lead to \u201cthe democratic liberation of a whole continent\u201d. In fact, it may be having the opposite effect. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform and one of the most informed EU-watchers, has posted an interesting Twitter thread on lessons learnt from the Brexit process so far. It starts here. And here is is conclusion. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on today\u2019s cabinet. Theresa May is meeting some of the MPs who have signed a cross-party letter urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit later this afternoon, the Times\u2019 Sam Coates reports. Brendan Cox, whose Labour MP wife Jo was murdered by a far-right terrorist shortly before the EU referendum in 2016, has written an article for the Guardian saying what happened to her should not cited as a reason why MPs should be silenced. Here is an excerpt. Terrorism only succeeds when we let it. To act differently because of the actions of an extremist would be to vindicate their act. To say that politics can be shaped by violence. I don\u2019t care what you think about Brexit \u2013 whether you support no\u2011deal, another referendum, the prime minister\u2019s deal \u2013 but whatever you back do it because you deeply believe in it. And please do not use Jo\u2019s name as a threat. If Jo\u2019s name is to become a synonym for anything, it should be for her kindness, generosity, optimism and her fundamental belief that we have more in common than that which divides us. That\u2019s what sums her up, that captures who she was and the spirit we\u2019ll need more than ever when the current political decisions have played out. And here\u2019s the full article. The DUP are planning to vote with the government against the Cooper/Morgan no-deal amendment to the finance bill, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. The Home Office has doubled the charge for migrants to use the NHS, Sky reports. The standard immigration health surcharge (IHS) will today double from \u00a3200 to \u00a3400, it says. Since I\u2019ve posted some copy about warnings about what might happen to Portsmouth in the event of a no-deal Brexit (see 3.34pm), Andy Fidler in the comments BTL suggests that, in fairness, I should flag up this story about Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, saying Southampton could benefit from a trade bonanza after Brexit. It\u2019s in the Southampton Daily Echo. HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh says a cross-party group of MPs wants to amend the business motion for the Brexit debate starting tomorrow so that the vote is hold on Thursday. Here\u2019s an extract from his story. The group, led by Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant and Conservative Dominic Grieve, are planning amendments to force a vote on Thursday, to block May from delaying it again, and to force her to return to the Commons within three days of her deal being rejected, as is expected, rather than the three weeks currently set out. It is the latest move in a campaign of what sources called \u201cguerilla warfare\u201d designed to stop a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d no-deal Brexit, following Yvette Cooper and Nicky Morgan\u2019s move to change the finance bill on Tuesday to make such an outcome more difficult for the government. However, MPs fear the government may try and duck the battle by putting down an un-amendable business motion for the Brexit debate, which begins on Wednesday. Downing Street has said the motion would be tabled by \u201cclose of play\u201d on Tuesday. Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, told the World at One that he was worried a clash between protesters outside the Houses of Parliament could escalate into something much more serious. He said: It is orchestrated intimidation that is playing out under the very shadow of Parliament which is such an iconic symbol of democracy. My concern is not just what has been expressed today, but ... that a minor clash could escalate into something far more serious and that would all [be] played out in front of the world\u2019s media. Council bosses have been warned that a 20-mile stretch of motorway could be closed to cope with backed-up lorries at Portsmouth\u2019s ferry port in the case of a no-deal Brexit, the Press Association reports. The \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d was revealed to Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, as he visited Portsmouth International Port to learn of preparations for the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union. As the Press Association reports, the Hampshire port currently handles 500 lorries a day, but this is set to at least double in the case of a no-deal as it is set to relieve some of the burden faced by Dover. Port director Mike Sellers said the distance from the freight gates to the motorway network was only 13 lorry lengths, and the introduction of any delays to processing vehicles on to ferries could lead to lorries backing up on to the motorways. He warned this could cause major traffic problems for the city, including the naval base and hospitals. He said: Portsmouth is seen as one of the high-risk ports that could be impacted from the no-deal and we want to be Brexit-ready even in a no-deal. There is an awful lot of infrastructure that needs to be put in place, and the cost, and whether that will be in place by the end of March is another question, and who is going to pay for it. If the M275 motorway is blocked with lorries, this is the main route into the city, it does impact on people getting in and out of the city, this is a naval port as well, you have the Royal Navy, people getting into work, the hospitals, it would very quickly impact on the whole of the Portsmouth city area. An EU source has rejected reports that British officials are putting out the feelers for an extension of article 50. An official said: We are really not getting any signals that they are considering an extension. I would describe them more in complete denial about the likelihood of an extension and that matters, because if the UK is in denial about extension, it is not going to ask for one. The EU\u2019s 27 countries would have to agree unanimously on an extension of Brexit talks, but will only consider the question if the UK requests more time under article 50. The Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford has more on how the Brexit debate will be structured. In the Commons Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has just finished responding to an urgent question about his decision to award a no-deal planning contract to Seaborne Freight, a firm that has no ferries. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, condemned the decision. He told MPs: This is a shoddy and tawdry affair and the secretary of state is making a complete mess of it. This contract is very likely unlawful and violates every current best practice guidance issued by Whitehall. When will he realise that this country cannot continue to suffer the consequences of his gross incompetence, why is this calamitous secretary of state still in post? In response, Grayling accused McDonald of \u201cidiocy\u201d. He went on: This government has let a contract for which we will pay no money until and unless ferries are running, that is responsible stewardship of public money. Earlier I said the vote on the Cooper/Morgan no-deal amendment to the finance bill would take place after 7pm. (See 1.21pm.) Sorry, that\u2019s a mistake. Instead it should be between 6pm and 7pm. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Theresa May will not open the Brexit debate when it starts tomorrow, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman revealed. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will open the debate and May will close it, meaning that she will be the final speaker before MPs vote early on Tuesday evening. But the spokesman would not give further details about the procedure for the debate (in particular, whether MPs will be debating a new motion, or just resuming the debate started in December), saying this would be set out in the business motion (which will be laid tonight). The spokesman refused to say when the government would update MPs on the fresh assurances about the withdrawal agreement it is seeking. \u201cIn terms of the assurances that we are seeking from the EU, that work is ongoing,\u201d he said. But he suggested that MPs would get details before the PM winds up on Tuesday, so that they can be discussed during the debate. The spokesman said the government \u201cwill not be extending article 50\u201d. Recently some government comments on this have implied that the government is softening its opposition to an extension. But the spokesman said that, during cabinet this morning, May said it was not government policy to extend article 50. During the briefing the spokesman went further, saying: \u201cWe will not be extending article 50.\u201d The spokesman insisted that government officials have not been asking the EU about the possibility of extending article 50. He suggested that today\u2019s Telegraph story saying that they have been \u201cputting out feelers\u201d on this could be based on what EU officials think might happen. (Adam Fleming, the BBC\u2019s Brussels reporter, was interesting on this topic on the World at One. He said that, while in London it is assumed that, if there is no deal, the default would be for the UK to leave the EU with no deal, in Brussels it is assumed that the default would be for article 50 to be extended.) The spokesman said that the main focus at today\u2019s cabinet was on how the government might win the vote next week. But he refused to say whether there was an discussion about what might happen if the government loses. The spokesman refused to rule out the UK leaving the EU with no deal. But he stressed that this is not what May wants. She \u201cbelieves it is in the best interests of the UK to leave with a deal\u201d, he said. The spokesman dismissed David Davis\u2019s claim that the EU would be willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement if pushed. (See 11.36am.) Asked about Davis\u2019s comments, the spokesman suggested that what Davis was saying was not consistent with \u201cthe public statements that the EU have made on that matter\u201d. The spokesman said the government was opposed to the Cooper/Morgan amendment to the finance bill (see 9.11am) but that, if passed, it would not cause significant difficulties for the government. Asked about it, he said: The amendment is not desirable. The effect of the amendment on no-deal preparations would be inconvenience, rather than anything more significant. He said, if passed, all the amendment would achieve would be to stop the government making minor changes to tax law in the event of a no-deal Brexit (unless one of three conditions was met - see 9.11am). For example, it might stop the government replacing a reference to the EEA with a reference to the UK in tax legislation. The amendment would not prevent the government from preventing tax, he said. At cabinet May condemned the harassment suffered by the Conservative MP Anna Soubry as she was being interviewed outside parliament, the spokesman said. He said May told colleagues that \u201cthis is not how debate should be conducted in our country\u201d. The spokesman refused to endorse a suggestion from Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, that the intimidation of Soubry and others illustrated why a second referendum would be a bad idea. The behaviour of protesters and a second referendum were \u201cseparate issues\u201d, the spokesman said. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, told cabinet that the government should uphold the principle that asylum seekers should claim asylum in the first country they reach, the spokesman said. Damian Hinds, the eduction secretary, has announced plans to spend \u00a345m on 900 places on the Frontline children\u2019s social work training programme up to 2021, Number 10 said. Speaking outside Scotland Yard, Laurence Taylor, the deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said that officers would be expected to intervene if protesters tried to stop MPs going about their daily routines. Asked if the Met would take specific action over John Bercow\u2019s concerns about the safety of MPs outside parliament, Taylor said: It\u2019s one of the allegations that we are assessing at the moment to determine whether any criminal activity has taken place. We\u2019ve given a very clear direction to our officers on the ground that if they witness criminal behaviour then there is an expectation that an arrest will be made. And also if they witness any behaviour that is intimidating, or to an extent that it is obstructing somebody going about their normal daily routines, then we would expect an intervention to be made according to what\u2019s happening at the time. Taylor said the policing operation near Parliament would be \u201cenhanced\u201d in the run-up to the Brexit vote next week. He went on: From a policing perspective, policing Brexit is always going to be very challenging. It\u2019s a very contentious issue, and it\u2019s going to bring out people with opposing views. Obviously politicians are part of those arguments, and our role as a police service is to make sure that people are able to voice those views in an appropriate manner without causing stress or criminal behaviour. We\u2019ve reviewed our policing plan on the back of incidents yesterday. You will see a visible policing presence (near parliament). We\u2019ve had a policing presence there for a number of months with ongoing protest. We recognise the challenges there at the moment and certainly leading up to the vote next week we will be enhancing the policing presence and we will ensure that we have appropriate measures in place to attempt as far as possible to reassure people that they can go about their lives without fear of harassment or alarm. Greg Clark, the business secretary, told MPs during business questions earlier that a no-deal Brexit \u201cshould not be contemplated\u201d. He said: I\u2019ve always been very clear, representing the views of small business and large business, that no deal should not be contemplated. Conservative MPs are being told to vote against the Cooper/Morgan amendment to the finance bill intended to make implementing a no-deal Brexit harder (see 9.31am), my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. But, as Jessica points out, at the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman made it clear that the government won\u2019t regard it as the end of the world if it loses the vote. I will post more on that, and what else was said at the briefing, shortly. UPDATE: The vote should take place between 6pm and 7pm. Earlier I said it would be after 7pm, but I misread the timetable. In the Commons, when the Labour MP Stephen Doughty asked about the \u201cracist\u201d abuse being directed at people by pro-Brexit campaigners outside the Houses of Parliament, John Bercow, the speaker, described this behavour as \u201ca type of fascism\u201d. He said: It\u2019s a type of fascism. Let\u2019s be quite clear about that, it\u2019s a type of fascism. Women and ethnic minority citizens in particular are being targeted. I don\u2019t say that they\u2019re the only people on the receiving end of this completely unacceptable behaviour but they have been and are being deliberately and disproportionately targeted. That is not acceptable and we have to ensure that something is done about it. Here is an extract from the letter John Bercow, the Commons speaker, has written to the Metropolitan police about campaigners intimidating MPs outside parliament. (See 12.52pm.) I would like to ask for your help in addressing, as a matter of urgency, a number of incidents of aggressive, threatening and intimidating behaviour towards MPs and journalists in the vicinity of Abingdon Green. The issue was raised with me in the House of Commons yesterday by colleagues who are concerned for their personal safety when they go to and return from media interviews. I am also adding my support to the growing call for police action by at least 60 members, who I believe have already submitted letters to you on this matter. It is frankly intolerable if members of parliament and journalists cannot go about their lawful business without being ritually insulted, abused, intimidated, threatened and harassed. There seems to be a pattern here of a regular coterie of burly white men who are effectively targeting and denouncing members whom they recognise and dislike - most notably female and those from ethnic minority backgrounds. One report I have is of a member being surrounded by individuals who hurled abuse at her as she walked back to parliament. I have also been warned that school children visiting the estate are at risk of witnessing these toxic attacks. Naturally I recognise that you and your officers have a difficult job striking the balance between allowing peaceful protests and intervening when things turn sour. There is of course a right to protest and that is important. However, it\u2019s one thing demonstrating from a distance with placards, or calling out slogans - and another, where the protester invades the personal space of a member, subjects him or her to a tirade of menacing, racist, sexist and misogynistic abuse, and follows them back to their place of work. I politely suggest that the present situation is not only intolerable but untenable. Matters cannot stand as they do today. A change in policy is required. I would therefore ask you and your officers to do your utmost to increase security for members, journalists and visitors to the parliamentary estate, and ensure there is safe access to and from Abingdon Green. In the Commons John Bercow, the speaker, has just told MPs that he has written to Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick asking for help to tackle \u201caggressive, threatening and intimidating behaviour\u201d against MPs and journalists outside parliament. I\u2019m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. The highlight came when the prime minister\u2019s spokesman was asked about these tweets from the Times\u2019 Sam Coates. \u201cI suspect the [cabinet] minute will not reflect that,\u201d said the spokesman, when asked about Michael Gove\u2019s alleged \u201cswingers\u201d analogy. But the spokesman did not dispute Coates\u2019s report of what was said. (Reminder: these people actually run the country.) Here are more of Coates\u2019 tweets. Alex Salmond has won his legal challenge against the Scottish government\u2019s investigation into claims he sexually harassed two women, after the government admitted its processes were unlawful, my colleague Severin Carrell reports. I\u2019m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. He is the one who resigned over the Chequers Brexit plan in the summer, remember, not the one who resigned over the actual withdrawal agreement (Dominic Raab). Davis got the main 8.10 slot on the programme, outranking the current Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, who was on a bit earlier. Here are the main points. Davis claimed that the EU would be willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. He said: [The claim that the deal on the table is the only deal available] will not prove to be true. The government is running out the clock, but actually now there are already signs - the taoiseach\u2019s comments [see 9.48am] being one of them - that the European Union knows it needs a deal, and it will come back ... What is going on at the moment is they\u2019re testing the mettle of the British government ... The simple truth is that they will hold fast to the line - this is the traditional approach of the European commission, the European Union - until the last possible minute. And then, if we hold fast to our line, then they will actually come back and renegotiate. Davis also claimed that today\u2019s Telegraph story, saying EU sources are saying British officials have been \u201cputting out feelers\u201d about extending article 50 (a story played down by the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, but not categorically denied) confirmed his theory. He said: What actually is going on is that the Europeans are thinking about the next stage. And the next stage is another round of negotiations. Otherwise it doesn\u2019t make sense. That [Telegraph] headline does not make sense. Asked what the EU would offer in a future negotiation, Davis said: \u201cIt will be what we demand.\u201d Those demands would included legal assurances on the backstop, and some undertaking on free trade, he said. Davis could theoretically be right, although a very large number of senior EU figures have said, repeatedly and categorically, that they are not willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister, said that again only this morning. (See 10.30am.) And, as my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney has said that Brexiters like Davis are guilty of \u201cwishful thinking\u201d if they think the EU is willing to make new compromises. Davis claimed the British press was ignoring all the work being done on the continent to make a no-deal Brexit manageable. He said: The French are moving heaven and earth. They have found places outside Calais to have their inspection regimes. The head of French customs has said they are going to facilitate and accelerate through-put. Indeed, other ports are saying the same; Rotterdam, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, all saying the same. And they are taking on thousands of people. When it was put to him that a no-deal Brexit would inevitably cause delays at the ports, he replied: That is why the French are taking all the action they\u2019re taking. This does not get reported in the British press, but they are taking loads of actions to ensure that it\u2019s dealt with quickly. He also said that French lorry drivers had blockaded ports before, without the British economy grinding to a halt. Denis MacShane, the former Labour Europe minister and a fervent pro-European, claimed later that Davis was talking \u201cnonsense\u201d. Davis rejected government claims that, even if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would still have to pay most of the \u00a339bn it has agreed to hand over. When this was put to him, he said: No, no. That\u2019s a false assertion, I\u2019m afraid ... The best guideline on this is the constitutional committee of the House of Lords right back at the beginning of this process who looked at all [arguments] ... they said, \u2018No, this is a matter of negotiation\u2019. Davis was actually referring to a report from the Lords European Union committee (pdf) published in 2017 which concluded: Although there are competing interpretations, we conclude that if agreement is not reached, all EU law\u2014including provisions concerning ongoing financial contributions and machinery for adjudication\u2014will cease to apply, and the UK would be subject to no enforceable obligation to make any financial contribution at all. But Geoffrey Cox, the Brexiter attorney general, challenged this when asked about it in the Commons in December. He said: The view of the government, and my view, is that we would have obligations to pay a certain amount of money were we to leave the European Union without a deal. The House of Lords European Union committee concluded that there would be no obligation under EU law. That is a stronger argument\u2014not necessarily an incontestable one\u2014as to our obligations under EU law, but the committee also concluded that we might have obligations under public international law, and with that I agree. There is an argument that we would not have an obligation under public international law, but it is an argument unlikely to be accepted by any international tribunal. My view is therefore that we would owe a presently unquantifiable sum were we to leave the European Union without a deal. It is impossible at this stage to say how much. It is true that the European Union is not a member state and is not a state, and therefore it is unable to take the case to the international court of justice. It might therefore be difficult to enforce the public international law obligation that existed. However, I ask the House to reflect on the fact that if this country, acknowledging that such obligations probably exist or do exist, did not pay them, it would be likely to cause the deepest resentment, just as it would to any of us who were unpaid a debt. If we leave a club, we pay the bar bill. If we do not pay the bill, we are not likely to get a lot of consideration from the other side. Today the government is launching a radio advertising campaign intended to give people information they might need in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But the government does not seem to be very keen on publicising its own publicity drive, according to the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith and the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope. Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister, told reporters this morning as she arrived at the EU\u2019s general affairs council that the Brexit withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated. Asked how the EU could prove to British MPs that it does not want to use the backstop, she said: We have said it repeatedly. The president said it at the end of the previous European council. Indeed, we all want to have a fruitful, profitable relationship with the United Kingdom in the future. So the backstop is just a last resort solution. Asked if that meant no new reassurances would be offered, she said: These are political assurances. But there is nothing more we can do. The withdrawal agreement is indeed a good agreement, both for the UK and the European Union. We should stick to it. Asked about extending article 50, she says she did not want to discuss \u201chypotheticals\u201d. But she said the prospect of raising it had not been raised with France. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, was also on Sky this morning. In that interview he claimed that some Tory MPs were now \u201cmuch more open\u201d to supporting Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has been giving media interviews this morning. As my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, he dismissed reports that the government is contemplating asking the EU if it can extend article 50. As PoliticsHome reports, Barclay also angered anti-Brexit MPs by arguing that the intimidation of Anna Soubry by pro-Brexit campaigners outside the House of Commons showed why a second referendum would be a bad idea. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has said the EU is willing to give written assurances about the withdrawal agreement ahead of next week\u2019s vote at Westminster. Speaking to reporters during a trip to Mali, the taoiseach said: The summit conclusions at our last meeting in December provided written assurances, but what\u2019s happening at the moment is there is close contact between the UK and EU institutions as to whether a further set of written guarantees, explanations and assurances could make a difference. Our intent, once the withdrawal agreement has been ratified by Westminster and the European Parliament, is to get into talks on the future relationship on the new economic and trade treaty with Britain, on the new security partnership with Britain. We don\u2019t want to trap the UK into anything - we want to get on to the talks about the future relationship right away. I think it\u2019s those kind of assurances we are happy to give. The EU has repeatedly said that any assurances of this kind would not amount to a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement. Instead, they would take the form of a clarification. But Varadkar also said he could not satisfy the DUP or Brexiters. He said: It\u2019s impossible for me to speak on behalf of the DUP or on behalf of the Brexiteers. I can\u2019t say what would or would not satisfy them. What I can say is that Ireland set out its objectives from day one. We regret the UK is leaving the EU, but they are. On Newsnight last night Richard Harrington, a business minister, said he would resign if the government went ahead with a no-deal Brexit. He told the programme: We will not be leaving with no deal. We\u2019re going to leave with the prime minister\u2019s deal. And I think people are beginning to realise that it\u2019s the prime minister\u2019s deal or there may not be a Brexit. Asked if he was prepared to resign to stop a no-deal Brexit, Harrington replied: \u201cDefinitely, I would.\u201d Harrington also said his view was \u201cnot an uncommon one\u201d. It is thought that some of the pro-Europeans in cabinet, like Greg Clark, the business secretary, and David Gauke, the justice secretary, would also quit if Theresa May decided to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. Gauke has effectively said as much in public. The main Brexit event in the Commons today will be a debate on the finance bill which may see MPs voting on a cross-party amendment that would make it harder for the government to implement a no-deal Brexit. My colleague Jessica Elgot has previewed it here. I say \u201cmay\u201d because a) there is no 100% guarantee yet that the amendment will get \u201ccalled\u201d (ie, selected for debate and a vote), although it is very likely that it will; and b) the government could decide to accept it anyway rather than go down to inevitable defeat. At the weekend the Sunday Times (paywall) rather ingeniously suggested that this amendment was could \u201cderail a no-deal Brexit this week by starving the government of cash and creating a Donald Trump-style shutdown\u201d. In truth, it is nowhere near as significant as that (although a second amendment, tabled by the Lib Dems, would be much more likely to hamstring the government in the event of a no-deal Brexit, although that is much less likely to get called\u201d). The Daily Mail quotes a Treasury source saying the government is \u201cpretty relaxed\u201d about the amendment because it would only \u201cstop us doing some little things to make the tax system work better\u201d, suggesting that around lunchtime we could well get an announcement saying the government will accept the amendment. But that would still be awkward for the government because the amendment, tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Nicky Morgan, effectively provides a template for stopping the government exercising all manner of powers in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (It says certain no-deal related powers in clause 89 of the finance bill could only be exercised if there is either a) a deal; b) an extension to article 50; or c) a Commons vote authorising a no-deal Brexit. It is easy to imagine more amendments being tabled attaching these three conditions to a huge range of government bills.) And Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d for the government to have its hands tied in this way. Speaking in California, where he is on a trade trip, he said the amendment would not stop a no-deal Brexit. As the BBC reports, he went on: The government has to ensure that all eventualities are covered. It maybe that we cannot get agreement with the EU and that we have to leave without an agreement in which case the UK has to be prepared. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 11am: Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, speaks at the publication of a Shelter report saying England should launch the biggest council and social house building drive in its history to rescue millions of people from a future in dangerous, overcrowded or unsuitable homes. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 12.45pm: MPs debate the finance bill. At some point there may be a vote on an amendment intended to make it harder for the government to implement a no-deal Brexit. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Mirack was badly beaten and was probably strangled. Prosecutors said they are not sure whether Rowe and Mirack knew each other or why he targeted her. Rowe lived about four miles from Mirack in 1992, and the prosecutor said Mirack\u2019s home was on a likely route between Rowe\u2019s home and where he worked at the time.

But the threats that eastern curlews are facing right now demand that we re-assess what we value.

More than 5,000 people have suffered from the milder sting of the bluebottle, which massed in a record-breaking armada along the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast last weekend. World Donald Trump is to make his first Oval Office address to the nation as president on Tuesday night, local time, to argue that an immigration crisis at the US-Mexico border requires funding for his border wall pet project \u2013 before the federal government partial shutdown can be ended. The official Democratic response to Donald Trump\u2019s televised address to the nation will be delivered by Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. In England, a woman who was allegedly raped by Australian-born professional cricketer Alex Hepburn broke down in court after being cross-examined about how she acted during the alleged attack. Hepburn, 23, denies raping the woman, who told a Worcestershire court she was initially asleep. Turkey has asked Washington to hand over its bases in Syria as the Trump administration appeared to reverse plans to withdraw from the country\u2019s north-east on Tuesday, jeopardising Ankara\u2019s plans to launch a widespread military operation targeting Kurdish groups that Turkey views as mortal foes. An Uber driver charged with killing six strangers in Michigan in between picking up passengers has pleaded guilty to murder \u2013 over his attorney\u2019s objections \u2013 triggering the prospect of a mandatory sentence of life in prison with no chance for parole. All flights out of the UK\u2019s busiest airport, London\u2019s Heathrow, were suspended for more than an hour on Tuesday after a drone sighting, just weeks after a similar report at Gatwick grounded about 1,000 flights. Opinion and analysis When Stephanie Convery moved to Sydney a few years ago she joined a choir: \u201cWhen we stood to sing through the first song \u2013 a Tori Amos tune that sucked me right back to the emotional upheaval of my late teens \u2013 I nearly burst into tears. I had forgotten how it felt to sing with other people, and the sudden rush of memory and pure joy was like a kick to the heart.\u201d Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People is the literary phenomenon of the decade. This week, Rooney, 27, became the youngest novelist ever to land the Costa awards\u2019 best novel category. Normal People is now favourite to win the prize for overall book of the year at the end of the month. Her second novel has been a surprise \u2013 not for its quality, which was assured after her confident debut Conversations with Friends \u2013 but for the response to it. There hasn\u2019t been a literary novel that has had such an impact on conversation since perhaps Jonathan Franzen\u2019s Freedom, or, before that, Monica Ali\u2019s Brick Lane, or even before that, Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth. Uncle Wes Marne, 96, has been telling stories \u201csince Moses played fullback for Jerusalem\u201d. The Indigenous elder is one of four First Nations people whose voices and stories have been captured in Blak Box: a sound installation at Sydney festival which invites anyone to come in and listen. Program curator Daniel Browning says that without intervention, the spoken literature of the world\u2019s oldest oral culture will disappear. Sport Today at the Kooyong Classic Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic meet on court for the first time as their Australian Open preparations ramp up. Tomic will again have to deal with new balls though, having criticised the switch to Dunlops from Wilson following his win over Jack Sock on Tuesday. England are due to arrive in Barbados on Friday for their latest tour. It would be no surprise if the first days were to throw up a few dramatic moments \u2013 and perhaps a bit of comedy. Thinking time: Ode to the eastern curlew \u201cI could use flowery language to tell you how extraordinary the eastern curlew is,\u201d writes Harry Saddler, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather let the facts speak for themselves: before it leaves Australia it has nearly doubled its own bodyweight to fuel its vast migration, and then flies for days, non-stop to the Yellow Sea, where it replenishes on the intertidal mudflats of north-east China and the Korean peninsula. Then it flies non-stop to Siberia. \u201cFor a creature with such endurance, the eastern curlew is in perilous danger of losing vital habitat \u2013 and its battle for survival. Although we love the coast, we love only a very specific kind of coast: golden sandy beaches and deep blue bays. Shallow seas over vast mudflats don\u2019t catch our imagination, or our hearts, regardless of how rich the ecosystem of invertebrates and birds they sustain is. But the threats that eastern curlews are facing right now demand that we re-assess what we value. If the mudflats that sustain eastern curlews are destroyed, so too are mudflats that sustains whimbrels, and terek sandpipers, and bar-tailed godwits, and any of dozens of other species.\u201d Media roundup In what it calls a \u201cremarkable shift\u201d, the Australian Financial Review reports that industry superannuation funds are likely to overtake self-managed super funds in the next two years, reaching $1tn in value. The Australian reports Peter Dutton is urging states to sign up to a national register of child-sex offenders available to the public online. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age both lead with research by Citigroup that finds Labor\u2019s plan to end cash refunds for franking credits could wipe billions from Australia\u2019s big four banks. Coming up Centre court will heat up the Kooyong Classic today as Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios play each other for the first time in a tournament. Two Irish nationals will appear in court today on murder charges after a man assaulted in Sydney\u2019s inner west died in hospital.

It\u2019s an eclectic mix and one that \u2013 quite deliberately \u2013 pushes at the edges of what\u2019s usually considered \u201ccultural\u201d. In Lane\u2019s view, \u201cthere needs to be as much high [culture] as there is low, and vice versa\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence that the Cultural Community College has appeared at a time when arts education is perceived to be in crisis. The exclusion of arts subjects from the English baccalaureate has led to a decline in their study at many schools, while the emphasis on so-called \u201cfacilitating subjects\u201d has discouraged students from choosing arts A-level options. In his new book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/23/britain-crisis-childhood-former-childrens-commissioner-al-aynsley-green-book\">The British Betrayal of Childhood</a>, former children\u2019s commissioner for England Sir Al Aynsley-Green even includes the downgrading of arts education as one of the factors driving a \u201ccrisis in childhood\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ea10b90774706dd97ac9b878b3ab9e31da164ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ea10b90774706dd97ac9b878b3ab9e31da164ce/0_0_1873_2145/873.jpg\" alt=\"A cookery lesson at Slung Low\u2019s Cultural Community College\" width=\"873\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cookery lesson organised by Slung Low\u2019s Cultural Community College</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lane and his team were certainly conscious of the challenges currently facing arts education, but the Cultural Community College has an offer that\u2019s distinct from the instruction provided by schools, universities and the education departments of theatres. Slung Low want to bring in people who may be put off by traditional learning environments, and so they\u2019ve been thinking carefully about how and where their courses take place \u2013 hence the bus, aboard which some of the lessons are taught, as well as at the Holbeck (formerly Holbeck Working Men\u2019s Club), Slung Low\u2019s new HQ.</p> <p>Lane is reluctant to describe the course instructors as teachers; instead he calls them talkers, or experts. \u201cThere is a failure of imagination going on at every possible level of society,\u201d Lane suggests, \u201cand that\u2019s starting with children in schools, where we have decided that to learn to remember things is more important than to imagine things.\u201d He adds that \u201cthe college is a kind of response to that failure of imagination, but it\u2019s also very aware of not trying to replicate an arts education\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/09/commonism-review-birmingham-rep\">Commonism review \u2013 the quest for common ground in a turbulent time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike many of those fighting for arts education \u2013 including the signatories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/08/british-artists-ebacc-will-damage-creativity-and-self-expression\">a letter to the Guardian last year</a> expressing \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the exclusion of the arts in schools \u2013 Lane does not fall back on the economic argument. For him, and for Slung Low, cultural learning is about confidence, citizenship and empathy. The real question is not what arts education can do for the nation\u2019s finances, but what it can do for people and communities. \u201cDoes it make better citizens, and does that have any impact on all our lives?\u201d</p>",

Over time, the idea is that the college\u2019s members take ownership of the curriculum, with courses selected through a dialogue between Slung Low and the community. \u201cIt\u2019s not pure cultural democracy,\u201d says Lane, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely true that there are subjects and classes that people will be able to point to and say, \u2018I told them to do that.\u2019\u201d New additions to the programme in 2019, which opens for booking on 9 January, include fire-eating, wood whittling and tai chi. It\u2019s an eclectic mix and one that \u2013 quite deliberately \u2013 pushes at the edges of what\u2019s usually considered \u201ccultural\u201d. In Lane\u2019s view, \u201cthere needs to be as much high [culture] as there is low, and vice versa\u201d. It\u2019s no coincidence that the Cultural Community College has appeared at a time when arts education is perceived to be in crisis. The exclusion of arts subjects from the English baccalaureate has led to a decline in their study at many schools, while the emphasis on so-called \u201cfacilitating subjects\u201d has discouraged students from choosing arts A-level options. In his new book The British Betrayal of Childhood, former children\u2019s commissioner for England Sir Al Aynsley-Green even includes the downgrading of arts education as one of the factors driving a \u201ccrisis in childhood\u201d. Lane and his team were certainly conscious of the challenges currently facing arts education, but the Cultural Community College has an offer that\u2019s distinct from the instruction provided by schools, universities and the education departments of theatres. Slung Low want to bring in people who may be put off by traditional learning environments, and so they\u2019ve been thinking carefully about how and where their courses take place \u2013 hence the bus, aboard which some of the lessons are taught, as well as at the Holbeck (formerly Holbeck Working Men\u2019s Club), Slung Low\u2019s new HQ. Lane is reluctant to describe the course instructors as teachers; instead he calls them talkers, or experts. \u201cThere is a failure of imagination going on at every possible level of society,\u201d Lane suggests, \u201cand that\u2019s starting with children in schools, where we have decided that to learn to remember things is more important than to imagine things.\u201d He adds that \u201cthe college is a kind of response to that failure of imagination, but it\u2019s also very aware of not trying to replicate an arts education\u201d. Unlike many of those fighting for arts education \u2013 including the signatories of a letter to the Guardian last year expressing \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the exclusion of the arts in schools \u2013 Lane does not fall back on the economic argument. For him, and for Slung Low, cultural learning is about confidence, citizenship and empathy. The real question is not what arts education can do for the nation\u2019s finances, but what it can do for people and communities. \u201cDoes it make better citizens, and does that have any impact on all our lives?\u201d",

Plucked from non-league football at 23, the winger racked up more than 150 games for Nottingham Forest between 1988 and 1994, in a period when cup finals were so commonplace for Clough and his players that Crosby has no idea how many times he appeared at Wembley.</p> <p>The answer takes longer to find on the internet than the footage that has arguably defined Crosby\u2019s career. It features one of the most controversial goals in English football and was scored against Manchester City, who just happen to be Burton\u2019s opponents in Wednesday night\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at the Etihad. \u201cOh right,\u201d says Crosby, sounding a little surprised after learning \u201cAndy Dibble\u201d is the answer to the Google question. \u201cOf course, that was Man City also, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Even now, almost 29 years on, Crosby\u2019s cheeky goal is seared into the minds of a generation of football fans. It was the first thing the commentator mentioned on Match of the Day last month when Alexandre Lacazette sneaked up behind David de Gea, who was weighing up what to do after claiming a cross, and headed the ball out of the Manchester United goalkeeper\u2019s hand before rolling it into the empty net, only for the goal to be disallowed. Dibble, in almost identical circumstances, was not so fortunate when he unwittingly served the ball to Crosby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a league game in March 1990 but Crosby can picture the scene as if it were yesterday. \u201cI can remember it being a deep cross, going around the back, maybe with Andy Hinchcliffe, and I got nowhere near it and went to the [advertisement hoardings],\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then all I thought as I got up and started running back on to the pitch was: \u2018He\u2019s got to have that ball in two hands.\u2019 So then I just did that [stoops to head the ball]. I don\u2019t think I even touched his hand. Whether the referee actually saw it, or to what degree he knew what had happened, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>City were furious. Their manager, Howard Kendall, remonstrated angrily with Roger Gifford, the referee, who was surrounded by City players. Dibble joined them and looked devastated when it was clear the goal \u2013 the only one of the game \u2013 would stand. Not surprisingly, it has featured on just about every sporting blooper video and DVD since. \u201cI can never escape it,\u201d Dibble said in an interview 14 years later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"daf7d9432bd5e9119b8510892e7ef999bd6bf3ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daf7d9432bd5e9119b8510892e7ef999bd6bf3ab/0_177_1830_1098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crosby nods the ball out of Dibble\u2019s hand before running on to score.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crosby nods the ball out of Dibble\u2019s hand before running on to score.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crosby remembers some City supporters staying behind and giving him \u201ca bit of abuse\u201d when he walked to his car, but says that everything soon died down. As for Dibble, he later gave the glove in question to Steve Sutton, the former Forest keeper, to auction at his testimonial, and there has never been any ill-feeling. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Dibbs about enough over the years that it\u2019s just a laugh,\u201d Crosby adds.</p> <p>If that goal somewhat unfairly shaped the perception of Dibble\u2019s career, it feels as though the same is probably true for Crosby, albeit without the ridicule. \u201cMaybe.

      "bodyText": "Gary Crosby looks slightly baffled when asked what he thinks comes up when his name is typed into Google. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never looked myself up once,\u201d Burton Albion\u2019s assistant manager says. \u201cI\u2019ve never watched any games back that I\u2019ve played in \u2013 no point. So I haven\u2019t got a clue. \u2018Joiner\u2019, hopefully, because that\u2019s what I am.\u201d A friendly and refreshingly down-to-earth character, Crosby has been talking candidly at Burton\u2019s Pirelli Stadium for nearly an hour, reminiscing about the days when he was running down the right flank against miners one week and signing for Brian Clough and upsetting Alex Ferguson the next. Plucked from non-league football at 23, the winger racked up more than 150 games for Nottingham Forest between 1988 and 1994, in a period when cup finals were so commonplace for Clough and his players that Crosby has no idea how many times he appeared at Wembley. The answer takes longer to find on the internet than the footage that has arguably defined Crosby\u2019s career. It features one of the most controversial goals in English football and was scored against Manchester City, who just happen to be Burton\u2019s opponents in Wednesday night\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at the Etihad. \u201cOh right,\u201d says Crosby, sounding a little surprised after learning \u201cAndy Dibble\u201d is the answer to the Google question. \u201cOf course, that was Man City also, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Even now, almost 29 years on, Crosby\u2019s cheeky goal is seared into the minds of a generation of football fans. It was the first thing the commentator mentioned on Match of the Day last month when Alexandre Lacazette sneaked up behind David de Gea, who was weighing up what to do after claiming a cross, and headed the ball out of the Manchester United goalkeeper\u2019s hand before rolling it into the empty net, only for the goal to be disallowed. Dibble, in almost identical circumstances, was not so fortunate when he unwittingly served the ball to Crosby. It was a league game in March 1990 but Crosby can picture the scene as if it were yesterday. \u201cI can remember it being a deep cross, going around the back, maybe with Andy Hinchcliffe, and I got nowhere near it and went to the [advertisement hoardings],\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then all I thought as I got up and started running back on to the pitch was: \u2018He\u2019s got to have that ball in two hands.\u2019 So then I just did that [stoops to head the ball]. I don\u2019t think I even touched his hand. Whether the referee actually saw it, or to what degree he knew what had happened, I don\u2019t know.\u201d City were furious. Their manager, Howard Kendall, remonstrated angrily with Roger Gifford, the referee, who was surrounded by City players. Dibble joined them and looked devastated when it was clear the goal \u2013 the only one of the game \u2013 would stand. Not surprisingly, it has featured on just about every sporting blooper video and DVD since. \u201cI can never escape it,\u201d Dibble said in an interview 14 years later. Crosby remembers some City supporters staying behind and giving him \u201ca bit of abuse\u201d when he walked to his car, but says that everything soon died down. As for Dibble, he later gave the glove in question to Steve Sutton, the former Forest keeper, to auction at his testimonial, and there has never been any ill-feeling. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Dibbs about enough over the years that it\u2019s just a laugh,\u201d Crosby adds. If that goal somewhat unfairly shaped the perception of Dibble\u2019s career, it feels as though the same is probably true for Crosby, albeit without the ridicule. \u201cMaybe. It\u2019s the one thing you get remembered for,\u201d says Crosby, who was a League Cup winner with Forest in 1990. \u201cBut I had some fantastic times at Forest.

      "bodyText": "British Airways has been accused of glamorising gambling after it ran a television commercial featuring a couple easily winning money on slot machines, triggering complaints to the advertising regulator and anger from MPs and campaigners. The advert, for British Airways Holidays, shows a couple returning to their room via what appears to be a hotel casino after a dip in the swimming pool. \u201cWe had a bit of spare change so we put it in the slot machines \u2026 and won a couple of dollars. So we put it back in and the next thing we knew we\u2019d won $493. Luckiest dip ever,\u201d they said. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, said he had been \u201cstunned\u201d by the advert and would be discussing the matter urgently with cross-party colleagues. He said: \u201cUtterly appalling. What were they thinking?\u201d A cross-party parliamentary group of MPs, led by the Labour MP Carolyn Harris, is expected to write to BA to condemn it for \u201cglamorising\u201d gambling. The advert aired just weeks after gambling companies agreed strict limits on their own TV commercials to address concerns about the impact of a surge in gambling ads on vulnerable people, addicts and children. A spokeswoman for the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the regulator had received several complains about the advert \u201con grounds that it promotes gambling and portrays it in a glamorous and frivolous way, and that it\u2019s therefore irresponsible\u201d. Marc Etches, the chief executive of the UK\u2019s leading gambling charity GambleAware, raised concerns about the lack of messages about addiction that are required to appear alongside marketing for gambling companies. \u201cWith 370,000 problem gamblers in Great Britain it is vital that we recognise gambling for the public health issue it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequences of problem gambling can be devastating for individuals and families alike, and companies need to recognise their responsibility to make sure people are aware of the risks of gambling.\u201d Matt Zarb-Cousin, of Fairer Gambling, who was at the centre of a successful campaign to restrict fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), criticised BA\u2019s choice of theme for its advert. \u201cIf BA instead glorified pot smoking to promote a route to Amsterdam in adverts shown before the watershed, it would surely raise some eyebrows.

He said that the government had \u201crun down the clock\u201d towards the 29 March exit date. \u201cNobody should be underestimating at this stage how likely a no deal exit could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has got us to the point of ruin.\u201d Morgan said those who had signed the amendment had different views both on Brexit itself and on the way forward. \u201cIt is right that parliamentarians on both sides of the house should rule out the most damaging thing that could happen on 29 March,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a gross dereliction of responsibility of members of this house to inflict a no-deal situation on our constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is time for members on all sides to make it clear to the government that a no-deal outcome for Brexit is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d The veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke, a prominent Europhile, said crashing out with no deal would leave the UK \u201cas the only developed country in the world that has no trade agreements at all with anyone and made to fall back on WTO rules, made to sound marvellous by Brexiteers but do not amount to very much.\u201d Opposition to the rebels\u2019 amendment came from pro-Brexit Labour MP Kate Hoey, who said it would be \u201cirresponsible for the government not to be making contingency plans for a WTO situation\u2026\u201d Backers of the amendment concede that it cannot, in and of itself, stop a no-deal Brexit from occurring. It is attached to a clause designed to give the government the power to keep some areas of tax administration working in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Cooper\u2019s amendment meant that new power would only be allowed to come into force if there were either a Brexit deal, a decision to extend article 50, or a vote in the Commons specifically approving a no-deal Brexit. It is this format of three options that MPs may later decide to attempt to apply to other bills going through the Commons. A number of bills could be amended, which might have more significant impact on day-to-day government operations. Seven bills must be implemented in order to provide a smooth exit by March, including trade, agriculture, healthcare, financial services, fisheries and immigration, as well as legislation for the withdrawal agreement. Government sources had briefed that the material effect of the finance bill amendment would be \u201clow down the list\u201d of difficulties if the UK was heading towards a no-deal Brexit and officials suggested that more emergency legislation would probably be needed, where the government could attempt to restore these powers without caveat. Earlier, May\u2019s spokesman said the amendment was \u201cnot desirable but the effect of the amendment on no-deal preparations would be inconvenience rather than anything more significant\u201d. He said it would not prevent the government from collecting tax. \u201cWhat clause 89 does is allow the government to make minor amendments to tax law, in consequence of EU exit, in order to keep the tax code working as it currently does,\u201d the spokesman said.",

The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, tweeted that Trump will use the trip to \u201cmeet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis\u201d. The Oval Office address will be carried by the main broadcast networks and cable news channels. Previewing Trump\u2019s comments, the vice-president, Mike Pence, told reporters: \u201cThere is a humanitarian and national security crisis\u201d at the border. \u201cThe passion you hear from President Trump, his determination to take this case to the American people, as he will tonight in his national broadcast from the Oval Office, comes from this president\u2019s deep desire to do his job to protect the American people,\u201d Pence said during an appearance on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Tuesday. Immigration experts argue otherwise, pointing out that the rate of illegal border crossings has been in decline over the past decade. Last year, the population of undocumented immigrants in the US reached a 12-year low. Pence on Monday said Trump has yet to decide whether he will officially declare a national emergency over his demand for a wall along the south-west border \u2013 the key sticking point in negotiations over the partial government shutdown that is affecting more than 800,000 federal employees. White House counsel is reviewing whether the president has the ability to declare a national emergency in the current situation, Pence told reporters at a media briefing on Monday. He added that the administration would prefer to secure the funding for border security from an agreement with Congress. Declaring a national state of emergency would all but certainly invite legal challenges. Trump said there is \u201cno doubt\u201d he has the legal authority to declare a national emergency but said \u201clet\u2019s get our deal done in Congress\u201d. The shutdown, which has lasted 17 days, is already the second-longest in US history and would become the longest if it stretches into this weekend. Negotiations between Democratic congressional leaders and the White House are at a stalemate. Both sides have dug in over the wall after fraught meetings last week. Nancy Pelosi has called the wall \u201cimmoral\u201d and refuses to budge on providing taxpayers\u2019 funding for it. As a first act, the newly empowered House Democrats passed legislation last week to reopen the government while congressional leaders and the administration continued to debate border security. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said he would not take up legislation the president did not support.

The cheek is Grayling\u2019s last remaining centre of intelligent life: when it wobbles, it\u2019s a sure sign he\u2019s in danger. Even though he isn\u2019t aware of it himself.</p> <p>Rather, he expressed surprise that anyone should doubt his ability to plan for a no-deal Brexit. As far as he was concerned, the fact everything was taking place at the last minute was an indication of just how advanced his preparations were. He even cited the previous day\u2019s abject failure to create a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/no-deal-brexit-rehearsal-tests-traffic-congestion-in-kent\">pretend lorry jam</a> as evidence of his success. It\u2019s one thing to humiliate yourself. It\u2019s quite another not to even realise you are doing it.</p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, looked vaguely bemused. What bit of Seaborne Ferries having no ferries, no money and no website <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/03/brexit-freight-ferry-firm-appears-all-geared-up-to-deliver-pizzas\">other than a pizza menu</a> didn\u2019t Failing Grayling understand? Even the mayor of Ostend had already said the ferry service wouldn\u2019t be allowed into his port. Why had no due diligence been done?</p> <p>\u201cI make no apologies,\u201d Grayling insisted. It was typical of Labour to nitpick. Since when did a ferry company actually need any ships? Seaborne was actually working on a Lego catapult to throw lorries from Ramsgate across to Belgium. And complaining about directors having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/brexit-ferry-firm-who-are-the-old-sea-dogs-behind-venture\">racked up debts</a> in previous ventures was just anti-business.

Bernard Jenkin, eager to live down to his portrayal in James Graham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/you-whitewashed-the-corruption-james-graham-and-carole-cadwalladr-on-brexit-the-uncivil-war\">Channel 4 Brexit drama</a> as an establishment buffoon, was the first on his feet to congratulate Grayling for all his hard work and observe that it was totally unfair to expect him to know anything about Seaborne. Charlie Elphicke agreed, suggesting Labour was only interested in wrecking and sabotage tactics.</p> <p>Too late. Grayling was more than capable of wrecking and sabotaging his own position without any help from Labour. First, he said it didn\u2019t matter if Seaborne ran any ferries or not, because if they didn\u2019t then they wouldn\u2019t get the \u00a313.8m anyway. This silenced many Tories, because even they could understand that the logic of contingency planning based on a ferry company not delivering additional capacity was inherently flawed. But not Failing Grayling. He was on a roll. His one regret was that he hadn\u2019t awarded even more worthless contracts.</p> <p>The failure was complete. Grayling had yet again died on his feet. It\u2019s what he does. A kinder prime minister would have removed him long ago, but he serves a purpose in making others look less mediocre. So he lived to lose another day. Besides, he had a relaxing afternoon ahead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/08/heathrow-airport-departures-suspended-after-drone-sighting\">flying his drone</a> near Heathrow.</p>",

The cheek is Grayling\u2019s last remaining centre of intelligent life: when it wobbles, it\u2019s a sure sign he\u2019s in danger. Even though he isn\u2019t aware of it himself. Rather, he expressed surprise that anyone should doubt his ability to plan for a no-deal Brexit. As far as he was concerned, the fact everything was taking place at the last minute was an indication of just how advanced his preparations were. He even cited the previous day\u2019s abject failure to create a pretend lorry jam as evidence of his success. It\u2019s one thing to humiliate yourself. It\u2019s quite another not to even realise you are doing it. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, looked vaguely bemused. What bit of Seaborne Ferries having no ferries, no money and no website other than a pizza menu didn\u2019t Failing Grayling understand? Even the mayor of Ostend had already said the ferry service wouldn\u2019t be allowed into his port. Why had no due diligence been done? \u201cI make no apologies,\u201d Grayling insisted. It was typical of Labour to nitpick. Since when did a ferry company actually need any ships? Seaborne was actually working on a Lego catapult to throw lorries from Ramsgate across to Belgium. And complaining about directors having racked up debts in previous ventures was just anti-business. He was sick and tired of people talking down bankruptcy. While Grayling was busy embarrassing himself, the Conservative stooge James Heappey was handing out crib sheets to backbenchers, begging them to ask vaguely supportive questions of the transport secretary. Bernard Jenkin, eager to live down to his portrayal in James Graham\u2019s Channel 4 Brexit drama as an establishment buffoon, was the first on his feet to congratulate Grayling for all his hard work and observe that it was totally unfair to expect him to know anything about Seaborne. Charlie Elphicke agreed, suggesting Labour was only interested in wrecking and sabotage tactics. Too late. Grayling was more than capable of wrecking and sabotaging his own position without any help from Labour. First, he said it didn\u2019t matter if Seaborne ran any ferries or not, because if they didn\u2019t then they wouldn\u2019t get the \u00a313.8m anyway. This silenced many Tories, because even they could understand that the logic of contingency planning based on a ferry company not delivering additional capacity was inherently flawed. But not Failing Grayling. He was on a roll. His one regret was that he hadn\u2019t awarded even more worthless contracts. The failure was complete. Grayling had yet again died on his feet. It\u2019s what he does. A kinder prime minister would have removed him long ago, but he serves a purpose in making others look less mediocre. So he lived to lose another day. Besides, he had a relaxing afternoon ahead flying his drone near Heathrow.",

We took these positions on the basis of the same long-term principles. Britain is a European nation by virtue of its geography and history. It shares enduring economic and cultural ties and values with the rest of Europe. Above all, Britain has a direct interest, born from the suffering of our peoples in decades of war, in the peace and harmony of Europe from which all can prosper. In the era of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, Britain\u2019s engagement in Europe is freshly urgent.</p> <p>However, the Guardian has never been an uncritical supporter of the EU. It has warned against the delusion of a United States of Europe. It has upheld the centrality of democratic nation states within the EU and stressed the enduring reality of national borders. It was enthusiastic about the epochal re-engagement between eastern and western Europe after the collapse of communism, but measured about the practicalities. It was critical about the reckless way that European monetary union was launched in the 1990s and, after much thought, preferred that Britain should keep its distance from the eurozone and its rules. These concerns have been vindicated by events.</p> <p>Although we opposed Brexit, it is essential to understand why a majority voted for it. Leave\u2019s victory cannot simply be dismissed as nostalgia for empire or dislike of foreigners, though these were factors. Many leave voters felt abandoned and unheard in an increasingly unequal Britain marked by vast wealth in parts of south-east England and austerity and post-industrial abandonment elsewhere. <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2016/whose-recovery\" title=\"\">Income levels</a> in London have risen by a third since the financial crash \u2013 but have dropped by 14% in Yorkshire and Humberside.</p> <p><strong>A cry for change</strong></p> <p>In June 2016 all this came together in the belief of a majority of voters that the EU did not offer the right solution to Britain\u2019s problems. Those of us who disagree need to show humility about what happened, respect the majority, understand the swirling dissatisfaction underlying it, and address it with sustained and practical answers. Ever since the referendum, the Guardian has tried to follow that approach in these columns. We accepted, without enthusiasm, that leave had won. We saw the vote as a cry for change. We hoped that Brexit would therefore be negotiated in the best way open to Mrs May\u2019s government. We took the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-now-is-the-time-to-change-course\" title=\"\">view</a> that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d would be the least bad outcome because it would prioritise jobs and the economy, maintain important links with the rest of Europe, not least in Ireland, and help to bind the wounds of 2016 by ensuring that the concerns of the 48% who voted to remain were taken into account alongside those of the 52% who voted to leave. If the government had produced something along these lines, there might have been a pragmatic consensus around a soft Brexit. We awaited Mrs May\u2019s detailed proposals. This was the fair approach. Yet the Brexit process fell vastly short. Ministers did not say what they wanted before invoking article 50. The government took a hard approach, not a soft one. Mrs May misread the public mood in the election of 2017. Her ministers proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/16/the-guardian-view-on-rexit-britain-clown-not-lion\" title=\"\">incompetent negotiators</a>. They were dismissive of parliament instead of seeking to build a majority there. Nothing substantial was done to address the social causes of the vote. The prime minister prioritised holding the Conservative party together over uniting the country \u2013 and failed in both. Her government was contemptuous of genuine concerns about everything from the economy to civil rights. It took little notice of Scotland and Wales. It failed to see that the DUP\u2019s sectarian interests in Ireland are a world away from the interests of Northern Ireland or modern Britain. Instead of producing a deal which could command a majority in the Commons, it produced one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/26/how-will-your-mp-vote-on-theresa-mays-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">doesn\u2019t even command a majority in the Tory party</a>.</p> <p><strong>Collective floundering</strong></p> <p>This outcome is not the fault of the remainers, the opposition parties or political elites. The government\u2019s failure is squarely its own responsibility. Brexit has never been a properly worked out policy prescription for Britain\u2019s problems. For many Tories, it is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/08/empire-fantasy-fuelling-tory-divisions-on-brexit\" title=\"\">attitude of mind</a>, an amorphous resentment against the modern world, foreigners, and Britain\u2019s loss of great-power status. This explains more than anything else why hardline Brexiters reject all compromise, refuse responsibility for the practical options, and continue to fantasise about a no-deal outcome which would make things far worse and hurt poor people most of all. It also explains why Mrs May\u2019s deal \u2013 which leaves almost everything about the future relationship with Europe up in the air for two more years \u2013 is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-mays-brexit-a-meaningless-deal-will-not-pass-a-meaningful-vote\" title=\"\">leap of faith</a>, and scarcely more acceptable than no deal at all.</p> <p>There has been a larger collective floundering across the political spectrum, including in Labour. We are living through a period of national democratic failure. We are deeply divided in many ways, not just over Brexit. Long-term comprehensive reform of Britain\u2019s concentrations of economic, social and political power is essential. Inequality must be tackled in a radical way, from the top as well as the bottom. There must be innovative, sustainable plans for towns, for the north, for the many areas that feel excluded from progress and success. There is no single magic answer to this national need. The past is no solution. That is partly why the Guardian has been and continues to be cautious about advocating a second referendum on Brexit as the solution to this wider failure of politics-as-usual. It may, in the end, be the only practical option facing MPs on Brexit. But badly framed referendums are a crude way of making democratic decisions, especially because referendums empower those who shout loudest.</p> <p>Parliament\u2019s role is crucial, but parliament is not perfect. Brexit has exposed the decrepit nature of our political system\u2019s hardware (its constitutional arrangements) as well as its software (the way we do politics). We need to open up to new forms of power and politics \u2013 better distributed, more diverse, more strongly integrated, and more modern. Parliamentary sovereignty needs to be better rooted in the people. Other forms of deliberative debate are essential buttresses of the parliamentary process. Ireland found a reasoned route through its own long and divisive argument over abortion through such a mechanism. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-a-brexit-citizens-assembly-the-peoples-voice-is-needed\" title=\"\">citizens\u2019 assembly</a> of voters \u2013 a representative group of voters selected at random \u2013 held a dignified and detailed civic conversation over several weekend sessions about the practical way forward. Its reasoned conclusions formed the basis of the proposal approved by the Irish people last May and passed into law last month. The contrast between this form of political dispute resolution and Britain\u2019s argument in and since 2016 is humbling. This lesson must be learned and applied in the reopening of the Brexit question.</p> <p><strong>Plausible alternatives</strong></p> <p>There is no outcome on the table this month that will not be divisive for years to come. That is true of a no-deal Brexit, which would be disastrous for the vast majority, especially younger people. It is true for Mrs May\u2019s deal, as it sets the terms of the UK\u2019s departure but not the nature of the future relationship with the EU, leaving the door open to more venomous debate. And it is true of a second referendum, because leave voters will fear that this is merely a device to rob them of their voice and restore a failed form of politics which has done little or nothing for them.</p> <p>No one creates division lightly. But divisions can be mitigated and rationally resolved in significant ways if the perils are recognised and the anxieties that underlie them are determinedly addressed. If Mrs May\u2019s deal is rejected, as it should be, Britain should pause the article 50 process and put Brexit on hold. Parliament should explicitly reject no-deal. MPs should then open up the debate to the country: first, by establishing a citizens\u2019 assembly to examine the <a href=\"https://livestream.com/accounts/5208398/events/8483723/videos/184676482\" title=\"\">options and issues</a> that face the nation; and second, by giving parliament the right, if it so chooses, to put these alternatives in a referendum this year or next. Such a vote should not be a repeat of 2016, but a choice between new options for Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe which are spelled out and which parliament can implement. This would require a set of clear and plausible alternatives, and the time and political support for the assembly to deliberate.

      "bodyText": "In their political intervention, the Russell Group and other university organisations are confusing the constitutionally damaging withdrawal agreement, which must be voted down, with the future partnership, which is yet to be agreed (Universities sector fears \u2018biggest threat\u2019 of no-deal exit, 4 January). British universities are the strongest and most attractive in Europe. With a clean sovereign Brexit, British universities get the best of both worlds. They escape the European commission\u2019s shackles imposed through the withdrawal agreement and, like other successful third-party countries (Israel, Norway and Switzerland, for example), can participate in EU programmes like Horizon 2020 at will. Now is the moment to tell the EU that the UK will be a close partner in academic research in the same way as 15 non-EU nation states are at present and that the UK will pay its way, as we did before. This is a win-win situation which does not require the UK to surrender sovereignty or accept destructive conditions. The idea that whole countries should be forced into political servitude in order to qualify for academic or scientific mutual exchange is ridiculous, illogical and completely without evidence. No country has ever had to accept this from the EU before. The first major act of the May government was to pledge to support a Swiss-style payment into mutual academic research programmes, which answers the Russell Group\u2019s funding complaints. In content and timing, the university organisations\u2019 letter to MPs has \u201cProject Fear\u201d Mark IV\u2019s fingerprints all over it. It should be seen for what it is and ignored.

He did not appear outside parliament and one of his fellow protesters said Goddard feared being arrested.</p> \n<p>The man said of Goddard: \u201cHe turned up about nine months ago.

He was among a group who disrupted a court hearing in the case in December.</p> \n<p>Much like their French counterparts, the UK yellow vest group are somewhat opaque about their aims beyond securing Brexit. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a member of any political party.

      "bodyText": "Such was the official fuss after \u201cyellow vest\u201d protesters harassed and verbally abused Anna Soubry outside parliament, that a day later the few activists who had turned up again were being so low key they had not even donned their trademark garments. \u201cThey\u2019re in that bag,\u201d said one man, who like all those present declined to be identified. \u201cWe\u2019ll put them on when there\u2019s more of us. The police are after all of us, so we\u2019ve got to be careful.\u201d With police having promised to respond to any future incidents, six police vans were parked opposite parliament and officers greatly outnumbered the men, some of whom identified themselves instead with union flag bobble hats. The outcry has followed weeks of intermittent action by a small, varying and semi-organised group, primarily men, who have borrowed the outfit and the tactics of France\u2019s much larger gilets jaunes movement to barrack MPs and journalists seen as opposing Brexit. In recent weeks they have also blocked Westminster Bridge, shouted sometimes sexist and racist abuse at TV crews, stormed into the offices of a radio station and the Labour party, and held small demonstrations in a series of cities. The most visible figure throughout has been James Goddard, a self-styled \u201cpolitical activist\u201d with close links to the far right and a background in making anti-Muslim comments, who solicits public donations to continue his activities. Goddard, who filmed an earlier targeting of Soubry in December in which he and a group of men called the Conservative MP a traitor and \u201con the side of Adolf Hitler\u201d, has routinely promoted himself by live-streaming his confrontations on Facebook. However, both of his Facebook pages disappeared on Tuesday \u2013 Goddard tweeted that the company had \u201csilenced\u201d him \u2013 and a link to his PayPal donations page also stopped working. He did not appear outside parliament and one of his fellow protesters said Goddard feared being arrested. The man said of Goddard: \u201cHe turned up about nine months ago. He\u2019s a new kid in town, a normal, working-class boy. Passionate. They claim he\u2019s our leader. But he\u2019s not our leader. There\u2019s no leader.\u201d According to the men, Goddard started his protests, like several other \u201cyellow vest\u201d members, in response to a conspiracy theory popular with anti-Muslim activists, connected to a case in which three teenage boys were killed by a driver in west London. The driver, Jaynesh Chudasama, was found to have been speeding, drunk, and under the influence of cannabis when he ran the boys over in January last year, and was jailed for 13 years. However, Goddard and other activists have claimed, without evidence, that the deaths were a terrorist attack covered up by police. He was among a group who disrupted a court hearing in the case in December. Much like their French counterparts, the UK yellow vest group are somewhat opaque about their aims beyond securing Brexit. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a member of any political party. It\u2019s about justice,\u201d one said. Another said he was uncomfortable about the incident on Monday in which Soubry was shouted at and abused as she walked back to parliament after a TV interview nearby. \u201cIt was a bit over the top, if you ask me,\u201d the man said. \u201cAll her \u2018I was being prevented from entering parliament\u2019 isn\u2019t true. But if I was her I wouldn\u2019t be happy with that sort of treatment. She was treated very harshly.\u201d On Tuesday evening, police on the parliamentary estate arrested a man as he tried to gain entry to the Palace of Westminster via Carriage Gates. Scotland Yard was not treating the incident, which happened at about 7.20pm, as terror-related. The man, who has not been named, was taken to a police station. The group Hope Not Hate, which monitors far-right activity, has alleged that the UK yellow vest protesters are linked to a new far-right group called the Liberty Defenders, which is supported by Nick Griffin, the former leader of the British National party. Hope Not Hate said activists were planning protests this weekend in Cardiff, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, and were thinking about targeting the offices of remain-voting Labour MPs. Nick Lowles, the head of Hope Not Hate, said that amid the Brexit process, \u201cthe threat from the far right is growing and the risk of disorder and violence is on the rise\u201d. He said: \u201cThe British far right are attempting to copy the French \u2018yellow vests\u2019 protests in order to stir up trouble and harass, threaten and attack their political opponents.\u201d While the protesters insist they were not linked to such views, Goddard in particular has been associated with the anti-Muslim activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, and shares similar views. Last year he spoke at a rally calling for the then-jailed Robinson to be freed from a prison sentence for contempt of court. Last June Goddard shared a picture on Twitter of himself posing with the leader of Ukip, Gerard Batten, who in November appointed Robinson as an adviser. Goddard has posted anti-Muslim messages on the social media site Gab, which is popular with far-right users. In one message he said: \u201cWherever Islam exists you will find murder and rape.\u201d In a video posted last year by Goddard he filmed himself castigating a young woman taking part in a pro-Palestine demonstration.

Appearing before the Commons defence select committee, Martyn Day called for independent investigators \u2013 rather than the Royal Military Police (RMP) \u2013 to look into serious allegations of abuse. Corporate manslaughter charges against the army might also be more appropriate, rather prosecuting individual soldiers, in the aftermath of military campaigns such as in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, he also proposed. Day, a prominent London solicitor, and his firm, Leigh Day, have twice been cleared of allegations of professional misconduct over the way they handled compensation claims against the Ministry of Defence over incidents in Iraq. The defence select committee is taking evidence on whether there should be a time limit to investigations into allegations of abuse or murder in the distant past. The MoD is also reviewing whether it can protect veterans from such claims. Day told the committee: \u201cI totally am of the view that, true in Iraq, true with Afghanistan, true with Northern Ireland, that there has to be a proper investigation to get to the bottom of what has happened for us as a society to learn the lessons from that and to move on.\u201d The most important issue, he said, was the quality of the initial investigations, which have been carried out in the past by the RMP. \u201cThey have to be seen to be independent and detailed,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the greatest failures in Iraq has been a failure of the RMP to obtain that,\u201d Day added, arguing that effective initial inquiries would prevent former soldiers from being subjected to lengthy and repeated re-investigations.

Chances are Brexit-bound Britain would come first followed by France after its <em>gilets jaunes</em> protests. Germany would come last.</p> <p>In fact, it is the eurozone\u2019s locomotive economy that is at biggest risk of fulfilling the technical definition of recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of falling output. After contracting by 0.2% in the third quarter, the latest news from Germany suggests it may have struggled to grow in the fourth quarter as well.</p> <p>News that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jan/08/german-slowdown-industrial-output-recession-fears-uk-house-prices-stock-markets-business-live\">German industrial production fell by 1.9% in November </a>came as a nasty shock. The stock response to the contraction in the third quarter was that it was due to the tightening up of European vehicle emission standards which led to one-off problems for its carmakers that would quickly be overcome.</p> <p>While the bounce-back has been delayed rather than cancelled, Europe\u2019s biggest economy faces significant headwinds. The growth spurt generated by monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank has run its course.</p> <p>The European commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator fell in every single month of 2018 and in December declines in all four of the eurozone\u2019s big four economies \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain. As Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics noted, the weakness cannot be put down to country-specific issues such as the gilets jaunes in France or sector-specific issues such as the disruption of the automotive sector.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/archive-zip/giv-3902cn95XSJ252yf/\" data-alt=\"world bank forecasts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/archive-zip/giv-3902cn95XSJ252yf/\">world bank forecasts</a> </figure>  <p>To make matters worse for Germany, the global economy is also slowing, making it harder for companies to pick up new export orders. Protectionism is not helping either. Donald Trump sees China as his No1 trade target, but Germany \u2013 with its colossal current account surplus \u2013 comes a close second.</p> <p>All of which brings a slightly different perspective to Britain\u2019s debate about Brexit, which currently seems to be based on three key propositions: that continental Europe is thriving; that Europe\u2019s politicians will come under no pressure to cut a deal from their big companies; and that Britain is well adrift at the bottom of Europe\u2019s economic league table.

Price-conscious consumers sit at home and do their shopping remotely, making life increasingly tough for traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions meant that in November online retail sales accounted for more than 20% of the market for the first time.</p> <p>But while consumers are increasingly likely to buy a shirt or the latest Booker prizewinner online, they are less likely to have their groceries delivered. While it may seem that the roads are choked with supermarket delivery vans, only 6% of food sales are made online and market penetration has stalled. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/08/uk-aldi-lidl-christmas-supermarkets-brexit\">Online spending in late 2018 was up by almost 4% on the previous year </a>but was entirely accounted for by existing rather than new customers.</p> <p>There are some obvious explanations for this. People can have a book left behind the recycling bin but have to be there in person for their food shop. Many of us like to size up the fruit and veg in person for fear we will be palmed off with bruised apples or over-ripe bananas. Not everybody is willing to pay to have their groceries delivered.</p> <p>But eventually, delivery slots will become shorter, policies for returned carrots will become as slick as they are for chinos, and consumers will realise that paying a fiver to avoid a schlep to the supermarkets is actually a good deal. Supermarkets are not immune from the online retail revolution. It will just take longer for food, that\u2019s all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Take Europe\u2019s three biggest economies and list them in order of the likelihood of being in recession in the second half of 2018. Chances are Brexit-bound Britain would come first followed by France after its gilets jaunes protests. Germany would come last. In fact, it is the eurozone\u2019s locomotive economy that is at biggest risk of fulfilling the technical definition of recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of falling output. After contracting by 0.2% in the third quarter, the latest news from Germany suggests it may have struggled to grow in the fourth quarter as well. News that German industrial production fell by 1.9% in November came as a nasty shock. The stock response to the contraction in the third quarter was that it was due to the tightening up of European vehicle emission standards which led to one-off problems for its carmakers that would quickly be overcome. While the bounce-back has been delayed rather than cancelled, Europe\u2019s biggest economy faces significant headwinds. The growth spurt generated by monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank has run its course. The European commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator fell in every single month of 2018 and in December declines in all four of the eurozone\u2019s big four economies \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain. As Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics noted, the weakness cannot be put down to country-specific issues such as the gilets jaunes in France or sector-specific issues such as the disruption of the automotive sector. To make matters worse for Germany, the global economy is also slowing, making it harder for companies to pick up new export orders. Protectionism is not helping either. Donald Trump sees China as his No1 trade target, but Germany \u2013 with its colossal current account surplus \u2013 comes a close second. All of which brings a slightly different perspective to Britain\u2019s debate about Brexit, which currently seems to be based on three key propositions: that continental Europe is thriving; that Europe\u2019s politicians will come under no pressure to cut a deal from their big companies; and that Britain is well adrift at the bottom of Europe\u2019s economic league table. All three are false. Supermarkets need time to deliver It\u2019s a familiar story. Price-conscious consumers sit at home and do their shopping remotely, making life increasingly tough for traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions meant that in November online retail sales accounted for more than 20% of the market for the first time. But while consumers are increasingly likely to buy a shirt or the latest Booker prizewinner online, they are less likely to have their groceries delivered. While it may seem that the roads are choked with supermarket delivery vans, only 6% of food sales are made online and market penetration has stalled. Online spending in late 2018 was up by almost 4% on the previous year but was entirely accounted for by existing rather than new customers. There are some obvious explanations for this. People can have a book left behind the recycling bin but have to be there in person for their food shop. Many of us like to size up the fruit and veg in person for fear we will be palmed off with bruised apples or over-ripe bananas. Not everybody is willing to pay to have their groceries delivered. But eventually, delivery slots will become shorter, policies for returned carrots will become as slick as they are for chinos, and consumers will realise that paying a fiver to avoid a schlep to the supermarkets is actually a good deal. Supermarkets are not immune from the online retail revolution. It will just take longer for food, that\u2019s all.",

Here are some highlights.</p> <h2><strong>Welt</strong><br></h2> <p>A terrifyingly named leather belt designed to stop us overeating. Once it detects expansion, the belt sends an alert to your phone \u2013 as if phones aren\u2019t already full of notifications of things we have neglected to do, or have done badly (see: emails). We\u2019re all black belts at ignoring screen nags. You know what would work better? A haptic feedback mechanism that physically restricted someone from eating as their stomach expanded. Sort of like \u2026 a belt.</p> <h2><strong>Home Brew</strong></h2> <p>LG\u2019s home beermaking machine ferments pale ales, stouts and pilsners with \u201clittle more than the touch of a button\u201d. Well, little more than a lot of time. The machine takes two weeks to make 10 pints. That\u2019s not really what we mean by \u201cat the touch of a button\u201d, is it?

It uses the same facial-recognition technology used to unlock smartphones, but to identify and open only for specific household animals, such as cats \u2013 those notoriously easy to train, machine-compliant sociopaths.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, the biggest tech event of the year, and a glance at this year\u2019s highlights confirm we are hurtling supersonically into a hi-tech future full of absolute McMuffins of uselessness. Here are some highlights. Welt A terrifyingly named leather belt designed to stop us overeating. Once it detects expansion, the belt sends an alert to your phone \u2013 as if phones aren\u2019t already full of notifications of things we have neglected to do, or have done badly (see: emails). We\u2019re all black belts at ignoring screen nags. You know what would work better? A haptic feedback mechanism that physically restricted someone from eating as their stomach expanded. Sort of like \u2026 a belt. Home Brew LG\u2019s home beermaking machine ferments pale ales, stouts and pilsners with \u201clittle more than the touch of a button\u201d. Well, little more than a lot of time. The machine takes two weeks to make 10 pints. That\u2019s not really what we mean by \u201cat the touch of a button\u201d, is it? That\u2019s like implying I can teleport to Acapulco by clicking the \u201cBuy now\u201d button on easyJet. Mookkie A spellcheck-defying, smart pet-food dispenser. It uses the same facial-recognition technology used to unlock smartphones, but to identify and open only for specific household animals, such as cats \u2013 those notoriously easy to train, machine-compliant sociopaths. Who\u2019s going to play guinea pig for this one? If a phone fails to unlock, we use a code instead. If this doesn\u2019t work, owners might return to a house of dead pets.

Addressing journalists in Guatemala City on Monday afternoon, Morales claimed the decision to eject members of the corruption-busting Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig) group was a result of its \u201csevere violation\u201d of national and international laws. \u201cCicig has put at risk the security of the nation, public order, governance, respect for human rights and above all the sovereignty of the state of Guatemala,\u201d the former television comic \u2013 who was elected partly thanks to a populist pledge to root out corruption \u2013 told reporters. However, regional specialists believe Morales\u2019s move \u2013 which follows a long-running effort to neuter the anti-crime initiative \u2013 is in fact intended to help corrupt members of Guatemala\u2019s ruling economic and political elite escape scrutiny. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving this is the fact that the person sitting in the president\u2019s office is himself corrupt and is surrounded by a series of other corrupt individuals for whom the Cicig represents an existential threat,\u201d said Jo-Marie Burt, a Guatemala expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group. Burt added: \u201cThe president has been investigated and accused by Cicig of illicit campaign contributions \u2026 he is backed by a corrupt business elite \u2013 and I think they are willing to go to any lengths to protect their interests and prevent themselves from being investigated and possibly going to jail.\u201d Mike Allison, a Central America specialist from the University of Scranton, agreed the move looked like an attempt \u201cto stop Cicig investigating the political and economic elite in the country, including Morales\u201d.

      "body": "<p>For four years from 1967 the economist Robert Neild, who has died aged 94, served as founding director of the <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/\" title=\"\">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a> (SIPRI).</p> <p>There he established a number of programmes that have had a long-lasting impact: <a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/yearbook\" title=\"\">the Yearbook on Armaments, Disarmament and International Security</a> (as it is now called), still an essential reference for anyone working in the field of arms regulation; research on the arms trade, including the construction of statistics on the trade in major weapons that continue to be widely used today; and research on chemical and biological warfare, which led directly to the conventions banning these types of weapons.</p> <p>He was also one of the pioneers of the concept of defensive defence \u2013 the idea that it was not necessary to engage in an arms race in order to protect the west effectively against the Soviet threat.</p> <p>This concept was taken up by Mikhail Gorbachev, who adopted a parallel concept of \u201creasonable sufficiency\u201d that allowed him to reduce military spending and to sign in 1987 the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/10/26/what-is-the-inf-treaty\" title=\"\">INF (intermediate-range nuclear forces)</a> treaty, and engage in negotiations for the <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaties-between-united-states-america-and-union-soviet-socialist-republics-strategic-offensive-reductions-start-i-start-ii/\" title=\"\">START (Strategic Arms Reduction)</a> treaty \u2013 a process that marked the beginning of the end of the cold war.</p> <p>Neild\u2019s approach to peace research involved painstaking empirical observation of the real world. \u201cFacts talk,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gunnar-Myrdal\" title=\"\">the eminent Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal</a>, SIPRI\u2019s first chairman.</p> <p>Neild had established this for himself during the second world war when he was invalided out of the RAF in 1944 and sent to work for operational research. \u201cThe beauty of operational research,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cwas that there was no established discipline; there were just problems to which anyone might contribute. Physicists, biologists and scientists from other disciplines were applying their minds to the problems of war.\u201d</p> <p>He was set to work collecting information on the sightings of U-boat snorkels with the aim of identifying a pattern of behaviour. He used the knitting needle system, the same system I used in constructing arms trade statistics when I worked for him at SIPRI.</p> <p>Each piece of information was put on an index card with a row of perforated holes at the top. You punched the top of a specific hole to demarcate a particular characteristic \u2013 say, a specific recipient or supplier of type of weapon. Then if you wanted to sort the data according to that characteristic you put a knitting needle through the relevant hole, and the cards you needed fell out. It is the same principle that underlies the digital databases we use today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/30/robert-neild-uk-balance-of-payments-crisis-no-deal-brexit\">As Robert Neild knew, politicians don\u2019t want wise advice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the war Neild was to apply this approach to real-world problem solving, initially in Geneva at the UN Economic Commission for Europe (1947-51), headed by Myrdal, where my father, <a href=\"https://policonomics.com/nicholas-kaldor/\" title=\"\">Nicholas Kaldor</a>, was research director. Neild edited the Economic Survey of Europe, compiling information on industrial production, trade and inflation at a time when there were very few statistics, and on the same principle of setting aside preconceptions as much as possible.</p> <p>In a similar vein, he edited the Quarterly Economic Review at the start of his time with the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (1958-64), and while economic adviser to the Treasury (1964-67) <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5922bf08-0abd-11e9-9fe8-acdb36967cfc\" title=\"\">he initiated a survey of social trends</a>, discontinued by the Conservative government in 2010.</p> <p>In later years he continued to apply his mind to practical problems. He loved oysters and puzzled over why oysters are so scarce in Britain and so abundant in France. With The English, the French and the Oyster (1995), he won the Andr\u00e9 Simon prize for food writing. In it, he argued that Britain applied laissez-faire strategies and allowed oysters to be fished to extinction, while France applied planning methods and protected the oyster beds.</p> <p>He also studied the problems of public corruption, starting from the premise that corruption is the norm and the puzzle is how to explain those places where corruption has been largely eliminated. And, as steward of Trinity College, Cambridge, he pored over bursary files in order to discover how the building of Trinity was financed and how it determined the type of stone used or the shape and scale of different buildings and quads.</p> <p>Born in Peterborough and brought up in Letchmore Heath, Hertfordshire, Robert was a twin, and one of three children of Quaker parents, Ralph Neild, an Indian civil servant turned lawyer, and his wife, Josephine, the daughter of J Allen Baker, a Quaker industrialist and MP. Robert was much influenced by his uncle Philip Noel-Baker, a passionate peace activist <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1959/noel-baker/biographical/\" title=\"\">who won the Nobel peace prize</a>.</p> <p>From Charterhouse school in Godalming, Surrey, he went to Trinity to study on a short course, joining the RAF in 1943. He returned in 1945 to complete his economics degree in two years, and was taught by the brilliant Marxist economist <a href=\"https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sraffa.htm\" title=\"\">Piero Sraffa</a>. He witnessed at first hand the devastation of war both as a consequence of his time in Germany working for operational research and a journey across Europe by car through Yugoslavia to Greece, which he made with his cousin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/01/francis-noel-baker-obituary\" title=\"\">Francis Noel-Baker</a>, as an undergraduate.</p> <p>In the 1950s and 60s he gave policy advice to the Labour party and even attempted to become a parliamentary candidate. His first stint at the Treasury (1951-56) was followed by his first as a fellow of Trinity and a lecturer (1956-58); when he returned to the college, it was as professor of economics at the university (1971-84). But he much preferred research to teaching and he found his last years as professor deeply disappointing, as abstract mathematical modelling took over the discipline. \u201cMy earth-bound approach,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas out of fashion.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/30/robert-neild-uk-balance-of-payments-crisis-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">But it is much needed now</a>.</p> <p>His marriage to Nora Sayre in 1957 ended in divorce four years later. In 1962 he married Elizabeth Griffiths, and they had a son and four daughters. They divorced in 1986, and in 2004 he married Virginia Matheson.

      "bodyText": "For four years from 1967 the economist Robert Neild, who has died aged 94, served as founding director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). There he established a number of programmes that have had a long-lasting impact: the Yearbook on Armaments, Disarmament and International Security (as it is now called), still an essential reference for anyone working in the field of arms regulation; research on the arms trade, including the construction of statistics on the trade in major weapons that continue to be widely used today; and research on chemical and biological warfare, which led directly to the conventions banning these types of weapons. He was also one of the pioneers of the concept of defensive defence \u2013 the idea that it was not necessary to engage in an arms race in order to protect the west effectively against the Soviet threat. This concept was taken up by Mikhail Gorbachev, who adopted a parallel concept of \u201creasonable sufficiency\u201d that allowed him to reduce military spending and to sign in 1987 the INF (intermediate-range nuclear forces) treaty, and engage in negotiations for the START (Strategic Arms Reduction) treaty \u2013 a process that marked the beginning of the end of the cold war. Neild\u2019s approach to peace research involved painstaking empirical observation of the real world. \u201cFacts talk,\u201d said the eminent Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal, SIPRI\u2019s first chairman. Neild had established this for himself during the second world war when he was invalided out of the RAF in 1944 and sent to work for operational research. \u201cThe beauty of operational research,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cwas that there was no established discipline; there were just problems to which anyone might contribute. Physicists, biologists and scientists from other disciplines were applying their minds to the problems of war.\u201d He was set to work collecting information on the sightings of U-boat snorkels with the aim of identifying a pattern of behaviour. He used the knitting needle system, the same system I used in constructing arms trade statistics when I worked for him at SIPRI. Each piece of information was put on an index card with a row of perforated holes at the top. You punched the top of a specific hole to demarcate a particular characteristic \u2013 say, a specific recipient or supplier of type of weapon. Then if you wanted to sort the data according to that characteristic you put a knitting needle through the relevant hole, and the cards you needed fell out. It is the same principle that underlies the digital databases we use today. After the war Neild was to apply this approach to real-world problem solving, initially in Geneva at the UN Economic Commission for Europe (1947-51), headed by Myrdal, where my father, Nicholas Kaldor, was research director. Neild edited the Economic Survey of Europe, compiling information on industrial production, trade and inflation at a time when there were very few statistics, and on the same principle of setting aside preconceptions as much as possible. In a similar vein, he edited the Quarterly Economic Review at the start of his time with the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (1958-64), and while economic adviser to the Treasury (1964-67) he initiated a survey of social trends, discontinued by the Conservative government in 2010. In later years he continued to apply his mind to practical problems. He loved oysters and puzzled over why oysters are so scarce in Britain and so abundant in France. With The English, the French and the Oyster (1995), he won the Andr\u00e9 Simon prize for food writing. In it, he argued that Britain applied laissez-faire strategies and allowed oysters to be fished to extinction, while France applied planning methods and protected the oyster beds. He also studied the problems of public corruption, starting from the premise that corruption is the norm and the puzzle is how to explain those places where corruption has been largely eliminated. And, as steward of Trinity College, Cambridge, he pored over bursary files in order to discover how the building of Trinity was financed and how it determined the type of stone used or the shape and scale of different buildings and quads. Born in Peterborough and brought up in Letchmore Heath, Hertfordshire, Robert was a twin, and one of three children of Quaker parents, Ralph Neild, an Indian civil servant turned lawyer, and his wife, Josephine, the daughter of J Allen Baker, a Quaker industrialist and MP. Robert was much influenced by his uncle Philip Noel-Baker, a passionate peace activist who won the Nobel peace prize. From Charterhouse school in Godalming, Surrey, he went to Trinity to study on a short course, joining the RAF in 1943. He returned in 1945 to complete his economics degree in two years, and was taught by the brilliant Marxist economist Piero Sraffa. He witnessed at first hand the devastation of war both as a consequence of his time in Germany working for operational research and a journey across Europe by car through Yugoslavia to Greece, which he made with his cousin Francis Noel-Baker, as an undergraduate. In the 1950s and 60s he gave policy advice to the Labour party and even attempted to become a parliamentary candidate. His first stint at the Treasury (1951-56) was followed by his first as a fellow of Trinity and a lecturer (1956-58); when he returned to the college, it was as professor of economics at the university (1971-84). But he much preferred research to teaching and he found his last years as professor deeply disappointing, as abstract mathematical modelling took over the discipline. \u201cMy earth-bound approach,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas out of fashion.\u201d But it is much needed now. His marriage to Nora Sayre in 1957 ended in divorce four years later. In 1962 he married Elizabeth Griffiths, and they had a son and four daughters. They divorced in 1986, and in 2004 he married Virginia Matheson. She, his children and his twin sister, Barbara, survive him. \u2022 Robert Ralph Neild, economist, born 10 September 1924; died 18 December 2018",

Against this shift in shoppers\u2019 behaviour, all major supermarket chains lost market share in the 12 weeks to 30 December, according to the grocery market analyst Kantar Worldpanel. In its latest update, John Lewis said sales were up 11.2% last week as shoppers hunted for bargains in the final days of its end-of-season sale. The employee-owned retailer experienced big swings in trade during November and December, but finished the year strongly with four weeks of sales that were ahead of Christmas 2017 levels. Jon Williams, John Lewis\u2019s director of merchandising operations, said fashion sales rose 20% last week.

The complainant asked for a break in her testimony when she became tearful during questioning on behalf of the Worcestershire all-rounder Alex Hepburn. Hepburn, 23, denies raping the woman, who told the court she was initially asleep and wrongly thought she was having sex with the former Worcestershire batsman Joe Clarke. A jury at Worcester crown court has been told Hepburn and Clarke were involved in a sexual conquest \u201cgame\u201d, after setting up a \u201cstat chat\u201d page to keep a record of sex with women. During her evidence on the second day of the trial, the alleged victim rejected a suggestion that her memory of her initial sexual contact with Hepburn was \u201cnot completely clear\u201d. Hepburn\u2019s barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, asked the woman whether she was \u201cfairly drunk\u201d after drinking wine, prosecco and spirits during a night out prior to the alleged rape in April 2017.

      "bodyText": "Canadian police have arrested 14 demonstrators at an indigenous protest camp in northern British Columbia, amid growing tensions over a proposed pipeline running through First Nations territory. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada\u2019s national police force, said 14 people had been arrested late on Monday as officers enforced a court order to remove barriers built along a logging road. Indigenous groups are fighting the construction of a 670km (416 miles) liquified natural gas pipeline, Coastal GasLink, which would cross through Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory. On 14 December, a provincial court granted an injunction to TransCanada \u2013 the company constructing the pipeline \u2013 in order to give them access to the construction site. In response, protesters set up the Gitimd\u2019en checkpoint to block energy company TransCanada from accessing the planned site of construction. Dozens of demonstrators have camped for weeks, braving heavy snow and temperatures that have dipped to -15C (5F). The Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en, made up of five clans, never signed a treaty ceding their land to the government of Canada, and retain control of who enters it. And although elected First Nations officials have signed deals with TransCanada, hereditary chiefs of the area have voiced opposition to the pipeline project. \u201cForces marching toward gate on Gitumt\u2019en, they are starting to breach, they are armed,\u201d said the protesters\u2019 Twitter account. The Unist\u2019ot\u2019en are one of the clans in the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation, along with the Gidimt\u2019en. Videos posted to social media showed police \u2013 some in green fatigues with military-style weapons \u2013 arresting demonstrators. At least a dozen police vehicles were present, as well as a helicopter and river boats, according to people at the scene. A number of demonstrators retreated back along the logging roads, in the direction of the nearby Unist\u2019ot\u2019en Camp. Police have set up an \u201cexclusionary zone\u201d to prevent access to the area \u2013 and have told those trying to access the roads they face arrest if they attempt to enter. Organizers believe the police are headed for Unist\u2019ot\u2019en Camp, members of which are listed in the court injunction. \u201cNow going into prayer,\u201d the camp tweeted after police cleared the Gitimd\u2019en checkpoint. TransCanada has previously said it has no intention of dismantling the camp \u2013 which is in the path of the proposed pipeline \u2013 but just wants access to the site for construction. Unist\u2019ot\u2019en Camp, established on the site of a previous 2009 protest camp, has developed into a much larger facility, with a number of buildings, including a healing lodge, as well as full-time inhabitants. Rallies in solidarity with the protesters are planned in cities across the country for Tuesday. Perry Bellegarde, the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, tweeted: \u201cEveryone has the right to peaceful assembly and protest. This must be respected.

Or, indeed, to fellow protagonist Marianne\u2019s sense that \u201cher real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn\u2019t know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHysterical realism\u201d was the name the critic James Wood once gave to the mid-2000s boom of novels ostensibly deliberately setting out to capture the moment.

But what Rooney does differently from Ian McEwan\u2019s Saturday (the Iraq war) or Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth (multiculturalism and globalisation) is to ensure it never feels like a lesson.</p> <p>The most compelling question the novel poses is, simply: will Marianne and Connell eventually be happy? In one scene in Normal People, Connell is so engrossed by Jane Austen\u2019s Emma that he loses track of time and, leaving the library, he marvels: \u201cIt feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is: literature moves him.\u201d There it is.</p>",

Or, indeed, to fellow protagonist Marianne\u2019s sense that \u201cher real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn\u2019t know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it\u201d. \u201cHysterical realism\u201d was the name the critic James Wood once gave to the mid-2000s boom of novels ostensibly deliberately setting out to capture the moment. He was not a fan of novels he saw as overstuffed with symbolism and real world events. But what Rooney does differently from Ian McEwan\u2019s Saturday (the Iraq war) or Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth (multiculturalism and globalisation) is to ensure it never feels like a lesson. The most compelling question the novel poses is, simply: will Marianne and Connell eventually be happy? In one scene in Normal People, Connell is so engrossed by Jane Austen\u2019s Emma that he loses track of time and, leaving the library, he marvels: \u201cIt feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is: literature moves him.\u201d There it is.",

Undeniably, Marne is the boss of his own story. That is significant: after centuries of being written about, Indigenous people are staking a claim to subjectivity and ownership of story. Born in 1922 on his Bigambul country in southern Queensland, Marne is a highly regarded elder in the Aboriginal communities of greater western Sydney \u2013 a region with a high concentration, and growing population, of Indigenous people.

That doesn\u2019t mean people haven\u2019t tried to share their own stories. Over the past two decades, there has been a wave of first-person storytelling in the form of life writing, with small independent publishers such as the Aboriginal-owned Magabala Books and the UQP imprint Black Australian Writers fostering a \u201cnew\u201d Indigenous literature. Follow The Rabbit Proof Fence by the late Doris Pilkington Garimara bridged the gulf of national forgetfulness and denial in a universal story of homecoming. Speaking to a Fairfax Media journalist in 2002, Pilkington concluded that \u201cthis forgetting, the absence of memory\u201d was one of the biggest legacies of the stolen generations.

Prof Jamie Seymour from James Cook University said the density of Irukandji, a species of box jellyfish, and the rate of stings had been steadily growing in southern Queensland as sea waters warmed. \u201cWe published a paper some years back looking at Irukandji syndrome in Queensland and we had a look at the number of stings,\u201d he said. \u201cFifty years ago the southernmost sting for Irukandji was in the Whitsundays, and now the southernmost sting is Mooloolaba beach. And if you look at the number of stings at Fraser Island, they are steadily increasing. More and more animals are getting down there. \u201cLifesavers down there are dragging them up very easily.\u201d The tropical box jellyfish likes to live in water temperatures higher than 29C and are normally found in the northern tropics. There have been two confirmed Irukandji deaths in Australia but the mysterious deaths of at least three tourists have been linked to the jellyfish. Seymour said Irukandji would inevitably move further south if waters continued to warm. \u201cWe know the temperature they prefer, and what we need is the data of where those water temperatures will occur,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it will be 29C for two months on the Gold Coast in three years\u2019 time, I can tell you there will be Irukandji down there. \u201cIn Queensland alone, we put more people in hospital due to Irukandji stings than shark attacks, crocodile attacks and snake bites combined. This is something that we need to address now. I can see a time when we have to shut major beaches on the Sunshine Coast. It is going to happen.\u201d He added that the current spate of stings at Fraser Island was due to \u201ca perfect storm\u201d of conditions: warmer water, more Irukandji and more people in the ocean during the Christmas holidays. \u201cYou have hot water down there which is 29 or 30C, which is unheard of,\u201d he said. \u201cThe animals love that sort of thing. The people being stung are on the western side of Fraser Island, where it is nice and calm, and this has coincided with the Christmas break where you have more people in the water.\u201d Another marine biologist, Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin, said that some swimmers could even be encountering a rare, giant species of bluebottle that was only spotted every \u201c10 to 30 years\u201d. However, she said it was very rare, and a spokesman for Surf Life Saving Queensland said lifesavers had not reported seeing the larger bluebottle. Gershwin has written on her website that climate change and warmer water was likely to lead to increased jellyfish populations. But she told the ABC this week that it was \u201cnothing new\u201d that Irukandji were found at Fraser Island. \u201cWe\u2019ve found them south of Fraser Island for more than 100 years,\u201d she said. Seymour said that it was possible for larger bluebottles to inflict Irukandji syndrome because jellyfish venom changed with age and size. \u201cWe know that bluebottles under some circumstances give rise to Irukandji syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears they have a different venom when they are small than when they are large. This is not unknown in jellyfish \u2013 their venom changes as they age.\u201d",

The legal year proper ends in the Australian Capital Territory after the last sitting day, 20 December. The ACT magistrates court, where the Collaery case is being heard, does not sit between December 20 and 9 January 2019, aside from bail and emergency care hearings. The handling of the brief has prompted crossbench senator Rex Patrick, a staunch supporter of Collaery, to accuse commonwealth prosecutors of breaching their obligations to act fairly. Patrick said Collaery\u2019s lawyers were required to respond to the brief within seven days \u2013 a claim denied by the federal government. \u201cThe commonwealth and its lawyers are bound to maintain the highest standards of probity and fair dealing with litigants,\u201d Patrick told Guardian Australia. \u201cServing documents on the last working day of the year that, by order of a court, must be responded to within seven days does not meet the high standards and fairness test.\u201d Patrick said he would be raising the matter with the attorney general.

Although we love the coast, we love only a very specific kind of coast: golden sandy beaches and deep blue bays. Shallow seas over vast mudflats don\u2019t catch our imagination, or our hearts, regardless of how rich the ecosystem of invertebrates and birds they sustain is. But the threats that eastern curlews are facing right now demand that we re-assess what we value. For all of its extraordinary feats and attributes, the most extraordinary thing about the eastern curlew is that it isn\u2019t so extraordinary after all: every one of those hundred-odd species of migratory shorebird worldwide is living the same lifestyle, yo-yoing thousands of kilometres twice a year between the far north and points south. The reason there are so many species of shorebirds is that each has evolved to feed in a slightly different niche, on slightly different prey. Each shorebird will return to the same feeding grounds year after year: when you lead such a risky life, you can\u2019t leave anything to chance. You stick to what you know. If the mudflats that sustain eastern curlews are destroyed, so too are mudflats that sustains whimbrels, and terek sandpipers, and bar-tailed godwits, and any of dozens of other species. Thanks to our own actions a world of awe-inspiring animals \u2013 animals that have amazed scientists and artists and bird-lovers for countless generations \u2013 is vanishing. But if we preserve their habitat, if we learn to share the coast, if we learn to love mudflats \u2013 it won\u2019t be just the eastern curlew that benefits. \u2022 Harry Saddler is the author of The Eastern Curlew, which has just been published by Affirm Press",

      "body": "<p>The artist Wendy Ramshaw, who has died aged 79, was best known for the jewellery she designed, and first gained widespread acclaim for in 1970 with a solo exhibition at the Pace Gallery in London. She presented sets of several complementary gold rings, some with semi-precious stones, establishing a signature vocabulary that she continued to develop in different directions for many years.</p> <p>When the rings were displayed on a support, they constituted a unified sculptural object. When the wearer detached the rings, they could be deployed on the hand in a variety of configurations.

      "bodyText": "The artist Wendy Ramshaw, who has died aged 79, was best known for the jewellery she designed, and first gained widespread acclaim for in 1970 with a solo exhibition at the Pace Gallery in London. She presented sets of several complementary gold rings, some with semi-precious stones, establishing a signature vocabulary that she continued to develop in different directions for many years. When the rings were displayed on a support, they constituted a unified sculptural object. When the wearer detached the rings, they could be deployed on the hand in a variety of configurations. As Ramshaw put it: \u201cMost of my jewellery is made in parts or sections, so that the owner can share in the way the piece is worn.\u201d She pushed the boundaries of jewellery, sculpture, installation and design, working in materials that ranged from precious stones and metals to paper, plastic, porcelain and glass. While a critical, deconstructive approach to the making of jewellery and other aesthetic objects became common after the second world war, Ramshaw was a particular pioneer in this field.

When the attraction of money adds to hatred and violence, I feel only disgust.\u201d Police unions warned that the fundraising legitimised violence against police. S\u00e9bastien Chenu, an MP for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party, said that the donations were \u201ca barometer of the hatred for the government\u201d before adding that he condemned all violence. The gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement \u2013 named after the hi-vis jackets worn by protesters \u2013 began in November as a revolt against the imposition of a fuel tax, but has morphed into a nationwide movement against the government and the pro-business, centrist Macron, who is accused of favouring the rich and maintaining an unfair tax system.",

Perhaps sensing my scepticism, Karine says they were surprised, too, but that they have had some very positive responses.</p> <p>Not everyone approves of bringing Romanian strays to Britain. Paula Boyden, veterinary director of the <a href=\"https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Dogs Trust,</a> the UK\u2019s largest dog charity, says there are diseases in mainland Europe that we don\u2019t have in the UK. With the pet passport scheme, a dog coming from any EU member state has to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies and tapeworm. That is to protect humans, but there are plenty of doggy diseases that aren\u2019t protected against, and she mentions a few scary-sounding ones: babesiosis, which is tick-borne; ehrlichiosis, which affects platelet cells; a heart worm called <em>Dirofilaria immitis</em>; and leishmaniasis, which is incurable and can potentially affect humans. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge worry because we really don\u2019t want those diseases in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The Dogs Trust gets 30,000 calls a year from people wanting to relinquish animals. \u201cI would encourage anyone thinking about getting a rescue dog to please consider a UK rescue organisation first,\u201d says Boyden. \u201cIf you have been refused, think carefully about why. Think about the challenges of getting a dog from overseas, particularly if you have never met it, from a behaviour perspective, and the disease side as well.\u201d On the behaviour side, she says that many of the street dogs will have been free-roaming, used to making their own choices, and that taking those choices away by putting them into a British domestic environment can increase their stress levels. She mentions a dog from Romania in the charity\u2019s care that was given up for those reasons. \u201cThat dog has certain challenges; it\u2019s not in a position to be rehomed at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>For humans, it\u2019s not easy getting accepted by the Dogs Trust. Alison Coussins describes it as \u201clike trying to get your child into some expensive private school\u201d, before adding: \u201cNot that I\u2019d ever do that.\u201d When her previous dog died, she knew that \u2013 being in full-time work \u2013 she would have problems obtaining a dog from a UK rescue organisation. So she got one from \u2026 Romania, obviously. Via Croydon.</p> <p>Suki, who came from a smaller organisation than Love Underdogs, is mostly collie, \u201clike a black-and-white Basil Brush\u201d says Coussins, who had no problem falling in love. They went for a walk. Suki seemed a little skittish, but Coussins, who had been checked and approved, could see no reason not to adopt her, and so she did, \u201cbased on almost no knowledge, which in hindsight might have been foolhardy\u201d.</p> <p>The problems started when she brought Suki back to her home, which Suki began to defend, ferociously. Anyone who visited was barked at, nipped or bitten \u2013 friends, relatives, the dog walker, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u2026 Coussins had to cancel her holiday to the Caribbean. As well as working for the housing ombudsman, she is also a magistrate. \u201cSo I\u2019m keenly aware of things like dangerous dogs. I didn\u2019t want to be up before myself,\u201d she jokes.</p> <p>Suki, and her owner, needed help. The vet put Suki on fluoxetine (AKA Prozac). Coussins called in pet behaviour counsellor Ingrid Haskal, who came, assessed, reinforced the good behaviour, ignored the bad stuff. And then billed (it hasn\u2019t been cheap, sorting Suki).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There are no guarantees with behaviour, because you\u2019re working with a living animal</p> <footer> <cite>Ingrid Haskal</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Haskal agrees that adopting rescue dogs from Romania has its risks. You know nothing of their backgrounds. They have probably been wandering the streets, abandoned. They may be aggressive towards other people, other dogs, terrified of going outside, or scared of the world in general. \u201cAlso, you have to consider the fact that every dog is an individual: some may be able to cope with change better than other dogs, in exactly the same way as people.\u201d</p> <p>People often get Romanian rescue dogs because they have had their heartstrings pulled, says she adds. \u201cYou go on the internet, you go, \u2018Ooh, look at the poor dog in a kennel in Romania or whatever \u2013 we\u2019ll rescue it.\u2019\u201d And this could be their first dog. \u201cSo you get first-time dog owners with a dog that has got a lot of behavioural issues, and they can\u2019t cope. A lot of people who have had dogs for years will get a dog they can\u2019t cope with, but if you\u2019re a first-time dog owner, that\u2019s quite scary, particularly if the dog is aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>Haskal admits that she sees the difficult cases, and that there are plenty of adorable, happy Romanian rescue dogs, but she would warn against such adoption for first-time owners. \u201cIf you\u2019re an experienced dog owner who knows what you\u2019re letting yourself in for and are prepared to do a lot of behavioural work, with a professional if needs be, then yes, fine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a bicycle with a flat tyre we can fix. There are no guarantees with behaviour because you\u2019re working with a living animal.\u201d</p> <p>Her grandfather came from Romania, and Haskal says she really upset one person when she said there were enough rescue dogs in the country without bringing any more in. \u201cShe accused me of being one of the same people who are anti-immigration, and I can understand her viewpoint.\u201d</p> <p>Suki has responded well to the treatment, and Coussins finds it impossible to regret adopting her. \u201cI used to work with refugees and with homeless people, and it just reflects what I\u2019ve done with humans. To be honest, it doesn\u2019t matter if you rescue a dog from Romania or Hammersmith.\u201d</p> <p>She does say you should find out as much as you can. \u201cThink of as many questions as possible and be prepared for a very serious commitment.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/04/russia-killing-stray-dogs-world-cup-fifa\">Russia is killing stray dogs.

But one that can be worthwhile. \u201cThese dogs are different,\u201d says Karine. \u201cThey are much more mature and complex than your normal pooch, and you need a different understanding of them. English dogs go as a puppy to a home; they have not had to deal with survival. Our guys are generations of survivors: they\u2019re complex, independent, free spirits.

She mentions a dog from Romania in the charity\u2019s care that was given up for those reasons. \u201cThat dog has certain challenges; it\u2019s not in a position to be rehomed at the moment.\u201d For humans, it\u2019s not easy getting accepted by the Dogs Trust. Alison Coussins describes it as \u201clike trying to get your child into some expensive private school\u201d, before adding: \u201cNot that I\u2019d ever do that.\u201d When her previous dog died, she knew that \u2013 being in full-time work \u2013 she would have problems obtaining a dog from a UK rescue organisation. So she got one from \u2026 Romania, obviously. Via Croydon. Suki, who came from a smaller organisation than Love Underdogs, is mostly collie, \u201clike a black-and-white Basil Brush\u201d says Coussins, who had no problem falling in love. They went for a walk. Suki seemed a little skittish, but Coussins, who had been checked and approved, could see no reason not to adopt her, and so she did, \u201cbased on almost no knowledge, which in hindsight might have been foolhardy\u201d. The problems started when she brought Suki back to her home, which Suki began to defend, ferociously. Anyone who visited was barked at, nipped or bitten \u2013 friends, relatives, the dog walker, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u2026 Coussins had to cancel her holiday to the Caribbean. As well as working for the housing ombudsman, she is also a magistrate. \u201cSo I\u2019m keenly aware of things like dangerous dogs. I didn\u2019t want to be up before myself,\u201d she jokes. Suki, and her owner, needed help. The vet put Suki on fluoxetine (AKA Prozac). Coussins called in pet behaviour counsellor Ingrid Haskal, who came, assessed, reinforced the good behaviour, ignored the bad stuff. And then billed (it hasn\u2019t been cheap, sorting Suki). Haskal agrees that adopting rescue dogs from Romania has its risks. You know nothing of their backgrounds. They have probably been wandering the streets, abandoned. They may be aggressive towards other people, other dogs, terrified of going outside, or scared of the world in general. \u201cAlso, you have to consider the fact that every dog is an individual: some may be able to cope with change better than other dogs, in exactly the same way as people.\u201d People often get Romanian rescue dogs because they have had their heartstrings pulled, says she adds. \u201cYou go on the internet, you go, \u2018Ooh, look at the poor dog in a kennel in Romania or whatever \u2013 we\u2019ll rescue it.\u2019\u201d And this could be their first dog. \u201cSo you get first-time dog owners with a dog that has got a lot of behavioural issues, and they can\u2019t cope. A lot of people who have had dogs for years will get a dog they can\u2019t cope with, but if you\u2019re a first-time dog owner, that\u2019s quite scary, particularly if the dog is aggressive.\u201d Haskal admits that she sees the difficult cases, and that there are plenty of adorable, happy Romanian rescue dogs, but she would warn against such adoption for first-time owners. \u201cIf you\u2019re an experienced dog owner who knows what you\u2019re letting yourself in for and are prepared to do a lot of behavioural work, with a professional if needs be, then yes, fine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a bicycle with a flat tyre we can fix. There are no guarantees with behaviour because you\u2019re working with a living animal.\u201d Her grandfather came from Romania, and Haskal says she really upset one person when she said there were enough rescue dogs in the country without bringing any more in. \u201cShe accused me of being one of the same people who are anti-immigration, and I can understand her viewpoint.\u201d Suki has responded well to the treatment, and Coussins finds it impossible to regret adopting her. \u201cI used to work with refugees and with homeless people, and it just reflects what I\u2019ve done with humans. To be honest, it doesn\u2019t matter if you rescue a dog from Romania or Hammersmith.\u201d She does say you should find out as much as you can. \u201cThink of as many questions as possible and be prepared for a very serious commitment.\u201d In Waltham Abbey, the Hauser sisters know it\u2019s a commitment. But one that can be worthwhile. \u201cThese dogs are different,\u201d says Karine. \u201cThey are much more mature and complex than your normal pooch, and you need a different understanding of them. English dogs go as a puppy to a home; they have not had to deal with survival. Our guys are generations of survivors: they\u2019re complex, independent, free spirits. An English dog is more of a pet and a child; a Romanian dog is a companion and a friend.\u201d And there\u2019s good news for one friend. Three-legged Tommy Lee has a home to go to. The family that have adopted him are volunteers at Love Underdogs. They have another rescue dog, and they\u2019ve had Tommy Lee home for weekends: it\u2019s going to work. Eskimo Joe? Still waiting, I\u2019m afraid. Maybe for you \u2026",

During what was essentially his job interview, Brett Kavanaugh also probably committed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorLeahy/status/1047967622594285568\">perjury</a>, then taunted, disrespected, raged against and accused some US senators of being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/politics/read-brett-kavanaughs-complete-opening-statement.html?module=inline\">conspirators out to destroy him</a> \u2013 and, despite all of that, he <em>still</em> got the job.</p> <p>Even worse, although chief justice John Roberts tasked the 10th circuit with reviewing the numerous charges of misconduct against Kavanaugh, the judges concluded that while the allegations were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/18/dozens-of-complaints-against-brett-kavanaugh-dismissed.html\">serious</a>\u201d, they didn\u2019t have the authority to go further because Kavanaugh was now a supreme court justice.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s gut-check time. With each guilty plea, each indictment, each tweet, it becomes evident that Donald Trump is not the legitimate president of the United States. He was hoisted into the White House by at least one foreign power to whom he and his regime are now beholden. Trump\u2019s domestic and international policies, such as an ill-conceived tariff war with China, unplanned troop withdrawals from Syria, and US abdication from key international treaties, reflect a White House that has been captured and is implementing the chaos policies that Vladimir Putin wanted. The big question for 2019, however, is \u201cWhat are Americans going to do about it?\u201d Impeachment will not be sufficient. Nor will a deal where Trump simply resigns and hands over the reins to Vice-President Mike Pence, who was handpicked by now-convicted felon Paul Manafort (guilty of conspiracy against the United States), and, who, as head of the transition team, overlooked the numerous warnings about Michael Flynn as a national security risk. The problem, frankly, isn\u2019t simply Donald Trump. He has been aided by a coterie of enablers, who have exploited the fissures, flaws, norms and loopholes in American democracy that allowed the unscrupulous to prosper at the expense of the people and the nation itself. Removing Trump, while essential, will not fully address the work that needs to be done. Instead, it is going to take an effort akin to Hercules cleaning out the Augean stables to repair, rebuild and strengthen America. And the first step is to understand what went wrong. Dark money and white supremacy fueled the disintegration of the Republican party. Without any viable core ideology to act as a lodestar, especially one that would resonate with the majority of Americans, the Republicans\u2019 only raison d\u2019etre now was power. Unable to win elections outright as they had in the past, the Republican party resorted, instead, to voter suppression, election fraud, cancelling elections and lame-duck electoral nihilism. In doing so, the Republicans not only deliberately undercut democracy but showed their utter contempt for it. Unfortunately, that disdain could not be isolated or quarantined. Instead, it metastasized and wreaked havoc on the constitutional necessity of checks and balances, including the crucial role of the Senate to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d. Far too many nominees for the federal bench and US supreme court as well as cabinet officials either lacked the minimum qualifications for the position or had an abundance of ethical issues that bordered on the criminal. Yet, with no rubric other than power, the Republican-dominated Senate confirmed most of them by subverting the process and ignoring evidence of incompetence or wrongdoing. This was, of course, most striking in the supreme court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh. Although 93% of his papers were still unavailable to the Senate judiciary committee, the Republicans, led by Senator Chuck Grassley, crafted an unreasonably accelerated confirmation timeline. The Republican senators glossed over questions about judicial temperament and partisanship, alcohol abuse, sexual violence and how hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt accrued and disappeared within a year. During what was essentially his job interview, Brett Kavanaugh also probably committed perjury, then taunted, disrespected, raged against and accused some US senators of being conspirators out to destroy him \u2013 and, despite all of that, he still got the job. Even worse, although chief justice John Roberts tasked the 10th circuit with reviewing the numerous charges of misconduct against Kavanaugh, the judges concluded that while the allegations were \u201cserious\u201d, they didn\u2019t have the authority to go further because Kavanaugh was now a supreme court justice. In other words, lying to Congress en route to the supreme court means that the only consequence for that perjury is a lifetime appointment to a prestigious position. Clearly, then, the debasement of the rule of law is not far behind. Alan Dershowitz, for example, explained that \u201clying to the FBI is not a crime\u201d. It is. Similarly, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, said that paying hush money to former sexual partners \u201cwas not a crime\u201d although public knowledge of the affairs might have affected the outcome of the election. But it is a crime. Trump claimed that his son\u2019s meeting in June 2016 with Russian nationals to get the dirt on Hillary Clinton was \u201ctotally legal\u201d. It isn\u2019t. Pundits on Fox News actually minimized \u201csomething nearing treason\u201d, as no more than the equivalent to \u201cpulling off mattress tags, jaywalking, parking tickets\u201d. There is not even a basic, foundational agreement that something is fundamentally wrong, illegal even, with meeting the ambassador from Russia to undercut the foreign policy of the United States and then lying about it to the FBI. Nor does there seem to be any understanding that negotiating a real estate deal that requires Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval and offering the dictator a $50m penthouse to sweeten the pot, was problematic. Or recognition that doing so, while securing the Republican nomination for president and lying repeatedly about any connections to Russia, quickly moved beyond bribery to compromising US national security because it put Trump in the Kremlin\u2019s extortionist crosshairs. Yet, despite the gravity of the offense, Fox News host and Trump confidant Sean Hannity claimed, \u201cNo crime was committed \u2026 Even if it had happened, there\u2019s no crime here. None whatsoever.\u201d The absolute numbing of legal and ethical senses is a direct threat to the viability of the United States. In fact, 71% of Republicans, despite the numerous guilty pleas, indictments and evidence of conspiracy and corruption, have become so anesthetized that they consider Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. Meanwhile, the horrific policies that have continued to stagnate the industrial and agricultural heartland, treat non-white immigrants like Hitlerian Untermenschen, militarize the police in African American communities, flatline wages while corporate profits soar, ignore the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, regard women as no more than a uterus, and abandon millions of Americans to bankruptcy or worse if a major illness or accident happens, portends disaster. As does the anti-environmental, head-in-the-sand climate change positions that have overdosed on fossil fuels and ignored the necessity of solar and wind energy. This year will, therefore, be pivotal. Proposals are out there to tackle these systemic problems head-on. Of course, Trump has to go. And Lawrence Tribe has done a brilliant job of detailing the legal authority to indict a sitting president. In addition, Trump\u2019s appointees, because they are clearly fruit of the poisonous tree, must also step down. If they want those positions, they need to undergo a real vetting process \u2013 not the sham that the Republican leadership implemented that allowed a slew of federal judges who couldn\u2019t even get certified as \u201cqualified\u201d by the American Bar Association on to the bench and ushered in a virtual deluge of grifters, tramps and thieves (with all due apologies to Cher!) in the cabinet. Also, the regime\u2019s cruel policies must also be jettisoned and replaced by those that embed dignity, the rule of law, and democracy into the operating code of the United States. There are proposals for immigration reform, a Green New Deal, restoring the Voting Rights Act, non-partisan redistricting commissions, nationwide automatic voter registration, increasing the minimum wage, eliminating dark money from campaigns, protecting the special counsel\u2019s investigation, electoral college reform, and restoring ethics as foundational for public service. This, of course, looks like a herculean task. But it\u2019s gut-check time. Whether the nation decides in 2019 that this work is too hard and simply accepts the fate of stagnating in years of political and economic filth or whether it embraces the challenge and takes the mighty rivers of democracy and justice to clean out the stables will ultimately determine the future of the United States.

At that point the alarm bells should have rung loudly but instead a pretence, regularly undermined by those close to the organising committee and by the delegations that returned from half-constructed venues, was maintained that the west African country could see it through. In September it was granted a last chance to put things right but, with two of the host cities located close to its violence-stricken anglophone regions, the reasons to pull the plug had stacked up insurmountably.</p> <p>As recently as October, the Caf president, Ahmad Ahmad, said his organisation had \u201cnever thought about withdrawing the Cup of Nations from Cameroon\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Six weeks ago the notion that Egypt might host this summer\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations had barely passed anyone\u2019s lips. Yet Tuesday\u2019s overwhelming decision by the Confederation of African Football\u2019s executive committee has conferred on them that responsibility and it marks the end of a chaotic process that, quite aside from the logistical blundering that has brought about this situation, leaves the continent once again asking itself broader questions. Egypt\u2019s candidacy was approved by a vote of 16 to one, with one abstention, a rival South African bid having failed to get off the ground because of inadequate financial commitments. The process was hurried through after Cameroon were stripped of hosting rights on 30 November; an initial reaction is that Caf has stumbled upon the best possible sticking plaster for a bad job but there is little merit in its flair for sailing close to the wind. Cameroon was already lagging behind in its preparations when, in July 2017, Caf announced the tournament would be enlarged to 24 teams from its standard 16. At that point the alarm bells should have rung loudly but instead a pretence, regularly undermined by those close to the organising committee and by the delegations that returned from half-constructed venues, was maintained that the west African country could see it through. In September it was granted a last chance to put things right but, with two of the host cities located close to its violence-stricken anglophone regions, the reasons to pull the plug had stacked up insurmountably. As recently as October, the Caf president, Ahmad Ahmad, said his organisation had \u201cnever thought about withdrawing the Cup of Nations from Cameroon\u201d. Ahmad, who made little secret of his wish for a country of such vibrant football heritage to hold the tournament after three of the previous four had been staged in the petrostates of Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, was desperate for it to work. He succeeded Issa Hayatou in March 2017, coming through on an appealing ticket of modernisation and transparency, but opted too soon for an expansionist European-style template and was left scrambling, just as his predecessor was in finding replacement hosts for the 2013, 2015 and 2017 iterations. The reasons for those switches differed and it is not the fault of anybody at Caf that political instability and \u2013 in the case of Morocco\u2019s last-minute withdrawal from hosting in 2015 \u2013 disease have forced them to think on their feet on previous occasions. But it makes Ahmad\u2019s insistence on imitating the European Championship\u2019s new format seem reckless when so much of the continent lacks the resources or need for a jamboree of this size. The Chinese-built stadium used in Oyem, in northern Gabon, two years ago already risks being reclaimed by the jungle; it is not a huge stretch, either, to imagine similar problems occurring after Cameroon (who will now host in 2021), Ivory Coast and Guinea have hosted the next three editions. Yet passing judgment from this distance on questions of progress, and what that ought to entail, is inherently problematic. One certainty is that Caf needs to revive this event\u2019s flagging global profile and Egypt is capable of hosting a full-fat, authentic-looking tournament for the first time since Ghana in 2008. The rise of Mohamed Salah has already piqued interest in a country whose love of international football is visceral.

The terrorist attack that killed three tourists and their guide in Giza, just outside the capital, last month is another reminder that this tournament will not take place without significant risk; the stadiums themselves will be under scrutiny too given the ban on spectators at domestic games that ran for six years after the Port Said riot in 2012, although the Egyptian FA has pointed out that continental and international fixtures have been hosted to full attendances.

They just want to be entertained. It\u2019s not too much to ask after a hard week at work. But their hopes and desires are not always shared by those managing the team. Take Bob McGrory, a dour Scot straight from Central Casting, who very nearly won the league for the Potters in 1947, but sold star winger Stanley Matthews in a fit of pique with three games of the season to go. Matthews was a bit too flashy for McGrory\u2019s tastes, you see, and the sheer number of fans who flocked to witness his skilful play made his boss fume in the resentful style. Not only that, Matthews had taken McGrory\u2019s pal Bobby Liddle\u2019s place in the team. And he wanted paying properly. So he was packed off to Blackpool. Stoke subsequently lost their last game of the season and missed out to Liverpool by one point. Well done, Bob!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/08/sunderland-newcastle-not-derby-everyone-wants-checkatrade\">Sunderland meet Newcastle \u2013 but this is not the derby everyone wants | Louise Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there was Alan Durban, who parked an old jalopy in front of the goal at Highbury in 1980. When pulled up for his grinding negativity after a 2-0 defeat, he ranted: \u201cWho are we running soccer for? If you want entertainment, you could go out and get a bunch of clowns. If obtaining pleasure from matches is the only concern, then you could get rid of all the coaches and let the players go out and get on with it.\u201d Stupid fans, hoping to experience pleasure. Years later, Durban was unrepentant. \u201cI\u2019m still not sorry, we should have been slaughtered but got a 0-0 out of it,\u201d he argued, with the sort of breathtaking creativity sadly lacking in his team\u2019s play. And then there was \u2026 but everyone\u2019s already had their say on Tony Pulis, let\u2019s leave the man be.</p> <p>Fast forward to the present, and if what fans have been chanting is anything to go by, Stoke have finally taken theatrical impresario Durban\u2019s advice, replacing their entire squad with a troupe of vaudeville performers specialising in slapstick pratfalls, squirting flower operation and the riding of very small bikes. Wonderful high jinks, but the football itself has been dire. They\u2019re 14th in the Championship, having won just eight of 26 matches. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/08/stoke-city-sack-manager-gary-rowett-after-eight-months-in-charge\">That\u2019s cost Gary Rowett his job</a> a mere eight months after jibbing off Derby County in the hope of getting Stoke straight back into the top flight. Not one of the great career moves. So now Stoke are looking for their fourth manager in little over a year. And who are the bookies\u2019 favourites to take over, with frivolity supposedly the primary consideration? David Moyes and Sam Allardyce. Stoke may as well add the similarly resting Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to their wishlist and be done with it.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Scott Murray from 8pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Tottenham 2-2 Chelsea in the Milk Cup semi-finals</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cThe basis for my decision was the ethical reasons and values that I wanted to act upon and hold on to.

      "bodyText": "SEND IN THE CLOWNS, DON\u2019T BOTHER THEY\u2019RE HERE Like everyone else around the country, the paying punters at Stoke City just want a little joy in their lives. They just want to be entertained. It\u2019s not too much to ask after a hard week at work. But their hopes and desires are not always shared by those managing the team. Take Bob McGrory, a dour Scot straight from Central Casting, who very nearly won the league for the Potters in 1947, but sold star winger Stanley Matthews in a fit of pique with three games of the season to go. Matthews was a bit too flashy for McGrory\u2019s tastes, you see, and the sheer number of fans who flocked to witness his skilful play made his boss fume in the resentful style. Not only that, Matthews had taken McGrory\u2019s pal Bobby Liddle\u2019s place in the team. And he wanted paying properly. So he was packed off to Blackpool. Stoke subsequently lost their last game of the season and missed out to Liverpool by one point. Well done, Bob! Then there was Alan Durban, who parked an old jalopy in front of the goal at Highbury in 1980. When pulled up for his grinding negativity after a 2-0 defeat, he ranted: \u201cWho are we running soccer for? If you want entertainment, you could go out and get a bunch of clowns. If obtaining pleasure from matches is the only concern, then you could get rid of all the coaches and let the players go out and get on with it.\u201d Stupid fans, hoping to experience pleasure. Years later, Durban was unrepentant. \u201cI\u2019m still not sorry, we should have been slaughtered but got a 0-0 out of it,\u201d he argued, with the sort of breathtaking creativity sadly lacking in his team\u2019s play. And then there was \u2026 but everyone\u2019s already had their say on Tony Pulis, let\u2019s leave the man be. Fast forward to the present, and if what fans have been chanting is anything to go by, Stoke have finally taken theatrical impresario Durban\u2019s advice, replacing their entire squad with a troupe of vaudeville performers specialising in slapstick pratfalls, squirting flower operation and the riding of very small bikes. Wonderful high jinks, but the football itself has been dire. They\u2019re 14th in the Championship, having won just eight of 26 matches. That\u2019s cost Gary Rowett his job a mere eight months after jibbing off Derby County in the hope of getting Stoke straight back into the top flight. Not one of the great career moves. So now Stoke are looking for their fourth manager in little over a year. And who are the bookies\u2019 favourites to take over, with frivolity supposedly the primary consideration? David Moyes and Sam Allardyce. Stoke may as well add the similarly resting Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to their wishlist and be done with it.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cGiven Liverpool fans have ditties for Joe Gomez, Alisson, Firmino too; isn\u2019t it about time they got a Song for Hoever?\u201d \u2013 Chris Baynes. \u201cI was delighted to read that Dejan Lovren had been replaced by a 16-year-old Hoover. If Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r fancies shoring up the United defence in similar fashion, I\u2019ve got a second-hand Henry I\u2019d be happy to lend him\u201d \u2013 James Maltby. \u201cLast Saturday I went to watch Blackeye Rovers at St James\u2019 Park in the third round of the FA Cup. It turns out Newcastle\u2019s second string is not all one might hope for and Blackeye\u2019s first string was everything you might expect. A draw was fair. However, I will tell you what was not: \u00a335 for a seat so high in the rafters I was apparently a vertigo-inducing quarter of a mile from the pitch. On a positive note, climbing to my seat took care of my cardio until February. In all my days watching football, I have never endured a more expensive and rubbish experience.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Former football coach Kit Carson has died after his car crashed into a tree minutes before the first day of his trial for sexual offences against 11 boys. Police are trying to trace a group of men, whom they believe to be Chelsea fans, in connection with alleged sexual assaults and racist chanting on a train to Worcester after the club\u2019s defeat by Leicester on 22 December. Paul Gascoigne will defend himself against a sex assault charge by saying he has a propensity to kiss people \u201cin a non-sexual manner\u201d, a court has heard. Egypt will host the revamped 24-team Africa Cup of Nations in June this year after Cameroon was stripped of the tournament. Pep Guardiola insists he is not the John Beck du jour, denying claims made by some fans that he lengthened the Etihad grass to help Manchester City beat Liverpool. \u201cI\u2019m not the greenkeeper. I never did it \u2013 if they want to play quick, we want to play quicker,\u201d parped Pep. Xherdan Shaqiri claims Liverpool did not deserve to be knocked out of the FA Cup by Wolves. \u201cI think we didn\u2019t deserve this result because we tried to play football,\u201d sobbed the Swiss cuboid. Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham has turned down the chance to join Wolves on loan in favour of, erm, staying on loan at Aston Villa. Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is making room in his bank account for some serious Chinese coin after Tottenham jumped at the chance to grab \u00a311m from Beijing Guoan for the knacktastic 31-year-old whose contract ends this summer.

      "bodyText": "A Russian lawyer who met senior aides to Donald Trump in 2016 had previously \u201csecretly schemed\u201d with the Russian official who was purportedly offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton, US authorities have alleged. Natalia Veselnitskaya was on Tuesday accused of fabricating evidence in a US money-laundering case she was working on when she attended a now-notorious meeting at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016. A criminal indictment unsealed by federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Veselnitskaya worked on the bogus evidence in 2014 with the office of Russia\u2019s prosecutor general, Yury Chaika. She was charged with obstruction of justice. The June 2016 meeting was convened after Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr, was told by a representative for well-connected Russians that Chaika could provide incriminating material on Clinton, their Democratic opponent, to help Trump\u2019s campaign. The meeting, which Donald Jr attended with the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been closely examined by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and any coordination with members of Trump\u2019s team. Veselnitskaya\u2019s obstruction charge relates to her work representing Prevezon Holdings, a Russian investment company. Prevezon was sued by the US government in New York for allegedly laundering part of $230m stolen by a Russian criminal network into upscale Manhattan condominiums. Angel Melendez, a senior FBI official in New York, said on Tuesday: \u201cVeselnitskaya secretly schemed with a senior Russian prosecutor to provide false information to US law enforcement in an attempt to influence the legal proceedings in the southern district of New York.\u201d During the Prevezon case, Veselnitskaya cited the report of a supposedly independent investigation by Russian authorities, which she said exonerated her clients. In a declaration to court signed under penalty of perjury, Veselnitskaya claimed she had \u201cgone to great lengths\u201d to obtain the report. In fact, US prosecutors said on Tuesday, Veselnitskaya secretly worked with Chaika\u2019s office to draft and edit the report. Then Chaika\u2019s office also helped Veselnitskaya file a phoney legal complaint against itself to make it appear she was obtaining the report through formal procedures, the indictment said. Veselnitskaya allegedly inserted 29 paragraphs into a draft of the report she received from Chaika\u2019s office on 1 August 2014. The indictment said many of these additions made it into the final report passed to the US by Russian authorities. US authorities went on to allege that in June 2015, a prosecutor in Chaika\u2019s office sent Veselnitskaya an email from his personal account containing a draft legal filing that she could use for her phoney complaint to Chaika\u2019s office, in which she would pretend to demand the report she had helped to write. The US justice department announced in May 2017 that Prevezon would pay a $5.9m settlement to halt the government\u2019s legal action. No wrongdoing was admitted and Prevezon maintained its innocence. The US attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, said in a statement that Veselnitskaya\u2019s act \u201cundermines the integrity of the judicial process\u201d and threatened the enforcement of justice. Berman said: \u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to protect the integrity of the judicial proceedings in this district, and we will not stand idly by while outside influences seek to corrupt and pervert that process.\u201d Melendez said Veselnitskaya was now \u201ca wanted person\u201d in the US, was \u201cnow on notice and will have to answer for her futile actions\u201d. Russian authorities are unlikely to cooperate with the US attempt to prosecute Veselnitskaya while she remains in her home country. She will, however, no longer be able to travel to the US without risking arrest.",

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, who is to meet Theresa May in London on Thursday, will underscore the damage Brexit is likely to have on Japanese investment in Britain by first visiting the Netherlands, the country to which many UK-based Japanese firms are redeploying ahead of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. The choice of the Netherlands as the other stop on Abe\u2019s mini-European tour is not a coincidence since he will also be given a chance to be briefed on how a no-deal Brexit could clog the flow of trade into Rotterdam, the main gateway for Japanese and British firms into the EU single market. Abe is also likely at a Downing Street press conference to urge acceptance of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, but he will be watched to see how closely he echoes the words of the UK business secretary, Greg Clark, that a no-deal Brexit cannot be contemplated. British officials insist the visit to London is not a panicked effort to dragoon influential overseas support for her deal, but instead forms part of a pattern of visits designed to strengthen relations with Japan across the fields of business, security and research. But some Japanese firms have lost patience with the UK\u2019s inability to provide Brexit certainty and are setting up parallel offices, primarily in the Netherlands, to ensure they have a bolthole in the event of a no-deal Brexit, or a deal that severely restricts UK-based firms\u2019 access to the EU single market. Companies that have transferred headquarters to Holland include Panasonic, and the banks Nomura and Daiwa. The UK absorbs 40% of Japanese investment destined for the EU. Jeroen CM Nijland, the commissioner of the Netherlands foreign investment agency, said the body was handling about 250 Brexit-related projects. Over the course of 2017, its caseload more than tripled and it has had to hire six additional staff. There are an estimated 1,000 Japanese firms operating in the UK employing 150,000 people. The Japanese ambassador to London, Koji Tsuruoka, has already said \u201cno private company can continue operations\u201d in the UK if it becomes unprofitable. Abe will hear directly from Japanese businesses based in the UK at a Downing Street reception. Firms such as Nissan have already demanded certainty, and said the reintroduction of UK-EU trading on World Trade Organization terms would mean tariffs on cars set at 10 %, wiping out fragile car industry profit margins. In meetings in The Hague with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, Abe will also be briefed on the preparations the Dutch government has been making to keep UK-European trade flowing. The Dutch have also started hiring about 950 customs officers, mostly at Rotterdam port, Europe\u2019s largest, to prepare for the extra bureaucracy required for British goods to enter the EU if the two sides do not reach a withdrawal agreement. Abe will hardly be reassured by UK government-commissioned studies showing lorries could be waiting as long as six days to cross the channel. Big queues at British ports would also destroy the \u201cjust in time\u201d production methods at the heart of the car industry. British officials are keen to emphasise the continuity in the UK relationship, including co-operation in the fields of artificial intelligence and ageing societies. British security co-operation with Japan over North Korea and the South China seas has also stepped up. May will also confirm UK willingness to join the Japan-led regional free trade association, a successor to the Transatlantic Trade Partnership.

      "body": "<p>Imperial College London is including cookery lessons in its chemistry degree courses, starting this September. The Introduction to Culinary Practice module, created in collaboration with the chef Jozef Youssef from the Basque Culinary Centre, will allow students to <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/189408/chemistry-students-taste-being-cooking-maestros/\" title=\"\">\u201cexperience the ambiguities and challenges of translating written instructions into action\u201d</a> (AKA \u201cfollowing a recipe\u201d). There are several reasons why I think this is a great idea, only some of which hold academic weight.</p> <p>I met Youssef several years ago, and he is one of the most absurdly good-looking men I have ever set eyes upon. He looks like a young Antonio Banderas had sex with a Magimix in Zorro\u2019s kitchen. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/may/23/neuro-cuisine-exploring-the-science-of-flavour-video\" title=\"\">His science-theory-inflected food is extraordinary, too</a>. At the tasting menu I attended, we ate origami pasta, oyster ice-cream and fossilised squash. One course was based on a Mexican folk tale and there was a mushroom dish based around the scent of petrichor. I was like a kid in a candy store. Not a real candy store, obviously, a virtual one, with piped custard aromas and implanted happy memories. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/mar/04/italy-molecular-gastronomy-blumenthal-adria\" title=\"\">Molecular gastronomy gets a bad rap from traditional food critics</a>, seen as \u201call fur coat, no knickers\u201d, but it\u2019s right up my street. Spherification, emulsions, foams, there\u2019s a Roald Dahl-esque theatre to this type of food that I love.</p> <p>Another good sign is that the professor of surgical education and engagement science who spearheaded the changes is called Roger Kneebone. I hope that\u2019s not one of the techniques he has pioneered. Is there anyone who doesn\u2019t feel their purpose on Earth bolstered by such a delightful piece of nominative determinism? I wonder if the years of hearing bad jokes have broken him. Anyway, his involvement guarantees the course\u2019s success. It\u2019s meant to be.</p> <p>Is cooking really educational? It\u2019s not a trivial question. According to Kneebone, the thigh bone\u2019s connected \u2013 no, hold on. According to Kneebone, many surgical students spend so much time on screens that they have lost the dexterity to stitch patients. OkayOK, he does sound a little bit broken. The idea behind this course is that the practical skills required by cooking will be invaluable to a new generation of scientists. And I believe that\u2019s true. Just look at The Great British Bake Off: some of its best contestants, such as Rahul Mandal and Andrew Smyth, make brownies with a set square.</p> <p>Cooking is one of the best teachers I\u2019ve known. Not only has it kept me sane and healthy, it has also got me more interested in the science of food and its preparation, despite being a chemistry brain-dud who thought an ionic bond was a Greek spy. Through cooking, I became interested in Maillard reactions and nasal receptors, fermentation, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic magic of egg yolks, denaturing proteins and the vibrational spectra of courgettes. There\u2019s no reason this wouldn\u2019t work the other way around \u2013 that booksmart students can\u2019t develop their powers of observation, adaptation and hands-on ability by making chips or turning out a spotted dick.</p> <p>The university has indicated that, as part of the module, the students will have access to research instruments such as centrifuges, rotary evaporators and sonic homogenisers; just picturing these God-level gadgets has me breaking out in excitement hives. It\u2019s great these chemistry undergraduates will be bettering our understanding of the world; and if that dream collapses like a souffl\u00e9, they will still have some great transferable skills. They could open an organic vegetarian restaurant, called Stems. No? Jeez, you get more of a reaction from helium. Thank you, I\u2019m here all week. Try the veal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imperial College London is including cookery lessons in its chemistry degree courses, starting this September. The Introduction to Culinary Practice module, created in collaboration with the chef Jozef Youssef from the Basque Culinary Centre, will allow students to \u201cexperience the ambiguities and challenges of translating written instructions into action\u201d (AKA \u201cfollowing a recipe\u201d). There are several reasons why I think this is a great idea, only some of which hold academic weight. I met Youssef several years ago, and he is one of the most absurdly good-looking men I have ever set eyes upon. He looks like a young Antonio Banderas had sex with a Magimix in Zorro\u2019s kitchen. His science-theory-inflected food is extraordinary, too. At the tasting menu I attended, we ate origami pasta, oyster ice-cream and fossilised squash. One course was based on a Mexican folk tale and there was a mushroom dish based around the scent of petrichor. I was like a kid in a candy store. Not a real candy store, obviously, a virtual one, with piped custard aromas and implanted happy memories. Molecular gastronomy gets a bad rap from traditional food critics, seen as \u201call fur coat, no knickers\u201d, but it\u2019s right up my street. Spherification, emulsions, foams, there\u2019s a Roald Dahl-esque theatre to this type of food that I love. Another good sign is that the professor of surgical education and engagement science who spearheaded the changes is called Roger Kneebone. I hope that\u2019s not one of the techniques he has pioneered. Is there anyone who doesn\u2019t feel their purpose on Earth bolstered by such a delightful piece of nominative determinism? I wonder if the years of hearing bad jokes have broken him. Anyway, his involvement guarantees the course\u2019s success. It\u2019s meant to be. Is cooking really educational? It\u2019s not a trivial question. According to Kneebone, the thigh bone\u2019s connected \u2013 no, hold on. According to Kneebone, many surgical students spend so much time on screens that they have lost the dexterity to stitch patients. OkayOK, he does sound a little bit broken. The idea behind this course is that the practical skills required by cooking will be invaluable to a new generation of scientists. And I believe that\u2019s true. Just look at The Great British Bake Off: some of its best contestants, such as Rahul Mandal and Andrew Smyth, make brownies with a set square. Cooking is one of the best teachers I\u2019ve known. Not only has it kept me sane and healthy, it has also got me more interested in the science of food and its preparation, despite being a chemistry brain-dud who thought an ionic bond was a Greek spy. Through cooking, I became interested in Maillard reactions and nasal receptors, fermentation, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic magic of egg yolks, denaturing proteins and the vibrational spectra of courgettes. There\u2019s no reason this wouldn\u2019t work the other way around \u2013 that booksmart students can\u2019t develop their powers of observation, adaptation and hands-on ability by making chips or turning out a spotted dick. The university has indicated that, as part of the module, the students will have access to research instruments such as centrifuges, rotary evaporators and sonic homogenisers; just picturing these God-level gadgets has me breaking out in excitement hives. It\u2019s great these chemistry undergraduates will be bettering our understanding of the world; and if that dream collapses like a souffl\u00e9, they will still have some great transferable skills. They could open an organic vegetarian restaurant, called Stems. No? Jeez, you get more of a reaction from helium. Thank you, I\u2019m here all week. Try the veal.",

As soon as the national discourse starts acting its age again, I\u2019ll do my best to give it the attention it deserves. \u2022 Katy Guest is a freelance writer and editor, and a commissioning editor for the publisher Unbound",

The two murders are alleged to have taken place in broad daylight in 2015 in Almere, a city east of Amsterdam, and in 2017 on a street close to the Dutch foreign ministry in The Hague. In a written statement to the Dutch parliament, Stef Blok, the country\u2019s foreign minister, said intelligence services had found \u201cstrong indications that Iran was involved in the assassinations of two Dutch nationals of Iranian origin\u201d. Blok added the government believed such \u201chostile actions\u201d violated Dutch sovereignty. The man killed in 2015 was named as Mohammad Reza Kolahi Samadi, 56, who had previously been sentenced to death in Iran after being accused of planting a bomb at the Islamic Republic party\u2019s headquarters in 1981, killing 73 people. Among those killed in the bomb attack was the second-in-command to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran\u2019s supreme leader. Samadi, who had been in the building shortly before the explosion, was accused of the attack and fled to Europe. He was sentenced to death in absentia. With his wife and teenage son, he had lived in Almere, working as an engineer under the alias Ali Motamed. He was shot in the head at point-blank range by two assailants dressed in black, in what was claimed to have the hallmarks of a contract killing. Two years later, the Iranian activist Ahmad Molla Nissi, 52, who founded an Arab nationalist group seeking an independent state inside Iran, was also shot in the head as he walked through The Hague. On Tuesday, the EU imposed sanctions against two Iranians and the country\u2019s military intelligence service in response to the allegations. The Dutch government said the expulsion in June 2018 of two diplomats from the Iranian embassy in the Netherlands had been in retaliation for the murders and the Iranian ambassador had been summoned at the time. Dick Schoof, the director general of the Dutch security service, the AIVD, said it was involved in \u201cintense\u201d efforts with other countries to research the extent of Iranian \u201cinterference\u201d in Europe. Last year, France and Denmark also accused Iran of plotting attacks on European soil, involving a foiled bombing attack that targeted a rally organised by an Iranian opposition group near Paris in June 2018 and the assassination of the exiled leader of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA), a separatist group with a history of carrying out attacks in Iran. The development has thrown EU-Iran relations into crisis at a time when Brussels is straining to keep alive the accord under which sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for it lowering its nuclear ambitions.

As a viewer, you\u2019re given the chance to make his character, Stefan Butler \u2013 a video game developer in the early 1980s whose project goes very wrong indeed \u2013 do all sorts of horrible and distressing things, directing the story, and his fate, with a series of sadistic clicks. If, of course, that\u2019s the direction you decide upon. Perhaps you were kinder than me, and let it play out to only moderate doom. Or perhaps not. At one point, when a particularly gory option presents itself, Stefan looks into the camera and sighs, \u201cOh God, really?\u201d, before he goes about the bloody task.</p> <p>Whitehead is 21, and Stefan is already his second big talking-point role, after he played British soldier Tommy in Christopher Nolan\u2019s harrowing 2017 epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/17/dunkirk-review-christopher-nolans-apocalyptic-war-epic-is-his-best-film-so-far\">Dunkirk</a>. Whitehead is aware of the hype around Bandersnatch \u2013 there are countless forums online attempting to map out the many courses the story could take, using a series of increasingly dense flowcharts \u2013 but the brunt of the fuss has passed him by. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed through my friends and family,\u201d he says. \u201cI got a text from a friend saying, \u2018Mate, you\u2019re trending on Twitter.\u2019 I didn\u2019t really know what it meant. He adopts a withering tone. \u2018It means apparently the TV show is good, <em>dad</em>.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh, cool.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c08128358ce5eacbd10f8d92de608724c6fb989c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08128358ce5eacbd10f8d92de608724c6fb989c/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Click bait \u2026 viewers of Black Mirror: Bandersnatch choose the fate of Fionn Whitehead\u2019s character, Stefan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Click bait \u2026 viewers of Black Mirror: Bandersnatch choose the fate of Fionn Whitehead\u2019s character, Stefan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is not on social media; his official Instagram and Twitter accounts are inactive and bare, and exist only to stop someone impersonating him. \u201cIt\u2019s not my bag,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI find it too easy to fall into the trap of relying on other people\u2019s opinions to feel gratified. So anything I can do to reduce that risk is probably a good idea.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/01/black-mirror-bandersnatch-review-charlie-brooker-netflix-tv-of-tomorrow-is-now-here\">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch review \u2013 the TV of tomorrow is now here</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He may be somewhat digitally averse, but he was a big Black Mirror fan before he got the audition. \u201cMy agent knew I would jump at the chance to be involved,\u201d he says. He knew nothing about the episode when he went up for it, and was given only a single scene to prepare. \u201cOne that isn\u2019t even really in it any more. It was sort of the ashtray scene, but a lot of things have changed in the script since I auditioned.\u201d He got the job, not knowing that it was a job with a twist. \u201cThen I went to meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/01/inside-black-mirror-with-charlie-brooker-annabel-jones-watch-live\">Charlie [Brooker] and Annabel [Jones]</a>, and just before I met them, they sent an email along the lines of, \u2018It\u2019s a \u2018choose-your-own-adventure\u2019 thing.\u2019 I was like, what? That doesn\u2019t really make any sense.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker has said that Bandersnatch, with its many paths and endings, took roughly the same amount of work as four regular episodes of Black Mirror. Whitehead says that even the script was difficult to read; it was sent to him in <a href=\"http://twinery.org/\">Twine</a>, software more typically used for writing games. \u201cYou spend a lot of time reading the script, thinking about the different choice paths, which added another level of complexity to the character arc.\u201d He reckons the average feature film takes two or three months to shoot, without alternative storylines being made on top of each other. \u201cBut we shot the whole thing in six weeks, and it was four and a half hours\u2019 worth of content.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"482a505b2f5761c118c619aecf3b88da6ee5e291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/482a505b2f5761c118c619aecf3b88da6ee5e291/0_973_4124_5027/820.jpg\" alt=\"Fionn Whitehead.\" width=\"820\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of the box \u2026 Fionn Whitehead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He found it helped not to overthink it. \u201cStefan is totally unaware that someone else is controlling him until very close to the end of the film,\u201d he explains. \u201cDepending on what path you take, and all the rest of it. During the shoot, I tried to put that bit to the back of my mind, which is a hard thing to do when you\u2019re shooting a scene that is a variation of a scene, almost the same, but very slightly different.

      "bodyText": "It is strange to sit down with Fionn Whitehead only days after watching him in Bandersnatch, the choose-your-own-adventure Black Mirror episode that appeared on Netflix just after Christmas. As a viewer, you\u2019re given the chance to make his character, Stefan Butler \u2013 a video game developer in the early 1980s whose project goes very wrong indeed \u2013 do all sorts of horrible and distressing things, directing the story, and his fate, with a series of sadistic clicks. If, of course, that\u2019s the direction you decide upon. Perhaps you were kinder than me, and let it play out to only moderate doom. Or perhaps not. At one point, when a particularly gory option presents itself, Stefan looks into the camera and sighs, \u201cOh God, really?\u201d, before he goes about the bloody task. Whitehead is 21, and Stefan is already his second big talking-point role, after he played British soldier Tommy in Christopher Nolan\u2019s harrowing 2017 epic Dunkirk. Whitehead is aware of the hype around Bandersnatch \u2013 there are countless forums online attempting to map out the many courses the story could take, using a series of increasingly dense flowcharts \u2013 but the brunt of the fuss has passed him by. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed through my friends and family,\u201d he says. \u201cI got a text from a friend saying, \u2018Mate, you\u2019re trending on Twitter.\u2019 I didn\u2019t really know what it meant. He adopts a withering tone. \u2018It means apparently the TV show is good, dad.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh, cool.\u2019\u201d He is not on social media; his official Instagram and Twitter accounts are inactive and bare, and exist only to stop someone impersonating him. \u201cIt\u2019s not my bag,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI find it too easy to fall into the trap of relying on other people\u2019s opinions to feel gratified. So anything I can do to reduce that risk is probably a good idea.\u201d He may be somewhat digitally averse, but he was a big Black Mirror fan before he got the audition. \u201cMy agent knew I would jump at the chance to be involved,\u201d he says. He knew nothing about the episode when he went up for it, and was given only a single scene to prepare. \u201cOne that isn\u2019t even really in it any more. It was sort of the ashtray scene, but a lot of things have changed in the script since I auditioned.\u201d He got the job, not knowing that it was a job with a twist. \u201cThen I went to meet Charlie [Brooker] and Annabel [Jones], and just before I met them, they sent an email along the lines of, \u2018It\u2019s a \u2018choose-your-own-adventure\u2019 thing.\u2019 I was like, what? That doesn\u2019t really make any sense.\u201d Brooker has said that Bandersnatch, with its many paths and endings, took roughly the same amount of work as four regular episodes of Black Mirror. Whitehead says that even the script was difficult to read; it was sent to him in Twine, software more typically used for writing games. \u201cYou spend a lot of time reading the script, thinking about the different choice paths, which added another level of complexity to the character arc.\u201d He reckons the average feature film takes two or three months to shoot, without alternative storylines being made on top of each other. \u201cBut we shot the whole thing in six weeks, and it was four and a half hours\u2019 worth of content.\u201d He found it helped not to overthink it. \u201cStefan is totally unaware that someone else is controlling him until very close to the end of the film,\u201d he explains. \u201cDepending on what path you take, and all the rest of it. During the shoot, I tried to put that bit to the back of my mind, which is a hard thing to do when you\u2019re shooting a scene that is a variation of a scene, almost the same, but very slightly different. A lot of reshooting a scene where the words would be slightly different, and shorter maybe. But you\u2019d have to have it in the back of your mind that it\u2019s like a deja vu thing, of having done this action before.\u201d Miraculously, it all comes together, and critics have responded well to its innovations, no matter how unsettling it seems for the viewer to be handed responsibility for a character\u2019s most terrible life choices. \u201cIt was definitely an intense experience, but I loved it,\u201d he says. Whitehead is as closed about his personal life as you\u2019d expect from someone who had already sworn off social media as a teenager: \u201cI just enjoy my privacy. I think it\u2019s important to have a life of your own, outside of work.\u201d (His Bandersnatch co-star Will Poulter announced he was stepping back from social media in the wake of comments about the episode.)

But just as he was about to start auditioning again, he was cast in ITV\u2019s supernatural drama Him. \u201cI never did my Ucas again.\u201d Him was followed by Dunkirk, a blockbuster that was hugely successful and critically acclaimed. It all sounds like a bit of a fairytale. \u201cIt was very quick, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cVery quick.

      "body": "<p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has continued to show her power to steer the national political conversation. In an interview, Ocasio-Cortez suggested offhandedly that income above $10m may need to be taxed up to 70%, especially if we are going to get serious about halting climate change. Her idea instantly sparked indignant replies from the right. Grover Norquist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GroverNorquist/status/1081692282477256707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1081692282477256707&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fpolicy-and-politics%2F2019%2F1%2F7%2F18171803%2Focasio-cortez-70-percent-marginal-tax-rate-scalise-norquist-spin\">compared it to slavery</a>. National Review\u2019s Brian Riedl <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-70-percent-tax-cannot-finance-socialism/\">called it</a> \u201ccompletely destructive\u201d. Steve Scalise said she wanted to \u201ctake away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs\u201d.</p> <p>Many critics attempt to confuse people over what Ocasio-Cortez said. Just to be clear: she said that when people earn $10m, the 10 millionth dollar and above should be taxed at a high rate. So unless you earn $10m, she\u2019s not talking about \u201cyour\u201d income. These are marginal tax rates, though the Republican party loves to trick people by conflating taxes that apply solely to the unfathomably rich with taxes that apply to ordinary workers.</p> <p>In fact, Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t even specifically say what she wanted the US tax rate to be: she said that \u201csometimes you see\u201d a 70% tax on multi-multimillionaires. And that\u2019s true: <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2019/01/05/sweden-has-a-70-percent-tax-rate-and-it-is-fine/\">Sweden has a 70% top tax rate</a> and consistently remains near the top of the <a href=\"https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/analysis-indicator\">Global Innovation Index</a>. She pointed to the fact that across the world, in many successful social democratic countries, high earners pay more than they do in the United States.

      "bodyText": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has continued to show her power to steer the national political conversation. In an interview, Ocasio-Cortez suggested offhandedly that income above $10m may need to be taxed up to 70%, especially if we are going to get serious about halting climate change. Her idea instantly sparked indignant replies from the right. Grover Norquist compared it to slavery. National Review\u2019s Brian Riedl called it \u201ccompletely destructive\u201d. Steve Scalise said she wanted to \u201ctake away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs\u201d. Many critics attempt to confuse people over what Ocasio-Cortez said. Just to be clear: she said that when people earn $10m, the 10 millionth dollar and above should be taxed at a high rate. So unless you earn $10m, she\u2019s not talking about \u201cyour\u201d income. These are marginal tax rates, though the Republican party loves to trick people by conflating taxes that apply solely to the unfathomably rich with taxes that apply to ordinary workers. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t even specifically say what she wanted the US tax rate to be: she said that \u201csometimes you see\u201d a 70% tax on multi-multimillionaires. And that\u2019s true: Sweden has a 70% top tax rate and consistently remains near the top of the Global Innovation Index. She pointed to the fact that across the world, in many successful social democratic countries, high earners pay more than they do in the United States. That\u2019s a fact, and it should make people wary of talking points about how destructive any attempt to fund critical programs would be. Many of the arguments against taxes on the wealthy are \u201cmoralistic\u201d rather than empirical. The argument that taxes on high earners are \u201cslavery\u201d is incoherent. Nobody forces you to earn $10m. When you are enslaved, someone makes you do work.

      "bodyText": "Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, the Saudi Arabian woman who fled her family and is now under UN protection in Thailand, has been sustained through the \u201cterrifying\u201d ordeal by thousands of online messages of support that probably saved her life, a friend has said. Nourah Alharbi, 20, told the Guardian: \u201cYesterday, they [social media supporters] made the difference in Rahaf\u2019s life. You saved Rahaf\u2019s life yesterday: the people, the media.\u201d Speaking on Tuesday morning, Alharbi said Qunun was buoyed when she saw how many messages about her were being posted online. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t believe it. Today when I was calling her ... [she said] she can see the thousands of messages, all of them supporting her. She\u2019s terrified and stressed, and when she saw the messages it really made a difference for her.\u201d Now based in Sydney, Alharbi said she fled Saudi Arabia herself after suffering abuse from her family, and is seeking asylum in Australia. She has kept in close contact with Qunun throughout her ordeal. She mentioned the case of Dina Ali Lasloom, a 24-year-old Saudi woman who in April 2017 was returned to Saudi Arabia from the Philippines against her will and whose fate is unclear. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get that [social media] support and that\u2019s why she\u2019s in Saudi Arabia now \u2013 she\u2019s disappeared,\u201d Alharbi said. On Sunday, Qunun, 18, barricaded herself in a hotel room inside Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport to prevent her forcible return to a family she claimed would kill her, following her renouncing of Islam. She tweeted about her situation, and the Twitter hashtag #SaveRahaf soon gained support. Supporters demanded she stay in Thailand rather than be returned to Kuwait, the point of her departure, and lobbied governments to offer her asylum. Alharbi said Qunun was keen to leave the country after hearing reports her father had travelled to Thailand but that she felt safe for the time being. \u201cShe called me and said the UN were good and were protecting her,\u201d she said. \u201cSecurity keep coming and asking about her. She wants to tell everyone that she wants to go outside Thailand \u2013 to any safe country.\u201d Alharbi claimed Australia had cancelled the tourist visa on which Qunun was originally travelling. \u201cI don\u2019t know [the reason] because they\u2019re not answering,\u201d she said. The Australian government is yet to respond to the claim. Urging people to keep posting messages about Qunun, Alharbi said: \u201cYesterday we won, but this is not the big winning. We got her out [of the airport] but we win when we get her out from Thailand. And we will, properly.\u201d Qunun was interviewed by staff from the UN\u2019s refugee agency UNHCR on Tuesday, after they met her on Monday. \u201cIt could take several days to process the case and determine next steps,\u201d UNHCR\u2019s Thailand representative Giuseppe de Vincentiis said in a statement. \u201cWe are very grateful that the Thai authorities did not send back (Qunun) against her will and are extending protection to her,\u201d he said. The Australian government said on Tuesday it would \u201ccarefully consider\u201d Qunun\u2019s asylum application after the UNHCR process has concluded. Qunun was detained on arrival at Bangkok and denied entry to Thailand while en route to Australia, where she said she intended to seek asylum. The Guardian confirmed on Monday Qunun had a valid three-month tourist visa for Australia, issued to her Saudi passport. Qunun said she was abducted after arriving in Bangkok and had her passport confiscated by Saudi Arabian diplomatic staff. She demanded access to the UNHCR and barricaded herself inside her hotel room in fear she would be forced on to a plane after Kuwait Airways officials had come to her door, but Monday\u2019s 11.15am flight departed without her. In a short press release distributed to media outside its embassy in Bangkok on Tuesday, the Saudi government said it had not demanded her deportation, adding the case is a \u201cfamily affair\u201d, but under the \u201ccare and attention\u201d of the embassy. The head of Thailand\u2019s immigration police, General Surachate Hakparn, had previously said Qunun would be sent back to Saudi Arabia because she was \u201cunsafe\u201d without a guardian in Thailand, and claimed she did not have the documentation to go on to Australia. But late on Monday he promised she would not be deported and agreed to consult the UNCHR. He later said she had been taken to a safe house for her asylum claim to be processed. \u201cIf she goes home it will be dangerous for her so Thailand is ready to help,\u201d he told media. \u201cWe are working with the foreign affairs ministry and UNHCR and today we will allow her entry to Thailand. UNHCR is now taking care of her and working on her asylum claim.\u201d Surachate said Qunun\u2019s father and brother had arrived in Bangkok and want to talk to her, but that UN officials would need to approve any such meeting. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs said it was monitoring the case closely. \u201cThe claims made by Ms Al-Qunun that she may be harmed if returned to Saudi Arabia are deeply concerning,\u201d a spokesman said on Monday night. On Tuesday a Department of Home Affairs official told AFP: \u201cAny application by Ms Al-Qunun for a humanitarian visa will be carefully considered once the UNHCR process has concluded.\u201d Qunun said in a video posted on social media from inside the airport that she was trying to escape from her family because they subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. She has appealed for help from Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. Her case has brought international attention to the obstacles women face in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom also faces intense scrutiny over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which has renewed criticism of its human rights record.",

In attempting to create a property-owning democracy, Margaret Thatcher enabled tenants to sell their former council houses off, essentially creating an \u201cunderclass\u201d of social housing tenant now viewed as the lowest of the low by other sections of the population. I\u2019d hazard that many of the policymakers and media figures involved in this debate have barely socialised with anyone living in the social housing that has become so ghettoised over the years, so removed from its original purpose of being \u201ca living tapestry for a mixed community\u201d as to be unrecognisable. Instead, council houses are scarce resources to be fought over by the desperate, with 1.15 million families on waiting lists. Even if you are deemed sufficiently in need to be granted a home, you may well find yourself labelled unworthy by the press and the public. Perhaps you are a single mother, or you have \u201ctoo many\u201d children. Not worthy. Perhaps you fled here from another country, or are on benefits. Not worthy. Or perhaps, like Kate Osamor, you succeeded in doing something amazing: becoming an MP despite the odds stacked against you. Not worthy. But who is worthy, when poor people \u2013 that is, people without enough money \u2013 have become so demonised? How bad do things have to get in your life before the government can offer you warmth and rest and others will not begrudge you for it? This competing for the most basic of resources is not the country that William Beveridge and Nye Bevan envisaged when they embarked on their postwar housebuilding programme. It is not the sign of a healthy country. Subjected to the \u201calien test\u201d, the whole thing seems barbaric. The proverbial space traveller arrives and asks: \u201cWhere do the humans on this island live?\u201d And you say, well, some people without enough money live on these estates, and the other people without enough money pay these other people, who have lots more money, to live in their houses, though they are often damp and smelly and not fit for habitation (which is not a legal requirement). And some of those people, the ones with the money and the houses, are our political representatives, and they decide whether or not we should build more affordable houses, or whether people carry on paying for ones that don\u2019t need to meet certain habitable standards. Three million council houses for England. Imagine how brilliant, if it is allowed to happen. Imagine what it says about us, as a country, as a community, as a people. How proud we could feel. We could look back and say, well, we got a bit lost back there, but now we are back on track. We forgot that a home is a home, and people are just people, but then we remembered, and we built some houses, to give them warmth, and rest. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author",

He uses his brush to create both himself and what looks like an unfinished map of the world. Rembrandt looks noble and flawed, gazing at you as one troubled person at another.</p> <p>Did Leonardo ever create anything so disarmingly and rawly human? I\u2019d reply with another question: has anyone under the age of 30 ever given a hoot about Rembrandt? Self-portraits that probe the inner self are all very well, but there\u2019s a universality to Leonardo that puts him in a different league. I became a fan of his genius when I was about eight. I had <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780721402635/Great-Artist-BOOK-LEONARDO-VINCI-0721402631/plp.\">a Ladybird book about great artists</a>.

To grasp the real wonder of Leonardo you need to look at his drawings. He finished very few paintings and all are commissions in which self-expression struggles with patrons\u2019 demands. It\u2019s in his notebooks that Leonardo truly soars. In page after page he studies nature, designs machinery, invents weapons, plans fortifications and seeks the secret of flight.</p> <p>The greatest of all these visual investigations are his anatomical drawings. These are his artistic answers to Rembrandt\u2019s portraits \u2013 and they are also miracles of science. He wrote of the dread he felt when he stayed up all night in a dissection room full of cadavers, alone with the dead. Out of these experiments he produced drawings that go \u2013 literally \u2013 deeper than Rembrandt. Instead of being moved by a face, Leonardo digs and cuts in search of life\u2019s hidden structure. The drawings that record his fleshy discoveries outdo Rembrandt\u2019s greatest portraits as images of what it is to be human. There\u2019s no more moving work of art on earth than his <a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/919102/recto-the-fetus-in-the-womb-verso-notes-on-reproduction-with-sketches-of-a-fetus\">depiction of a foetus in the womb</a>, esconced as if in a capsule bound for the stars.</p> <p>The quivering mystery of Leonardo\u2019s drawings of the lungs and heart, <a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/collection/912603/recto-the-layers-of-the-scalp-and-the-cerebral-ventricles-verso-studies-of-the\">the precision of his studies of the eye and brain</a> \u2013 these are his most sensitive as well as mind-boggling works.

He uses his brush to create both himself and what looks like an unfinished map of the world. Rembrandt looks noble and flawed, gazing at you as one troubled person at another. Did Leonardo ever create anything so disarmingly and rawly human? I\u2019d reply with another question: has anyone under the age of 30 ever given a hoot about Rembrandt? Self-portraits that probe the inner self are all very well, but there\u2019s a universality to Leonardo that puts him in a different league. I became a fan of his genius when I was about eight. I had a Ladybird book about great artists. The story of Leonardo da Vinci was like a fairytale \u2013 there was a picture of him buying birds at market just so he could release them. What\u2019s Rembrandt got for an eight-year-old? And how many copies would The Rembrandt Code sell? As for depth, it\u2019s a false test to compare a Rembrandt self-portrait with the Mona Lisa. To grasp the real wonder of Leonardo you need to look at his drawings. He finished very few paintings and all are commissions in which self-expression struggles with patrons\u2019 demands. It\u2019s in his notebooks that Leonardo truly soars. In page after page he studies nature, designs machinery, invents weapons, plans fortifications and seeks the secret of flight. The greatest of all these visual investigations are his anatomical drawings. These are his artistic answers to Rembrandt\u2019s portraits \u2013 and they are also miracles of science. He wrote of the dread he felt when he stayed up all night in a dissection room full of cadavers, alone with the dead. Out of these experiments he produced drawings that go \u2013 literally \u2013 deeper than Rembrandt. Instead of being moved by a face, Leonardo digs and cuts in search of life\u2019s hidden structure. The drawings that record his fleshy discoveries outdo Rembrandt\u2019s greatest portraits as images of what it is to be human. There\u2019s no more moving work of art on earth than his depiction of a foetus in the womb, esconced as if in a capsule bound for the stars. The quivering mystery of Leonardo\u2019s drawings of the lungs and heart, the precision of his studies of the eye and brain \u2013 these are his most sensitive as well as mind-boggling works. His anatomical drawings belong to the Queen and many will be touring the country this year. Sure, Rembrandt is the Shakespeare of painting. But Leonardo is Shakespeare, Einstein and the Wright brothers rolled into one. Come off it, Rijksmuseum. This just isn\u2019t Rembrandt\u2019s year.",

Concerns about security and illegal immigration were raised by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and Rudd, his predecessor at the Home Office. May announced the final vote on the Brexit deal would take place on 15 January after five more days of debate. It is understood the government hopes it will be, in effect, a continuation of the postponed debate on the motion that was put down before Christmas, rather than a new motion, but that is contingent on whether the Speaker agrees to it. MPs who spoke in the debate before Christmas are to be permitted to speak again in the days ahead. On Wednesday, Barclay will open the debate, which will be closed by the prime minister next Tuesday. May is still fighting for concessions from the EU over the Irish backstop, having promised legally binding assurances that the insurance option to keep the UK in an effective customs union would be temporary and used only in the most severe circumstances. The lack of progress with Brussels may mean MPs restart the debate without any material change to discuss. Downing Street said there would be something on offer \u201cbefore the vote\u201d and indicated MPs would have some time to debate whatever change came about. May\u2019s spokesman said the prime minister had \u201creaffirmed\u201d that the UK was not intending to seek an extension to article 50 to allow more time to reach an acceptable deal. \u201cThere are people in the EU discussing this issue, but that is not the position of the UK government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not be extending article 50.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BT is facing a post-Brexit battle to maintain access to a number of multimillion-pound EU contracts and avoid the premature termination of a \u00a324m deal with the European parliament. The BT Group has won a slew of contracts with the EU\u2019s institutions in the last decade worth more than \u00a3150m. But the potential for the EU to scrap \u201csensitive\u201d contracts such as that struck with BT was raised during a recent meeting of EU officials and senior MEPs discussing Brexit preparations, according to leaked minutes obtained by the Guardian. The risk to the EU in honouring contracts and allowing the BT Group to provide telecommunications services, when the UK is no longer an EU member state, was said to require examination. According to minutes of the meeting, senior MEPs voiced the view that \u201csensitive services, such as telecommunications, currently provided inter alia by British Telecom, should be given thorough consideration in the framework of procurement by parliament.\u201d The meeting also discussed creating \u201ca full list of contracts with UK-based companies currently in force\u201d. The MEPs concluded that \u201cwhereas ongoing contracts with British companies would be fulfilled as a general rule \u2026 certain particularly sensitive contracts could be terminated prematurely for security reasons\u201d. The meeting between Klaus Welle, the secretary general of the European parliament, and a \u201cBrexit preparedness\u201d working-group of MEPs, also heard that the EU bodies such as the European parliament would not be able to sign off on future contracts with British firms under its procurement rules. \u201cAs of the date on which the United Kingdom ceases to be a member state, ie 29 March 2019, parliament will no longer be able to conclude contracts with British companies, noting that this also applied to ongoing calls for tender,\u201d the minutes note. In response to the MEPs, Welle had agreed that \u201cthe question of certain sensitive external service providers to parliament from UK-based companies, inter alia in the field of telecommunications, would be evaluated closely in the light of a new legal situation\u201d, according to the minutes. It was also noted that a no-deal Brexit, under which the UK would leave the EU without the 21-month transition period envisaged in the withdrawal agreement, was a factor that would heighten the risk of contracts being brought to a premature end. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, the UK would in effect remain a member state for at least 21 months, and possibly until 2022, allowing it to retain many of the current benefits, although it would lose representation in the EU\u2019s decision-making institutions. Welle told the MEPs that the parliament need to examine \u201cexisting contracts with UK-based companies, for which the future status will depend on whether or not specific provisions are adopted as part of the withdrawal agreement\u201d. A spokesman for the BT Group said it was in talks with the EU over the contracts. \u201cWe firmly believe that BT should continue to retain its existing EU contracts\u201d, he said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation as it develops as part of our scenario planning for Brexit to ensure we\u2019re prepared for any potential impacts on our business, people and customers. \u201cWe are fully engaged with the EU institutions and remain committed to delivering the services we have been contracted for. We believe BT should be able to bid for new EU contracts post-Brexit.\u201d In 2016, BT secured a \u00a349m contract with the European parliament and separately announced two new contracts with the European commission worth \u00a324m to deliver public and private cloud services across 52 major European institutions, agencies and bodies \u2013 including the European parliament, the European council and the European Defence Agency. Those deals followed the signing in 2011 of a \u00a3100m contract between BT and the European parliament for the provision of telecommunications services over a period of five years. That contract proved to be a huge boost for BT\u2019s Global Services division, which at one stage reported losses of \u00a3124m. In 2008 the division was at risk of losing 10,000 jobs because of its poor performance but it has subsequently become a major generator of the company\u2019s profits.

More than 30 individuals have made allegations against Spacey. On Christmas Eve, just after prosecutors announced charges had been filed regarding the Nantucket allegations, Spacey released on social media a video in which he appeared to channel his House of Cards character.

After a nine-week trial, the protesters were last month convicted of endangering the safety of an aerodrome, an offence under the 1990 Aviation and Maritime Security Act that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The verdict \u2013 described by Amnesty International as a \u201ccrushing blow for human rights in the UK\u201d \u2013 came after the judge told the jury to disregard all evidence put forward by the defendants to support the defence that they acted to stop human rights abuses. On Monday, lawyers representing all 15 defendants lodged submissions amounting to around 100 pages at the court of appeal in London. They are arguing that the judge was biased in his summing up of the case, that he should have allowed the defendants to make the defence of necessity, and that he got the law wrong about what the offence means. They also claim that the court did not properly check that the attorney general had properly given consent for the terror charge to be levied against peaceful protesters, and that the judge should have ordered disclosure of the materials sent to the attorney general when deciding whether to sign it off.

      "bodyText": "Kurdish security forces in Erbil are continuing to torture children to confess their involvement with Islamic State, according to allegations in a report released by Human Rights Watch. According to the organisation, which first raised the alarm about the mistreatment of child detainees by Kurdish security forces nearly two years ago, it has collected claims of the continued regular use of beatings and electric shocks to extract confessions, often prior to trials lasting a handful of minutes. The boys interviewed by the group allege the abuse took place in a detention centre in the Iraqi Kurdistan city in 2017 and 2018, where they were being held without access to a lawyer and without being permitted to read the confessions they say security officers wrote and forced them to sign. The report, published on Tuesday, is based on interviews late last year with 20 boys, aged between 14 and 17, who have been either charged or convicted because of their alleged affiliation with Isis and are being held at the Women and Children\u2019s Reformatory in Erbil. The group also interviewed three boys who had recently been released. At the time of the visit by HRW researchers, 63 children were being held at the facility for alleged terrorism-related offences, including 43 who had been convicted. Sixteen of the 23 children who were interviewed said that security officers known as Asayish officers had beaten them with plastic pipes, electric cables or rods, while three others said the officers had used electric shocks. Others described being tied into a painful stress position called the \u201cscorpion\u201d for up to two hours. Several boys said the torture continued over consecutive days, and only ended when they confessed. Four other boys said Asayish threatened them with torture during interrogation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell us the truth, I will call the guys and they will beat you and break your bones,\u201d a 17-year-old boy recalled his interrogator telling him. While several of those interviewed said they had joined and worked with Isis, or received religious or military training, only one said that he had participated in fighting against Iraqi military forces. Others, however, insisted that they had no personal involvement, while admitting family members were involved. All but one of the boys interviewed said they eventually confessed. \u201cMy confession says that I joined Isis for 16 days, but actually, I didn\u2019t join at all,\u201d one 16-year-old boy told researchers. \u201cI said 16 days to stop the torture.\u201d Another 14-year-old boy told a similar story. \u201cFirst they said I should say I was with Isis, so I agreed,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they told me I had to say I worked for Isis for three months.

      "bodyText": "An energy firm supplying electricity and gas to nearly a quarter of a million customers has collapsed, becoming the latest in a string of casualties in the sector. The energy regulator Ofgem confirmed on Tuesday that Economy Energy had ceased trading and urged its 235,000 customers to take meter readings and wait for a new supplier to be appointed. The firm is the ninth small UK supplier within a year to fail, taking the total number of displaced customers to about 800,000. The announcement was expected after Ofgem banned Economy from taking on new customers last week. The company entered credit default on Monday. Economy Energy did not offer any apology, saying on its website: \u201cCustomers need not worry, their supplies are secure and credit balances are protected.\u201d However, customers\u2019 energy costs could change, depending on which provider takes over. As recently as last month, Economy had said it had \u201cno intention of closing our doors\u201d. Dozens of customers have taken to review websites recently to complain that the company owes them hundreds of pounds in unreturned credit. More than 1,300 complaints about the supplier were being investigated by the Energy Ombudsman. The collapse matters to more than just the firm\u2019s customers, as all households bear the cost for moving customers from failed firms to other suppliers. A Guardian analysis found that, before Economy Energy, consumers already faced a bill of at least \u00a380m from other failed gas and electricity suppliers. The company\u2019s demise will add to that tally in two ways. It forces all billpayers to pay for the costs incurred by the supplier that takes on its customers, a process known as \u201csupplier of last resort\u201d. The firm also leaves an outstanding bill of around \u00a313m in renewable energy subsidy payments, which will now be spread across all suppliers. Former chief energy regulator Stephen Littlechild recently questioned the oversight of that scheme. \u201cPrudent suppliers, and ultimately their customers, will have to bail out imprudent ones,\u201d he said. Observers had speculated that Economy Energy was on the rocks after it missed a payment deadline for the subsidies, and closed all its social media accounts without explanation. Economy Energy is far from the only troubled firm among the challenger suppliers taking on the big six. Rising wholesale prices over the past year have squeezed smaller firms, some of which do not buy energy as far in advance as the big players. Large suppliers will hedge more than a year in advance in some cases. Future Energy, a minnow with 10,000 customers, was the first firm to fail last year, followed by One Select and its 36,000 consumers in December. The largest to collapse was Scotland-based Spark Energy, which had nearly 300,000 customers. Economy Energy appears to have been pinched both by the wholesale increases and customer service failings. \u201cUnfortunately, Economy Energy didn\u2019t get the basics right when it came to customer service, billing and payments, so when market conditions got tougher it didn\u2019t have the solid foundations on which to continue trading,\u201d said uSwitch.com energy expert Rik Smith. Another price comparison site, energyhelpline, said it expected 2019 to bring as many supplier bankruptices as 2018, while comparethemarket.com said it feared the failure would be the first of many. Concerns over the financial sustainability and customer service from some new players has prompted Ofgem to discuss tougher rules and checks for new entrants. \u201cOfgem\u2019s moves to tighten up the licensing rules should address the problem of unprepared companies coming into the market. But the continued failure of suppliers shows there are firms operating that require the regulator\u2019s urgent attention,\u201d said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.",

And the good news for cinemas is that this dark period comedy-drama is shaping up to be a big fat hit, with a debut of \u00a32.2m for the weekend (\u00a33.97m including previews). Director Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 previous biggest film was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/15/the-lobster-review-\">The Lobster</a>, which achieved a lifetime total of \u00a31.52m.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYb-wkehT1g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SYb-wkehT1g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The big question is whether The Favourite can match the giant numbers achieved by Darkest Hour (\u00a324.1m) and Three Billboards (\u00a315.2m).</p> <p>The latter title began with \u00a32.17m (\u00a32.36m including previews), so The Favourite is encouragingly ahead of the pace. Darkest Hour debuted with a bigger \u00a34.06m, benefiting from appeal to a huge swathe of older cinemagoers interested in Winston Churchill and the Dunkirk evacuation. The Favourite benefits from must-see cachet plus support for national treasure in waiting Olivia Colman, but its appeal to fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/06/the-kings-speech-review\">The King\u2019s Speech</a> is moot.</p> <h2><strong>The winner No 2: Mary Poppins Returns</strong></h2> <p>Despite its strong opening, The Favourite failed to dislodge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/12/mary-poppins-returns-review-sequel-emily-blunt\">Mary Poppins Returns</a> from the top spot. The magical-nanny sequel dropped 40% from the previous session, and has now grossed \u00a334.3m after 17 days. That number makes it the eighth-highest-grossing release of 2018, and it looks set to climb higher.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6dy7xQ8NeE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W6dy7xQ8NeE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The flop: Welcome to Marwen</strong></h2> <p>The new film from Robert Zemeckis landed outside the Top 10 with a disappointing \u00a3145,000 from 328 cinemas (\u00a3242,000 including takings on 1-3 January). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/19/welcome-to-marwen-review-steve-carell-mark-hogancamp\">Welcome to Marwen</a> stars Steve Carell as an artist who, after a vicious beating, retreats into a fantasy world, creating a small-scale second world war-era Belgian town in his back yard and populating it with dolls. Given a production budget estimated at up to $50m, Welcome to Marwen has already been declared a big cash loser for backers Universal, with losses up to $60m including marketing costs.</p> <p>The takeaway from Welcome to Marwen is that the storyline needed to be realised as a modestly budgeted arthouse film, rather than the CGI-heavy production delivered by Zemeckis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/28/mark-hogancamp-marwencol-jon-ronson-miniature-town-horrors-of-war\">The story</a> was previously told in acclaimed 2010 documentary Marwencol.</p> <h2><strong>The gravity defier: Bohemian Rhapsody</strong></h2> <p>Another week, and another stunning result for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/bohemian-rhapsody-review-freddie-mercury-biopic-bites-the-dust\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, which rises 10% from the previous session. This is on top of a 58% rise for the Freddie Mercury biopic last time around. The film grossed \u00a3726,000 at the weekend, pushing its tally so far to \u00a348.4m.</p> <p>Wins for best picture and best actor in the Golden Globes drama category on Sunday should help sustain Bohemian Rhapsody in the run-up to the Baftas and Oscars. The film enjoys a strong IMDb user rating of 8.3/10, plus a weaker Metacritic score of 49/100, indicating a large disparity between the audience and critical opinion on this title.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP0VHJYFOAU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mP0VHJYFOAU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>The market</strong></h2> <p>The box office summary for 2018 shows that a weak December took the shine off what had been shaping up to be a strong year. November ended with box office 3% ahead of 2017 for the same 11-month period. But December eroded that advantage, and box office for the whole of last year was essentially flat compared with 2017.</p> <p>Admissions data \u2013 the number of tickets sold \u2013 is calculated separately and takes longer to tabulate. When these numbers arrive, 2018 is expected to show a rise on 2017. If box office is flat and admissions rose, the logical conclusion is that cinema ticket prices fell slightly in 2018, thanks to the growing popularity of unlimited-use loyalty cards and two-for-one promotions. Vue has also been engaging in price discounting at many of its sites.</p> <p>For the 4-6 January weekend, box office is 2% up on the equivalent session from 2018. Cinema bookers now have hopes pinned on the arrival this week of awards contenders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/22/colette-review-keira-knightley-is-on-top-form-in-exhilarating-literary-biopic\">Colette</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/21/stan-and-ollie-review-laurel-and-hardy-steve-coogan-john-c-reilly\">Stan and Ollie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/08/the-front-runner-review-hugh-jackman-makes-headlines-in-nuanced-drama\">The Front Runner</a>, plus Kevin Hart/Bryan Cranston comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/09/the-upside-review-bryan-cranston-kevin-hart-toronto-film-festival-2017-tiff\">The Upside</a>, a remake of the French hit The Intouchables.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3jsfXDZLIY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-3jsfXDZLIY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>Top 10 </strong><strong>films, 4-6 January</strong></h2> <p>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mary-poppins-returns\">Mary Poppins Returns</a>, \u00a34,444,023 from 718 sites.

      "bodyText": "The winner No 1: The Favourite January and February represent the climax of awards season in the UK, when many of the films with the biggest chance of Oscar and Bafta wins are released. A year ago, those releases included best picture Oscar nominees Darkest Hour, The Shape of Water, Lady Bird, Phantom Thread, The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. This year, first out of the gate is The Favourite. And the good news for cinemas is that this dark period comedy-drama is shaping up to be a big fat hit, with a debut of \u00a32.2m for the weekend (\u00a33.97m including previews). Director Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 previous biggest film was The Lobster, which achieved a lifetime total of \u00a31.52m. The big question is whether The Favourite can match the giant numbers achieved by Darkest Hour (\u00a324.1m) and Three Billboards (\u00a315.2m). The latter title began with \u00a32.17m (\u00a32.36m including previews), so The Favourite is encouragingly ahead of the pace. Darkest Hour debuted with a bigger \u00a34.06m, benefiting from appeal to a huge swathe of older cinemagoers interested in Winston Churchill and the Dunkirk evacuation. The Favourite benefits from must-see cachet plus support for national treasure in waiting Olivia Colman, but its appeal to fans of The King\u2019s Speech is moot. The winner No 2: Mary Poppins Returns Despite its strong opening, The Favourite failed to dislodge Mary Poppins Returns from the top spot. The magical-nanny sequel dropped 40% from the previous session, and has now grossed \u00a334.3m after 17 days. That number makes it the eighth-highest-grossing release of 2018, and it looks set to climb higher. The flop: Welcome to Marwen The new film from Robert Zemeckis landed outside the Top 10 with a disappointing \u00a3145,000 from 328 cinemas (\u00a3242,000 including takings on 1-3 January). Welcome to Marwen stars Steve Carell as an artist who, after a vicious beating, retreats into a fantasy world, creating a small-scale second world war-era Belgian town in his back yard and populating it with dolls. Given a production budget estimated at up to $50m, Welcome to Marwen has already been declared a big cash loser for backers Universal, with losses up to $60m including marketing costs. The takeaway from Welcome to Marwen is that the storyline needed to be realised as a modestly budgeted arthouse film, rather than the CGI-heavy production delivered by Zemeckis. The story was previously told in acclaimed 2010 documentary Marwencol. The gravity defier: Bohemian Rhapsody Another week, and another stunning result for Bohemian Rhapsody, which rises 10% from the previous session. This is on top of a 58% rise for the Freddie Mercury biopic last time around. The film grossed \u00a3726,000 at the weekend, pushing its tally so far to \u00a348.4m. Wins for best picture and best actor in the Golden Globes drama category on Sunday should help sustain Bohemian Rhapsody in the run-up to the Baftas and Oscars. The film enjoys a strong IMDb user rating of 8.3/10, plus a weaker Metacritic score of 49/100, indicating a large disparity between the audience and critical opinion on this title. The market The box office summary for 2018 shows that a weak December took the shine off what had been shaping up to be a strong year. November ended with box office 3% ahead of 2017 for the same 11-month period. But December eroded that advantage, and box office for the whole of last year was essentially flat compared with 2017. Admissions data \u2013 the number of tickets sold \u2013 is calculated separately and takes longer to tabulate. When these numbers arrive, 2018 is expected to show a rise on 2017. If box office is flat and admissions rose, the logical conclusion is that cinema ticket prices fell slightly in 2018, thanks to the growing popularity of unlimited-use loyalty cards and two-for-one promotions. Vue has also been engaging in price discounting at many of its sites. For the 4-6 January weekend, box office is 2% up on the equivalent session from 2018. Cinema bookers now have hopes pinned on the arrival this week of awards contenders Colette, Stan and Ollie and The Front Runner, plus Kevin Hart/Bryan Cranston comedy The Upside, a remake of the French hit The Intouchables.

      "bodyText": "Bayern Munich have increased their offer for Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi to \u00a335m, with the 18-year-old having reiterated his desire to leave Stamford Bridge this month. A bid worth \u00a330m plus add-ons for the England youth forward was rejected, prompting Bayern to return with a deal they feel matches Chelsea\u2019s valuation. Hudson-Odoi has refused to discuss a new contract with Chelsea, having been offered a five-year deal last summer. It is understood he is keen to establish himself as a first-team player at a time when his former England Under-17 teammates Jadon Sancho and Reiss Nelson have benefited from moves to Germany. On Monday Maurizio Sarri urged Hudson-Odoi to stay. \u201cI don\u2019t think a move to Germany would be good for him,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. \u201cHe is an English player, he is very young and I think he has a very good future here; with the England team and with Chelsea. I think he is a very important player. \u201cHe is ready for the Premier League. Of course we have very important players in the same position and I can play with only two wingers. Three is difficult. But he is ready. Some times he will be on the bench but I think I can start to consider him on the same level as Willian and Pedro.\u201d",

The fresh row between the two Nato allies broke out as the US national security adviser, John Bolton, visited Ankara to row back on a surprise announcement by Donald Trump in December that US forces would leave Syria imminently, abandoning Kurdish proxies who had led its ground war against the Islamic State terror group. Turkey views those same Kurdish groups as mortal foes. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, in a scathing speech to parliament delivered while Bolton was still in the Turkish capital, said the US envoy had \u201cmade a serious mistake\u201d and that Turkey would never agree to a compromise that protected the Kurdish militia, known as the YPG, whose members helped a US-led coalition push Isis out of most of Syria\u2019s east. \u201cElements of the US administration are saying different things,\u201d said Erdo\u011fan. \u201cThe YPG and the PKK can never be representatives of the Kurdish people.\u201d Erdo\u011fan, signalling the rift, refused to meet Bolton, leaving the US national security adviser to instead hold talks with his Turkish counterpart, Ibrahim Kalin, and other officials at Ankara\u2019s presidency complex. The Turkish leader said Turkey\u2019s armed forces had finished preparations to enter Syria and that Washington was stalling on a commitment to leave the town of Manbij as a first step. Bolton, before arriving in Ankara, had directly contradicted the US president, claiming Washington would not leave Syria without first receiving guarantees that Turkey would not attack its allies. Trump later claimed this was \u201cno different from my original statements\u201d, but said the US would leave \u201cat a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!\u201d Bolton\u2019s added condition came amid a furore over Trump\u2019s claims that Isis had been defeated and his apparent disregard for the fate of Kurdish forces recruited for the cause, whom Ankara had never accepted as legitimate allies. Erdo\u011fan on Tuesday repeated his insistence that there was no distinction between the YPG in Syria and the PKK in Turkey, with whom Ankara has fought a four-decade civil war. Throughout the Syrian war, and in particular since the US partnered with the Kurds in 2014, Turkey has been deeply wary of Kurdish postwar ambitions, and what they might mean for the 500-mile border it shares with its southern neighbour. An emboldened Kurdish cause has been a nightmare scenario for Turkish officials, whose crackdown on the Kurds inside Syria intensified 11 months ago, when the country\u2019s military invaded an enclave in Syria\u2019s north-west, ousting the YPG from the town of Afrin. A schism between Turkey and the US over the fate of north-eastern Syria had grown since the Afrin operation, which also sparked tensions between Washington and its Kurdish-led anti-Isis force, which had implored its sponsor to defend it from the Turkish incursion. Since then, the Isis fight has slowed and there have been fears that it might stop altogether, just as the terror group faces a military defeat in the last slithers of lands it holds along the Iraqi-Syrian border. Regional security officials say as many as 5,000 diehard Isis members remain in the area, with potentially more having abandoned their weapons and filtered back into towns and villages on both sides of the border, where they have been biding their time. The group has retained significant firepower; on Saturday, Isis members fired a guided missile at a Kurdish position, seriously wounding two British special forces members who were assisting the local fighters. Britain and France, with growing uncertainty over US plans, had stepped up engagement with Kurdish forces with whom they too have partnered against Isis in Syria\u2019s eastern deserts over the past four years. Bolton was on Tuesday joined in the region by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, whose arrival appeared to be part of a rearguard to assure the Kurds and other allies that the US was not abandoning its stated strategies of defeating Isis and curbing Iranian influence. Both Bolton and Pompeo are Iran hawks and their oft-stated goals had been thrown into confusion after Trump\u2019s December announcement.

That would seriously weaken international rugby and fail, in the longer term, to assist the Bath owner, Bruce Craig, and others at the forefront of the new enterprise. \u201cBruce wants his best international-quality players available to him but he also knows they become better players if they play for their country,\u201d said one insider. \u201cHe\u2019s not stupid.\u201d It is equally true the RFU cannot simply stick its head in the sand and wait for its worst nightmare to disappear. Nor can the union say it has not been warned. \u201cWhen London Welsh went bust they should have got round the table and said: \u2018How are we going to stop this ever happening again?\u2019 said another source. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done it. It is a massive own goal.\u201d Those of us who believe in rugby remaining open to all also have to acknowledge that, in a professional sport, money talks. If there were enough sugar daddies keen to fund a fully pro second domestic tier they would have stepped forward by now. It would not surprise me if, eventually, some kind of global conference system materialises with a world club final at its apex. It will be rugby, Jim, but not as we know it. Which, for its new investors, is the whole point of the exercise. Sunken Bath Losing a couple of players to the sin-bin might be considered unfortunate; being shown a red card and three yellows is beyond careless. And yet still Bath were not finished off by Worcester until the 99th minute at Sixways as the game\u2019s labyrinthine regulations and interminable sanctions regarding close-range scrum offences took their course. Gripping stuff, in a perverse sort of way, but not something anyone wants to see every week. Referees are increasingly being placed in an invidious position and a law change should be the consequence. Any side in receipt of three simultaneous yellow cards should automatically have a penalty try awarded against them. One to watch Not a team or a player this week but a dinner. Each year the Rugby Union Writers\u2019 Club hosts its celebrated annual dinner in London as an antidote to dry January and much else besides. There have been some legendary nights down the years and the shortlist for the Pat Marshall Trophy, awarded to the personality of the year, is once again excellent. In alphabetical order it reads: Tadhg Furlong, Siya Kolisi, Stuart Lancaster, Joe Schmidt and Johnny Sexton. The winner will be announced at the dinner next Monday.",

This increases the odds that gentrification will lead to displacement, as residents find that once they\u2019re priced out of their homes there are few other places for them to move into.</p> <p>In addition, Zillow Research found that communities see <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/homelessness-rent-affordability-22247/\">rapid increases in homelessness</a> when people begin spending more than one-third of their income on rent.</p> <p>In Seattle, rents were actually in line with the national average until 2010. Since then, <a href=\"https://www.builderonline.com/money/economics/the-amazon-effect-rising-rents_o\">they\u2019ve jumped by over 40%</a>. Now the city has the third highest number of homeless residents in the nation.</p> <p>Amazon chose to build two major new offices, one in New York and one in Arlington, Virginia, after a year-long competition between cities around the US, soliciting bids for a location. In return for the jobs, which Amazon says will pay an average of $150,000 a year, the company will get at least $1.5bn in cash subsidies and tax breaks from New York state, and another $1.3bn in tax breaks from the city. The mayor and governor claim they will come out on top, getting $9 back in revenue for every dollar spent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People are going to be kicked out of their homes.

      "bodyText": "Juan Rivera has lived in Long Island City, in Queens, for a month \u2013 but has never been to the part of the neighborhood where Amazon will soon establish its New York City headquarters. \u201cThe only time I leave this side is to go to my program,\u201d says the 28-year-old Puerto Rican native, referring to the methadone clinic he visits in Manhattan five times a week. He spends the rest of his time watching YouTube in his room at his homeless shelter, a former hotel in an enclave of Long Island City known as Blissville. With his cigarette, Rivera gestures towards the sleek glass towers on the other side of the train yard that divides the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ll probably never go over there,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to.\u201d In all likelihood, Amazon\u2019s incoming workers won\u2019t visit Rivera\u2019s side of the neighborhood, either. They will be more interested in the luxury waterfront condos with jaw-dropping views, the hip restaurant scene, and fast links to midtown Manhattan. When the deal was announced, such was the scramble for hot property there some Amazon workers were even reported to be buying condos by text. But the the proximity of Blissville and the assumed development zone for Amazon tells a story of the competing pressures and choices that cities must make, with some experts, and residents, warning the Amazon deal will compound problems for the most vulnerable residents. Seattle, Amazon\u2019s home city, has experienced rising rents and homelessness in recent years. New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio hailed the deal to lure one of the tech giant\u2019s next major hubs to New York city last November, touting its promise to ultimately bring 25,000 Amazon workers to 4m sq ft of office space on the waterfront site. But De Blasio has also looked at Long Island City as part of his plan to to tackle New York\u2019s homelessness epidemic, with three shelters with the capacity to house more than 400 people opening in Blissville since 2017. Now, the number of homeless in tiny Blissville rivals the number of permanent residents, estimated at around 475 people. \u2018No basic services\u2019 Blissville hasn\u2019t shared in the wealth that has poured into the other end of Long Island City, with its windswept expanse of warehouses and autobody shops abutting Newtown Creek, a Superfund site. \u201cThere\u2019s no basic community services here, no supermarkets, playgrounds, parks, libraries, churches \u2013 nothing,\u201d says resident Warren Davis. \u201cThe city neglects us because people here are working class, or undocumented.\u201d Until 2001, Davis lived on Amazon\u2019s side of the neighborhood, back when it was gritty and quiet. \u201cWhat Blissville is now, that\u2019s what that side of Long Island City was then,\u201d he says. Over the past decade, priced-out Manhattanites discovered Long Island City, making it New York\u2019s fastest growing neighborhood. But few of them moved to its Blissville section, which lacks skyline views and is farther from the subway. Instead, Blissville became a focus of \u201cTurning the Tide,\u201d the mayoral program to consolidate the city\u2019s 360 shelter facilities into a smaller system. The move has exasperated some residents. \u201cWhen they started coming here, we had some issues,\u201d says Davis. \u201cTrespassing, littering, public drunkenness, open drug use, occasionally some violence.\u201d He says things have calmed down since the weather turned cold. Rahhid Asif, owner of Midtown Deli &amp; Grocery, says the shelters have actually been a boon for business. \u201cThey come in to get out of the cold, then they hang out and buy things,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m selling a lot of coffee these days.\u201d Rent increases in \u2018condo corridor\u2019 Twelve blocks away, across the tracks, coffee sales are up at Toby\u2019s Estate, too \u2013 in this case, mostly of the fair trade espresso and pour-over variety. \u201cI can\u2019t say we were early adopters of Long Island City,\u201d says co-owner Amber Jacobsen, who opened the cafe in 2017. \u201cBut this is a great location for us, being so close to a transport hub.\u201d Housed in a former artist\u2019s studio in the heart of Long Island City\u2019s condo corridor, Toby\u2019s was bustling on a recent afternoon with smartly dressed customers lined up, credit cards in hand. For her part, Jacobsen believes Amazon will encourage more businesses to open nearby. \u201cThe more, the merrier,\u201d she says. \u201cThe real estate people have been incredibly thoughtful with the curation of the area, trying to attract the right mix of retail.\u201d That has taken place amid a construction boom that has seen more new rental apartments built in Long Island City since 2010 than in any other neighborhood in the country. Despite the new housing stock, rents rose by 18% here during the same period, according to a StreetEasy analysis. Now, analysts warn that the arrival of thousands of well-paid tech workers could push prices even higher. Rents may actually jump even more dramatically in adjacent areas like Blissville. According to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, when prices rise, \u201cpoor neighborhoods that are in close proximity to the rich neighborhoods are the ones that have housing prices increase the most\u201d. This creates exactly the kind of conditions that can lead to a rise in homelessness. In areas of New York where the average rent is under $800, vacancy rates are a paper-thin 1%. This increases the odds that gentrification will lead to displacement, as residents find that once they\u2019re priced out of their homes there are few other places for them to move into. In addition, Zillow Research found that communities see rapid increases in homelessness when people begin spending more than one-third of their income on rent. In Seattle, rents were actually in line with the national average until 2010. Since then, they\u2019ve jumped by over 40%. Now the city has the third highest number of homeless residents in the nation. Amazon chose to build two major new offices, one in New York and one in Arlington, Virginia, after a year-long competition between cities around the US, soliciting bids for a location. In return for the jobs, which Amazon says will pay an average of $150,000 a year, the company will get at least $1.5bn in cash subsidies and tax breaks from New York state, and another $1.3bn in tax breaks from the city. The mayor and governor claim they will come out on top, getting $9 back in revenue for every dollar spent. But critics like Greg LeRoy of the DC-based Good Jobs First thinktank, which monitors such subsidies, question whether the deal is really good for residents and taxpayers. Amazon did not respond to a request from the Guardian to comment. It has previously promised to help fund community infrastructure improvements in Long Island City and provide space on its campus for artists, industrial businesses and a tech startup incubator. \u201cThe team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities,\u201d said Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. Top priority Mayor De Blasio has made fighting homelessness a top priority. Under his tenure, rising homelessness rates have leveled off, though they remain at record highs. And while Turning the Tide aims to reduce the number of people in shelters, Amazon\u2019s move to New York, which De Blasio was instrumental in orchestrating, could exacerbate the very problem that the program is designed to combat. \u201cMost folks become homeless because of eviction, overcrowding, tenuous housing,\u201d says Giselle Routhier, policy director at the Coalition for the Homeless. \u201cBasically, they can\u2019t keep up with the rent.\u201d That means that in a tight housing market like New York\u2019s, even the gainfully employed can end up homeless. Ricky Rivers, 30, works nights in a FedEx package sorting facility. Despite the regular paycheck, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t have the money to stay anywhere\u201d. He\u2019s been living at a Blissville shelter until he can find permanent housing he can afford. \u201cIt\u2019s just somewhere to sleep during the day.\u201d Congress member Carolyn Maloney, who represents the district containing Long Island City, says that keeping permanent housing within reach is \u201cone of New York\u2019s biggest challenges\u201d. \u201cWith or without Amazon, New Yorkers are paying increasingly high portions of their income in rent, and not enough is being done to address the needs of people who are very low income, which is exacerbating our homelessness crisis,\u201d she said in a statement.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s lunchtime at a stalwart Beverly Hills steakhouse when the door swings open and the room lights up. Retta has arrived. The comedian and actor who spun a background part on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/15/park-and-recreation-amy-poehler\" title=\"\">the sitcom Parks and Recreation</a> into major roles on two TV series \u2013 the heist drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/07/mad-women-angry-sisterhood-taking-over-tv\" title=\"\">Good Girls</a>, and the fizzy and ferocious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/02/girlfriends-guide-divorce-sex-and-the-city-golden-girls\" title=\"\">Girlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce</a> \u2013 plus her recent book of essays, So Close to Being the Sh*T, Y\u2019all Don\u2019t Even Know, sits down at a table. Across from us, industry titans Ron Howard, Judd Apatow and Brian Grazer split a shrimp cocktail.</p> <p>Retta \u2013 full name Marietta Sangai Sirleaf \u2013 orders a caipirinha. She so adores the Brazilian cocktail that the writers for Girlfriends\u2019 Guide put the drink in the show. The waiter doesn\u2019t know what a caipirinha is, but he\u2019s game to give it a try. For Retta, anything.</p> <p>Retta takes a sip, adds a little sugar, takes a longer sip, and smiles. Any Parks and Rec fan observing the moment would know exactly what to say: \u201cTreat yo\u2019 self!\u201d Her character, Donna Meagle, a small-town government employee with glamorous taste, turned that phrase into a mantra. On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/treatyoself/top/\" title=\"\">Instagram, #treatyoself</a> has been used 4.3m times over photos of manicures, chocolate pancakes, shoes, bubble baths and tacos, making Retta the patron saint of indulgence. Naturally, when the waiter asks if she would like a second caipirinha, she doesn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cI would.\u201d</p> <p>Retta, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/12/self-care-problems-solange-knowles\" title=\"\">does not say \u201cTreat yo\u2019 self!\u201d</a> It\u2019s implied, and besides, she has heard it plenty. Out of car windows, in the comments on her Instagram posts, sometimes in shops, where the cashier plays it cool until they have swiped her card. In those moments, she knows she has been recognised. Getting used to the attention took a while. For the first two seasons of Parks and Rec, playing Donna meant pretending to type at a desk in the background and giving the side-eye to the show\u2019s stars Amy Poehler and Chris Pratt. Retta was ninth on the callsheet \u2013 the last name on the list \u2013 when she noticed a girl at her neighbourhood bar giving her the side-eye.</p> <p>\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m not interested in your boyfriend,\u2019\u201d Retta says. Then the girl said she loved her on TV. \u201cIt never even dawned on me!\u201d she admits. In season three, Retta got promoted to a full-time cast member and, as the only black regular on the show, got her own lights. When Rob Lowe noticed her extra attention, he did a double-take: \u201cDo you have your own lighting?\u201d Donna\u2019s delayed emergence turned out to be a blessing. By then, the writers knew who Retta was \u2013 sensible, picky, swoony for Michael Fassbender and prone to live-tweeting her favourite shows \u2013 and they folded those details into Donna, moulding the character to her instead of cramming her into a cliche. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t the stereotypical sassy, big, black woman,\u201d Retta writes in her book. That was a gift \u2013 although creating well-rounded female black characters should just be a basic part of a writer\u2019s job. \u201cAs a plus-sized black girl, we\u2019re usually a trope,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI welcome the opportunity to play human beings.\u201d</p> <p>It was an uphill trek from sidekick to star. \u201cIt took me 20 years to get to this place,\u201d she says. She has just driven by the Taco Bell she used to visit every day as a broke standup, after she won a contest that included a year\u2019s supply of chalupas. \u201cI went there probably 350 days.\u201d</p> <p>Retta is regimented enough that you believe her. She\u2019s addicted to to-do lists. \u201cI will kill myself to come up with benign shit to add so it looks like I\u2019ve done stuff, like: go get the mail.\u201d Not only does she keep her closet colour-coordinated, she bought a professional T-shirt-folding board so that her wardrobe looks as tidy as a store. (Yes, she folds them herself, occasionally uploading the soothing videos to social media.) And then there\u2019s her handbag collection. She grins as she swipes through photos on her smartphone of luxury bags that gleam under spotlights like gems. When people ask Retta how she treats herself, she points to them, in part because the designers she likes still don\u2019t make clothes in her size. As she says: \u201cHandbags never don\u2019t fit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84ffcbcae04414869004c1bde828bcb49d1f224c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ffcbcae04414869004c1bde828bcb49d1f224c/0_0_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Lidya Jewett in Good Girls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Lidya Jewett in Good Girls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Television/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has been an overachiever since childhood, when she was still going by her full name. Her parents were Liberian immigrants with high expectations for their family. (Retta\u2019s aunt Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was the president of Liberia for 12 years from 2006, the first elected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jul/23/can-president-ellen-johnson-sirleaf-save-liberia\" title=\"\">female head of state in Africa</a>.) Retta was born in Newark, New Jersey, but spent her early years in Liberia. She can still remember her relatives making food in her grandfather\u2019s backyard, and the cold sugar cane that the ice-cream man would sell on the street. But then it was back to life in 1980s New Jersey, where Retta was all over her high-school yearbook. \u201cFrench club, calculus club, cheerleading, managing wrestling, home-ec club, I was everywhere,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was idyllic.\u201d</p> <p>Money was tight. Retta shared a bedroom with two brothers and a cousin. She poured water on cornflakes when they couldn\u2019t buy milk. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford movies,\u201d she says. TV became her creative escape \u2013 and her goal. Young Retta wanted her own sitcom, a goal that sounded impossible when she said it out loud. Instead, she graduated from Duke University and became a chemist. \u201cAll I did was link amino acids,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I moved on to small molecules.\u201d</p> <p>She was good at the work, winning an in-house competition in the year she spent working at GlaxoSmithKline in North Carolina. Then she had a lightbulb moment: What if she approached TV stardom like a science experiment?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a math person,\u201d she says. Most successful sitcoms had a comedian at the centre. \u201cSo I put all these steps down and I was like: \u2018All right, I have to do standup!\u2019 I was always funny, but now I had to figure out how to piece together a set.\u201d</p> <p>One night at an open mic, the MC stumbled over introducing a \u201cMarietta Sirleaf.\u201d \u201cJust Retta,\u201d she said. The name stuck.</p> <p>Retta retired her lab coat, moved to Los Angeles, won those tacos, toured colleges and got better. She wrote jokes lampooning assumptions people might make about her, such as a bit about a woman who sneers at her at a stoplight for singing along to rap, until Retta rolls down the window to belt Vivaldi\u2019s Laudamus Te. Although she has never studied opera, Retta hits the notes perfectly here at the table. \u201cI\u2019m a good mimic,\u201d she shrugs.</p> <p>After two years campus-hopping, she was burned-out on cheap motels, although they did inspire a gag where she would tuck a mini-soap under a roll of flesh on her stomach. She came back to LA and got serious about auditioning. That was rough. The parts weren\u2019t good \u2013 tired caricatures of sassy, big black woman \u2013 but she wasn\u2019t landing them anyway. Her agents would forget she existed. But Retta stayed focused.</p> <p>\u201cI never let myself lament about being a woman in comedy, because if I did, then I\u2019m angry and I\u2019m moving in anger as opposed to moving in positivity,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to be mad. I mean, black people do it all the time, women do it all the time: take the gig and show them what you can do, in the hopes of getting the opportunity to really show them what you can do.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s easy to say, of course. In reality, confidence is hard to maintain. Retta opens her book of personal essays with a confession about ghosting the producers of Dreamgirls when she was too nervous to try out for the part that would win Jennifer Hudson an Oscar. Regret, she learned, stings more than any potential rejection.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to start [the book] by showing my fears,\u201d she says. Losing them, she says, has been like being handed an inhaler. \u201cYou\u2019re able to breathe,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t have fear. But I\u2019m getting to a place where it doesn\u2019t paralyse me.\u201d</p> <p>She has learned to control her emotions. That\u2019s part of her next phase: becoming a dramatic actress. During Parks and Rec, Retta would unnerve her cast mates by crying on command, such as in the episode where Pratt\u2019s Andy Dwyer describes the plot of the film Babe. \u201cChris Pratt goes: \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re going to fucking win an Oscar someday because that was legit!\u2019\u201d beams Retta. Suddenly, her face goes serious. And there it is, a tear.</p> <p>\u201cOn Good Girls, that\u2019s all that I do,\u201d she says, drying her eyes. Her character, Ruby, is a waitress with a hospitalised daughter \u2013 and medical bills she will rob a grocery store to pay, if it will keep her child alive. Good Girls has been special for a couple of reasons. First, the messages she has received from the mothers of disabled children, who love Ruby as much as she does. Second, that Ruby was written with her in mind: she didn\u2019t have to audition. After two decades of chasing her TV hopes, Retta finally feels seen.</p> <p>How to celebrate? Treating herself, of course. The TV obsessive recently installed a television in every room in her house, so she\u2019s always near the glowing screen that has guided her life. \u201cMy bedroom has a TV. My bathroom has a TV. My closet has a TV,\u201d she says, counting off the sets on her fingers. A friend worried that her house was going to start looking like a sports bar. Retta bursts out laughing. \u201cThat is the dream!\u201d</p>",

The comedian and actor who spun a background part on the sitcom Parks and Recreation into major roles on two TV series \u2013 the heist drama Good Girls, and the fizzy and ferocious Girlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce \u2013 plus her recent book of essays, So Close to Being the Sh*T, Y\u2019all Don\u2019t Even Know, sits down at a table. Across from us, industry titans Ron Howard, Judd Apatow and Brian Grazer split a shrimp cocktail. Retta \u2013 full name Marietta Sangai Sirleaf \u2013 orders a caipirinha. She so adores the Brazilian cocktail that the writers for Girlfriends\u2019 Guide put the drink in the show. The waiter doesn\u2019t know what a caipirinha is, but he\u2019s game to give it a try. For Retta, anything. Retta takes a sip, adds a little sugar, takes a longer sip, and smiles. Any Parks and Rec fan observing the moment would know exactly what to say: \u201cTreat yo\u2019 self!\u201d Her character, Donna Meagle, a small-town government employee with glamorous taste, turned that phrase into a mantra. On Instagram, #treatyoself has been used 4.3m times over photos of manicures, chocolate pancakes, shoes, bubble baths and tacos, making Retta the patron saint of indulgence. Naturally, when the waiter asks if she would like a second caipirinha, she doesn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cI would.\u201d Retta, of course, does not say \u201cTreat yo\u2019 self!\u201d It\u2019s implied, and besides, she has heard it plenty. Out of car windows, in the comments on her Instagram posts, sometimes in shops, where the cashier plays it cool until they have swiped her card. In those moments, she knows she has been recognised. Getting used to the attention took a while. For the first two seasons of Parks and Rec, playing Donna meant pretending to type at a desk in the background and giving the side-eye to the show\u2019s stars Amy Poehler and Chris Pratt. Retta was ninth on the callsheet \u2013 the last name on the list \u2013 when she noticed a girl at her neighbourhood bar giving her the side-eye. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m not interested in your boyfriend,\u2019\u201d Retta says. Then the girl said she loved her on TV. \u201cIt never even dawned on me!\u201d she admits. In season three, Retta got promoted to a full-time cast member and, as the only black regular on the show, got her own lights. When Rob Lowe noticed her extra attention, he did a double-take: \u201cDo you have your own lighting?\u201d Donna\u2019s delayed emergence turned out to be a blessing. By then, the writers knew who Retta was \u2013 sensible, picky, swoony for Michael Fassbender and prone to live-tweeting her favourite shows \u2013 and they folded those details into Donna, moulding the character to her instead of cramming her into a cliche. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t the stereotypical sassy, big, black woman,\u201d Retta writes in her book. That was a gift \u2013 although creating well-rounded female black characters should just be a basic part of a writer\u2019s job. \u201cAs a plus-sized black girl, we\u2019re usually a trope,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI welcome the opportunity to play human beings.\u201d It was an uphill trek from sidekick to star. \u201cIt took me 20 years to get to this place,\u201d she says. She has just driven by the Taco Bell she used to visit every day as a broke standup, after she won a contest that included a year\u2019s supply of chalupas. \u201cI went there probably 350 days.\u201d Retta is regimented enough that you believe her. She\u2019s addicted to to-do lists. \u201cI will kill myself to come up with benign shit to add so it looks like I\u2019ve done stuff, like: go get the mail.\u201d Not only does she keep her closet colour-coordinated, she bought a professional T-shirt-folding board so that her wardrobe looks as tidy as a store. (Yes, she folds them herself, occasionally uploading the soothing videos to social media.) And then there\u2019s her handbag collection. She grins as she swipes through photos on her smartphone of luxury bags that gleam under spotlights like gems. When people ask Retta how she treats herself, she points to them, in part because the designers she likes still don\u2019t make clothes in her size. As she says: \u201cHandbags never don\u2019t fit.\u201d She has been an overachiever since childhood, when she was still going by her full name. Her parents were Liberian immigrants with high expectations for their family. (Retta\u2019s aunt Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was the president of Liberia for 12 years from 2006, the first elected female head of state in Africa.) Retta was born in Newark, New Jersey, but spent her early years in Liberia. She can still remember her relatives making food in her grandfather\u2019s backyard, and the cold sugar cane that the ice-cream man would sell on the street. But then it was back to life in 1980s New Jersey, where Retta was all over her high-school yearbook. \u201cFrench club, calculus club, cheerleading, managing wrestling, home-ec club, I was everywhere,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was idyllic.\u201d Money was tight. Retta shared a bedroom with two brothers and a cousin. She poured water on cornflakes when they couldn\u2019t buy milk. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford movies,\u201d she says. TV became her creative escape \u2013 and her goal. Young Retta wanted her own sitcom, a goal that sounded impossible when she said it out loud. Instead, she graduated from Duke University and became a chemist. \u201cAll I did was link amino acids,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I moved on to small molecules.\u201d She was good at the work, winning an in-house competition in the year she spent working at GlaxoSmithKline in North Carolina. Then she had a lightbulb moment: What if she approached TV stardom like a science experiment? \u201cI\u2019m a math person,\u201d she says. Most successful sitcoms had a comedian at the centre. \u201cSo I put all these steps down and I was like: \u2018All right, I have to do standup!\u2019 I was always funny, but now I had to figure out how to piece together a set.\u201d One night at an open mic, the MC stumbled over introducing a \u201cMarietta Sirleaf.\u201d \u201cJust Retta,\u201d she said. The name stuck. Retta retired her lab coat, moved to Los Angeles, won those tacos, toured colleges and got better. She wrote jokes lampooning assumptions people might make about her, such as a bit about a woman who sneers at her at a stoplight for singing along to rap, until Retta rolls down the window to belt Vivaldi\u2019s Laudamus Te. Although she has never studied opera, Retta hits the notes perfectly here at the table. \u201cI\u2019m a good mimic,\u201d she shrugs. After two years campus-hopping, she was burned-out on cheap motels, although they did inspire a gag where she would tuck a mini-soap under a roll of flesh on her stomach. She came back to LA and got serious about auditioning. That was rough. The parts weren\u2019t good \u2013 tired caricatures of sassy, big black woman \u2013 but she wasn\u2019t landing them anyway. Her agents would forget she existed. But Retta stayed focused. \u201cI never let myself lament about being a woman in comedy, because if I did, then I\u2019m angry and I\u2019m moving in anger as opposed to moving in positivity,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to be mad. I mean, black people do it all the time, women do it all the time: take the gig and show them what you can do, in the hopes of getting the opportunity to really show them what you can do.\u201d That\u2019s easy to say, of course. In reality, confidence is hard to maintain. Retta opens her book of personal essays with a confession about ghosting the producers of Dreamgirls when she was too nervous to try out for the part that would win Jennifer Hudson an Oscar. Regret, she learned, stings more than any potential rejection. \u201cI wanted to start [the book] by showing my fears,\u201d she says. Losing them, she says, has been like being handed an inhaler. \u201cYou\u2019re able to breathe,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t have fear. But I\u2019m getting to a place where it doesn\u2019t paralyse me.\u201d She has learned to control her emotions. That\u2019s part of her next phase: becoming a dramatic actress. During Parks and Rec, Retta would unnerve her cast mates by crying on command, such as in the episode where Pratt\u2019s Andy Dwyer describes the plot of the film Babe. \u201cChris Pratt goes: \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re going to fucking win an Oscar someday because that was legit!\u2019\u201d beams Retta. Suddenly, her face goes serious. And there it is, a tear. \u201cOn Good Girls, that\u2019s all that I do,\u201d she says, drying her eyes. Her character, Ruby, is a waitress with a hospitalised daughter \u2013 and medical bills she will rob a grocery store to pay, if it will keep her child alive. Good Girls has been special for a couple of reasons. First, the messages she has received from the mothers of disabled children, who love Ruby as much as she does. Second, that Ruby was written with her in mind: she didn\u2019t have to audition. After two decades of chasing her TV hopes, Retta finally feels seen. How to celebrate? Treating herself, of course. The TV obsessive recently installed a television in every room in her house, so she\u2019s always near the glowing screen that has guided her life. \u201cMy bedroom has a TV. My bathroom has a TV. My closet has a TV,\u201d she says, counting off the sets on her fingers. A friend worried that her house was going to start looking like a sports bar. Retta bursts out laughing. \u201cThat is the dream!\u201d",

The \u201cprofoundly negative effect on forest and woodland\u201d the writer warns of won\u2019t be the result of an increase of 4 billion mouths. The planet will be two or three degrees hotter by the middle of this century, coasts and even whole countries will be underwater, agriculture impossible, potable water scarce and those trees, bushes and all the life they contained dead. Thirst and starvation, migration and war will cause the deaths of many, if not most, of us human beings and whatever fauna, flora and invertebrates we haven\u2019t already exterminated. It is we who will control our population. Or not.</p> <p>Some delegates at the Poland climate conference knew this, and many others would have objected to politics interfering with our God-given right to propagate.

Although increased household incomes and wider access to education often result in lower birthrates, these are not the key issues. What is never discussed is that millions of women across the world have no power over their reproduction or their sexual activity. They do not have the right to say \u201cno\u201d.</p> <p>This is a deeply rooted cultural issue, but women\u2019s empowerment is fundamental to our survival. Neither sustainable development goals nor stemming climate change will be achieved until all women have freedom to make their own reproductive decisions.

      "bodyText": "We cannot regulate human selfishness Your letter on climate change (21 December), intelligent as it is, has it backwards. The \u201cprofoundly negative effect on forest and woodland\u201d the writer warns of won\u2019t be the result of an increase of 4 billion mouths. The planet will be two or three degrees hotter by the middle of this century, coasts and even whole countries will be underwater, agriculture impossible, potable water scarce and those trees, bushes and all the life they contained dead. Thirst and starvation, migration and war will cause the deaths of many, if not most, of us human beings and whatever fauna, flora and invertebrates we haven\u2019t already exterminated. It is we who will control our population. Or not. Some delegates at the Poland climate conference knew this, and many others would have objected to politics interfering with our God-given right to propagate. No different, really, from our right to be greedy, selfish, careless and destructive, none of which can be tamed or regulated. Bryna Hellmann Amsterdam, The Netherlands \u2022 I can understand the idea that population growth seems to be a taboo topic. Although increased household incomes and wider access to education often result in lower birthrates, these are not the key issues. What is never discussed is that millions of women across the world have no power over their reproduction or their sexual activity. They do not have the right to say \u201cno\u201d. This is a deeply rooted cultural issue, but women\u2019s empowerment is fundamental to our survival. Neither sustainable development goals nor stemming climate change will be achieved until all women have freedom to make their own reproductive decisions. I fear this will take more than the 12 years we have left to slow climate breakdown. Trish Nicholson Northland, New Zealand China is just copying the US playbook Reading your article Beijing calling (14 December), one wonders how many of the media strategies used today by China are copied from the book written by the US media during the 1950s and 1960s to tell the US story well. In fact, one asks oneself, how much is still going on behind the scene where US money is funding media for making the foreign serve the US? And then, lo and behold, five pages later George Monbiot tells us what the Koch brothers are up to in the UK. The parallels are hard to ignore. And, nota bene, this letter is neither funded by the Chinese nor by the Kochs. Martin Skogsbeck Mougins, France Issue of class dominated the Grenfell inquiry I was impressed by the eloquence and sensitivity of Tim Adams\u2019s report on the Grenfell inquiry (14 December). It seems to me that behind this eloquence is one word: class. As with most of the inquiries referenced, the victims were lower class, the judges, lawyers and managers, upper class. The traditional tendency of the upper class is to be deaf to the feelings of the lower classes and to close ranks when called to account. Adams highlights the softening of the judge\u2019s attitude after hearing of the trauma and grief of the survivors and also the influence of Bishop James Jones\u2019s report on the Hillsborough inquiry, which he called \u201cthe patronising disposition of unaccountable power\u201d. Could these be signs, almost a thousand years after the Norman conquest, that the British class system is withering? Edward Butterworth Victoria, British Columbia, Canada White rich men can\u2019t win \u2013 at least most of the time Regarding your 21 December story Billionaires aim to turn their fire on Trump: When did these three money-spinners (Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and Howard Schultz) \u2013 their heads in the clouds \u2013 forget Karl Rove\u2019s astute axiom (from the Obama v Romney matchup) that old, rich white guys are unelectable here on out? Ah, but what of the inimitable Mr Trump? A fluke, a mere blip on the screen, an aberration. RM Fransson Wheat Ridge, Colorado, US",

      "bodyText": "When Andy Murray berated a social media troll as \u201ca clown\u201d for accusing him and other senior players of extending their careers \u201cjust for the money\u201d, he will have had a sympathetic audience in nearly every corner of the locker room. Injury has already robbed the Australian Open of the perennially fragile Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, and Alexander Zverev has put himself on the doubtful list. Kyle Edmund and Jo Konta are carrying injuries that might also put them out of the season\u2019s first slam. This is a tough gig. Of those still standing, several will embark on the Melbourne fortnight this weekend in hope rather than expectation. As angry as Murray was on behalf of friends and rivals who sweat blood for the love of the game when they might more comfortably be inspecting their retirement portfolios and tee-off times on the Algarve, some younger players give detractors plenty of ammunition. Murray\u2019s young rebel friend, Nick Kyrgios, is the villain du jour on any slow news day, along with his compatriot Bernard Tomic, who metaphorically waved his millions in front of critics after failing to qualify for the Australian Open two years ago. Kyrgios\u2019s latest crime was to get bitten by a spider over Christmas before losing limply in the Brisbane International, where he was the defending champion, then winding up media commentators he suspects do not \u201cunderstand\u201d him. The sulking genius \u201creportedly spent a few hours at a Canberra hospital\u201d, said one critic, who seemed reluctant to embrace the evidence of the player\u2019s own Instagram post, which showed him with a drip attached to his left arm. So, when Jeremy Chardy dumped Kyrgios out of the tournament \u2013 and the top 50, for the first time in four years \u2013 the game\u2019s free radical was primed to respond: \u201cI honestly could not care less.\u201d Kyrgios headed south looking as dispirited as he has done since injury shredded his 2018 season. But it\u2019s the perception of \u201cnot caring\u201d that disturbs traditionalists (and midnight trolls). If you don\u2019t care, you don\u2019t rate. That is why Naomi Osaka\u2019s reaction to one of her most wretched performances \u2013 losing in Brisbane to the world No 27, Leisa Tsurenko, in two one-sided sets \u2013 struck a chord across tennis. In a press conference that should stand as a model of common sense, the US Open champion and world No 5 spoke openly about what looked like a brain-dump under pressure. \u201cI feel like I had the worst attitude today,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I didn\u2019t really know how to cope with not playing well. I don\u2019t know ... I was sulking a little bit? There were moments when I tried not to do that, but then the ball wouldn\u2019t go in and I would go back to being childish. \u201cI feel like last year I did a lot of that. I\u2019m trying to change it more and I think I had towards the end of last year.\u201d She did, never more memorably than when keeping her cool as Serena Williams had a meltdown across the net in the US Open final. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily like watching myself play,\u201d Osaka added. \u201cAnd I know that people don\u2019t like to watch people who are so negative.\u201d To be fair to Kyrgios, he has said similar. He too can be wickedly honest, although he can perhaps come across as a \u201csmart-arse\u201d \u2013 which might give him perverse satisfaction. If Kyrgios and Osaka were to talk about their shared neuroses, he might rediscover the innocent, less cynical swagger that carried him to a sit-up-and-look fourth round win over Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2014. That performance, celebrated everywhere but in the Spaniard\u2019s camp, announced Kyrgios\u2019s arrival \u2013 much as an 18-year-old Tomic had done by reaching the quarter-finals there three years earlier.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your edge?\u201d the actor playing Craig Oliver asked Dominic Cummings in Monday night\u2019s TV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/it-presses-every-button-politicians-on-brexit-the-uncivil-war-benedict-cumberbatch-leave-campaign\" title=\"\">Brexit: The Uncivil War</a>. The programme does a decent job of demonstrating how Vote Leave used a superior slogan (\u201cTake back control\u201d) and false claims (on money for the NHS, and Turkey joining the EU) to capture the public mood. Sadly it brushes over the illegality of their overspending and overplays the role of their data wizards \u2013 who are now common in politics.</p> <p>But rather than looking backwards at 2016, the question posed by Oliver \u2013 David Cameron\u2019s then spin doctor \u2013 is perhaps more pertinent with regard to the prospect of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/15/how-would-a-second-brexit-referendum-work\" title=\"\">new referendum</a>. Some bookmakers have slashed the odds of a people\u2019s vote to virtually evens as Theresa May\u2019s deal looks destined to fail.</p> <p>Although my part in the TV drama was blink-and-you-miss-it, in reality I was part of the remain campaign from the start. My job was to build an organisation \u2013 Britain Stronger in Europe \u2013 from scratch, which ultimately employed 200 people around the country. I was there in 2015 when Oliver and the rest of Cameron\u2019s team wanted nothing to do with us as they pursued their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/02/eu-deal-key-points-what-cameron-wanted-and-what-he-got\" title=\"\">hopeless renegotiation of EU membership</a>. And I was there when, despite cordial relations, the No 10 team focused the campaign increasingly narrowly on economic risk.</p> <p>So what are the lessons if another referendum becomes the only route out of the current mess?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPX9MLALjAE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gPX9MLALjAE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Gordon Brown\u2019s video from the ruins of Coventry Cathedral was the most shared remain video during the referendum</figcaption> </figure>   <p>First, a new campaign will need an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/13/remain-mistakes-brexit-leavers\" title=\"\">emotionally resonant message</a> rather than relying solely on the \u201cfacts\u201d. The former prime minister Gordon Brown came closest to finding this tone when he argued that Britain should \u201clead not leave\u201d. His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPX9MLALjAE\" title=\"\">video from the ruins of Coventry Cathedral</a> making this case was the most shared remain video on Facebook during the referendum. Unfortunately, greater use of this slogan was dismissed by our pollsters. They insisted that voters simply wanted facts on the economic impact. \u201cTell them again\u201d is likely to be the leave slogan if there is a new vote. Something appropriately patriotic and uplifting will be needed on the remain side to compete.</p> <p>Second, political leadership must come from all major parties. Labour\u2019s refusal to join the official campaign meant that remain was dominated by David Cameron and George Osborne. Labour\u2019s logic was that sharing a platform with the Tories in the 2014 Scottish referendum had been fatal for the party, which was all but wiped out in Scotland at the next election. The consequences were that neither Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell nor even Alan Johnson, who led the independent \u201cLabour In\u201d campaign, were part of remain\u2019s central command. All the key decisions were taken by a small group close to the then-prime minister, and relayed back to campaign staff. Indeed, Peter Mandelson denies that the call with David Cameron portrayed in the TV drama ever took place.</p> <p>The No 10 team were full of hubris from their surprise (but narrow) general election victory, and thought they had all the answers. Having Labour at the top table would have forced a more balanced campaign and prevented groupthink.</p> <p>Third, the campaign must be prepared to take on its opponents\u2019 arguments. Immigration was the dominant theme in the final month, but No 10 wanted to focus purely on the economy. Instead, we should have made the case for free movement\u2019s role in supporting the NHS and providing opportunities for Britons, especially young people, to travel, study and work abroad.</p> <p>Fourth, it doesn\u2019t take a brainbox in a broom cupboard to know that the campaign will need the ability to frame its opponents. Leave did a superb job of painting remain as the establishment \u201cProject Fear\u201d campaign. This was patently absurd given the scare stories on Turkey and the backgrounds of Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and even Cummings (the Vote Leave campaign director), who married the daughter of a baronet. But it stuck.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/labour-backs-cross-party-amendment-to-block-no-deal-brexit\">Labour backs cross-party amendment to block no-deal Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Remain\u2019s creative agencies produced a series of eye-catching adverts that would have nailed leading leavers in the public\u2019s imagination. This included one of Boris Johnson in the pocket of Nigel Farage, mimicking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/09/tory-election-poster-ed-miliband-pocket-snp-alex-salmond\" title=\"\">successful poster of Ed Miliband and Alex Salmond the year before</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat\u2019s your edge?\u201d the actor playing Craig Oliver asked Dominic Cummings in Monday night\u2019s TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War. The programme does a decent job of demonstrating how Vote Leave used a superior slogan (\u201cTake back control\u201d) and false claims (on money for the NHS, and Turkey joining the EU) to capture the public mood. Sadly it brushes over the illegality of their overspending and overplays the role of their data wizards \u2013 who are now common in politics. But rather than looking backwards at 2016, the question posed by Oliver \u2013 David Cameron\u2019s then spin doctor \u2013 is perhaps more pertinent with regard to the prospect of a new referendum. Some bookmakers have slashed the odds of a people\u2019s vote to virtually evens as Theresa May\u2019s deal looks destined to fail. Although my part in the TV drama was blink-and-you-miss-it, in reality I was part of the remain campaign from the start. My job was to build an organisation \u2013 Britain Stronger in Europe \u2013 from scratch, which ultimately employed 200 people around the country. I was there in 2015 when Oliver and the rest of Cameron\u2019s team wanted nothing to do with us as they pursued their hopeless renegotiation of EU membership. And I was there when, despite cordial relations, the No 10 team focused the campaign increasingly narrowly on economic risk. So what are the lessons if another referendum becomes the only route out of the current mess? First, a new campaign will need an emotionally resonant message rather than relying solely on the \u201cfacts\u201d. The former prime minister Gordon Brown came closest to finding this tone when he argued that Britain should \u201clead not leave\u201d. His video from the ruins of Coventry Cathedral making this case was the most shared remain video on Facebook during the referendum. Unfortunately, greater use of this slogan was dismissed by our pollsters. They insisted that voters simply wanted facts on the economic impact. \u201cTell them again\u201d is likely to be the leave slogan if there is a new vote. Something appropriately patriotic and uplifting will be needed on the remain side to compete. Second, political leadership must come from all major parties. Labour\u2019s refusal to join the official campaign meant that remain was dominated by David Cameron and George Osborne. Labour\u2019s logic was that sharing a platform with the Tories in the 2014 Scottish referendum had been fatal for the party, which was all but wiped out in Scotland at the next election. The consequences were that neither Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell nor even Alan Johnson, who led the independent \u201cLabour In\u201d campaign, were part of remain\u2019s central command. All the key decisions were taken by a small group close to the then-prime minister, and relayed back to campaign staff. Indeed, Peter Mandelson denies that the call with David Cameron portrayed in the TV drama ever took place. The No 10 team were full of hubris from their surprise (but narrow) general election victory, and thought they had all the answers. Having Labour at the top table would have forced a more balanced campaign and prevented groupthink. Third, the campaign must be prepared to take on its opponents\u2019 arguments. Immigration was the dominant theme in the final month, but No 10 wanted to focus purely on the economy. Instead, we should have made the case for free movement\u2019s role in supporting the NHS and providing opportunities for Britons, especially young people, to travel, study and work abroad. Fourth, it doesn\u2019t take a brainbox in a broom cupboard to know that the campaign will need the ability to frame its opponents. Leave did a superb job of painting remain as the establishment \u201cProject Fear\u201d campaign. This was patently absurd given the scare stories on Turkey and the backgrounds of Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and even Cummings (the Vote Leave campaign director), who married the daughter of a baronet. But it stuck. Remain\u2019s creative agencies produced a series of eye-catching adverts that would have nailed leading leavers in the public\u2019s imagination. This included one of Boris Johnson in the pocket of Nigel Farage, mimicking the successful poster of Ed Miliband and Alex Salmond the year before. Sadly, No 10 banned the images because, as Oliver\u2019s character reveals in the drama, they had one eye on putting the Tory party back together following the vote, rather than both eyes on the prize. Finally, it is critical to use every available resource to make your case to voters. The leading leave and remain campaigns were each able to spend \u00a37m. We know now that Vote Leave broke electoral law by channelling an extra \u00a3625,000 to one of its offshoots. But leave also managed to spend twice as much as remain on digital adverts. It did so because remain wasted money on unnecessary vanity items like the daily tracker poll that Cameron wanted, and on inflated fees for American consultants. Discipline is critical in any campaign, and remain was bloated. After watching Monday night\u2019s drama, a new referendum may be the last thing that many people want.

Surveying its membership and that of 14 other writers\u2019 organisations in what it said was the largest survey of US authors\u2019 earnings ever conducted, the Authors Guild reported that the median income from writing-related work fell to a historic low in 2017 at $6,080 (\u00a34,760), down 42% from 2009.

      "body": "<p>When Leah Holroyd joined a dating site five years ago, the 31-year-old noticed a lot of men had listed The Great Gatsby as a favourite book. \u201cSo, to be slightly provocative, I mentioned in my profile that I thought it was overrated, and challenged someone to persuade me it was great,\u201d she says. A postgraduate student in English literature sent her a message that read \u201ca bit like literary criticism\u201d, and they began exchanging messages and discussing their favourite books. Holroyd found him pleasant enough, but she was looking for a relationship rather than just friendship, and he only ever talked to her about authors.</p> <p>After a couple of weeks, the bibliophile said he would be visiting London where Holroyd, who builds online learning courses, was living. \u201cHe asked if I fancied meeting for coffee and a walk by the river,\u201d she says. He suggested they swap phone numbers to make arrangements easier. \u201cAlmost instantly, he sent me closeups of his penis.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the conversation had some potential, but was becoming boring, I would sometimes send a dick pic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Holroyd\u2019s experience is worryingly common. A 2018 YouGov poll found that, shockingly, four in 10 women aged between 18 and 36 have been sent a photograph of a penis without having asked for one \u2013 colloquially known as an unsolicited \u201cdick pic\u201d. (Only 5% of men in this age group admitted to having sent one.) Nor does this just happen through online dating. Some men have used the AirDrop function on their Apple devices \u2013 which allows users to share files with other nearby Apple devices \u2013 to send unsolicited pictures to women. Anyone, of any age, who has AirDrop turned on at its most unrestricted setting is at risk of picking up their phone to see a graphic image that was sent anonymously by someone in the same restaurant, cinema or train carriage. The problem has become widespread enough that MPs and campaigners are now calling for a law targeting \u201ccyberflashers\u201d.</p> <p>Laura Thompson, a researcher at City, University of London, whose work examines harassment over dating apps, says the issue has until now been trivialised. \u201cThe research in this area is really limited. I think this blind spot says something about how society and the law tends to think of the problem: that dick pics are an annoying internet phenomenon as opposed to \u2018real\u2019 flashing. The term \u2018cyberflashing\u2019 wasn\u2019t even in widespread use until about a year or so ago. Research reflects the world we live in, and I just don\u2019t think this problem has been taken seriously until relatively recently.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the question that plagued me after hearing Holroyd\u2019s story was: why? What happened in the mind of that man between talking about books, inviting a woman for coffee and a walk \u2013 and sending her a photograph of his penis? Unsurprisingly, I did not get very far by asking men in person if they had ever sent unsolicited photographs of their penis. So I set up an account on Reddit, where users can post anonymously in forums on a range of topics, and I asked the question again. Shortly afterwards, I went to the cinema. When I checked back a few hours later, I discovered more than 500 comments, and the moderators had shut the thread down.</p> <p>The comments were fascinating. The most important thing I learned is that sending pictures of one\u2019s genitals has different meanings for different men \u2013 and different meanings for the same men at different points in their lives. Stephen Blumenthal, a consultant clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst at the Portman \u2013 an NHS clinic that offers specialist long-term therapy to patients with disturbing sexual behaviours \u2013 says: \u201cThere\u2019s always a tendency with these issues to provide one kind of formulation; a one-size-fits-all explanation. But the reality is that there are many different motives that people have, some of which are perhaps more troubled and troubling than others.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b68825abfc456306b7b37374083f121b5edcb8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b68825abfc456306b7b37374083f121b5edcb8f/0_0_1404_1477/951.jpg\" alt=\"By Guardian Design\" width=\"951\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Some who shared their experiences anonymously wrote about not feeling confident with their bodies, and wanting praise. One Reddit user, Jake, told me: \u201cI\u2019ve done it a few times in the past, and I think it\u2019s mostly about validation. Although most men will never admit to it, we are very insecure about our bodies, especially down there. So, unconsciously, we just want someone to say we look nice, or that we are attractive. OK, sending an unsolicited dick pic is really not the way to do it, but I do think that\u2019s the driver. We are just desperate for someone to tell us we\u2019re OK. Not even sexy or incredibly handsome \u2013 just OK.\u201d</p> <p>Others described wanting to turn up the sexual excitement in a messaging conversation they felt was flagging. Another user, Dave, wrote: \u201cIf the conversation had some potential, but was slowing down or becoming boring, I would sometimes send a dick pic. Because either they stop texting me or I get laid.\u201d He added that \u201cdick pics now only get sent upon request\u201d.</p> <p>For others, it was \u201ca numbers game\u201d. For all the unsolicited pictures that were ignored or rebuffed, there was the occasional woman who responded in kind, and if one picture \u201cworked\u201d, it was worth it. Jake wrote: \u201cWhen they were well-received, I felt good about it, from the validation and the boost to my self-image, but also the precedent it opened. It was now OK for them to reply in kind, or to steer the conversation down more sexual routes.\u201d</p> <p>Another, John, estimated he has sent 100 unsolicited pictures in chatrooms over the years, after becoming aroused. \u201cI\u2019d see people chatting about various subjects. If they were remotely sexual, I think that served as my entry point to sending a pic,\u201d he wrote. While he did have a couple of his \u201cbest pictures\u201d saved on his phone, \u201cthe thrill of it was taking a pic in that moment and sending it \u2026 I think it may have been about creating or imagining some kind of sexual connection in that moment. The feeling was a bit of a rush in the anticipation of a response.\u201d</p> <p>He described the four types of responses he received: very rarely, it would lead to an overtly sexual conversation in a chat window, in which further pictures might be exchanged; or he might be sent a complimentary message; or he might receive a negative, angry response. But, most often, he received no response.</p> <p>John is now in his 60s and has not sent a picture like this in more than a decade. He wrote: \u201cAs I have become older, frankly, it just seems a combination of rude, silly and empty. I have learned this is offensive and an unwanted intrusion, even if it is the internet and anonymous. Even online, it is a violation, in my opinion; little different from the stereotypical street flasher in a trenchcoat. Really, those who send these unsolicited pics are essentially standing on a virtual street corner digitally flashing women they don\u2019t know for their own sexual gratification.\u201d</p> <p>I was intrigued by John\u2019s condemnation, so I asked if he included himself among these online flashers. \u201cYes. The anonymity of the internet facilitates doing things online you\u2019d never contemplate in the real world, so I think that helps men distance themselves from any consequences or impact on the person they send it to.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The guy on the train using AirDrop is looking for something very particular \u2026 he wants to see shock and surprise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This notion makes a lot of sense to Blumenthal. \u201cThe internet has brought out all sorts of new varieties of unusual sexual proclivities that are related to previous versions, and might have some similar dynamics,\u201d he says. Blumenthal believes there is a hidden narrative underneath some of these stories, which is what he has experienced with his patients who have committed indecent exposure: \u201cSome will be trying to impress, whereas some will be seeking to intrude. And this intrusive aspect is an important one,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe guy on the train using AirDrop is flashing in the digital age. The flasher is looking for something very particular: he is interested in the response, focused on the faces of these women \u2013 he wants to see shock and surprise, and a kind of disabling of the person he is flashing.\u201d</p> <p>In almost every case of real-world indecent exposure, he says, there will have been a childhood incident where the perpetrator endured a trauma that made him feel out of control. This is the notion of identification of the aggressor: determined never to be a victim again. As an adult, he unconsciously twists this act around so that, \u201che is now in the driving seat, watching the reaction of those he disturbs, inserting into his victim a feeling of shock, surprise, disturbance\u201d.</p> <p>John says he has never heard about women being distressed by pictures sent by somebody they are already talking to online, describing them as \u201creally more of an annoyance\u201d. Perhaps some women do feel that, but others find them much more disturbing. When Holroyd received several explicit pictures from the man with whom she had just agreed to go for coffee and a walk, she tells me, \u201cI felt totally shocked. Nothing in the conversation had made me think he was going to do that. I felt really worried because it seemed like a deception, I was confused, I didn\u2019t know what he was really looking for, I didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>When she replied to this man to say that she no longer wanted to meet him, she says, \u201che got really angry and aggressive. He told me that I must be mentally unstable because I had changed my mind so quickly. He said: \u2018If you can just change your mind like that there\u2019s something wrong with you.\u2019 And he told me I should get professional help. He put the blame on me; made me feel I had done something wrong and had been unfair to him.\u201d</p> <p>In expressing his rage towards Holroyd, he was also describing exactly how he had made Holroyd feel about him: he was the one whose behaviour had been unstable, unpredictable, disturbed and disturbing. He had projected his feelings directly on to her.</p> <p>There were many thoughtful and thought-provoking responses to my question on Reddit. But in response to the many posts from men insisting that some women like receiving them, one woman replied: \u201cIf a woman wants dick pics, it\u2019s easy to ask for them. Or for a man to ask a woman if she would like to receive one. This [sending unsolicited images] is just like pulling your dick out in front of someone \u2013 of course, loads of people are into that, but you need to make sure of that before you do it, not just shrug and say: \u2018Eh, some women would have loved it!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Some men said they had stopped sending unsolicited photographs after a negative response. Another Reddit user, Jeremy, wrote about the one occasion he sent a photograph to a girl he had been messaging on Tinder: \u201cShe replied with: \u2018Ew!\u2019 and blocked me. Rightly so. Haven\u2019t done it since.\u201d</p> <p>Others replied that leaving it up to women to teach men what is acceptable by responding negatively could put those women at risk.</p> <p>Blumenthal says that it is crucial to distinguish between noncontact offences, in which the perpetrator does not touch his or her victim, and contact offences \u2013 and that the overlap between those who commit indecent exposure and those who go on to sexually assault their victims, is low. Yet the term \u201cnoncontact offence\u201d in this context, is an interesting one \u2013 it almost feels inaccurate: while sending an unsolicited photograph does not involve physical contact, it can feel like a violation; an assault.</p> <p>Cyberflashing can be prosecuted under a number of different laws, which carry prison sentences of up to two years. But there are problems with these laws, says barrister Kate Parker, director of the UK-based Schools Consent Project, a charity she founded to educate young people about consent and sexual assault. A prosecution would need to prove that the sender\u2019s purpose was either to cause distress or anxiety, or that the image was \u201cgrossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\u201d.</p> <p>Parker says: \u201cIn an era where sending dick pics is becoming increasingly normalised, the depressing reality is that such intent might not be proven. Some men think it is an appropriate way to start a conversation, or take an existing conversation to a more \u2018flirty\u2019 level.\u201d And when it comes to the notion of indecency, the threshold is increasingly high: \u201cas our online and offline worlds are increasingly saturated with sexual imagery, it may be that society\u2019s collective perception of sexual indecency begins to shift\u201d. She supports the creation of a new law \u2013 one \u201cthat finally includes a consideration of the recipient\u2019s \u2013 typically a woman \u2013 response to such messages as a determinant of criminal liability\u201d.</p> <p>We can improve the law, criminalising this latest incarnation of flashing, but, unless we try to understand the motivations behind it, we have no hope of stopping it. When I was a schoolgirl, a man flashed me as I walked home from the local park \u2013 he ran ahead of me then stood masturbating, with his T-shirt over his face. When I was 17, on holiday in Paris with my best friend, a man thrust a photograph of a deformed penis in our faces. When I was in my 20s, a man I was flirting with texted me an unexpected dick pic. All these experiences, shifting in format, but not in nature, as technology progressed, were shocking, and unpleasant. On the upside, I am happy to report that in researching this piece, I did not receive a single one.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.

      "bodyText": "When Leah Holroyd joined a dating site five years ago, the 31-year-old noticed a lot of men had listed The Great Gatsby as a favourite book. \u201cSo, to be slightly provocative, I mentioned in my profile that I thought it was overrated, and challenged someone to persuade me it was great,\u201d she says. A postgraduate student in English literature sent her a message that read \u201ca bit like literary criticism\u201d, and they began exchanging messages and discussing their favourite books. Holroyd found him pleasant enough, but she was looking for a relationship rather than just friendship, and he only ever talked to her about authors. After a couple of weeks, the bibliophile said he would be visiting London where Holroyd, who builds online learning courses, was living. \u201cHe asked if I fancied meeting for coffee and a walk by the river,\u201d she says. He suggested they swap phone numbers to make arrangements easier. \u201cAlmost instantly, he sent me closeups of his penis.\u201d Holroyd\u2019s experience is worryingly common. A 2018 YouGov poll found that, shockingly, four in 10 women aged between 18 and 36 have been sent a photograph of a penis without having asked for one \u2013 colloquially known as an unsolicited \u201cdick pic\u201d. (Only 5% of men in this age group admitted to having sent one.) Nor does this just happen through online dating. Some men have used the AirDrop function on their Apple devices \u2013 which allows users to share files with other nearby Apple devices \u2013 to send unsolicited pictures to women. Anyone, of any age, who has AirDrop turned on at its most unrestricted setting is at risk of picking up their phone to see a graphic image that was sent anonymously by someone in the same restaurant, cinema or train carriage. The problem has become widespread enough that MPs and campaigners are now calling for a law targeting \u201ccyberflashers\u201d. Laura Thompson, a researcher at City, University of London, whose work examines harassment over dating apps, says the issue has until now been trivialised. \u201cThe research in this area is really limited. I think this blind spot says something about how society and the law tends to think of the problem: that dick pics are an annoying internet phenomenon as opposed to \u2018real\u2019 flashing. The term \u2018cyberflashing\u2019 wasn\u2019t even in widespread use until about a year or so ago. Research reflects the world we live in, and I just don\u2019t think this problem has been taken seriously until relatively recently.\u201d Yet the question that plagued me after hearing Holroyd\u2019s story was: why? What happened in the mind of that man between talking about books, inviting a woman for coffee and a walk \u2013 and sending her a photograph of his penis? Unsurprisingly, I did not get very far by asking men in person if they had ever sent unsolicited photographs of their penis. So I set up an account on Reddit, where users can post anonymously in forums on a range of topics, and I asked the question again. Shortly afterwards, I went to the cinema. When I checked back a few hours later, I discovered more than 500 comments, and the moderators had shut the thread down. The comments were fascinating. The most important thing I learned is that sending pictures of one\u2019s genitals has different meanings for different men \u2013 and different meanings for the same men at different points in their lives. Stephen Blumenthal, a consultant clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst at the Portman \u2013 an NHS clinic that offers specialist long-term therapy to patients with disturbing sexual behaviours \u2013 says: \u201cThere\u2019s always a tendency with these issues to provide one kind of formulation; a one-size-fits-all explanation. But the reality is that there are many different motives that people have, some of which are perhaps more troubled and troubling than others.\u201d Some who shared their experiences anonymously wrote about not feeling confident with their bodies, and wanting praise. One Reddit user, Jake, told me: \u201cI\u2019ve done it a few times in the past, and I think it\u2019s mostly about validation. Although most men will never admit to it, we are very insecure about our bodies, especially down there. So, unconsciously, we just want someone to say we look nice, or that we are attractive. OK, sending an unsolicited dick pic is really not the way to do it, but I do think that\u2019s the driver. We are just desperate for someone to tell us we\u2019re OK. Not even sexy or incredibly handsome \u2013 just OK.\u201d Others described wanting to turn up the sexual excitement in a messaging conversation they felt was flagging. Another user, Dave, wrote: \u201cIf the conversation had some potential, but was slowing down or becoming boring, I would sometimes send a dick pic. Because either they stop texting me or I get laid.\u201d He added that \u201cdick pics now only get sent upon request\u201d. For others, it was \u201ca numbers game\u201d. For all the unsolicited pictures that were ignored or rebuffed, there was the occasional woman who responded in kind, and if one picture \u201cworked\u201d, it was worth it. Jake wrote: \u201cWhen they were well-received, I felt good about it, from the validation and the boost to my self-image, but also the precedent it opened. It was now OK for them to reply in kind, or to steer the conversation down more sexual routes.\u201d Another, John, estimated he has sent 100 unsolicited pictures in chatrooms over the years, after becoming aroused. \u201cI\u2019d see people chatting about various subjects. If they were remotely sexual, I think that served as my entry point to sending a pic,\u201d he wrote. While he did have a couple of his \u201cbest pictures\u201d saved on his phone, \u201cthe thrill of it was taking a pic in that moment and sending it \u2026 I think it may have been about creating or imagining some kind of sexual connection in that moment. The feeling was a bit of a rush in the anticipation of a response.\u201d He described the four types of responses he received: very rarely, it would lead to an overtly sexual conversation in a chat window, in which further pictures might be exchanged; or he might be sent a complimentary message; or he might receive a negative, angry response. But, most often, he received no response. John is now in his 60s and has not sent a picture like this in more than a decade. He wrote: \u201cAs I have become older, frankly, it just seems a combination of rude, silly and empty. I have learned this is offensive and an unwanted intrusion, even if it is the internet and anonymous. Even online, it is a violation, in my opinion; little different from the stereotypical street flasher in a trenchcoat. Really, those who send these unsolicited pics are essentially standing on a virtual street corner digitally flashing women they don\u2019t know for their own sexual gratification.\u201d I was intrigued by John\u2019s condemnation, so I asked if he included himself among these online flashers. \u201cYes. The anonymity of the internet facilitates doing things online you\u2019d never contemplate in the real world, so I think that helps men distance themselves from any consequences or impact on the person they send it to.\u201d This notion makes a lot of sense to Blumenthal. \u201cThe internet has brought out all sorts of new varieties of unusual sexual proclivities that are related to previous versions, and might have some similar dynamics,\u201d he says. Blumenthal believes there is a hidden narrative underneath some of these stories, which is what he has experienced with his patients who have committed indecent exposure: \u201cSome will be trying to impress, whereas some will be seeking to intrude. And this intrusive aspect is an important one,\u201d he says. \u201cThe guy on the train using AirDrop is flashing in the digital age. The flasher is looking for something very particular: he is interested in the response, focused on the faces of these women \u2013 he wants to see shock and surprise, and a kind of disabling of the person he is flashing.\u201d In almost every case of real-world indecent exposure, he says, there will have been a childhood incident where the perpetrator endured a trauma that made him feel out of control. This is the notion of identification of the aggressor: determined never to be a victim again. As an adult, he unconsciously twists this act around so that, \u201che is now in the driving seat, watching the reaction of those he disturbs, inserting into his victim a feeling of shock, surprise, disturbance\u201d. John says he has never heard about women being distressed by pictures sent by somebody they are already talking to online, describing them as \u201creally more of an annoyance\u201d. Perhaps some women do feel that, but others find them much more disturbing. When Holroyd received several explicit pictures from the man with whom she had just agreed to go for coffee and a walk, she tells me, \u201cI felt totally shocked. Nothing in the conversation had made me think he was going to do that. I felt really worried because it seemed like a deception, I was confused, I didn\u2019t know what he was really looking for, I didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d When she replied to this man to say that she no longer wanted to meet him, she says, \u201che got really angry and aggressive. He told me that I must be mentally unstable because I had changed my mind so quickly. He said: \u2018If you can just change your mind like that there\u2019s something wrong with you.\u2019 And he told me I should get professional help. He put the blame on me; made me feel I had done something wrong and had been unfair to him.\u201d In expressing his rage towards Holroyd, he was also describing exactly how he had made Holroyd feel about him: he was the one whose behaviour had been unstable, unpredictable, disturbed and disturbing. He had projected his feelings directly on to her. There were many thoughtful and thought-provoking responses to my question on Reddit. But in response to the many posts from men insisting that some women like receiving them, one woman replied: \u201cIf a woman wants dick pics, it\u2019s easy to ask for them. Or for a man to ask a woman if she would like to receive one. This [sending unsolicited images] is just like pulling your dick out in front of someone \u2013 of course, loads of people are into that, but you need to make sure of that before you do it, not just shrug and say: \u2018Eh, some women would have loved it!\u2019\u201d Some men said they had stopped sending unsolicited photographs after a negative response. Another Reddit user, Jeremy, wrote about the one occasion he sent a photograph to a girl he had been messaging on Tinder: \u201cShe replied with: \u2018Ew!\u2019 and blocked me. Rightly so. Haven\u2019t done it since.\u201d Others replied that leaving it up to women to teach men what is acceptable by responding negatively could put those women at risk. Blumenthal says that it is crucial to distinguish between noncontact offences, in which the perpetrator does not touch his or her victim, and contact offences \u2013 and that the overlap between those who commit indecent exposure and those who go on to sexually assault their victims, is low. Yet the term \u201cnoncontact offence\u201d in this context, is an interesting one \u2013 it almost feels inaccurate: while sending an unsolicited photograph does not involve physical contact, it can feel like a violation; an assault. Cyberflashing can be prosecuted under a number of different laws, which carry prison sentences of up to two years. But there are problems with these laws, says barrister Kate Parker, director of the UK-based Schools Consent Project, a charity she founded to educate young people about consent and sexual assault. A prosecution would need to prove that the sender\u2019s purpose was either to cause distress or anxiety, or that the image was \u201cgrossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\u201d. Parker says: \u201cIn an era where sending dick pics is becoming increasingly normalised, the depressing reality is that such intent might not be proven. Some men think it is an appropriate way to start a conversation, or take an existing conversation to a more \u2018flirty\u2019 level.\u201d And when it comes to the notion of indecency, the threshold is increasingly high: \u201cas our online and offline worlds are increasingly saturated with sexual imagery, it may be that society\u2019s collective perception of sexual indecency begins to shift\u201d. She supports the creation of a new law \u2013 one \u201cthat finally includes a consideration of the recipient\u2019s \u2013 typically a woman \u2013 response to such messages as a determinant of criminal liability\u201d. We can improve the law, criminalising this latest incarnation of flashing, but, unless we try to understand the motivations behind it, we have no hope of stopping it. When I was a schoolgirl, a man flashed me as I walked home from the local park \u2013 he ran ahead of me then stood masturbating, with his T-shirt over his face. When I was 17, on holiday in Paris with my best friend, a man thrust a photograph of a deformed penis in our faces. When I was in my 20s, a man I was flirting with texted me an unexpected dick pic. All these experiences, shifting in format, but not in nature, as technology progressed, were shocking, and unpleasant. On the upside, I am happy to report that in researching this piece, I did not receive a single one. Some names have been changed.

But starting in the mid-1980s, the US supreme court issued a series of rulings saying that arbitration could be used for other kinds of conflicts \u2013 including conflicts between employees and employers over things such as discrimination.</p> <p>According to the Economic Policy Institute, <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/the-growing-use-of-mandatory-arbitration-access-to-the-courts-is-now-barred-for-more-than-60-million-american-workers/\">more than 55% of the American workforce is now subject to mandatory arbitration</a> \u2013 up from just 2% in 1992. Most of those workers don\u2019t know that they have forfeited their right to sue. Employers slip mandatory arbitration clauses into their employee contracts \u2013 those big stacks of confusingly worded hiring documents that employees are asked to sign, but usually don\u2019t read.</p> <p><a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/news/publications/forced-arbitration-clauses-metoo-movement\">In the wake of the #MeToo movement, mandatory arbitration clauses have posed a problem</a>. Women who feel newly emboldened and safe in coming forward with their accounts of harassment and assault in the workplace find to their surprise that they have already relinquished their right to a day in court. Instead, they are forced into a private system, where their claims are resolved with unclear rules for the process, little oversight, and a mandate to keep it all a secret.</p> <p>There is a reason employers have been so eager to adopt mandatory arbitration clauses. The arbitration system favors employers over employees in several crucial ways. Chief among them is confidentiality: the secrecy of arbitration proceedings allows companies to avoid embarrassment and public censure. Mandatory arbitration clauses are often paired with non-disclosure or non-disparagement agreements, which forbid an employee from saying anything that could be construed as negative about the company or its leaders. Combined, these provisions allow employers that use arbitration to conceal bad behavior by management or a pervasive culture of harassment, and to quietly dispatch those who complain.</p> <p>The confidentiality provision also hampers a complainant\u2019s lawyer, who, because she is bound by confidentiality, also can\u2019t look for other plaintiffs who have had similar experiences of harassment or discrimination at the company. \u201cThere are [lawyers] out there who know about fairly harrowing wrongdoing,\u201d says David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law and an expert in arbitration. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t go out and find other people that it happened to.\u201d</p> <p>This brings us to a second pillar of arbitration\u2019s disenfranchisement of workers: in arbitration, all disputes are one-on-one. There is no such thing as a class action arbitration case. Even if sexual harassment is pervasive at a company, with many victims who have standing to complain, women will have to bring complaints to arbitration one at a time.</p> <p>This changes the economic calculus of bringing a harassment complaint: it is much less efficient, and much more expensive, to hire a lawyer for every individual employee who has been victimized. And just as mandatory arbitration clauses are often paired with non-disclosure agreements, they are also often accompanied by class action waivers, meaning the employee can\u2019t join any class action case that is brought against the company in a court. An individual arbitration is her only option.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Constitutional rights, like the freedom to sue over violations of federal anti-discrimination law, shouldn\u2019t be dependent on what state you live in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s also the matter of outcomes. In arbitration, employees win their cases much less often than in court \u2013 and when they do, they are awarded much less money. There\u2019s no right of appeal. And all of this is agreed to in a contract that\u2019s presented to employees without the opportunity for negotiation, at the time of hiring, before they know what sort of company culture they\u2019re entering or what their colleagues and superiors might subject them to.</p> <p>The supreme court has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/business/supreme-court-upholds-workplace-arbitration-contracts.html\">repeatedly reaffirmed arbitration\u2019s legitimacy</a> and the legality of these exploitative practices by employers who coerce or trick employees into signing away their legal rights. But there is a growing consensus that mandatory arbitration isn\u2019t a fair way to resolve employment discrimination claims. \u201cThe situation now, where every arbitration agreement is enforceable \u2013 it\u2019s not a sustainable equilibrium,\u201d says Noll.</p> <p>Feminists agree, and have made a renewed push to end forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. Google ditched the practice after their employees walked out; Facebook followed suit the next day. But real change will require not just such tactical concessions to workers by large companies, but legislation to enforce a ban on this unjust practice. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, <a href=\"https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/03/12/ny-senate-passes-bill-prohibiting-mandatory-arbitration-clauses-in-sex-harassment-settlements/?slreturn=20181120140504\">signed a ban on forced arbitration for sexual harassment contracts in July</a>, a major legislative victory for the #MeToo movement, and similar laws are on the books in Washington and Maryland. Other states are preparing to follow suit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/14/two-weeks-in-feminist-time-equals-a-whole-year-for-everyone-else\">Two weeks in feminist time equals a whole year for everyone else | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has even been a move toward a national fix. The Restoring Statutory Rights Act, which would bar forced arbitration in a wide array of employee disputes, was <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2506\">introduced in Congress in 2016</a>. But it\u2019s languished in committee, ignored by lawmakers unwilling to prioritize workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>Constitutional rights, like the freedom to sue over violations of federal anti-discrimination law, shouldn\u2019t be dependent on what state you live in, or what company you work for. They shouldn\u2019t be able to be taken away in relationships as unequal as that between an employer and an employee. And illegal behavior by companies, like the enabling of sexual harassment, should not be able to be swept under the rug and hushed up in an asymmetrical, secretive process. Abuse thrives on secrecy, and sunlight is the best disinfectant.</p> <p>It is long past time to make forced arbitration nationally illegal in sexual harassment claims, if not in all workers\u2019 complaints, and to bring these disputes into the public eye, under the full scrutiny and protection of the court. Workers\u2019 rights \u2013 including, crucially, the right of women to be free from sexual harassment \u2013 need not be privatized and kept in the shadows. They must become a public concern.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

And just as mandatory arbitration clauses are often paired with non-disclosure agreements, they are also often accompanied by class action waivers, meaning the employee can\u2019t join any class action case that is brought against the company in a court. An individual arbitration is her only option. There\u2019s also the matter of outcomes. In arbitration, employees win their cases much less often than in court \u2013 and when they do, they are awarded much less money. There\u2019s no right of appeal. And all of this is agreed to in a contract that\u2019s presented to employees without the opportunity for negotiation, at the time of hiring, before they know what sort of company culture they\u2019re entering or what their colleagues and superiors might subject them to. The supreme court has repeatedly reaffirmed arbitration\u2019s legitimacy and the legality of these exploitative practices by employers who coerce or trick employees into signing away their legal rights. But there is a growing consensus that mandatory arbitration isn\u2019t a fair way to resolve employment discrimination claims. \u201cThe situation now, where every arbitration agreement is enforceable \u2013 it\u2019s not a sustainable equilibrium,\u201d says Noll. Feminists agree, and have made a renewed push to end forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. Google ditched the practice after their employees walked out; Facebook followed suit the next day. But real change will require not just such tactical concessions to workers by large companies, but legislation to enforce a ban on this unjust practice. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, signed a ban on forced arbitration for sexual harassment contracts in July, a major legislative victory for the #MeToo movement, and similar laws are on the books in Washington and Maryland. Other states are preparing to follow suit. There has even been a move toward a national fix. The Restoring Statutory Rights Act, which would bar forced arbitration in a wide array of employee disputes, was introduced in Congress in 2016. But it\u2019s languished in committee, ignored by lawmakers unwilling to prioritize workers\u2019 rights. Constitutional rights, like the freedom to sue over violations of federal anti-discrimination law, shouldn\u2019t be dependent on what state you live in, or what company you work for. They shouldn\u2019t be able to be taken away in relationships as unequal as that between an employer and an employee. And illegal behavior by companies, like the enabling of sexual harassment, should not be able to be swept under the rug and hushed up in an asymmetrical, secretive process. Abuse thrives on secrecy, and sunlight is the best disinfectant. It is long past time to make forced arbitration nationally illegal in sexual harassment claims, if not in all workers\u2019 complaints, and to bring these disputes into the public eye, under the full scrutiny and protection of the court. Workers\u2019 rights \u2013 including, crucially, the right of women to be free from sexual harassment \u2013 need not be privatized and kept in the shadows. They must become a public concern.

After a pathogen outbreak in the lab where he lived, he became the only surviving member of his species and was visited by hundreds, if not thousands, of schoolchildren. Despite his celebrity status, George wasn\u2019t the prettiest snail to look at. David Sischo, the snail extinction prevention program coordinator for the Hawaii Invertebrate Program, described him as \u201cold and grizzled\u201d and said that George was also \u201cbit of a hermit\u201d, who would stay in his shell at times when most other nocturnal snails emerge.

In fact, the<em> Achatinella apexfulva</em> was the very first snail species to be written about by non-native scientists, said Sischo. In the 1780s, when British captain George Dickson arrived in Hawaii, he was given a lei made with the shells of George\u2019s ancestors. Back then, the snails hung from trees in giant clusters, easy pickings for scientists and collectors. \u201cIn a few minutes I collected several hundred specimens, picking them from trees and low bushes as rapidly as one would gather huckleberries from a prolific field,\u201d a collector named DD Baldwin wrote in 1887.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/hawaii-volcano-eruption-kilauea-natural-wonders-destroyed-kapoho-bay\">'The entire habitat is gone': Hawaii's natural wonders claimed by lava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At that time, Hawaiian land snails existed in a mind-boggling 752 varieties \u2013 about as many as exist in the mainland US and Canada combined.

      "bodyText": "As New Year\u2019s Day broke in the Hawaiian Islands, one rare creature was not there to emerge from his shell and greet it: George, the last snail of his kind and a local celebrity, was dead at age 14. The passing of George, a member of the Achatinella apexfulva species and a tree snail who fed on tree fungus, algae and bacteria, epitomizes the decline of biodiversity on the Hawaiian islands, where climate change and invasive predators have taken a heavy toll on native animals and insects. Snails like George also played a part in the songs and stories of native Hawaiian culture, which holds that snails make sounds and are \u201cthe voice of the forest\u201d. George, who never lived in an actual forest, was still a mascot for endangered Hawaiian snails. After a pathogen outbreak in the lab where he lived, he became the only surviving member of his species and was visited by hundreds, if not thousands, of schoolchildren. Despite his celebrity status, George wasn\u2019t the prettiest snail to look at. David Sischo, the snail extinction prevention program coordinator for the Hawaii Invertebrate Program, described him as \u201cold and grizzled\u201d and said that George was also \u201cbit of a hermit\u201d, who would stay in his shell at times when most other nocturnal snails emerge. Although scientists had hoped that George, a hermaphrodite, would have offspring, his solitary life ruled out that possibility. Snails like George used to be ubiquitous throughout the Hawaiian islands. In fact, the Achatinella apexfulva was the very first snail species to be written about by non-native scientists, said Sischo. In the 1780s, when British captain George Dickson arrived in Hawaii, he was given a lei made with the shells of George\u2019s ancestors. Back then, the snails hung from trees in giant clusters, easy pickings for scientists and collectors. \u201cIn a few minutes I collected several hundred specimens, picking them from trees and low bushes as rapidly as one would gather huckleberries from a prolific field,\u201d a collector named DD Baldwin wrote in 1887. At that time, Hawaiian land snails existed in a mind-boggling 752 varieties \u2013 about as many as exist in the mainland US and Canada combined. The snails likely arrived by hitchhiking on sea birds that came to the islands millions of years ago, where they thrived and developed into different species \u2013 many of which are only found in a single area of one forest on one island. They had no natural predators, and even after the Polynesians brought rats to the island, still lived in abundance. But when Europeans began arriving, that all changed.

To book click here Feedback from Reading for pleasure, primary teachers and librarians \u2013 9 November 2018 Just amazing and inspirational. I want to be back in the classroom now so that I can try out the resources and ideas. Fantastically high quality talks which both inject and inspire passion. I really enjoyed it, feel inspired and am hoping to come again next year. Useful to consider how we can programme poetry workshops/events and longer term poetry projects. Excellent day - well organised and hugely knowledgable and inspiring chair and guests. I have got so many ideas ready to implement in my school. The biggest gap being poetry - currently its tagged on. I have big plans from today! It was a super day - thank you! This was an excellent course. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute!",

      "bodyText": "Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman has come out of the hat and will be the book to bring us a smile this month on the reading group. This is good timing. Reading the novel now will prime us nicely for the starry TV adaptation later this year. It will also help us cope: as Gaiman has noted, \u201cglobal idiocy\u201d is currently a hot topic \u2013 and while the 1990 novel doesn\u2019t necessarily provide solutions, it might at least help us laugh at the absurdity of our current situation. But even the worst predictions for 2019 don\u2019t quite match up to the events in Good Omens.

      "bodyText": "A new analysis shows US greenhouse gas levels are increasing as the Trump administration unravels efforts to slow climate change. Carbon emissions rose sharply last year, increasing 3.4%, according to new estimates from the economic firm Rhodium Group. That year\u2019s jump in emissions is the biggest since the bounce back from the recession in 2010. It is the second largest gain in more than two decades. Coal plants are shutting down, but electricity demand is growing. Natural-gas fired power emits about half as much carbon as coal but still contributes to climate change. The fossil fuel is replacing most of the coal plants that are closing and also fed most of the higher demand, increasing power-sector climate pollution. Outside of the power sector, transportation, industry and buildings all increased their emissions as well, according to the estimates. The numbers undercut one of the Trump administration\u2019s key defenses for dismissing federal science reports that show rising temperatures will wreak havoc on the economy, kill people and cause more extreme weather. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t believe the findings and his officials have argued they are exaggerated. The Environmental Protection Agency chief, Andrew Wheeler, often trumpets declines in greenhouse gases, citing data showing that they fell 2.7% from 2016 to 2017. But the EPA is rescinding Obama-era climate work, including regulations meant to speed a shift from coal. The agency contends that Donald Trump\u2019s agenda is driving energy innovation that could help cut emissions. Energy experts, however, say Trump is doing the opposite by rolling back the rules and policies that could have sped renewable growth and by forgoing new regulations beyond the electricity sector. Rhodium Group tracks the most prevalent greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The firm found a modest decrease in carbon emissions between 2016 and 2017, in part because of a warmer-than-usual winter that didn\u2019t require as much heating. Since then carbon output has surged. \u201cThe tailwinds of Obama administration policy are dissipating,\u201d said Trevor Houser, a partner at the firm. \u201cThis year makes it abundantly clear that energy market trends alone \u2013 the low cost of natural gas, the increasing competitiveness of renewables \u2013 are not enough to deliver sustained declines in US emissions.\u201d Houser said the numbers would have been worse without the state and local policies enacted during the past five to 10 years. But that the groundswell of climate commitments by governors and mayors since Trump said he would exit the international Paris climate agreement might not translate into policy for some time, he added. He said those efforts are likely to be significant but not sufficient to meet the levels the US pledged.",

      "bodyText": "Two-thirds of UK households visited a discounter over Christmas, handing Aldi and Lidl their biggest ever slice of spending as political uncertainty prompted shoppers to keep a tight hold on their wallets. All the major supermarkets lost market share in the 12 weeks to 30 December as Aldi\u2019s sales jumped 10.4%, according to the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel, and Lidl\u2019s by 9.4%. This took their combined market share to a record 12.8%, up from 11.4% the previous year. Homegrown discounter Iceland\u2019s sales rose 1.8%, increasing its share of the market to 2.3%. \u201cThe discounters have continued to make their mark over Christmas: two-thirds of all households shopped at either Aldi or Lidl over the 12-week period, culminating in a highest-ever combined Christmas market share of 12.8%,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Asda was the strongest performer of the big four food retailers, with sales growth of 0.7% according to Kantar, followed by Tesco and Morrisons. Sainsbury\u2019s had the most difficult period with sales falling by 0.4%. Overall, supermarket sales growth slowed to 1.6% over Christmas, the poorest performance in more than a year, as shoppers reined in spending amid political uncertainty. While shoppers spent \u00a3450m more than in 2017, growth in 2018 was tempered by lower inflation of 1.3%, less than half the level seen the previous year. McKevitt said supermarkets had not been affected by the shift to the web that has hit high street retailers. Online sales rose just 3.9%, with all of that growth coming from existing shoppers. McKevitt said Amazon would be a force to watch this year as its grocery sales rose 16% over the three-month period. The industry figures were released as Morrisons reported a slowdown in sales growth over Christmas as it said shoppers had become \u201cmore cautious and careful\u201d amid the political uncertainty around Brexit. Sales at its established supermarkets rose 0.6%, including a 0.4% contribution from online sales, in the nine weeks to 6 January. Wholesale sales were up 3% and Morrisons said it had held the price of 100 key Christmas goods, such as mince pies, at the same level as last year. The figures were slightly behind some City expectations and were down on the strong Christmas enjoyed by the group in 2017, as well as on the 1.3% in stores and 4.3% via wholesale reported for the three months to 4 November. David Potts, the Morrisons chief executive, said: \u201cGoing into November there was a sense that customers were a bit more cautious, a bit more careful with their spending and there was a feeling of uncertainty in the country that may have led to that [cautiousness].\u201d He said both affluent and price conscious shoppers had been concerned to keep a limit on the total amount they spent over Christmas. \u201cPeople became increasingly savvy and conscious of the macro political situation in the country and how it may influence 2019 and how it may affect them.\u201d He said he expected consumers would continue to be price-conscious through 2019 and said retailers would have to \u201ctrade hard and offer great value\u201d in order to win over shoppers. Morrisons recently announced it was slashing the price of more than 900 products by an average 20% and Tesco has also revealed price cuts on hundreds of items in the annual attempt to win over shoppers who find their finances squeezed after the Christmas blowout. Potts said: \u201cThis is Morrisons\u2019 fourth consecutive Christmas of like-for-like sales growth during the turnaround. Our performance shows colleagues are listening hard and responding to customers, providing consistently great value and good quality when it matters most.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Waitrose will report their festive trading figures later this week.",

      "bodyText": "Indonesian forces have raided and allegedly destroyed the offices of the West Papuan liberation group, taking over one site in what lawyers for the group claim is an \u201cillegal occupation\u201d. The raids, which have prompted threats of legal action, as well as several arrests and three treason charges, come amid an increased crackdown on the separatist movement and continuing violence in the decades-long insurgency against Indonesia. Three headquarters of the West Papuan National Committee (KNPB) \u2013 the domestic arm of the liberation campaign \u2013 were raided by Indonesia police and military (TNI) in recent weeks, with two destroyed and the Timika office taken over for use as a joint military-police outpost on New Year\u2019s Eve. A letter sent to Mimika police by KNPB lawyers demanded authorities withdraw from its ongoing \u201cillegal occupation\u201d by Tuesday or face legal action. \u201cWe are seeing a new chapter of persecution against KNPB by unlawfully arresting them and now arbitrarily destroying their properties,\u201d KNPB lawyer Veronica Koman said. The letter accused officers of trespassing and of coercion in the arrests and detaining eight activists who allegedly signed letters that they were \u201cforever Indonesian\u201d and promising not to take part in any further campaigns. Among those arrested was Yanto Awerkion, who was released in April last year after spending 10 months in prison for his involvement in an independence petition. The KNPB legal letter said the organisation had given authorities notice on 29 December, as an act of good faith, that it intended to hold a prayer event marking their fifth anniversary. \u201cOn 31 December 2018, the prayer and traditional cooking pit feast \u2018bakar batu\u2019 event which was planned to be held at 9am was forcibly cancelled by the arrival of more than a hundred police and military personnels,\u201d the letter alleged. \u201cThey failed to present letter of assignment, arrest warrant, and search warrant [and] ... police conducted destruction including vandalism.\u201d Mimika police chief Agung Marlianto confirmed to the Jakarta Post that about 80 security personnel took over the KNPB headquarters in Timika on New Year\u2019s Eve, removing all insignia and posters, and destroying walls. \u201cThe headquarters is not allowed to operate any more and was taken over as a TNI and police post from now on,\u201d he said. Eight KNPB members were also questioned on Saturday as part of treason investigations, the lawyers alleged. On Tuesday afternoon they said three had been flown to Jayapura and charged with treason offences over the prayer event. KNPB lawyer Veronica Koman said campaigners\u2019 freedom of assembly was guaranteed by the constitution, and claims that the organisation was illegal were incorrect in law. \u201cEven if KNPB was illegal, police still does not have the right or authority to destroy or vandalize their property, let alone trespassing and illegally occupying land and building owned by KNPB.\u201d Spokesman for the Papua regional police, Suryadi Diaz, told Indonesian media the building belonged to the local government, which had given it to the local community, but KNPB had used it. \u201cThat is why the Mimika police saw it fit to retake the building and made it into a joint post for the police and TNI,\u201d he said. The takeover of the Timika office followed the alleged destruction of headquarters in Asmat and Jayapura in December. In a video purported to show the Asmat site, a man films the smoking ruins of a building. \u201cToday, Free Papua office was burnt down by police and military,\u201d he says, according to a translation obtained by Guardian Australia. \u201cWe are full of tears, we are full of misery, but we will continue the fight. Wherever you are, please support us and be in solidarity with us, because we will continue the fight for now and forever.\u201d Indonesian authorities launched a crackdown on West Papuan separatists last month following the killing of at least 17 construction workers in the Ndagu province of West Papua by the liberation army, which claimed the workers were all members of the Indonesian military. The attack came just days after Indonesia arrested more than 500 people, reportedly including Indonesians, at West Papuan independence rallies across the country. Indonesia was later accused of using white phosphorus on civilians \u2013 against international law \u2013 in a report by the Saturday Paper, a report Indonesia said was \u201ctotally baseless, non-factual, and gravely misleading\u201d. Following the attack on the construction workers, the exiled leader of the West Papuan independence movement, Benny Wenda called for calm on all sides. In an interview with the Guardian, Wenda said Indonesia had a history of \u201ccreating violence\u201d and using it to justify increases to its military presence and harsh crackdowns on West Papuans.",

      "bodyText": "Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has discounted the possibility that the government might delay Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union beyond 29 March. Following reports claiming that UK officials were actively exploring the possibility of extending article 50, he said the government still planned to leave on time. His comments followed claims from Margot James, the digital minister, who said on Monday that \u201cwe might have to extend article 50\u201d if May loses next week\u2019s parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Barclay said he had not had any discussions with the EU in terms of extension. Asked if he was denying reports in the Telegraph on Tuesday that officials had discussed an extension in Brussels, Barclay said: \u201cYes, I can be very clear that the government\u2019s policy is to leave on 29 March.\u201d Saying there would be practical problems to any extension, such as colliding with EU elections, Barclay said: \u201cIt is important the we reflect the result. The consequence of triggering article 50 is that you either have a deal or you have no deal.\u201d Any extension to article 50 must be unanimously agreed by all EU member states, and EU officials have hinted in the past that the UK could be granted a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d in order to give time to enact legislation or complete a general election or referendum Barclay appeared to confirm that the EU would give further written assurances about the nature of the Northern Ireland backstop before next week\u2019s key vote at Westminster on the Brexit deal. It follows comments from the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who told reporters on Monday: \u201cThe [European] council conclusions at our last meeting in December provided written assurances but certainly what\u2019s happening at the moment is there is close contact between the UK and EU institutions on whether a further set of written guarantees explanations and assurances could make a difference. \u201cAnd bear in mind a lot of the opposition to the withdrawal agreement and the backstop might be based on suppositions and misunderstandings about our intent as a European Union.\u201d Barclay said Varadkar\u2019s comments reflected the prime minister\u2019s understanding. \u201cThe comments from the taoiseach reflect the fact that the EU want to see this deal passed but its also in the UK\u2019s interests to avoid the uncertainty of not having a deal and the problems that would flow from that.\u201d MPs will resume their debate on the Brexit deal on Wednesday, with a vote expected next Tuesday. The government is widely expected to lose that vote unless there is a significant development, prolonging the current parliamentary impasse over Brexit. May said on Monday she would set out in the coming days what assurances her government could give domestically on the backstop as well as those from the EU. An amendment to the finance bill \u2013 the legislation that gives the budget legal status \u2013 would restrict the government\u2019s powers to pursue a no-deal Brexit unless parliament voted for no deal or the government requested an extension of article 50.",

The Blues will try to replace him with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, also on loan, and will also attempt to sign a midfielder to replace the supposedly departing Cesc F\u00e0bregas, with Zenit Saint Petersburg\u2019s Leandro Paredes and Cagliari\u2019s \u00a345m-rated 21-year-old Nicol\u00f2 Barella under consideration. They would do well not to move too soon, mind, because having agreed to leave for Monaco and waved a tearful farewell to fans, F\u00e0bregas is still waiting for the Ligue 1 club to agree a fee with Chelsea, leaving the whole business ripe for potential collapse. Like Morata, Tammy Abraham is a Chelsea striker who wants to leave on loan, though his departure is complicated by the fact he is already on loan. With his temporary stay at Championship side Aston Villa going thrillingly well, Abraham is demanding another chance to prove himself in the Premier League. Amid rumours of interest from Wolves, the Mirror is reporting that Abraham failed to turn up to training at Villa on Monday, and is hoping to force Chelsea to cancel his loan. Villa have already started looking for a replacement, with their gaze settling on Brentford\u2019s Neal Maupay, who like Abraham has scored 16 goals this season. They could also attempt to snaffle the \u00a310m-rated winger Adam Reach from their former manager Steve Bruce, soon to arrive at Sheffield Wednesday. West Ham want a striker on loan as well, and have taken a fancy to Internazionale\u2019s Gabriel \u2018Gabigol\u2019 Barbosa. Burnley, Cardiff, Newcastle and Fulham are all interested in the Marseille winger Clinton N\u2019Jie, formerly of Tottenham, but Burnley are hedging their bets by also eyeing up Stoke\u2019s James McClean. Fulham also want the Bordeaux right-back Youssouf Sabaly, while Cardiff are hoping to seal an \u00a38.5m deal for Nice midfielder Adrien Tameze in the next few days.

      "body": "<p>As he lay dying of tuberculosis in 1924, Franz Kafka left perhaps the most infamous last will and testament of any 20th-century writer. The note was sent in the form of a letter to his great friend, disciple, agent and executor, Max Brod. \u201cDear Max,\u201d it read, \u201cperhaps this time I will not recover at all\u2026\u201d The will went on to detail the few stories he had written \u201cthat can stand\u201d, which included The Judgment and <em>Metamorphosis</em>. \u201cEverything else of mine which is extant,\u201d Kafka demanded, \u201call those things without exception are to be burned, and I beg you to do this as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The note, discovered in Kafka\u2019s desk in the Prague apartment belonging to his parents, in which he lived for all but the last of his 40 years, left Brod with the worst of all dilemmas. Since the pair had first met as law students at Charles University \u2013 \u201ca collision of souls\u201d \u2013 22 years earlier, Brod, widely recognised as a literary prodigy himself, viewed Kafka as his great mission in life. Kafka was compulsive about his writing and despairing of its merit in about equal measure. By 1910, he confessed to Brod that he had never \u201cmanaged a single line I\u2019d care to acknowledge \u2026 The sentences literally crumble in my hands; I see their insides and have to stop quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Had it not been for Brod\u2019s insistent championing of his friend\u2019s genius, Kafka might well have destroyed all of his work long before he died. \u201cAt times,\u201d Brod confessed, \u201cI stood over him like a rod, drove him and forced him again and again by means of new tricks.\u201d Kafka rarely thanked his confidant for this bullying, but Brod was not deterred. Almost alone, he had read Kafka, understood the ways in which he was unique \u2013 qualities that would one day give rise to the term \u201cKafkaesque\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat mattered to me,\u201d Brod said of his efforts to get that work into print, \u201cwas the thing itself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/10/up-in-smoke-should-an-authors-dying-wishes-be-obeyed\" title=\"\">the helping of a friend even against the wish of a friend</a>.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7eabe0292696ac5bb497705a2cc346c48d24dfe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eabe0292696ac5bb497705a2cc346c48d24dfe4/0_391_3907_5217/749.jpg\" alt=\"Max Brod, Kafka\u2019s friend and executor, in around 1940.\" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What mattered to me \u2026 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/10/up-in-smoke-should-an-authors-dying-wishes-be-obeyed\">the helping of a friend even against the wish of a friend</a>\u2019\u2026 Max Brod, Kafka\u2019s friend and executor, in around 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On reading Kafka\u2019s posthumous instruction, Brod remained faithful to the writing, not to the writer.

      "bodyText": "As he lay dying of tuberculosis in 1924, Franz Kafka left perhaps the most infamous last will and testament of any 20th-century writer. The note was sent in the form of a letter to his great friend, disciple, agent and executor, Max Brod. \u201cDear Max,\u201d it read, \u201cperhaps this time I will not recover at all\u2026\u201d The will went on to detail the few stories he had written \u201cthat can stand\u201d, which included The Judgment and Metamorphosis. \u201cEverything else of mine which is extant,\u201d Kafka demanded, \u201call those things without exception are to be burned, and I beg you to do this as soon as possible.\u201d The note, discovered in Kafka\u2019s desk in the Prague apartment belonging to his parents, in which he lived for all but the last of his 40 years, left Brod with the worst of all dilemmas. Since the pair had first met as law students at Charles University \u2013 \u201ca collision of souls\u201d \u2013 22 years earlier, Brod, widely recognised as a literary prodigy himself, viewed Kafka as his great mission in life. Kafka was compulsive about his writing and despairing of its merit in about equal measure. By 1910, he confessed to Brod that he had never \u201cmanaged a single line I\u2019d care to acknowledge \u2026 The sentences literally crumble in my hands; I see their insides and have to stop quickly.\u201d Had it not been for Brod\u2019s insistent championing of his friend\u2019s genius, Kafka might well have destroyed all of his work long before he died. \u201cAt times,\u201d Brod confessed, \u201cI stood over him like a rod, drove him and forced him again and again by means of new tricks.\u201d Kafka rarely thanked his confidant for this bullying, but Brod was not deterred. Almost alone, he had read Kafka, understood the ways in which he was unique \u2013 qualities that would one day give rise to the term \u201cKafkaesque\u201d. \u201cWhat mattered to me,\u201d Brod said of his efforts to get that work into print, \u201cwas the thing itself, the helping of a friend even against the wish of a friend.\u201d On reading Kafka\u2019s posthumous instruction, Brod remained faithful to the writing, not to the writer. He did not follow Kafka\u2019s injunction to burn the unfinished manuscripts, notebooks and letters that were left behind. Instead, he preserved them, and in doing so, in an irony the author of The Trial would have understood, gave rise to a legal battle that has run from Brod\u2019s death, in Tel Aviv in 1968, almost up to the present day. Benjamin Balint\u2019s account of this saga is both a fine journalistic telling of that half century of courtroom drama, and a revealing examination of the writer and the relationships at its heart. In 1939, Brod escaped from Prague before the arrival of the Nazis with Kafka\u2019s papers in a battered suitcase. \u201cAn exile,\u201d Balint notes, \u201cis a refugee with a library.\u201d The library Brod carried contained all Kafka\u2019s prescient dread of the terrors to come.

After his death, he left all of the Kafka papers \u2013 including a sheaf of unpublished letters between the writer and Felice Bauer, the love of his life \u2013 in the care of his secretary, Esther Hoffe, and with his intentions for them maddeningly vague. Hoffe resisted overtures from the National Library of Israel, which argued that Brod wanted the papers to be given to its archive.

      "bodyText": "The French author and television presenter who claimed he could not love any woman over the age of 50 has said he has no regrets over his remarks that caused widespread outrage. Yann Moix, 50, who is promoting his latest book, Rompre, said his personal preferences in women were his own business and he was only being honest. \u201cI don\u2019t see this as pride, but almost as a curse. It\u2019s not my fault. We are not responsible for our tastes, our penchants, our inclinations. I\u2019m not here to hold forth on this,\u201d he told RTL radio. Moix, a prize-winning novelist, sparked a furious backlash after a question and answer interview was published in the latest edition of Marie-Claire magazine in which he claimed he was \u201cincapable\u201d of loving women in their 50s because they were \u201ctoo, too old\u201d. In the radio interview, he suggested it was important to face up to certain truths even if they caused offence. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a society where it\u2019s hard to be an individual. We have to always represent the universal citizen \u2026 someone who displeases nobody,\u201d he said. He added that while he considered himself a victim of his preferences he did not feel obliged to apologise for \u201cbeing different\u201d. \u201cEvery individual is a prisoner of their tastes. I\u2019m a prisoner of mine. It takes nothing away from a woman of 50 years that I don\u2019t want to sleep with her,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not responsible for my tastes; I\u2019m trying to be honest.

Planes could come in to land on both runways at the same time during busy periods, Heathrow has proposed, to help maximise its capacity ahead of expansion. The plans, requiring planning approval but tacitly backed through government support for increased aircraft capacity, would involve lifting the current cap to more than 500,000 flights a year. New areas of London would be brought under Heathrow flight paths for the first time. The airport will also start to sketch out where planes will fill the skies after the third runway opens, potentially as early as 2026. In a separate consultation last year, most respondents rejected the idea of concentrating more planes over the same area and asked the airport to vary flight paths, which is likely to affect thousands more homes. However, more distant areas under flight paths, such as parts of south-east London, could get some respite. John Stewart, of the Heathrow noise reduction campaigning group Hacan, said: \u201cAlthough a third runway will clearly bring many losers, one long-lasting impact of these proposed changes is that a break from aircraft noise would be guaranteed to many more people than who currently enjoy it, as Heathrow would make the biggest changes to its flight paths since opening in 1946.\u201d The consultation will ask how to alternate runways to best manage respite from noise, including on night flights. Heathrow has agreed to a six-and-a-half hour night flight ban, which could mean the first planes touch down as late as 5.30am, if it was to use two runways, or 5.15am if using just one.

We dressed in red and waved huge banners with period slogans, calling time on the government\u2019s reluctance to act.

We celebrated a small victory \u2013 evidence that activism can yield tangible results. But a year on from the protest, we are yet to see any meaningful policy change.

It is not unusual for cars and minibuses to queue for 20 minutes at a single pinch-point intersection. A lone suburban rail line serves residents in a few areas to the south but is tiny in the context of the wider city. Outside the centre many rely on <em>boda boda</em> motorbike taxis to navigate the narrow side alleys and potholed mud roads that make up much of the metropolis. Their safety record is notorious.</p> \n<p>Dar es Salaam\u2019s reliance on four arterial roads \u2013 two lanes each way for the most part, one lane in places \u2013 is a legacy of the colonial government that planned the city at the start of the 20th century for a population of 35,000. Most of the growth is made up of young people arriving from the countryside to find work, and as the population has exploded Dar es Salaam has grown around those four highways. Nearly all the expansion is happening on the periphery, and nearly all is informal and unplanned.</p> \n<p>Until recently, Morogoro Road, the arterial serving the north-west, was one of the most congested and polluted. \u201cIt was just dalla dallas,\u201d remembers Ulisses Navarro, a consultant on the city\u2019s original Dart bus rapid transit design in 2005, as we squeeze on to a packed bus for the long trip out towards the edge of the city. \u201cThat was the only way for people living out here. It was one of the worst.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Dart system boasts bus lanes separated from other traffic, mostly in the middle of the road to reduce stoppages. Ticket payment and control takes place at stations rather than on board, while step-free stations and boarding mean the entire route is accessible to people in wheelchairs or with buggies.</p> \n<p>We get on the first bus fine, but for the return journey have to wait for three buses before there is space to board.

      "body": "<p>Parts of the NHS are still in the dark ages, technologically speaking,\u201d says Professor Joe Harrison, chief executive of Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS foundation trust. \u201cThere are still sites across the NHS that don\u2019t even have wifi. In certain parts of the NHS we still believe that paper and pen are the way to capture data,\u201d he adds with barely concealed contempt. Harrison worries that the service\u2019s unhappy history with technology, most infamously exemplified by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/18/nhs-records-system-10bn\" title=\"\">the failure of the \u00a312bn Connecting for Health initiative</a>, a bold attempt by the then Labour government to modernise NHS IT but plagued by cost overruns and scrapped in<strong> </strong>2011, has left it poorly placed to benefit from the digital revolution.</p> <p>Harrison fervently believes that embracing tech, IT and digital innovation helps patients and staff and improves the quality of care. He appears both baffled and horrified that doctors at outpatient clinics still write notes from the consultation into the patient\u2019s often bulging paper medical record and that hospitals send patients letters to confirm their next appointment. \u201cThe vast majority of people who use tech on a daily basis would be happy to communicate and engage with the NHS in a different way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/07/matt-hancock-improving-nhs-it\">Matt Hancock has made big pledges to fix NHS IT - he must now deliver</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harrison unsurprisingly welcomes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/long-term-plan-for-nhs-england-undeliverable-amid-staffing-crisis\" title=\"\">NHS long-term plan</a>, launched this week, which spelled out a much more central role for technology in the health service over the next decade. Headline initiatives include rolling out online GP appointments to millions of patients and more people using approved health apps to manage their physical and mental health symptoms. \u201cI am really pleased to see technology and digital innovation feature so prominently,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cThere is so much scope to improve service delivery and patient experience through the use of technology \u2013 it is not a panacea for all things, but there is certainly much more technology can offer us as patients and as professionals.\u201d</p> <p>After Harrison\u2019s six years at the helm, Milton Keynes, an acute hospital with more than 4,000 staff, serving one of the fastest-growing populations in the country, is now one of the NHS\u2019s most technologically advanced hospitals. It is as close as any NHS trust to becoming what Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary and fellow digital evangelist, wants the entire service to be \u2013 \u201can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/my-vision-for-a-more-tech-driven-nhs\" title=\"\">ecosystem for the best technology</a> available\u201d.</p> <p>It integrates technology into much of what the hospital does, from giving patients wearable technology to monitor their clinical symptoms to booking appointments. Since last year, 300 patients with heart problems wear a wristband that automatically uploads their latest vital signs, such as their pulse, temperature and blood pressure, into their electronic patient record. This saves time, he points out. \u201cThe nurse doesn\u2019t even have to put the cuff on to measure their blood pressure; it\u2019s happening continuously.

      "bodyText": "Parts of the NHS are still in the dark ages, technologically speaking,\u201d says Professor Joe Harrison, chief executive of Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS foundation trust. \u201cThere are still sites across the NHS that don\u2019t even have wifi. In certain parts of the NHS we still believe that paper and pen are the way to capture data,\u201d he adds with barely concealed contempt. Harrison worries that the service\u2019s unhappy history with technology, most infamously exemplified by the failure of the \u00a312bn Connecting for Health initiative, a bold attempt by the then Labour government to modernise NHS IT but plagued by cost overruns and scrapped in 2011, has left it poorly placed to benefit from the digital revolution. Harrison fervently believes that embracing tech, IT and digital innovation helps patients and staff and improves the quality of care. He appears both baffled and horrified that doctors at outpatient clinics still write notes from the consultation into the patient\u2019s often bulging paper medical record and that hospitals send patients letters to confirm their next appointment. \u201cThe vast majority of people who use tech on a daily basis would be happy to communicate and engage with the NHS in a different way.\u201d Harrison unsurprisingly welcomes the NHS long-term plan, launched this week, which spelled out a much more central role for technology in the health service over the next decade. Headline initiatives include rolling out online GP appointments to millions of patients and more people using approved health apps to manage their physical and mental health symptoms. \u201cI am really pleased to see technology and digital innovation feature so prominently,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cThere is so much scope to improve service delivery and patient experience through the use of technology \u2013 it is not a panacea for all things, but there is certainly much more technology can offer us as patients and as professionals.\u201d After Harrison\u2019s six years at the helm, Milton Keynes, an acute hospital with more than 4,000 staff, serving one of the fastest-growing populations in the country, is now one of the NHS\u2019s most technologically advanced hospitals. It is as close as any NHS trust to becoming what Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary and fellow digital evangelist, wants the entire service to be \u2013 \u201can ecosystem for the best technology available\u201d. It integrates technology into much of what the hospital does, from giving patients wearable technology to monitor their clinical symptoms to booking appointments. Since last year, 300 patients with heart problems wear a wristband that automatically uploads their latest vital signs, such as their pulse, temperature and blood pressure, into their electronic patient record. This saves time, he points out. \u201cThe nurse doesn\u2019t even have to put the cuff on to measure their blood pressure; it\u2019s happening continuously. It\u2019s something a nurse or healthcare support worker doesn\u2019t need to do.\u201dHarrison is looking at expanding this from cardiology into other clinical areas, including diabetes. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about technology replacing the doctor or the nurse. If you take the human interaction out of having to physically enter the readings into the patient\u2019s record, then a valuable, scarce resource has more time to talk to the patient, feel their skin and see how they are.\u201d In April last year Milton Keynes became the first hospital to let patients book their own outpatient appointments online, something that Hancock and his predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, want to see happening everywhere. This ability to arrange consultations directly, using a phone or computer, \u201cis the Ocado or Tesco home delivery of the outpatient world\u201d, jokes Harrison. He sees that facility as potentially only the start of a process of patient empowerment.\u201cThat\u2019s the precursor to enabling that patient to look at their medical record on their phone, thereby making it transportable, and enabling them to go and see any healthcare professional, with their own medical record.\u201d It would mean that any member of staff in the UK could see a patient\u2019s medical record at the push of a button.

In recent decades researchers have conclusively shown that western imperialists and historians who dismissed sub-Saharan Africa as a vast wasteland awaiting \u201ccivilisation\u201d by Europeans were entirely wrong. Instead scholars have explored the riches, power and sophistication of cities and civilisations such as Great Zimbabwe, the empire of Mali, the kingdom of Benin and many others.

      "body": "<p>Who would I be without my work? I sometimes wonder about this, and perhaps the existential dread the question stirs in me is one reason I found Josh Cohen\u2019s book <em>Not Working: Why We Have to Stop</em> at times uncomfortable to read. Turning its pages, in which its author, a psychoanalyst, makes great claims for a certain kind of inertia, I had little choice but to consider why I work as hard as I do, and what might happen (nothing good, in my view) were I ever to stop. There is, I think, no ignoring the fact that, even in those of us who love and need work, lethargy is always lurking, ready to rise up and paralyse us \u2013 whether for a few moments or a few months. As Cohen described the feelings of those of his patients with burnout and other work-related conditions, I could not decide which I craved more: my bed or my desk. Is there a person alive who has not longed, sometimes, for what he calls \u201cthe desire for non-desire\u201d?</p> <p>Given that Cohen is both a devoted Freudian and a professor of literary theory, he writes of these things clearly and beguilingly, his sentences mostly unclogged with jargon \u2013 though it is hard not to hoot with laughter when, having described his childhood love of <em>Peanuts</em> and its slacker dog, Snoopy, he adds with utter seriousness: \u201cI hadn\u2019t read [Georges] Bataille then.\u201d (I tend to think we can understand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/28/peanuts-movie-charles-schulz-charlie-brown-cartoon\" title=\"\">the genius of Charles Schulz</a> without recourse to French intellectuals.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He seeks to make us, his readers, feel a little better about our fears when it comes to slobbery and distractedness by offering a sense of solidarity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cohen is good at revealing all the ways in which, even as the 21st century induces exhaustion, it banishes the expression of it; and everyone will recognise what he has to say about how life can feel like a facsimile, one in which we merely go through the motions, when we should be living it to the full. His account of Herman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/09/herman-melvilles-bartleby-and-the-steely-strength-of-mild-rebellion\" title=\"\">Melville\u2019s story </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/09/herman-melvilles-bartleby-and-the-steely-strength-of-mild-rebellion\" title=\"\">Bartleby, the Scrivener</a></em>, about a clerk who refuses to do any of the tasks required of him with the words: \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d, makes you want to read it immediately.</p> <p>Nevertheless, <em>Not Working</em> is rather a clunky mashup of case studies, memoir, literary criticism and biography. His wildly creative slackers and opt-outers include Emily Dickinson, Andy Warhol and Orson Welles \u2013 examples so extreme as to be less than useless in terms of illuminating his central arguments about the possibilities of non-work.</p> <p>It\u2019s not always easy to see how these composite parts fit together, and it\u2019s difficult, too, not to think that Cohen doesn\u2019t sometimes make a little too much of, say, his childhood dreaminess or his inclination, as a PhD student, to sit around doing nothing. It\u2019s not only that we\u2019ve all been there. But, given his academic qualifications, his several books and his dual career, his confessional tone is distinctly unconvincing. Staring out of the window seems to have done him nothing but good.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/02/josh-cohen-private-life-review\">The Private Life: Why We Remain in the Dark by Josh Cohen \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But perhaps this is half of his point. Cohen shares the conviction of the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott that creativity depends on maintaining contact with the \u201cstill, silent spot\u201d at the heart of the psyche; withdrawal into solitude, and the benefits this may bring, is one of the themes of his book. Perhaps, too, he seeks to make us, his readers, feel a little better about our fears when it comes to slobbery and distractedness by offering a sense of solidarity \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly right to imagine we\u2019re afraid. Moral disapprobation of apathy and collapse may be traced to medieval times and beyond.</p> <p>Though we\u2019re a more secular society now, our feeling that those who cannot, or will not, work are putting themselves in some kind of spiritual danger is hard to shake off, even if this isn\u2019t necessarily how we would articulate it.</p> <p>The dark places deep within us, moreover, maintain their power to unnerve; they must be kept at bay. It takes a rare nonchalance and, possibly, courage to reveal them to the world \u2013 to give in to abjectness and squalor and sloth. As Cohen writes, the slob disturbs \u201cbecause he puts us in touch with that formless, muddy region of the self we thought we\u2019d risen above\u201d. (On this score, his account of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/27/tracey-emin-my-bed-sale-christies\" title=\"\">Tracey Emin\u2019s controversial 1998 installation </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/27/tracey-emin-my-bed-sale-christies\" title=\"\">My Bed</a></em> is one of the best and most sympathetic I\u2019ve read.) If the daydreamer resists gravity as he rises above the clouds, the slob gives in to its downward pull.</p> <p>Of course, there is another way: my own understanding of these things is Larkinesque. I wouldn\u2019t toss the toad work off my back even if I could, for what would freedom mean without it? Would it exist at all?</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t to say that, for all its frustrations, I didn\u2019t warm to Josh Cohen\u2019s book. It is very nice \u2013 comforting, even \u2013 to be told that it\u2019s OK to stop, even if such a strategy is, for you, impossible. I\u2019ll keep the idea in reserve: a light thought alongside all my dark ones.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Not Working: Why We Have to Stop</em> by Josh Cohen is published by Granta Books (\u00a314.99).

As Cohen described the feelings of those of his patients with burnout and other work-related conditions, I could not decide which I craved more: my bed or my desk. Is there a person alive who has not longed, sometimes, for what he calls \u201cthe desire for non-desire\u201d? Given that Cohen is both a devoted Freudian and a professor of literary theory, he writes of these things clearly and beguilingly, his sentences mostly unclogged with jargon \u2013 though it is hard not to hoot with laughter when, having described his childhood love of Peanuts and its slacker dog, Snoopy, he adds with utter seriousness: \u201cI hadn\u2019t read [Georges] Bataille then.\u201d (I tend to think we can understand the genius of Charles Schulz without recourse to French intellectuals.) Cohen is good at revealing all the ways in which, even as the 21st century induces exhaustion, it banishes the expression of it; and everyone will recognise what he has to say about how life can feel like a facsimile, one in which we merely go through the motions, when we should be living it to the full. His account of Herman Melville\u2019s story Bartleby, the Scrivener, about a clerk who refuses to do any of the tasks required of him with the words: \u201cI would prefer not to\u201d, makes you want to read it immediately. Nevertheless, Not Working is rather a clunky mashup of case studies, memoir, literary criticism and biography. His wildly creative slackers and opt-outers include Emily Dickinson, Andy Warhol and Orson Welles \u2013 examples so extreme as to be less than useless in terms of illuminating his central arguments about the possibilities of non-work. It\u2019s not always easy to see how these composite parts fit together, and it\u2019s difficult, too, not to think that Cohen doesn\u2019t sometimes make a little too much of, say, his childhood dreaminess or his inclination, as a PhD student, to sit around doing nothing. It\u2019s not only that we\u2019ve all been there. But, given his academic qualifications, his several books and his dual career, his confessional tone is distinctly unconvincing. Staring out of the window seems to have done him nothing but good. But perhaps this is half of his point. Cohen shares the conviction of the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott that creativity depends on maintaining contact with the \u201cstill, silent spot\u201d at the heart of the psyche; withdrawal into solitude, and the benefits this may bring, is one of the themes of his book. Perhaps, too, he seeks to make us, his readers, feel a little better about our fears when it comes to slobbery and distractedness by offering a sense of solidarity \u2013 and he\u2019s certainly right to imagine we\u2019re afraid. Moral disapprobation of apathy and collapse may be traced to medieval times and beyond. Though we\u2019re a more secular society now, our feeling that those who cannot, or will not, work are putting themselves in some kind of spiritual danger is hard to shake off, even if this isn\u2019t necessarily how we would articulate it. The dark places deep within us, moreover, maintain their power to unnerve; they must be kept at bay. It takes a rare nonchalance and, possibly, courage to reveal them to the world \u2013 to give in to abjectness and squalor and sloth. As Cohen writes, the slob disturbs \u201cbecause he puts us in touch with that formless, muddy region of the self we thought we\u2019d risen above\u201d. (On this score, his account of Tracey Emin\u2019s controversial 1998 installation My Bed is one of the best and most sympathetic I\u2019ve read.) If the daydreamer resists gravity as he rises above the clouds, the slob gives in to its downward pull. Of course, there is another way: my own understanding of these things is Larkinesque. I wouldn\u2019t toss the toad work off my back even if I could, for what would freedom mean without it? Would it exist at all? But this isn\u2019t to say that, for all its frustrations, I didn\u2019t warm to Josh Cohen\u2019s book. It is very nice \u2013 comforting, even \u2013 to be told that it\u2019s OK to stop, even if such a strategy is, for you, impossible. I\u2019ll keep the idea in reserve: a light thought alongside all my dark ones. \u2022 Not Working: Why We Have to Stop by Josh Cohen is published by Granta Books (\u00a314.99).

Before then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/06/brexit-as-parliament-returns-to-work-what-happens-now\">May aims to offer reassurances</a> in three areas: Northern Ireland, the role of parliament in future negotiations and (in written and legal form) the role of EU27 member states.</p> <p>The DUP and hardliner Tory Brexiters will not be convinced, and the EU is unlikely to make any further concessions until MPs have defeated the agreement at least once, as seems almost certain, so as to prevent Brexiters from coming back for yet more.</p> <p>If the margin of the defeat is less than about 100, the government may make a final appeal to the EU27 for help in the unlikely hope it can come back to parliament with a substantively different proposition.</p> <p>Pressure on May will increase. Labour could table a vote of no confidence, and hard-Brexiters in her cabinet could revolt. Ultimately, she hopes to convince the DUP, Tory hardliners and enough Labour leavers in a second parliamentary vote that the choice is her Brexit, no deal, or no Brexit at all.</p> <p>A very heavy defeat on 15 January, or a second defeat, could trigger a crisis. Anything could happen: a mass cabinet walkout; indicative votes; a change of strategy, perhaps towards a permanent customs union; a second referendum, or an election (though the two latter options would mean extending article 50, requiring EU27 agreement).</p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <ul> <li><p>No-deal Brexit lorry rehearsal in Kent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/no-deal-brexit-rehearsal-tests-traffic-congestion-in-kent\">\u201ca waste of time\u201d.</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/may-will-win-vote-on-her-deal-on-15-january-says-brexit-minister\">May will win vote</a> on her deal on 15 January, says Brexit minister.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/most-tory-members-would-choose-no-deal-over-may-brexit-plan\">Most Tory members would choose no deal</a> over May\u2019s plan.</p></li> <li><p>Chris Patten says UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/07/uk-must-have-second-eu-referendum-chris-patten-tory\">must have second EU referendum</a>.</p></li> <li><p>John Redwood says UK is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/05/john-redwood-uk-brexit-benefits-ken-clarke\">losing sight of Brexit benefits</a>.</p></li> <li><p>No-deal Brexit would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/04/no-deal-brexit-would-be-catastrophic-uk-farmers-warns-nfu\">catastrophic for UK farmers</a>, warns the NFU.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/04/uk-nationals-in-italy-assured-of-residency-in-event-of-no-brexit-deal\">UK nationals in Italy assured of residency</a> in event of no-deal Brexit.</p></li> <li><p>Publicity drive to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/03/publicity-drive-to-prepare-uk-public-for-possible-no-deal-brexit\">prepare UK public for possible no-deal</a> Brexit.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/01/sadiq-khan-angers-brexiters-pro-eu-fireworks-display-london-new-years-eve\">Sadiq Khan angers Brexiters</a> with pro-EU fireworks display.</p></li> <li><p>Record number of Britons seek <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/31/record-number-of-britons-seeking-irish-passports-ahead-of-brexit\">Irish passports before Brexit</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Top comment</h2> <p>In the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/uncivil-war-brexit-deceit-james-graham-dominic-cummings\">Anne Perkins says</a> of Channel 4\u2019s Brexit drama The Uncivil War, which focuses on the role of Dominic Cummings, that Brexit was \u201cfuelled by deceit, not one oddball\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The shameless misinformation that Cummings and his associates propagated was infinitely more brazen and dangerous than anything that has gone before \u2026 Their audacity was best summed up in the single, Cummings-crafted message, \u201cTake back control\u201d, implying that control \u2013 sovereignty \u2013 had been frivolously, cravenly surrendered by an effete political class for no discernible reward. The notorious pledge of \u00a3350m a week to the NHS was the symbol of what restored sovereignty would deliver. It was a grossly misleading figure that crowned a campaign based on deceit. No one imagines we live in a world where politicians never dissemble, but nor did we imagine that they painted deliberate untruths on campaign buses.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/07/tribal-politics-free-vote-brexit-theresa-may-no-deal\">Simon Jenkins says</a> MPs should be given a free vote on the deal:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is said to be a majority of MPs against no deal, but that means nothing without a positive alternative. There is none. There is only May\u2019s deal. The Brexiters\u2019 argument that Britain held all the cards was rubbish. Next week\u2019s vote still looks hopeless, but that is because so many MPs will defy their whips. This is a classic case where parliament should rise above party. May should agree with Corbyn to have next week\u2019s vote a free one, and to let conscience divide the house. Parliament is the national interest in conclave. MPs at this time should decide individually, not tribally.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet</h2> <p>Labour\u2019s David Lammy on that no-deal Brexit rehearsal (in the end, only 89 trucks showed up):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1082239818241843200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There is no better representation of the sheer absurdity of Brexit than this. 150 lorries driving round a disused airport practising the popular British pastime of queuing, in preparation for an entirely self-inflicted national catastrophe. <a href=\"https://t.co/fjlQ56caAK\">https://t.co/fjlQ56caAK</a></p>&mdash; David Lammy (@DavidLammy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1082239818241843200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

If you would like to receive it as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. Producing the Guardian\u2019s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian supporter. Thank you. Top stories Here we are, then: 2019. In less than three months, the UK is due to leave the EU. Not that you\u2019d know it. The withdrawal deal struck between Theresa May and the EU27 is no closer to winning MPs\u2019 approval than it was before Christmas. After the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the UK to \u201cget its act together\u201d, the prime minister urged the Commons in her new year address to allow the the country to \u201cturn a corner\u201d by voting through the unpopular deal. But she failed to win any concessions from EU leaders over the Christmas period and, having insisted MPs will vote on the agreement in the week starting 14 January (the UK will be \u201cin uncharted territory\u201d if they reject it, she warned), has now launched a fresh round of appeals to the bloc to cut her some slack on the Irish backstop. \u201cFriendly\u201d conversations with, among others, Juncker have so far got her nowhere, with the EU adamant that negotiations on the withdrawal agreement \u201chave been concluded\u201d and the bloc has gone as far as it can in offering reassurances over the backstop. Germany and Ireland are doing what they can, but any potential fix they come up with will be limited to tweaks to the political declaration. The EU could perhaps offer an \u201cexchange of letters\u201d confirming its intention to conclude trade talks by 2021, so avoiding the need for the backstop, but whether that will satisfy Tory Brexiters or the DUP, which has ruled out backing the deal, is far from clear. Labour, meanwhile, will support a backbench amendment that could severely restrict the government\u2019s taxation powers unless no deal is taken off the table, and could offer a second referendum on an EU deal it renegotiates, as the party leadership came under intense pressure over its Brexit policy. One poll showed Labour support would collapse at the next election if it eventually backed a Brexit deal, while another survey of party members suggested most believed Jeremy Corbyn should back a second Brexit vote \u2013 90% would opt to remain. So far, however, the Labour leader has remained defiant. Meanwhile, Brexit-related economic gloom deepened. Economists predicted GDP growth of just 0.1% for the final quarter of 2018, manufacturers face their biggest worker shortage in 30 years and house prices took a major hit. Police reinforcements are to be deployed to Northern Ireland to deal with the disorder of a possible no-deal Brexit, which universities said would be catastrophic, and the government has signed a \u00a314m contract with a ferry firm that has no ferries and copied its T&amp;Cs from a fast food delivery joint. As the prime minister announced she would chair a new cabinet committee on Brexit planning, including for no deal, the one thing we can be sure of is that it\u2019s going to be a fun-packed few weeks. What next? Parliament will finally have its delayed vote on the withdrawal agreement on 15 January, government sources have confirmed. Before then, May aims to offer reassurances in three areas: Northern Ireland, the role of parliament in future negotiations and (in written and legal form) the role of EU27 member states. The DUP and hardliner Tory Brexiters will not be convinced, and the EU is unlikely to make any further concessions until MPs have defeated the agreement at least once, as seems almost certain, so as to prevent Brexiters from coming back for yet more. If the margin of the defeat is less than about 100, the government may make a final appeal to the EU27 for help in the unlikely hope it can come back to parliament with a substantively different proposition. Pressure on May will increase. Labour could table a vote of no confidence, and hard-Brexiters in her cabinet could revolt. Ultimately, she hopes to convince the DUP, Tory hardliners and enough Labour leavers in a second parliamentary vote that the choice is her Brexit, no deal, or no Brexit at all. A very heavy defeat on 15 January, or a second defeat, could trigger a crisis. Anything could happen: a mass cabinet walkout; indicative votes; a change of strategy, perhaps towards a permanent customs union; a second referendum, or an election (though the two latter options would mean extending article 50, requiring EU27 agreement). Best of the rest No-deal Brexit lorry rehearsal in Kent \u201ca waste of time\u201d. May will win vote on her deal on 15 January, says Brexit minister. Most Tory members would choose no deal over May\u2019s plan. Chris Patten says UK must have second EU referendum. John Redwood says UK is losing sight of Brexit benefits. No-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for UK farmers, warns the NFU. UK nationals in Italy assured of residency in event of no-deal Brexit. Publicity drive to prepare UK public for possible no-deal Brexit. Sadiq Khan angers Brexiters with pro-EU fireworks display. Record number of Britons seek Irish passports before Brexit. Top comment In the Guardian, Anne Perkins says of Channel 4\u2019s Brexit drama The Uncivil War, which focuses on the role of Dominic Cummings, that Brexit was \u201cfuelled by deceit, not one oddball\u201d: The shameless misinformation that Cummings and his associates propagated was infinitely more brazen and dangerous than anything that has gone before \u2026 Their audacity was best summed up in the single, Cummings-crafted message, \u201cTake back control\u201d, implying that control \u2013 sovereignty \u2013 had been frivolously, cravenly surrendered by an effete political class for no discernible reward. The notorious pledge of \u00a3350m a week to the NHS was the symbol of what restored sovereignty would deliver. It was a grossly misleading figure that crowned a campaign based on deceit. No one imagines we live in a world where politicians never dissemble, but nor did we imagine that they painted deliberate untruths on campaign buses. Simon Jenkins says MPs should be given a free vote on the deal: There is said to be a majority of MPs against no deal, but that means nothing without a positive alternative. There is none. There is only May\u2019s deal. The Brexiters\u2019 argument that Britain held all the cards was rubbish. Next week\u2019s vote still looks hopeless, but that is because so many MPs will defy their whips. This is a classic case where parliament should rise above party. May should agree with Corbyn to have next week\u2019s vote a free one, and to let conscience divide the house. Parliament is the national interest in conclave. MPs at this time should decide individually, not tribally. Top tweet Labour\u2019s David Lammy on that no-deal Brexit rehearsal (in the end, only 89 trucks showed up):",

Leftwing activists from the anti-Brexit campaign Another Europe is Possible, the group behind a similar push at Labour\u2019s conference last year, have drafted a tough motion calling on Labour to support a fresh referendum. The party\u2019s policy cannot be changed again until its 2019 conference, but organisers hope that the sheer number of motions submitted before its member-led policy forum this Wednesday will have heavy symbolism in the crucial weeks ahead. An unprecedented 119 constituency Labour parties (CLPs) submitted pro-referendum motions before Labour\u2019s last conference in September. The campaign was key to setting the direction for Labour\u2019s current policy \u2013 to push for an election but then leave all options on the table, including a referendum. That number of anti-Brexit motions could almost double for Wednesday\u2019s national policy forum; members from 201 CLPs have so far given commitments to submit pro-referendum motions for debate. The forum will be attended by Labour frontbenchers including the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, as well as party officials and union leaders. Ana Oppenheim, an organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: \u201cThe appetite at the grassroots to take a clear stand against Brexit is overwhelming.

      "bodyText": "Two months after narrowly winning a contentious election in which he nailed his colors firmly to the mast of Trumpism, Ron DeSantis will be sworn in as Florida\u2019s 46th governor on Tuesday with voters in the nation\u2019s third most populous state still unsure exactly what they will be getting. Many of the Republican\u2019s picks for his new administration during the seven weeks\u2019 transition since his progressive Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum conceded have, predictably, followed his predecessor Rick Scott\u2019s brand of hardline conservatism. For example, Mary Mayhew, his choice to lead Florida\u2019s healthcare agency, served the White House in blocking expansion of the Medicaid program that provides health insurance for the poor. And DeSantis\u2019s key adviser and former state House speaker, Richard Corcoran, is a rightwing ideologue who will become the next commissioner of education. But other considerably more moderate appointments have left DeSantis supporters scratching their heads. Two prominent Democrats, Jared Moskowitz and Jim Zingale, have been nominated to lead, respectively, Florida\u2019s departments of emergency management and revenue. And in a clear break from the industry-friendly policies of an outgoing governor who was infamously branded Red Tide Rick, DeSantis has pledged to raise the environment and clean water as priority issues in arguably the nation\u2019s most ecologically fragile state. It is, in DeSantis\u2019s own words, the fulfilling of a campaign pledge to embrace bipartisanship and unite a divided electorate, who handed him a recount victory by fewer than 33,000 votes, from more than 8.2m cast. \u201cWe were elected to serve all Floridians and that is a charge we will keep,\u201d DeSantis said in a written address to the state published at the weekend (he did not respond to requests from the Guardian and other media outlets for a pre-inauguration interview). \u201cI know there are political divides in our state, but the election is over and it is time for our state to come together. That means prioritising environmental issues \u2026 we will put Everglades restoration into high gear and make it the reality that Floridians have been promised for three decades.\u201d To some analysts, however, the self-styled \u201cpitbull Trump defender\u201d whose most infamous campaign ad featured him reading the Trump book The Art of the Deal as a bedside story to his infant son has been forced to follow a more moderate path. One that increasingly veers from that of the US president, who praised him as a \u201cgreat Congressman [who] will be a great Governor\u201d. \u201cThe assumption from the beginning was that it would be all Trump all the time, but it\u2019s not turning out that way,\u201d said Susan MacManus, emeritus professor of political science at the University of South Florida and a long-time expert on Florida politics. \u201cThe narrowness of his victory and the changing demographics of the state made it very clear among savvy Republicans that they have to broaden their base. He\u2019s already demonstrated he\u2019s doing some of that by his two Democratic appointments, and even a discussion of willingness not to clamp down so much on medicinal marijuana.\u201d Whether DeSantis will prove to be a champion of Florida\u2019s environment, which is under severe threat from climate change and water pollution, could even influence Trump\u2019s chances of re-election in 2020, MacManus believes. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to be,\u201d she said. \u201cThese younger generations are the environmental generations. A lot of small businesses in south-west Florida have been hurt by the red tide and are Republican leaning and they\u2019re not going to take some kind of \u2018well, we\u2019ll get to that later\u2019 approach any more. \u201cThese people are really upset about pollution of the rivers and the Everglades.

Only two women, and no African Americans, are among the group of 11 Scott-favoured nominees from which DeSantis must choose. But is it the Florida voters\u2019 passage of Amendment 4, a voter-approved measure that restores voting rights to up to 1.5 million mostly black felons, other than murderers and sexual offenders, who have served their sentences, that is already proving a racial hot potato to the incoming governor. In December, DeSantis said it would be months before Florida\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature would approve \u201cimplementing language\u201d to allow the measure to be passed into law, a claim that earned an immediate scorching rebuke from Melba Pearson, executive director of the ACLU of Florida. \u201cDeSantis wants to stand in the way of Amendment 4 by asking the legislature to pass an implementing bill, where in fact Amendment 4 is self-executing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only responsibility DeSantis has right now is to direct state agencies without delay to register voters consistent with state law.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When I was living in Yemen during the 1980s, someone gave me a battered old map. Information was scarce then, and accurate maps were extremely hard to come by. So departing expatriates tended to pass on any treasures to new arrivals. As he did so, my benefactor paused. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get caught with this.\u201d</p> <p>Maps, you see, can be dangerous. I think of this when I meet Martin Greenaway, a cartographer at Stanfords in London. Martin is sitting by a couple of computer screens behind a treasure trove of maps: tables covered in vast colourful countries, wall racks groaning with continents, drawers stuffed with cities and mountain ranges. Stanfords has been making maps since the mid-1850s, and has operated from this purpose-built site on London\u2019s Long Acre since 1901. Now it is moving on \u2013 opening new premises in nearby Mercer Walk on 10 January.</p> <p>Martin laughs at my Yemen story. \u201cA customer came in and told us how, in the 1970s, he pulled out a 1:50,000 map on a bus and got into trouble with a Spanish secret policeman sitting next to him.

According to NHS figures for 2018, 1,138 women and 959 men were undertaking their first foundation year of medical training. However, only 14.5% of those at the top of their profession were women, with 1,389 female consultants to 8,164 male. A small survey of women working in surgery has attempted to examine why so few pursue a career in the field. Writing in the journal BMJ Open, the authors report how they posted a survey on both Twitter and a Facebook group for women of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in October 2017. Of the 81 participants, who spanned all levels of training, 88% said they felt surgery was a male-dominated field, with 53% citing trauma and orthopaedic surgery (which deals with the musculoskeletal system) as sexist \u2013 the highest proportion for any speciality. Overall, 59% of participants said they had experienced sexism. When it came to barriers for women, 34% said they felt the surgery profession did not make motherhood or a family life very likely, while 16% said it felt like an \u201cold boys\u2019 club\u201d. The same proportion raised childcare issues, while 10% flagged unsocial working hours as a barrier. More than a quarter said that other specialisms offered a better work-life balance. \u201cThere is a culture that basically discourages females to pursue this career,\u201d said Dr Maria Irene Bellini of Imperial College, London, first author of the study, saying that visibility of senior women in the profession is a key factor. \u201cI strongly believe that you cannot be what you cannot see,\u201d she said, adding that lack of support during pregnancy is another issue. The authors say common themes emerged among written comments, including conflicts between personal life and career, the problematically rigid structure of surgical training \u2013 and blatant discrimination. \u201cI got told by another surgeon that he left vascular surgery for plastics because there were \u2018too many women surgeons and they caused too much drama\u2019,\u201d wrote one participant, while another commented: \u201cPatients don\u2019t think women can be doctors, let alone surgeons.\u201d Bellini said such perceptions were damaging: \u201cYou feel like you have to fight not only against the institution for the way [it is] organised [to] favour men, but also some patients that don\u2019t trust females because there is a general perception, dominated by unconscious bias, [that] this is a male-dominated field and a man\u2019s profession.\u201d When the team asked how the field could be changed to retain women, 42% of participants said more flexible career paths and training were important, but almost a third noted that current flexible pathways are looked down on. However, the study was small and reached only a subset of surgeons, and there could also have been bias in who answered the survey. Bellini said the attrition of women in surgery showed something serious was amiss. \u201cWhy, if there is not discrimination, are the numbers what they are?\u201d she said. Scarlett McNally, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at a hospital in Eastbourne who has been a surgeon for 25 years, said concerns raised by the research were very familiar. \u201cThis is exactly what women surgeons are saying and feeling,\u201d she said, adding that structural changes, mentoring and tackling sexist behaviours are important. \u201cIn all specialties, structures should be improved to make it easier for women and men \u2013 or the second parent\u2013 to take shared parental leave or less-than-full-time training. This would not only improve life for these doctors, but also show future cohorts that this is possible,\u201d she said. But McNally said the situation was improving, noting that the experiences captured by the survey could stretch back over decades, and there was now a legal maximum of working 48 hours a week \u2013 although surveys suggest some trainees work considerably longer hours. \u201cNow we only do life- or limb-threatening surgery at night. Hence we no longer need the heroic, sleep-deprived image of a surgeon; there is more team work and the learning opportunities can easily be focused into a shorter working week,\u201d she said. \u201cA variety of lifestyles is possible around this fantastic career.\u201d",

Exclusion zones around airports will be extended to about a three-mile radius, and further from runway ends, while police will be able to issue on-the-spot fines.

The Ministry of Justice says helping prisoners keep up family ties leads to lower rates of reoffending. Lowdham Grange, run by Serco, was found to have a high rate of violent incidents, and has put in a hotline where inmates can report violent or antisocial behaviour. \u201cWe did see some innovative practice, and recent improvements needed to be embedded,\u201d said Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: What does 2019 hold for North Korea?</h2> \n<p>As Kim Jong-un <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/07/special-north-korean-train-reportedly-crosses-chinese-border\">visits China again</a> and attempts to negotiate a fresh summit with Donald Trump, the Guardian\u2019s Tania Branigan looks at his leadership so far, while Emma Graham-Harrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2019/jan/08/what-does-2019-hold-for-kim-jong-un-and-north-korea-podcast\">describes a rare trip to Pyongyang</a> and the humanitarian conditions for ordinary North Koreans.

But Dalton dropped an insanity defence and told the judge: \u201cI\u2019ve wanted this for quite a while.\u201d Solis said: \u201cThere are personal reasons for him. He does not want to put his family through that, or the victims\u2019 families, through the trial. It\u2019s his decision.\u201d The pleas mean he could be sentenced to life without parole. * * * Drone users face curbs \u2013 Police will be handed extra powers to combat drones after the mass disruption at Gatwick airport in the run-up to Christmas. Exclusion zones around airports will be extended to about a three-mile radius, and further from runway ends, while police will be able to issue on-the-spot fines. Operators of larger drones will be required to register and take an online drone pilot competency test, and the Home Office is to test the use of counter-drone technology at airports and prisons. Police will be empowered to land, seize and search drones. * * * Gene pairs \u2013 \u201cYou have to tolerate another animal next to you for an extended period of time and that is not easy.\u201d It might sound to some like the institution of marriage, but the scientist is talking about monogamous species and what makes them stick together. Researchers say they have located the DNA that correlates with certain animals staying paired up to survive and raise offspring while others go their separate ways. \u201cWhat evolution came up with is brilliant,\u201d says Hans Hoffman, a senior author on the paper. \u201cWhen we enter into a pair bond, or have offspring we must take care of, we find it rewarding. The reward system gets hijacked.\u201d Future studies might manipulate genes in animals to see if it makes monogamous species promiscuous and vice versa. * * * From mugshots to happy snaps \u2013 The privately run Lowdham Grange prison in Nottinghamshire has been praised by inspectors for putting in a photo booth so inmates can take pictures with their visiting families. The Ministry of Justice says helping prisoners keep up family ties leads to lower rates of reoffending. Lowdham Grange, run by Serco, was found to have a high rate of violent incidents, and has put in a hotline where inmates can report violent or antisocial behaviour. \u201cWe did see some innovative practice, and recent improvements needed to be embedded,\u201d said Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons. Today in Focus podcast: What does 2019 hold for North Korea? As Kim Jong-un visits China again and attempts to negotiate a fresh summit with Donald Trump, the Guardian\u2019s Tania Branigan looks at his leadership so far, while Emma Graham-Harrison describes a rare trip to Pyongyang and the humanitarian conditions for ordinary North Koreans. Plus: Catherine Shoard, at the start of the annual film awards season, argues prizes are not necessarily a mark of quality \u2026 Lunchtime read: \u2018Bounced from place to place\u2019 The commission on the future of social housing believes 3.1m new social homes are needed to house people in three groups: those in greatest need, including the homeless, younger trapped renters and older renters. Robert Booth speaks to people from each of these groups. Sport R\u00faben Neves\u2019s second-half goal gave Wolverhampton Wanderers a 2-1 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup third round before last night\u2019s fourth-round draw pitted Arsenal and Manchester United against each. Newport were rewarded for their exploits against Leicester City with a trip to Middlesbrough. Crucial talks on the future of European club rugby are about to commence with Heineken Champions Cup organisers seeking assurances that all parties are fully committed to the tournament beyond 2022. Alex Hepburn, a Worcestershire CCC all-rounder, raped a sleeping woman after helping to set up a sexual conquest \u201cgame\u201d with friends on WhatsApp, a court has heard. World Anti-Doping Agency experts hope to finally get their hands on secret Russian doping data after a row over specialist IT equipment was resolved. The Ferrari Formula One team have replaced their team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, with Mattia Binotto, their chief technical officer. And when a mugger approached a woman on the streets of Rio, he had little idea how things badly would turn out for him \u2013 his would-be victim was UFC strawweight fighter Polyana Viana, who ensured the encounter ended in predictable and bloody fashion. Business Overnight the ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has declared he is innocent of any wrongdoing as he appeared in a Tokyo court charged with financial misconduct. \u201cI have always acted with integrity,\u201d Ghosn said. \u201cI never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed.\u201d Shares have been mixed in Asia with officials keeping silent after two days of talks on the China-US trade tensions wrapped up. A short time ago Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index was up 1.1% while the Hang Seng had added 0.3%. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P ASX 200 gained 0.6% and the South Korean Kospi gave up 0.2%. Shares fell in Taiwan and Thailand but rose in Singapore and Indonesia. The FTSE is forecast to open higher, while the pound has been trading at $1.276 and \u20ac1.115 overnight. The papers Most front pages lead with news of May\u2019s NHS plan and the tens of thousands of new staff needed for it to work. The i says: \u201cThe NHS needs YOU\u201d, while the Mirror claims the plan is \u201cWrong medicine\u201d. The Mail (\u201cThe doctor will see you by Skype\u201d) and the Times (\u201cMillions of patients to see doctor by Skype\u201d) focus on the teleconferencing part of the plan. The Express seems to eat up the PM\u2019s announcement, hailing an \u201cNHS fit for 21st century\u201d, whereas the Guardian says: \u201cTime to curb privatisation of care, NHS chiefs tell PM\u201d.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Charmed </strong><br><strong>9pm, E4</strong><br></h2> <p>This fresh reboot of the 90s/00s witchy drama has a few things going for it. It boasts a Riverdale-style sheen, a trio of energetic, young female leads (played by newcomers Madeleine Mantock, Sarah Jeffery and Melonie Diaz) and some scary computer-generated demons. However, as a continuation of a cult series, it ends up feeling more superficial than supernatural, with clunky dialogue about feminism and rape culture that doesn\u2019t quite hit the mark, and a strange lack of agency for its protagonists. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>My Million Pound Menu <br>8pm, BBC Two<br></h2> <p>Let the pizzicato strings commence as Fred \u201cFirst Dates\u201d Sirieix fronts a series to find the restaurant brands of tomorrow. Among those vying to impress a panel of investors, all successes in the restaurant industry, is Ed, who is seeking to create a \u201cduck Nando\u2019s\u201d. Each concept gets a trial run in a pop-up restaurant in Manchester. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Silent Witness <br>9pm, BBC One<br></h2> <p>Part one of a gripping series opener, Two Spirits is proof of why this crime drama strand continues to hold its own on British TV two decades after its debut. After investigating a brutal attack on a trans man, the team realise that the assault is simply part of a larger outbreak of violence against the community. Continues tomorrow. <em>Mike Bradley</em></p> <h2>Icons <br>9pm, BBC Two<br></h2> <p>Einstein, Picasso, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/04/martin-luther-king-last-31-hours-the-story-of-his-prophetic-last-speech\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a> \u2013 who was the greatest icon of the 20th century? This thought-provoking series asks viewers to decide what makes a great leader (the subject of tonight\u2019s opener) and rate the genius of sportspeople, explorers and inventors who transformed the way we live. Continues tomorrow. <strong> </strong><em>MB</em></p> <h2>Escape at Dannemora<br>9pm, Sky Atlantic<br></h2> <p>Starry of cast and slowly paced, this Ben Stiller-directed jailbreak drama comes across as overkeen to show off its quality. Yet, as manipulative inmate Richard Matt (Benicio del Toro) plans his escape, there is plenty to admire, notably Patricia Arquette\u2019s performance as a vulnerable prison worker. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Catastrophe <br>10pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>Still funny but slightly off the boil judging by this series four opener, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/14/sharon-horgan-rob-delaney-catastrophe-sitcom\" title=\"\">Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney</a>\u2019s comedy is starting to cram in just a little too much catastrophe: Rob has a car crash that somehow leads to him attracting a spooky stalker (the evergreen Julie Hesmondhalgh) and Sharon gets caught shoplifting. <em>MB</em></p> <h2>Film choice<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"beee07c1dd24b90ae1018e89e6479a6a37064c8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beee07c1dd24b90ae1018e89e6479a6a37064c8b/0_1_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"To the dark side \u2026 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To the dark side \u2026 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, 5.50pm, ITV2</strong><br>Chris Columbus\u2019s second entry in the Potter archive is like the first one, but darker and scarier, with Daniel Radcliffe\u2019s wizard and his pals encountering spiders (big ones), a flying Ford Anglia, Dobby the heroic house elf, and Kenneth Branagh\u2019s bumptious dark arts master Gilderoy Lockhart. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s best live sport<br></h2> <p><strong>T20 Cricket: Sydney Thunder v Brisbane Heat </strong>8am, BT Sport 2.

      "bodyText": "Charmed 9pm, E4 This fresh reboot of the 90s/00s witchy drama has a few things going for it. It boasts a Riverdale-style sheen, a trio of energetic, young female leads (played by newcomers Madeleine Mantock, Sarah Jeffery and Melonie Diaz) and some scary computer-generated demons. However, as a continuation of a cult series, it ends up feeling more superficial than supernatural, with clunky dialogue about feminism and rape culture that doesn\u2019t quite hit the mark, and a strange lack of agency for its protagonists. Hannah J Davies My Million Pound Menu 8pm, BBC Two Let the pizzicato strings commence as Fred \u201cFirst Dates\u201d Sirieix fronts a series to find the restaurant brands of tomorrow. Among those vying to impress a panel of investors, all successes in the restaurant industry, is Ed, who is seeking to create a \u201cduck Nando\u2019s\u201d. Each concept gets a trial run in a pop-up restaurant in Manchester. David Stubbs Silent Witness 9pm, BBC One Part one of a gripping series opener, Two Spirits is proof of why this crime drama strand continues to hold its own on British TV two decades after its debut. After investigating a brutal attack on a trans man, the team realise that the assault is simply part of a larger outbreak of violence against the community. Continues tomorrow. Mike Bradley Icons 9pm, BBC Two Einstein, Picasso, Martin Luther King \u2013 who was the greatest icon of the 20th century? This thought-provoking series asks viewers to decide what makes a great leader (the subject of tonight\u2019s opener) and rate the genius of sportspeople, explorers and inventors who transformed the way we live. Continues tomorrow. MB Escape at Dannemora 9pm, Sky Atlantic Starry of cast and slowly paced, this Ben Stiller-directed jailbreak drama comes across as overkeen to show off its quality. Yet, as manipulative inmate Richard Matt (Benicio del Toro) plans his escape, there is plenty to admire, notably Patricia Arquette\u2019s performance as a vulnerable prison worker. Jonathan Wright Catastrophe 10pm, Channel 4 Still funny but slightly off the boil judging by this series four opener, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney\u2019s comedy is starting to cram in just a little too much catastrophe: Rob has a car crash that somehow leads to him attracting a spooky stalker (the evergreen Julie Hesmondhalgh) and Sharon gets caught shoplifting. MB Film choice Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, 5.50pm, ITV2 Chris Columbus\u2019s second entry in the Potter archive is like the first one, but darker and scarier, with Daniel Radcliffe\u2019s wizard and his pals encountering spiders (big ones), a flying Ford Anglia, Dobby the heroic house elf, and Kenneth Branagh\u2019s bumptious dark arts master Gilderoy Lockhart. Paul Howlett Today\u2019s best live sport T20 Cricket: Sydney Thunder v Brisbane Heat 8am, BT Sport 2. Action from the Big Bash League. Darts: BDO World Championships 1pm, Eurosport 1.

But he has no doubt how he would have voted had his 18th birthday been just a few weeks earlier. \u201cLeave,\u201d said the now 20-year-old, shortly after waking up from a lunchtime nap following a very early shift at Tesco. \u201cI did think I should have had a vote then, but a second referendum would be bad for democracy, especially around here. They\u2019ve already lost trust in politicians after all the chaos that happened in the 80s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere\u201d is Shirebrook, a former pit village five miles south-east of Bolsover, a market town famed for its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-41651706\">allegedly haunted castle</a> \u2013 as well as its cantankerous Beast, Dennis Skinner, MP since 1970. The main colliery, which employed more than 2,000 men in its heyday, closed in 1993. The mine shaft was filled in and Sports Direct, the bullish discount retailer, plonked its 75,000 sq metre (800,000 sq ft) headquarters on the site. Mitchell worked there when he was 16. Most young people in Shirebrook have at least had a holiday job in the gargantuan warehouse, where a Guardian investigation in 2015 revealed workers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">toiling for effectively less than the minimum wage</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"67c6b3cff7b492d1e665163a1800f19f6ffd0df8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67c6b3cff7b492d1e665163a1800f19f6ffd0df8/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Handley selling hotdogs outside Sports Direct in Shirebook.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Handley selling hotdogs outside Sports Direct in Shirebook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 13 years since Sports Direct moved in, thousands of eastern European people followed, taking up insecure agency jobs.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Mick Jackson, producer/director</strong></h2> <p>I was working in the BBC Science features department and had made a well-received documentary about nuclear war, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GJttnC8PoA\">A Guide to Armageddon</a>. I wanted to explore this area further by creating a drama about nuclear war and its aftermath. I went to Sheffield and talked to Barry Hines, a brilliant novelist and screenwriter (best known for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/02/my-favourite-film-kes\">Kes</a>) who I knew would bring a terrific worldliness, empathy and rich feeling for human nature to the project. I persuaded him to be my collaborator.</p> <p>Barry came up with the idea of the two families \u2013 one working class, the other lower-middle \u2013 and what their lives were like. Sheffield seemed a good place to set it, and Barry knew it well. It was bang in the middle of the country, and a good way from London. Strategically, it also made sense: there were industrial and military targets nearby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/20/threads-the-film-that-frightened-me-most-halloween\">Threads: the film that frightened me most</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both of us were interested in the idea that none of these characters would ever have a god\u2019s-eye-view of events, and never find out what was happening outside their immediate experience, certainly not outside Sheffield. That seemed to be the way most people would have to deal with a nuclear apocalypse, with most forms of communication vaporised.</p> <p>Threads was very graphic and the shoot asked a lot of everybody, especially the actors. Once it was over, we all ceased being members of a movie ensemble and just became anxious individuals in the 1980s. What we\u2019d depicted and its implications stayed in the minds of every actor and crew member for a long time. I\u2019m sure there were some nightmares. There are some things so far outside our experience or comprehension that they are unthinkable. Nuclear war is one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/08/threads-terrified-a-generation-now-nuclear-war-is-being-restaged-in-sheffield\">Threads terrified a generation \u2013 now nuclear war is being restaged in Sheffield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The props department had shown me various options for the handheld LCD game featured in the film. I picked the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQqP34vYqeM\">Epoch Game Box Penta</a> for Michael to be playing with in the early scenes as it seemed to show people being pursued by ghosts \u2013 a nice prefiguring of what would happen to him later. It was also poignant, in the aftermath, to see his father playing with it in an emergency feeding centre in a graveyard. It was the only thing he had salvaged that linked him to his son.</p> <p>People tell me how relevant they find the movie to what\u2019s happening now. It\u2019s comforting, at a time when so many films are being remade, to find that people still appreciate \u2013 and are scared by \u2013 the original film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6310dae7be3c04f88c34351a25bc1e57e530e65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6310dae7be3c04f88c34351a25bc1e57e530e65/0_28_2960_1776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Most world leaders at the time watched it\u2019 \u2026 Threads.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Most world leaders at the time watched it\u2019 \u2026 Threads.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Karen Meagher, actor</strong><strong>, played Ruth</strong></h2> <p>Ruth was a great part and it was a great script \u2013 I was young and up for a challenge. But the nature of the story seemed all too real and traumatic.</p> <p>It was not the most comfortable of parts, physically or emotionally. I\u2019m a vegetarian, and so the scene where we ate the sheep was pretty yuck: the raw meat became quite gelatinous in your mouth. It was absolutely real. We northerners are made of stern stuff.</p> <p>I have particularly strong memories of helping the \u201crat man\u201d round up his critters in the scene where I\u2019m forced to trade my body for food \u2013 dead rats \u2013 and another day getting to the set and finding the wardrobe department blowtorching rails of costumes. Seeing Rita May, who played Mrs Kemp, in post-bomb makeup was also pretty harrowing.</p> <p>The scene in the stable where Ruth gives birth was a particular challenge, as at that point I did not have children. Luckily, the women who worked on the crew were a great source of information. Our aim was always for the piece to have integrity. The crew and extras were definitely the heroes, and the [four] Baftas the film won was testimony to their skill and dedication. We were aware that no one person was more important than any other, or than the message.</p> <p>When Threads aired, on 23 September 1984, some branded it: \u201cThe night the country didn\u2019t sleep.\u201d It had a huge impact. I have a copy of a letter of thanks sent to Barry Hines from the then Labour leader, Neil Kinnock. I think most world leaders of the time watched Threads. The BBC was very brave to make it.</p> <p>There is an argument that without nuclear weapons, we would be less safe. And yet if we look at the world today, few places seem free from strife. The film still taps into today\u2019s anxiety that the world is heading into a catastrophe, whether it be ecological, military or economic. There was a a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNkjqBmOmeA\">live \u201credux\u201d remake filmed in June this year</a> \u2013 whatever keeps the message current!

      "bodyText": "Mick Jackson, producer/director I was working in the BBC Science features department and had made a well-received documentary about nuclear war, A Guide to Armageddon. I wanted to explore this area further by creating a drama about nuclear war and its aftermath. I went to Sheffield and talked to Barry Hines, a brilliant novelist and screenwriter (best known for Kes) who I knew would bring a terrific worldliness, empathy and rich feeling for human nature to the project. I persuaded him to be my collaborator. Barry came up with the idea of the two families \u2013 one working class, the other lower-middle \u2013 and what their lives were like. Sheffield seemed a good place to set it, and Barry knew it well. It was bang in the middle of the country, and a good way from London. Strategically, it also made sense: there were industrial and military targets nearby. Both of us were interested in the idea that none of these characters would ever have a god\u2019s-eye-view of events, and never find out what was happening outside their immediate experience, certainly not outside Sheffield. That seemed to be the way most people would have to deal with a nuclear apocalypse, with most forms of communication vaporised. Threads was very graphic and the shoot asked a lot of everybody, especially the actors. Once it was over, we all ceased being members of a movie ensemble and just became anxious individuals in the 1980s. What we\u2019d depicted and its implications stayed in the minds of every actor and crew member for a long time. I\u2019m sure there were some nightmares. There are some things so far outside our experience or comprehension that they are unthinkable. Nuclear war is one. The props department had shown me various options for the handheld LCD game featured in the film. I picked the Epoch Game Box Penta for Michael to be playing with in the early scenes as it seemed to show people being pursued by ghosts \u2013 a nice prefiguring of what would happen to him later. It was also poignant, in the aftermath, to see his father playing with it in an emergency feeding centre in a graveyard. It was the only thing he had salvaged that linked him to his son. People tell me how relevant they find the movie to what\u2019s happening now. It\u2019s comforting, at a time when so many films are being remade, to find that people still appreciate \u2013 and are scared by \u2013 the original film. Karen Meagher, actor, played Ruth Ruth was a great part and it was a great script \u2013 I was young and up for a challenge. But the nature of the story seemed all too real and traumatic. It was not the most comfortable of parts, physically or emotionally. I\u2019m a vegetarian, and so the scene where we ate the sheep was pretty yuck: the raw meat became quite gelatinous in your mouth. It was absolutely real. We northerners are made of stern stuff. I have particularly strong memories of helping the \u201crat man\u201d round up his critters in the scene where I\u2019m forced to trade my body for food \u2013 dead rats \u2013 and another day getting to the set and finding the wardrobe department blowtorching rails of costumes. Seeing Rita May, who played Mrs Kemp, in post-bomb makeup was also pretty harrowing. The scene in the stable where Ruth gives birth was a particular challenge, as at that point I did not have children. Luckily, the women who worked on the crew were a great source of information. Our aim was always for the piece to have integrity. The crew and extras were definitely the heroes, and the [four] Baftas the film won was testimony to their skill and dedication. We were aware that no one person was more important than any other, or than the message. When Threads aired, on 23 September 1984, some branded it: \u201cThe night the country didn\u2019t sleep.\u201d It had a huge impact. I have a copy of a letter of thanks sent to Barry Hines from the then Labour leader, Neil Kinnock. I think most world leaders of the time watched Threads. The BBC was very brave to make it. There is an argument that without nuclear weapons, we would be less safe. And yet if we look at the world today, few places seem free from strife. The film still taps into today\u2019s anxiety that the world is heading into a catastrophe, whether it be ecological, military or economic. There was a a live \u201credux\u201d remake filmed in June this year \u2013 whatever keeps the message current! Complacency cannot be tolerated. A remastered edition of Threads on HD Blu-ray is out now.",

      "bodyText": "Two communities in Western Australia are reeling after the suicides of two Indigenous girls who died within a day of each other. A 12-year-old Aboriginal girl took her life in the Pilbara mining town of Port Hedland on Sunday, and a 14-year-old Aboriginal girl from the remote community of Warmun in the East Kimberley took her own life on Monday. Workers from the National Indigenous Critical Response project are in contact with both families. The deaths come as the state is still waiting on the final report from a sweeping inquest into 13 suicides of Indigenous young people in the Kimberley region from 2012 to 2016, including the shocking death of a 10-year-old girl. State coroner Ros Fogliani, who began the inquest in 2017, is expected to deliver her findings early this year. National Indigenous Critical Response project coordinator Gerry Georgatos said the number of Indigenous suicides in the Kimberley had fallen from an annual high of 14 to eight in 2018, but said that the number of suicides or suicide attempts by children was on the rise. Georgatos said children made up seven of the past nine Indigenous people to take their own life in the Kimberley, and called for an urgent need to overhaul suicide prevention to look at \u201cthe full spectrum of issues that led to it\u201d, including child sexual abuse. He said the focus should be on early intervention. A Senate inquiry in December found that mental health services in rural and remote areas were lacking and often not culturally appropriate. It also found that suicides of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were often linked not to mental health but to \u201cdespair caused by the history of dispossession combined with the social and economic conditions in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples live\u201d. Indigenous children aged five to 17 die from suicide at five times the rate of non-Indigenous children, according to figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics this year. In the five years from 2013 to 2017, the Indigenous child suicide rate was 10.1 per 100,000, compared with two per 100,000 for non-Indigenous children. More than one in four people who took their own life before turning 18 were Indigenous. Rates are even higher in remote areas of Western Australian and the Northern Territory.

      "bodyText": "Heading into tonight\u2019s game, Clemson\u2019s task was colossal: overthrow the greatest college football coach and program in history. Not only did the Tigers beat the Tide, they crushed them on both sides of the ball. Trevor Lawrence threw for 347 yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions. His number one target Justyn Ross was electric, grabbing 153 yards on six receptions. On defense, the Tigers\u2019 defensive line smothered Tua Tagovailoa, both through the air and on the ground. Three crucial stops on fourth down snuffed out any momentum Nick Saban tried to build. While the majority of Clemson\u2019s D Line will inevitably declare for the NFL Draft in April, Lawrence and Ross will remain in South Carolina for at least the next two years, meaning Clemson has established itself as one of the true great, and it isn\u2019t going anywhere. That\u2019s it for tonight. Thanks for joining us. You can read a full report from tonight\u2019s game below: That\u2019s it. Clemson routs Alabama by 28 points. Bama players are stunned, were blown away by the explosive Tigers offense. Game summary coming shortly... Clemson 44-16 Alabama, 2:40 4th quarter Starters out, reserves in for the Tigers. And there could yet be more to come as Clemson has a 3rd &amp; 4 on the Alabama 11. Holy smokes. Clemson has two more years of Trevor Lawrence. Jalen Hurts takes the field for Alabama with 11 and change left, but goes three and out, and Alabama is forced to punt. Rough night for Tua. Those two interceptions, and multiple failures on fourth down will him. Untypical of Tua this season, who had the best passer rating (an often flawed metric) since 2000. Clemson 44-16 Alabama, 11:12 4th quarter Clemson goes three and out and Alabama will take over on its own 52. The Crimson Tide must score a touchdown on this next possession. Drake curse? Clemson Twitter having some fun... Clemson 44-16 Alabama, 12:17 4th quarter Unbelievable defense by the Tigers. Alabama opens up with an impressive drive all the way to the red zone. With a 1st &amp; goal, three successive runs are all stopped by Clemson, and Alabama somehow comes up empty handed. Turnover on downs. Clemson takes over at its own nine-yard line. Clemson 44-16 Alabama, end of 3rd quarter Big play to end the quarter by Jerry Jeudy with a 48-yard reception. But is it too late? One thing for sure is that Tua Tagovailoa hasn\u2019t found his rhythm all night. Heading into the game, Alabama had five receivers with at least 500 yards, giving Tua seemingly limitless options. Through three quarters, Bama has only three receivers with more than 40 yards. Is this the best quarterback performance in a national title game by a freshman? What about ever? Trevor Lawrence finds Tee Higgins for the five-yard reception! Clemson up four scores now. A reminder that Lawrence is 19 years old. Clemson 37-16 Alabama, 2:12 3rd quarter Justyn Ross makes ANOTHER insane catch at the Alabama 20. The Tide\u2019s defense is scrambling yet again, and forces Nick Saban to spend a timeout to catch up. Not want you want if you\u2019re a Bama fan. Clemson 37-16 Alabama, 2:46 3rd quarter Ross almost turns into a villain by fumbling the ball after stretching for the extra yard. BUT after review, he was ruled down. Clemson 3rd &amp; 9 at the Alabama 37. Clemson 37-16 Alabama, 3:24 3rd quarter Justyn Ross makes an amazing catch over his shoulder to give the Tigers a first down at around the Alabama 40. The freshman Justyn Ross now has 135 yards on four receptions. Clemson 37-16 Alabama, 4:01 3rd quarter Alabama has taken more than eight minutes off the game clock so far this half and has come up empty on two fourth downs. Hate to say it, but this one looks like it\u2019s headed back to the state of South Carolina. (I really hope I don\u2019t have to eat it.) Clemson 37-16 Alabama, 5:04 3rd quarter After the timeout, Tua fails to convert on the 4th &amp; 4 with his legs and falls a yard short. Clemson takes over at its own 11. Another huge play by the Tigers\u2019 D. Clemson 37-16 Alabama, 8:26 3rd quarter Couple of big throws for Tagovailoa is a great sign for Bama. 1st &amp; 10 on the Clemson 20. Part of the reason Clemson has crushed the Alabama defense is because of its incredibly balanced offense. I hope I don\u2019t eat my words, but this looks like Clemson\u2019s title. We hadn\u2019t had a touchdown through first six minutes of the second half and we were all about to switch our TVs / streams off. But the ferocious Clemson offense has other ideas. They look absolutely unstoppable! Clemson 37-16 Alabama, 8:26 3rd quarter The Alabama native Justyn Ross goes for 74 yards on the reception to break this game wide open! Clemson misses the PAT. Clemson 31-16 Alabama, 9:47 3rd quarter Review is confirmed. An immediate questionable call by Saban to fake on the field goal attempt. Clemson snuffs it out to regain the ball on its own 24. I must say, I\u2019ve watched a lot of Alabama football over the years, and haven\u2019t seen this number of questionable calls from Saban. We\u2019re in unchartered territory for sure. Clemson 31-16 Alabama, 10:08 3rd quarter Play is under review. The officials are looking at whether DeVonta Smith fumbled at the Clemson 22 before he was down after a three-yard reception. Smith recovered his own fumble, so no alarm for Bama fans. Clemson 31-16 Alabama, 12:30 3rd quarter Another gamble for Saban as Alabama convert on 4th &amp; inches and have a first down at the Clemson 38. Clemson 31-16 Alabama Second half underway. Alabama begins at its own 25-yard line. So many questions are about to be answered. Resurfacing this chart. Alabama has lost just EIGHT GAMES in the past NINE SEASONS under Saban. Dabo Swiney\u2019s Clemson hasn\u2019t read the script and has ripped Bama\u2019s defense to shreds. My former colleague at FiveThirtyEight puts some context on the hole Nick Saban currently finds himself in... Half time analysis: Clemson leads by 15 points and the difference so far has been Trevor Lawrence. After throwing for 327 yards and three touchdowns against Notre Dame in the semi-finals, the true freshman is 11-21 and has thrown for 197 yards, including a touchdown and no interceptions. A reminder that Lawrence is just 19 years old and was in high school this time last year. For Alabama, they came into the game with five receivers with at least 500 yards on the season, but Tua Tagovailoa has only managed to find three receivers so far, while being picked off twice. I expect more fireworks to come. Clemson 31-16 Alabama Nick Saban lets the clock run down and will get the ball first in the second half. This is Alabama\u2019s largest deficit all season and I think it\u2019s fair to say they\u2019ve met their match. Clemson 31-16 Alabama, 0:50, 2nd quarter 36-yard field goal to cap a 61-yard drive for the Tigers. That was an important stop for Alabama. The Tide has been run ragged through the first 30 minutes, and was key to build some momentum heading into halftime. Clemson 28-16 Alabama, 1:49, 2nd quarter Trevor Lawrence makes the completion to Justyn Ross for 12 yards to the Alabama 48 for a first down. Tack on 15 yards for the late hit out of bounds. The Bama defense looks perplexed. Clemson 28-16 Alabama, 2:10, 2nd quarter Trayvon Mullen makes the sack! Alabama is forced to punt. Clemson will get the ball back with a little more than two minutes to go in the half. Clemson\u2019s defense has been ferocious all season and leads the nation in sacks. More on Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s elite touchdown-to-interception ratio through the season. Hasn\u2019t worked out so far against the Tigers though... Clemson 28-16 Alabama, 4:38, 2nd quarter Travis Etienne barrels in for his second touchdown. The Clemson offense is on fire! I mentioned earlier that the Tigers were scoring on so few plays that Alabama still looked fresh. I take that back. The Bama D looks gassed. Half time can\u2019t come quick enough. Clemson 21-16 Alabama, 5:10, 2nd quarter Clemson is driving, has a first down at the Alabama six-yard line. That\u2019s two interceptions already for Tagovailoa, who had one of the best touchdown-to-interception ratios in the nation coming into this game. Saban has repeatedly told his sophomore quarterback that he doesn\u2019t need to win the game on his own, so perhaps this will change the offensive strategy going forward. Clemson 21-16 Alabama, 8:40, 2nd quarter Tua throws his second pick of the game as Trayvon Mullen returns for 46 yards to the Alabama 47-yard line. Clemson 21-16 Alabama, 9:25, 2nd quarter Nick Saban goes for it on 4th down and it pays off. Alabama has a first down on its own 35 yard line. Big gamble in what is a show of respect for the Clemson offense. Clemson 21-16 Alabama, 11:38, 2nd quarter One development to follow: Clemson has made just 16 plays for its two offensive TDs. That\u2019s great, and is of course the priority, but the Tigers aren\u2019t wearing down Alabama\u2019s defense. But will it matter? Clemson 21-16 Alabama, 11:38, 2nd quarter Etienne walks in for the 1-yard touchdown. Six plays and 65 yards for Clemson on that drive. Clemson 14-16 Alabama, 14:18, 2nd quarter Clemson snuffs out the run to force a field goal. The running back duo of Damien and Najee Harris has been extremely effective so far for the Tide. They have a combined 56 yards on 10 carries. Interesting that coming into the game, it was Clemson who had the more balanced offense. Clemson 14-13 Alabama, end of 1st quarter A frenetic first quarter comes to an end. Four touchdowns and 27 points. Alabama currently in the red zone with a 3rd &amp; goal at the six-yard line. We can all take a breath now. Clemson 14-13 Alabama, 5:25, 1st quarter Alabama gets the ball back down one point. A disappointing series for Lawrence and Clemson, whose sideline is animated over what they think was a pass interference. Tua has looked terrific in the red zone so far. Another look at the FOURTH touchdown in the game already... Clemson 14-13 Alabama, 6:23, 1st quarter Tua Tagovailoa throws to Hale Hentges for 1 yard, but the freshman Joseph Bulovas MISSES the extra point. Wow. How important may that prove to be? Clemson 14-7 Alabama, 6:37, 1st quarter We have a possible touchdown run, which is currently under review. Certainly looks like Najee Harris was down before breaking the end zone. Clemson 14-7 Alabama, 7:17, 1st quarter Alabama is driving... Tua has looked really comfortable since the pick and looks threatening at Clemson\u2019s 10 yard line. We knew there would be fireworks, but this pace is crazy! Here\u2019s a recap of the THREE touchdowns in the first five minutes. Clemson 14-7 Alabama, 10:35, 1st quarter Lawrence finds Tee Higgins for a huge 62-yard gain. And then Travis Etienne rushes for 17 yards into the endzone. Clemson 7-7 Alabama, 11:59, 1st quarter Lawrence makes his first completion, but it\u2019s brought back for a tripping penalty. Clemson 7-7 Alabama, 12:05, 1st quarter Tua Tagovailoa throws for 62 yards to Jerry Jeudy for the touchdown. What. A. Start. Alabama 0-7 Clemson, 13:10, 1st quarter Damien Harris runs for 10 yards to get the 1st down. Clemson 0-7 Alabama, 13:10, 1st quarter Wow, what a start. A.J. Terrell picks off Tua Tagovailoa and returns 44 yards for the touchdown. Dabo Swinney ecstatic. Tua Tagovailoa is picked off and Clemson returns to the house! Tigers up 7-0. Biiigggg punt for Clemson. Alabama fair catches on its own 20 yard line. Tua takes the field. Lawrence fails his first test. Clemson goes three and out. Fair catch to start things off. Trevor Lawrence and the Clemson offense take the field. Alabama wins the toss. Clemson will receive. Some big-time NFL names on opposite sidelines tonight. Julio Jones won a national title with the Tide in 2009. Terrell Owens played his college ball at Chattanooga, but was born 100 miles from Tuscaloosa in Alexander City. On the Clemson touchline, Tiger-royalty DeAndre Hopkins and 2016 national title winner Deshaun Watson. The legendary Lee Corso picks Clemson. Apparently he hasn\u2019t been wrong all season... FiveThirtyEight does a nice job of summarising how close Alabama vs Clemson IV could be. They have the Tide as a 51% \u201cfavourite\u201d... Ten minutes until kick off. This gave me some chills... Ticket prices for Alabama vs Clemson IV fell dramatically leading up to the game. Likely factors are the fact that Santa Clara is more than 2,000 miles from either Tuscaloosa and Clemson and, well, this is the fourth straight year we\u2019re doing this. Last time I checked on Seat Geek, cheapest ticket was $134 for nosebleeds. A measure of Alabama\u2019s greatness under Nick Saban... True freshman Trevor Lawrence has had a special season. He\u2019s one of only four freshman since 2000 to throw for at least 2900 yards, have a passer rating of at least 150 and complete 65% of his passes. The other three: Jameis Winston, Johnny Manziel and Kellen Moore. Trevor Lawrence is good. I managed to catch an Alabama game in Tuscaloosa in October. Let me just say, although they beat my beloved Missouri Tigers (M-I-Z!), Bama fans show up! Things are heating up with around 40 minutes to kick off. Here\u2019s what another national title would mean for both schools... As for Dabo Swinney \u2014 the Birmingham, Alabama-born Clemson head coach \u2014 who played three years as a wide receiver for the Crimson Tide, and was also part of their coaching staff from 1993 to 2000. What must be going through his mind right now as he aims to topple his childhood team for a second time in four years? Hello, and welcome to live coverage of the national championship game. As well as, um, the national title there\u2019s a little bit of history on the line tonight. If Alabama win a sixth title since 2009 tonight, their head coach Nick Saban will break a tie with the legendary Bear Bryant for the most in history (Saban also won a title with LSU in 2003). Not that Saban is thinking too much about history. \u201cI don\u2019t ever even think about that at all,\u201d said Saban, who is in his 12th season at Alabama. \u201cI do think a lot about trying to make and help this team to be the best possible and to put them in the best possible position to have a chance to be successful.\u201d",

It needs to provide value for money,\u201d Butler said.</p> <p>\u201cBut almost 5,000 people in the system have had seven or more job placements in the past three years. Many of those placements resulted in some form of publicly-funded outcome payment to the Jobactive provider even though the same person just keeps coming back again and again.</p> <p>\u201cThe incentives and structures for providers are all wrong under this government.</p> <p>\u201cLabour market programs should be geared to making people more work-ready, help them get the skills they need, and help them to get a secure, decent job,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Coalition has jumped on Labor\u2019s plan, saying it proves that the opposition wants to fundamentally weaken Australia\u2019s mutual obligation requirements.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re an Australian who\u2019s being supported through our social welfare system while you\u2019re looking for work it\u2019s only fair that you should comply with the mutual obligation requirements,\u201d said Paul Fletcher, the minister for social services.</p> <p>\u201cAt the next election there\u2019s going to be a very clear contrast in so many ways, Labor wants to add $200bn of new taxes but we now know that Labor also wants to fundamentally weaken mutual obligation.\u201d</p> <p>Tony Abbott also attacked Labor\u2019s plan, saying Labor was now the \u201cwelfare class party not the working class party.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TonyAbbottMHR/status/1082450811341307904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People on unemployment benefits are supposed to be looking for work.

      "bodyText": "Labor plans to dramatically overhaul the employment services system Jobactive, saying it is incentivising job providers to churn unemployed people through unsuitable jobs, and flooding businesses with disingenuous job applications. Terri Butler, the shadow spokeswoman for employment services, says labour market programs are supposed to connect unemployed Australians with decent, stable jobs, but the government\u2019s Jobactive system is not delivering value for money. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Under the current system, long-term unemployed people are referred to private and non-government providers funded by the taxpayer to help them become job-ready and look for work through training and face-to-face meetings with case managers. But the incentives in the system have had unintended consequences \u2013 including employment service providers receiving multiple payments for placing the same unemployed person in different jobs. Labor says that means thousands of jobseekers have been placed into insecure work over and over again, rather than into suitable, stable positions. Butler said the current requirement for unemployed people to submit 20 job applications a month was also problematic, because it was flooding businesses with disingenuous applications and turning job service providers into welfare compliance officers. \u201cInstead of ticking boxes, Jobactive providers should be getting to the bottom of what\u2019s stopping their unemployed clients getting work, building relationships with employers, and getting a better understanding of the local labour market,\u201d Butler said. She said employers had also lost faith in the system, because it was failing to connect them with work-ready Australians. A recent report by the Department of Jobs and Small Business, I Want to Work: Employment Services 2020, found 18% of employers used the Jobactive system in 2007 to help them find workers, but that figure had dropped to 4% by 2018. Butler said Labor wants to retain \u201cmutual obligation\u201d requirements for jobseekers, but the system must work better for unemployed people and employers. \u201cThe Jobactive system costs the Australian public more than $6bn over four years. It needs to provide value for money,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut almost 5,000 people in the system have had seven or more job placements in the past three years. Many of those placements resulted in some form of publicly-funded outcome payment to the Jobactive provider even though the same person just keeps coming back again and again. \u201cThe incentives and structures for providers are all wrong under this government. \u201cLabour market programs should be geared to making people more work-ready, help them get the skills they need, and help them to get a secure, decent job,\u201d she said. The Coalition has jumped on Labor\u2019s plan, saying it proves that the opposition wants to fundamentally weaken Australia\u2019s mutual obligation requirements. \u201cIf you\u2019re an Australian who\u2019s being supported through our social welfare system while you\u2019re looking for work it\u2019s only fair that you should comply with the mutual obligation requirements,\u201d said Paul Fletcher, the minister for social services. \u201cAt the next election there\u2019s going to be a very clear contrast in so many ways, Labor wants to add $200bn of new taxes but we now know that Labor also wants to fundamentally weaken mutual obligation.\u201d Tony Abbott also attacked Labor\u2019s plan, saying Labor was now the \u201cwelfare class party not the working class party.\u201d But Peter Strong, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business of Australia, said the $6bn spent on Jobactive service providers was not delivering. He said the requirement for unemployed jobseekers to send out 20 job applications a month was particularly hated by business, and the Jobactive program was not communicating properly with apprenticeship centres, the vocational education and training sector, or disability support services. \u201cThey\u2019re all treated like they\u2019re different parts of society,\u201d Strong told Sky News on Tuesday. \u201cThey are not talking to each other and that\u2019s what\u2019s costing us the money. If you combine them \u2026 you\u2019ll actually save money in administrative costs, and you\u2019ll have them talking to each other, so if someone has a disability and needs training and wants an apprenticeship, at the moment they have to go to three different places, it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. The Jobactive contract ends in 2020 and Labor has asked the Coalition government not to rush through any new contract before the election.",

After being blindfolded for a short stint, people feel it as a more debilitating condition than it really is; they underestimate the adaptive capability of blind people and end the experiment more likely to agree with statements such as: \u201cIf I were blind, I would do anything to get my sight back.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/07/bird-box-sandra-bullock-netflix-memes-hit\">Flying high: how Bird Box became Netflix's biggest hit to date</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is because those participants focus on the beginning stages of the disability, the shock of it, rather than the adaptation process that comes with lived experience.</p> <p>For those who take the Bird Box Challenge, it\u2019s the same story.</p> <p>As someone who grew up almost totally blind, the meme offers a strange, almost laughable version of what my life is really like. Most blind people don\u2019t make like Jake Paul and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172657/jake-paul-bird-box-challenge-youtube-blindfold-netflix\">immediately walk blindly into a busy Los Angeles street</a>; instead, we spend time acquiring skills and tools that enable us to live in a world without sight.</p> <p>Take body protection, for starters. If you can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of you, you do the next best thing: protect yourself from collision. This means shielding yourself with your arms or twisting your body away from the object you\u2019re trying not to run into.</p> <p>Every time I get into a local train, I raise my arm to a shoulder height. The reason is because I know there are poles in this area of the train. If I run into one, it hurts a lot less if I\u2019m cushioned by my arm.</p> <p>But gestures and postures won\u2019t guarantee a collision-free life. You need to use your other senses to interact with your environment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d12e4e09a77cac1f3e0415205dfbbd8ddbe12d9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d12e4e09a77cac1f3e0415205dfbbd8ddbe12d9d/0_121_4760_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Bullock in a scene from Bird Box.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Bullock in a scene from the thriller Bird Box.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Adyani/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a scene in Bird Box where two characters, Boy and Girl, are in the back garden. They\u2019re blindfolded, and their mother Malory knocks two objects together and says, \u201cListen to the clicks. Listen to the sounds, if they\u2019re softer or louder \u2026 If they\u2019re louder, you\u2019re in an open space. Do you hear that? But if they\u2019re softer, something is very close.\u201d</p> <p>This is supposed to be a lesson in echolocation: a way to make sense of the world through sounds.</p> <p>The technique was made famous by the American <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xATIyq3uZM4\">Daniel Kish</a>, for his ability to navigate by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/13/experience-blindness-echolocation-daniel-kish\">clicking with his mouth</a> and listening to the way the sound bounces off the surfaces around him. In the real world, it\u2019s not as simplistic as the film made it seem: most hard materials such as walls amplify echoes, for instance, while soft ones like a hedge absorb them. The blindfold itself can interfere, too; the type you\u2019re wearing can change the sound that gets into the ears.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/28/echolocation-could-help-blind-people-learn-to-navigate-like-bats\">Echolocation could help blind people learn to navigate like bats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kish is one of very few people who can move about without additional mobility aids \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xATIyq3uZM4\">viral videos even show him cycling on busy roads</a>. Most people who are blind or have low vision are able to use echolocation to a lesser degree, to find corners or count driveways \u2013 but they would rarely walk the streets without some kind of mobility aid. We get specialised training with an orientation and mobility instructor to get around the environment safely, either with a long cane or a dog guide.

      "bodyText": "It was a strange feeling to wake up last week to the internet awash with the #BirdBoxChallenge meme. Inspired by the new Netflix thriller, Bird Box, people film themselves completing everyday tasks blindfolded \u2013 sometimes for 24 hours \u2013 without much success. So much so that Netflix issued a warning. But there\u2019s a more serious side effect to this meme than basic injuries. Disability researcher Arielle Silverman and her colleagues have shown that conducting \u201csimulations\u201d like blindfolding among the abled can actually lead them to greater negative bias towards blindness itself. After being blindfolded for a short stint, people feel it as a more debilitating condition than it really is; they underestimate the adaptive capability of blind people and end the experiment more likely to agree with statements such as: \u201cIf I were blind, I would do anything to get my sight back.\u201d This is because those participants focus on the beginning stages of the disability, the shock of it, rather than the adaptation process that comes with lived experience. For those who take the Bird Box Challenge, it\u2019s the same story. As someone who grew up almost totally blind, the meme offers a strange, almost laughable version of what my life is really like. Most blind people don\u2019t make like Jake Paul and immediately walk blindly into a busy Los Angeles street; instead, we spend time acquiring skills and tools that enable us to live in a world without sight. Take body protection, for starters. If you can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of you, you do the next best thing: protect yourself from collision. This means shielding yourself with your arms or twisting your body away from the object you\u2019re trying not to run into. Every time I get into a local train, I raise my arm to a shoulder height. The reason is because I know there are poles in this area of the train. If I run into one, it hurts a lot less if I\u2019m cushioned by my arm. But gestures and postures won\u2019t guarantee a collision-free life. You need to use your other senses to interact with your environment. There\u2019s a scene in Bird Box where two characters, Boy and Girl, are in the back garden. They\u2019re blindfolded, and their mother Malory knocks two objects together and says, \u201cListen to the clicks. Listen to the sounds, if they\u2019re softer or louder \u2026 If they\u2019re louder, you\u2019re in an open space. Do you hear that? But if they\u2019re softer, something is very close.\u201d This is supposed to be a lesson in echolocation: a way to make sense of the world through sounds. The technique was made famous by the American Daniel Kish, for his ability to navigate by clicking with his mouth and listening to the way the sound bounces off the surfaces around him. In the real world, it\u2019s not as simplistic as the film made it seem: most hard materials such as walls amplify echoes, for instance, while soft ones like a hedge absorb them. The blindfold itself can interfere, too; the type you\u2019re wearing can change the sound that gets into the ears. Kish is one of very few people who can move about without additional mobility aids \u2013 viral videos even show him cycling on busy roads. Most people who are blind or have low vision are able to use echolocation to a lesser degree, to find corners or count driveways \u2013 but they would rarely walk the streets without some kind of mobility aid. We get specialised training with an orientation and mobility instructor to get around the environment safely, either with a long cane or a dog guide. They might help to map the safest route, point out landmarks and accompany clients to and from the destination until they gain enough confidence to do it alone. Most people don\u2019t need to break down preparing dinner into sizeable goals such as food preparation, operating the stove and checking whether the food is done. But for someone who has grown up blind \u2013 especially someone who hasn\u2019t watched their parents do it \u2013 these tasks might not come naturally. Professionals such as occupational therapists can show how to complete basic tasks like cooking, cleaning and doing the laundry, which can make a huge difference to surviving independently and safely. Living without vision is a lot more involved than it seems when you pop on a blindfold and hope for the best; it takes skills, creativity and appropriate aids and training. It\u2019s not as hazardous as the meme makes it seem \u2013 but it\u2019s not something that can be learned in 24 hours, either.",

      "bodyText": "A prison has been praised by inspectors for installing a photobooth so inmates can take pictures with family members, amid evidence that bolstering personal relationships can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Inmates at privately-run HMP Lowdham Grange in Nottinghamshire can use the facility to capture group shots with relatives during visits, which Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) described as a \u201cgood innovation\u201d. The prison\u2019s operator, Serco, said the photobooth was introduced in March last year as part of efforts to help families and children have a more positive experience of visiting their fathers. Ministers have highlighted the importance of enabling prisoners to keep up relationships with loved ones when behind bars. Last month, the government announced plans that will allow thousands more inmates in England and Wales to make phone calls from their cells. The Ministry of Justice cited research that shows those who receive family visits are 39% less likely to reoffend. The inspectorate also disclosed that Lowdham Grange had introduced a \u201cviolence hotline\u201d in an effort to improve safety. Opened in 1998, Lowdham Grange holds up to 920 adult men. The inspection, which took place in August, found the number of violent incidents was high for a category B training prison, with 64 assaults on staff and 83 on prisoners in the last six months. There had been 30 serious incidents involving weapons, some of which had resulted in puncture wounds and victims being treated in hospital. Most violence related to the trade of illicit drugs, the inspectorate said. Inmates can use the hotline service to report concerns about violent or antisocial behaviour. HMIP described the measure as an example of \u201cgood practice\u201d. It noted that the use of technology to scan mail for drugs was a \u201cvery useful\u201d initiative but said the practice of destroying all correspondence that indicated positive, including photographs and stamps, was \u201cexcessive\u201d.

Investment in social housing in England has halved in real terms since 1980 and, in the last two decades less has been spent on housing, including benefits, than on defence, public order and safety, education, health and other welfare payments. \u201cThere needs to be a profound shift to see social housing as a national asset like any other infrastructure,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. \u201cA home is the foundation of individual success in life and public housebuilding can be the foundation of national success. It is the only hope the government has of hitting its 300,000-homes-a-year target.\u201d The commission is also demanding: \u2022 a powerful new Ofsted-style regulator to inspect homes; \u2022 greater influence for tenants over what happens in their buildings; \u2022 the replacement of any sold-off social housing; \u2022 a commitment to mix social housing with private homes of indistinguishable design and without separate \u201cpoor door\u201d entrances. The government has won praise from councils for lifting restrictions on borrowing to build, but levels of council house building have remained historically low, despite recent small increases. A survey of more than 30,000 people carried out for the commission found that a large majority believed there was not enough social housing. James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, said the government had already launched a \u00a39bn affordable homes programme to deliver 250,000 homes by 2022, which includes social housing, with an additional \u00a32bn promised to 2028. \u201cProviding quality and fair social housing is a priority for this government, and our social housing green paper seeks to ensure it can both support social mobility and be a stable base that supports people when they need it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked tenants across the country for their views and the thousands of responses we\u2019ve received will help us design the future of social housing. We\u2019re also giving councils extra freedom to build the social homes their communities need and expect.\u201d The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, described the report as \u201ca wake-up call for Conservative ministers\u201d, adding: \u201cIt confirms that investment in new social homes has fallen dramatically since 2010 and that the Conservative redefinition of \u2018affordable housing\u2019 is a sham.\u201d The report states that \u201caffordable rents\u201d for typical two-bedroom properties work out at 30% more expensive than social rents and that \u201cthese rent levels are completely out of reach for most people who are eligible for social housing.\u201d Healey said the commission\u2019s target of 3.1m social homes was consistent with the scale of Labour\u2019s ambition to build a million new \u201cgenuinely low-cost homes\u201d in the first 10 years after taking power.",
