He has previously been criticised for arguing in favour of the move at a time when the UK government was facing calls to give women in Northern Ireland the right to an abortion.</p> \n  <p>He says it\u2019s a matter of public record that he voted for the time limit to be reduced from 24 weeks to 12 in 2008, but says he wouldn\u2019t \u201cseek to change the law\u201d as prime minister. He does not, however, rule out backing someone else\u2019s attempts to do so.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>How I vote in any future private member\u2019s bill would be a matter of conscience and I would have to see what that bill is before I make that decision.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d126b4c8f081e872734eb98\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T18:52:42.333Z\">7.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Kuenssberg presses Hunt on how he will pay for the significant spending promises he has made. He says he wants to \u201ccut taxes on ordinary people\u201d but still spend vast sums on various social projects.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And the only way that you can afford all of those things is to fire up the British economy. And, as someone who set up their own business, I want to help thousands more young people set up their businesses. Let me just give you this one example, Laura: We\u2019re growing at 1.5% a year at the moment. If we were growing at 3% a year, which is the American growth rate, we\u2019d have an extra \u00a320bn to spend on public services or tax cuts. All conservatives want to do both of those things and that\u2019s why my first focus is to really grow the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Kuenssberg points out that his corporation tax cut would \u201cprobably be about \u00a313bn\u201d, that he wants to spend an extra \u00a315bn on defence and more money on caring for the elderly. She asks if the no-deal Brexit he\u2019s willing to pursue would not end up costing the treasury yet more money. \u201cWhere are you going to get all that cash from? I mean would you borrow more than Philip Hammond has as Chancellor?\u201d</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, I will follow a fiscal rule that is very clear that debt will continue to fall as a proportion of GDP over the cycle and we\u2019ve costed these commitments very very carefully indeed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt adds that he wants to cut corporation tax to \u201cIrish levels\u201d, proposing a levy of 12.5%, rather than the current main rate, which is set at 19%.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When they made that move a number of years ago, their GDP per head was lower than ours. Now it\u2019s nearly 50% higher than ours. So, this is the way that we fire up the economy: we create the jobs; we get the money for our precious public services like the NHS; transform our social care system; and find tax cuts. But there is no magic about this. If you don\u2019t create the wealth you can\u2019t spend it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1269698f081e872734eb8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T18:43:13.058Z\">7.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On social care, Hunt says he wants people to begin saving for it as they currently do for their retirement.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well I negotiated a 10-year plan for the NHS and my next job if I\u2019d stayed as health secretary was to a 10-year plan for the social care system. And I do think that councils need more money because I think we want to be a country where we know that as people get older they\u2019re going to be properly looked after.</p> \n   <p>So I think there is a bit of public money. But it\u2019s also about personal responsibility. I think we should be a country where people save for their social care costs, particularly those last few months, possibly years of their life when things can be very uncomfortable, very painful. Just In the same way they save for their pension. I think it should be something that people can opt out of but it should be an automatic thing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if he would cap<strong> </strong>social care costs \u2013 an issue that caused <strong>Theresa May</strong> significant damage at the 2017 general election \u2013 he says those who had saved would have their costs capped.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019d do a deal. If you\u2019re prepared to save responsibly during your life, then we will cut those costs. Do the right thing. We need to be a country which rewards people who do the right thing and I think if we do that, if you look at where we were in the post-war period where many people didn\u2019t save for their pensions, we\u2019ve created a society where the majority of people do save for their pensions. That\u2019s the change we need for social care.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He does not elaborate on what would happen to those who had not saved, nor does he give any details about the amount that would need to be saved to benefit from the cut in costs, nor how much of a cut would be made.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d12653c8f082364d7cf12c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T18:35:06.552Z\">7.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Addressing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Hunt says that, while it\u2019s not his preferred option, he would take it if he didn\u2019t think a deal was possible by 31 October \u2013 even though he acknowledges it\u2019d destroy people\u2019s livelihoods.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\">31st of October come hell or high water</a>\u2019 is a fake deadline, because it\u2019s more likely to trip us into a general election before we\u2019ve delivered Brexit, and that would hand the keys to Jeremy Corbyn and then we\u2019d have no Brexit at all.</p> \n   <p>But, in my case, how would I approach this: I think we\u2019ll know very soon well before 31st October if there is a deal to be done along the basis I\u2019ve said. If there isn\u2019t and if no-deal is still on the table, I\u2019ve been very clear: I will leave the European Union without a deal.</p> \n   <p>But I\u2019m not going to do that if there\u2019s a prospect of a better deal and, if I did it, it would be with a heavy heart because businesses up and down the country would face a lot of destruction. I think it\u2019d be very bad for the union, with Scotland where I was at the weekend \u2026 so I would do it though. But as a last resort.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Interestingly, Hunt has given himself a significant amount of wiggle-room on the no-deal Brexit question, acknowledging that it may not be \u201con the table\u201d when the 31 October deadline comes around.</p> \n  <p>Any Tory prime minister would be vulnerable to a no-confidence vote and some of the party\u2019s own MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/next-tory-pm-will-face-serious-challenge-trying-to-secure-commons-confidence\">have already indicated</a> they would vote against it in such an instance if doing so would prevent a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T19:06:14.649Z\">at 8.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1264738f080e828514f676\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T18:16:44.847Z\">7.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Asked about how he can bring together a negotiating team that includes Tories from across the UK, as well as the DUP, who Kuenssberg points out \u201cfundamentally disagree with each other\u201d, Hunt says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, this is the big difference between the way I want to handle it and the way we handled it before because, yes, I think there is a deal that can unite all wings of the Conservative party and our friends in the DUP. But it\u2019s got to be different to Theresa May\u2019s deal. We can\u2019t put forward a deal to Brussels unless they absolutely know that it could get through the British parliament.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt is asked if his approach \u2013 like that of Johnson \u2013 is not simply \u201csomething that the European Union has said no to on multiple occasions. It\u2019s what Theresa May tried and failed to do many times\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, what Theresa May tried to do was a deal involving the backstop. I was in cabinet at the time and I supported her loyally but I never thought that was the right approach. What I\u2019m talking about is a deal that doesn\u2019t involve the backstop as it\u2019s constituted at the moment, so it would be different.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d12614e8f082364d7cf12a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T18:12:52.909Z\">7.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hunt is confronted about his claim he can renegotiate a deal the EU has repeatedly said is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/11/no-renegotiation-withdrawal-agreement-french-minister\">not open for renegotiation</a>. He insists, as he has done before, that he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/09/jeremy-hunt-claims-merkel-willing-to-renegotiate-brexit-deal\">being given a different message</a> in conversations with European leaders.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I talk to European leaders, what they say is: \u2018look, it\u2019s up to the UK to come up with a solution. But, of course, if you come up with a different solution, something that can work, when we\u2019ll look at the whole package\u2019.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt\u2019s claim is led some credence by the admission that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jun/25/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-rudd-tells-boris-johnson-optimism-not-enough-to-deliver-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d12090b8f082364d7cf0dd0#block-5d12090b8f082364d7cf0dd0\">Germany is ready to listen</a> to ideas on how to solve the backstop problem. It\u2019s perhaps worth pointing out, however, that what Germany did not say is that it\u2019s willing to back down on the overall object of the backstop: preventing a hard border.</p> \n  <p>Asked what he would change to that end, Hunt acknowledges his plan is similar to that of his opponent.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It would be changing the backstop with some guarantees that we\u2019re not going to have a hard border on the island of Ireland for completely obvious reasons. That approach is not too different to what Boris wants. I think it\u2019ll be a technology-led solution.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What, exactly, that \u201ctechnology-led solution\u201d entails remains something of a mystery, however, as Hunt is short on details in the interview on how he actually sees it working. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think everyone thinks that, within the next decade, we aren\u2019t going to have big border checks when it comes to goods because we\u2019re going to do all these things online, just like the rest of our lives is transformed. And that discussion is what do you do if there\u2019s a disagreement about what technology can do, so you need some mechanisms that resolve those disputes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>While Germany is ready to discuss options, the EU has rejected the idea that solely technological means can effectively replace border checks.</p> \n  <p>In the interview, however, Hunt says he thinks that very solution \u201cis ready\u201d to be put in place right away and that he believes the bloc has simply been unwilling thus far to discuss it because it wants to keep the UK in the customs union.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But I think they know now that won\u2019t get through Parliament. So what I\u2019m saying is let\u2019s not be negative, let\u2019s not be pessimistic. There is a way we can do this but what we have to do is send the right prime minister to Brussels to have those negotiations, have those open discussions and then I think there is a deal to be done.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T19:13:56.952Z\">at 8.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d125e2d8f081e872734eb17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T17:59:56.857Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In his interview with the BBC\u2019s political editor, <strong>Laura Kuenssberg, </strong>Hunt returns again and again to the question of character, insisting he can be trusted to negotiate a deal with the EU.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris and I want to change that deal and the judgement is: who is the person we trust as PM to go to Brussels and bring back that deal? It\u2019s about the personality of our PM. If you choose someone where there\u2019s no trust, there\u2019s going to be no negotiation, no deal. And, quite possibly, a general election, which could mean we have no Brexit either. If you choose someone that the other side will talk to who\u2019s going to be very tough, there will least be in negotiation and I believe this deal to be done.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The significance of this approach \u2013 particularly at a time when his opponent has been facing so many questions about his own temperament and attention to detail \u2013 is difficult to overstate. Hunt, however, tries to play it down. Asked if he thinks Johnson would be an untrustworthy prime minister, he says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would never make those comments about a fellow candidate. I would serve Boris Johnson to the very best of my ability and make his prime ministership a success and I hope he\u2019d do the same for me. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It\u2019s pointed out that it\u2019s somewhat implausible \u2013 in a two-horse race \u2013 to suggest he is not casting Johnson as untrustworthy. He responds:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No I\u2019m saying I am trustworthy and I do believe that I can be trusted to deliver this deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He\u2019s also asked how he can be trusted by the EU, given that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/01/jeremy-hunt-draws-eu-ire-over-soviet-prison-comparison\">caused a major row</a> when he compared the bloc to the Soviet Union last year. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am not afraid to speak uncomfortable truths to our partners in the EU. The point I made in that speech was it was totally inappropriate for an organisation that was set up to defend freedom to make it impossible for a member to leave. I will say tough things when I need to say tough things. But I\u2019ll also preserve the relationship. I think I\u2019ve also shown as foreign secretary that I can have good links with European countries. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m the right person to deliver Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d125c148f082364d7cf1265\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T17:39:21.730Z\">6.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jeremy Hunt puts personality at the heart of Downing Street debate</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In a week in which his opponent, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>, has faced serious questions about his fitness for office, <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has sought to place temperament and competence at the forefront of the debate in an interview with BBC that has just aired.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a brief summary of the lengthy exchange.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The situation is deteriorating rather than getting better.

But there have been various hints along the way that this might be a promise that he does not expect to keep.

At a meeting with business leaders, although Johnson said that he would go for a no-deal if necessary to meet the October deadline, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48680303\">some in the audience concluded he did not mean it</a>. And last week the Evening Standard, edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, said <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/evening-standard-comment-we-back-boris-as-the-pm-to-turn-britain-around-a4171816.html\">it was backing Johnson for party leader because it thought he would be more flexible on Brexit than any of the other candidates</a> and because he had not \u201cguaranteed\u201d (it judged) Brexit by 31 October.</p> \n  <p>Well, now Johnson is firmly guaranteeing Brexit by 31 October. This morning in an interview he said it was a \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment for him (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jun/25/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-rudd-tells-boris-johnson-optimism-not-enough-to-deliver-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d11e5a78f080e828514efcc#block-5d11e5a78f080e828514efcc\"> 2.11pm)</a> and he has now released an open letter to Jeremy Hunt challenging him to commit, with Johnson, to ruling out any further extension.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1143536757360738304\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If I become PM, we will leave the EU on 31st October, deal or no deal.

My colleague <strong>Ben Quinn</strong> has written it up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/gordon-brown-unity-of-uk-at-risk-from-hijacking-of-patriotism-brexit\">here</a>, but here are some lengthy extracts which deserved a wider audience. The full text does not seem to be available on the web.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brown said Boris Johnson as prime minister would exploit English nationalism to secure a Tory election victory \u2013 putting the future of the United Kingdom at risk. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Unless [Johnson] specifically rules it out, he will almost certainly \u2013 and under the influence of his election guru \u2013 play the \u2018English card\u2019, whipping up English nationalistic fervour against Scotland for English votes that put at risk the union itself.</p> \n   <p>If the precedent was set by David Cameron with his posters of the Labour leader in the pocket of the Scottish first minister, think of a similar Lynton Crosby campaign for Johnson \u2013 the claim that a Corbyn minority government, dependent on SNP votes, would grant another independence referendum to the SNP.</p> \n   <p>It is right to warn of the SNP\u2019s obsession with independence. It is right, too, for us to remind Labour that as a party of the union it can never and must never make a backdoor deal with the SNP. </p> \n   <p>But of course, that\u2019s not the point of the Crosby-Johnson exercise: their interest is not that the SNP or Labour have the best policies in the national interest: their aim is to whip up English nationalist fervour against Scotland simply to secure a Tory victory \u2013 and even at the cost of harming the union. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brown said Johnson was opposed to the principles that underpin the union. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson is not just defining his patriotism as being anti-European. </p> \n   <p>Look at what he has written on the union \u2013 not in the heat of the moment during a referendum, but continuously over 20 years. What his writing adds up to is a manifesto vehemently opposing the three constitutional pillars upon which today\u2019s union is built: Scottish representation in the UK parliament, Scottish devolution and Scottish funding.</p> \n   <p>First, representation: he believes that that the number of Scottish MPs in the UK parliament should be substantially reduced.</p> \n   <p>Unable to understand careful care has to be taken in any union \u2013 whether the USA, Germany or Australia \u2013 when considering the representation of minorities, he continues to argue that Scotland is grossly overrepresented at Westminster. </p> \n   <p>When it comes to the devolution settlement, he would curtail the Scottish parliament making their own decisions in devolved areas such as universities and social care.</p> \n   <p>And he also opposes as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cunfair to England\u201d the financial linchpin of the union \u2013 the 40-year-old UK-wide settlement, the Barnett formula \u2013 which allocates resources by taking account of differing needs and changing demography across the four nations of the UK. </p> \n   <p>And if the Scots were in dire need he would have an answer: \u201cI propose that we tell them to hop it.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The SNP think of him as their best recruiting sergeant for independence. And, not surprisingly, few Scots believe the union is safe in his hands, fearing whether through ignorance, carelessness or malice he will be prepared to play fast and loose with the union when it suits his personal electoral needs. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson, of course, would dispute this. Recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/18/tory-leadership-bbc-debate-boris-johnson-voting-results-gets-fresh-boost-as-leadsom-gives-her-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d092fc68f08374cc5790a9c#block-5d092fc68f08374cc5790a9c\">Nicola Sturgeon said he had jokingly floated the idea of offering Scotland full fiscal autonomy</a>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brown said the United Kingdom needed more than just four nationalisms to survive.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But Scottish nationalism plus English nationalism plus Welsh nationalism plus Ulster nationalism does not add up to a United Kingdom. Four nations united only by nationalism will not sustain the United Kingdom. It means a house divided that cannot stand for long.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He criticised Nigel Farage\u2019s style of nationalism.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If Britain is seen by us not just as traditionally tolerant and fair-minded but as outward looking, what do we find in the Farage brand of nationalism? A Britain that for him is glorying in isolation, viewing every institution with the word \u201cEuropean\u201d or \u201cglobal\u201d in its title as \u201cthe enemy\u201d or as hostile territory.</p> \n   <p>So where does this intolerant, divisive, inward-looking nationalism take us? It leads us exactly where divisive continental nationalisms led us in the past \u2013 to targeting and then blaming and demonising immigrants, foreigners and anyone who stands in the Farage way \u2013 and, of course, using language designed to induce uncertainty, fear and discord, rebutting any criticisms and countering any arguments with the now familiar trademark accusations of \u201cbetrayal\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Brown argued for an alternative form of patriotism.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can love your country without being made to feel you ever have to hate your neighbour.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed the SNP were now pushing for a more extreme form of independence than in 2014.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the 2014 Scottish referendum the nationalists proposed leaving the UK political union but said they wanted to keep the UK pound and to stay inside the UK custom union and the UK single market.</p> \n   <p>Now they are committed to a wholly separate Scottish pound and to abandon, in a quiet, almost furtive way the UK customs union and single market which has given us tariff-free, tension-free trade across the four nations for 300 years and prevented what now seems inevitable under independence: a hard border at Hadrian\u2019s Wall separating Scotland and England and life reduced to an unending battle between us and them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is an ingenious argument, but not a wholly fair one. In 2014 the Scottish government did not have a straightforward currency policy, because the UK parties rejected its call for a currency union, and this became a big problem for the yes campaign.

When he was asked if that meant \u201cdo or die\u201d, Johnson replied: \u201cDo or die. Come what may.\u201d He also came closer than ever before to saying he would resign if he did not deliver Brexit by the end of October. At his official campaign launch two weeks ago he notably dodged the question when asked if he would resign if the UK were still in the EU by November. But today, when asked that question, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that it follows from everything that I\u2019ve said, that I think politics is at a crossroads in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed government \u201cdefeatism\u201d under Theresa May had been partly to blame for the UK not achieving Brexit.</strong> Claiming that his own optimism about Brexit would help to secure a deal, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think a bit of positive energy would help, frankly. I\u2019ve never seen such morosity and gloom from a government. For three years we\u2019ve been sitting around wrapped in defeatism telling the British public that they can\u2019t do this or that. It is pathetic, it\u2019s absolutely pathetic. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he wanted to agree a new withdrawal agreement with the EU.</strong> He said that the current withdrawal agreement would need to go, but that he would want to keep some aspects of it. When asked if that meant he would be pushing for changes to the withdrawal agreement text, and not just changes to the political declaration (the accompanying text, covering the future relationship), Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[We need] more than a change. It\u2019s got to be, you know, we need a new withdrawal agreement. If we\u2019re going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.<strong> Donald Tusk</strong>, the president of the European council, explained its position for the umpteenth time after last week\u2019s EU summit<a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/06/21/remarks-by-president-donald-tusk-after-the-euro-summit-meeting-on-21-june-2019/\"> when he said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are open for talks when it comes to the declaration on the future UK-EU relations if the position of the United Kingdom were to evolve, but the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson admitted that the UK would not be able to use article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt) to carry on tariff-free trade with the EU unilaterally in the event of a no-deal Brexit. </strong>Some Brexiters have implied that article 24 means the UK has nothing to fear from a no-deal Brexit, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/18/tory-leadership-bbc-debate-boris-johnson-voting-results-gets-fresh-boost-as-leadsom-gives-her-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d093a088f08374cc5790b03#block-5d093a088f08374cc5790b03\">Johnson himself suggested as much in the BBC debate last week. </a>But today he was more circumspect. When asked if <strong>Mark Carney</strong>, the governor of the Bank of England, was right to say<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/brexit-mark-carney-dismisses-boris-johnson-trade-claim-on-no-deal\"> article 24 would not apply in a no-deal situation,</a> Johnson told LBC: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, he\u2019s right in the sense that Gatt article 24 paragraph males it perfectly clear that two countries that are in the process of beginning a free trade agreement may protract their existing arrangements until such time as they have completed any free trade agreement. And that\u2019s a very hopeful prospect. That is the way forward ...</p> \n   <p>Where Mark is right is saying that implies mutuality, there has to be agreement on both sides.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also admitted there had been \u201csome confusion\u201d about article 24. When it was put to him that Carney had said article 24 was not an option for the UK, he replied: \u201cHe\u2019s wrong in thinking it is not an option. It is certainly an option.\u201d But then Johnson admitted he did not know if that is what Carney had said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know whether [Carney] said it\u2019s not an option. People are wrong if they say it is not an option ...</p> \n   <p>What you can\u2019t do is unilaterally [have] a Gatt 24 solution. But what you could do is agree with our EU friends and partners to go forwards together on that basis.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Carney has not said that article 24 would not be an option in any circumstances. He has just said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/brexit-mark-carney-dismisses-boris-johnson-trade-claim-on-no-deal\">it would not be an option if the UK and the EU were resigned to no-deal.</a> <strong>Henry Newman</strong>, director of the Open Europe thinktank, says Johnson\u2019s article 24 concession is important.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HenryNewman/status/1143443080974077952\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most important aspects of Boris's interview with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bbclaurak</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickFerrariLBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NickFerrariLBC</a> is confirmation that GATT 24 cannot be used unilaterally<br><br>This is a significant shift from the position over the weekend</p>\u2014 Henry Newman (@HenryNewman) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HenryNewman/status/1143443080974077952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But in an interesting Twitter thread starting here, <strong>Ed Conway</strong>, Sky\u2019s economics editor, suggests that article 24 argument is like the \u00a3350m per week claim used during the EU referendum - a bogus assertion that receives plenty of media coverage that benefits the Brexiter cause, even while being refuted by fact-checking journalists.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1143464297428914182\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thread: When will people realise that with this GATT Article XXIV row we're simply re-running the Vote Leave playbook from the 2016 referendum?

So the challenge for us all in parliament is to get this thing done.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But in his answer Johnson is assuming Conservative and Labour MPs both see the failure to deliver Brexit as an existential threat. This ignores the fact that many Labour MPs would be delighted to see Brexit abandoned, and while most Tory MPs accept the need for Brexit to happen, there is a profound split between those who think no-deal is acceptable and those who don\u2019t. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson revived his threat to without money from the EU as a means of getting a deal - although he reframed this as \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d. </strong>Explaining what he would do, he told LBC:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Then what you\u2019ve got to do is look at the money, which is at the high end of [the EU\u2019s] expectations, \u00a339bn. And I think we need a bit of creative ambiguity about when and how much of that money is going to be paid, and what kind of deal it would be payable for. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This seems a slightly milder way of expressing<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/boris-johnson-threat-to-hold-back-eu-brexit-divorce-bill\"> a threat he first raised in a Sunday Times interview earlier this month.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He criticised Jeremy Hunt, his rival, as someone who would \u201csimply kick the can down the road\u201d on Brexit.</strong> He told LBC:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is one candidate standing in this contest who represents a fresh way of actually getting us out of the mire and who will deliver Brexit on October the 31st.

This was a promise that Johnson first unveiled in his Daily Telegraph column, which was written up by the paper as a front-page splash. Johnson has also proposed raising the threshold for paying national insurance \u2013 although, up to now, his campaign has not stressed this plan as much, and he has not said what the new threshold would be. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary who was also a leadership contender before being eliminated in the MPs\u2019 ballot, said the threshold should rise to \u00a312,500, and Johnson has not ruled this out as a target.

Those aren\u2019t the figures that I have seen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Then he went on to claim that tax cuts for the poor would take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy if he were prime minister. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will bring forward a tax proposal, a package, that actually begins by lifting thresholds for those on lowest pay.</p> \n   <p>I just remind you that when I was mayor \u2026 we massively expanded the London living wage. We put millions of pounds in the pockets of some of the poorest families in our cities, and we brought the city together. And what I want to do as prime minister, if I\u2019m lucky enough to serve, is to bring the whole of the country together.</p> \n   <p>And if you look at what happened in London over those two terms, it was the poorest families who saw the biggest increases in life expectancy and in their prosperity. And that is what we need to do.</p> \n   <p>And we can do it through roughly the same approach, which is a big, broad-minded Conservative agenda of investing in education, in infrastructure and technology to close the gaps in society.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed tax cuts for the poor would take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy if he were PM.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that London became more equal in the years he was mayor (from 2008 to 2016) because the poorest families gained most proportionally.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>I will ask Johnson\u2019s campaign what data they have to back up the claim that London became more equal during his mayoralty. The London mayor has very few powers that have a direct impact on household income, and so what happened to income inequality in the capital while he was in charge probably had very little to do with him anyway. But his mayoralty coincided with the financial crash, which saw salaries in the City shrink as bankers lost their bonuses, and sometimes their jobs, and so the figures may well show a reduction in inequality.</p> \n  <p>But Johnson is wrong to imply that lifting national insurance thresholds mainly benefits the lowest paid. It does help the lowest paid, unlike his plan to increase the higher rate tax threshold, but it helps the rich more.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. You can read my brief summary of the Jeremy Hunt interview here and the more detailed point-by-point takes in the subsequent posts. Or, if you prefer your news in the form of a single, perfectly crafted article, my colleague Jessica Elgot has produced one of those: And here\u2019s the earlier summary of the rest of the day\u2019s developments. And Hunt risks reigniting the row over his views on abortion, refusing to rule out backing moves to cut the legal time limit. He has previously been criticised for arguing in favour of the move at a time when the UK government was facing calls to give women in Northern Ireland the right to an abortion. He says it\u2019s a matter of public record that he voted for the time limit to be reduced from 24 weeks to 12 in 2008, but says he wouldn\u2019t \u201cseek to change the law\u201d as prime minister. He does not, however, rule out backing someone else\u2019s attempts to do so. How I vote in any future private member\u2019s bill would be a matter of conscience and I would have to see what that bill is before I make that decision. Kuenssberg presses Hunt on how he will pay for the significant spending promises he has made. He says he wants to \u201ccut taxes on ordinary people\u201d but still spend vast sums on various social projects. And the only way that you can afford all of those things is to fire up the British economy. And, as someone who set up their own business, I want to help thousands more young people set up their businesses. Let me just give you this one example, Laura: We\u2019re growing at 1.5% a year at the moment. If we were growing at 3% a year, which is the American growth rate, we\u2019d have an extra \u00a320bn to spend on public services or tax cuts. All conservatives want to do both of those things and that\u2019s why my first focus is to really grow the economy. Kuenssberg points out that his corporation tax cut would \u201cprobably be about \u00a313bn\u201d, that he wants to spend an extra \u00a315bn on defence and more money on caring for the elderly. She asks if the no-deal Brexit he\u2019s willing to pursue would not end up costing the treasury yet more money. \u201cWhere are you going to get all that cash from? I mean would you borrow more than Philip Hammond has as Chancellor?\u201d No, I will follow a fiscal rule that is very clear that debt will continue to fall as a proportion of GDP over the cycle and we\u2019ve costed these commitments very very carefully indeed. Hunt adds that he wants to cut corporation tax to \u201cIrish levels\u201d, proposing a levy of 12.5%, rather than the current main rate, which is set at 19%. When they made that move a number of years ago, their GDP per head was lower than ours. Now it\u2019s nearly 50% higher than ours. So, this is the way that we fire up the economy: we create the jobs; we get the money for our precious public services like the NHS; transform our social care system; and find tax cuts. But there is no magic about this. If you don\u2019t create the wealth you can\u2019t spend it. On social care, Hunt says he wants people to begin saving for it as they currently do for their retirement. Well I negotiated a 10-year plan for the NHS and my next job if I\u2019d stayed as health secretary was to a 10-year plan for the social care system. And I do think that councils need more money because I think we want to be a country where we know that as people get older they\u2019re going to be properly looked after. So I think there is a bit of public money. But it\u2019s also about personal responsibility. I think we should be a country where people save for their social care costs, particularly those last few months, possibly years of their life when things can be very uncomfortable, very painful. Just In the same way they save for their pension. I think it should be something that people can opt out of but it should be an automatic thing. Asked if he would cap social care costs \u2013 an issue that caused Theresa May significant damage at the 2017 general election \u2013 he says those who had saved would have their costs capped. I\u2019d do a deal. If you\u2019re prepared to save responsibly during your life, then we will cut those costs. Do the right thing. We need to be a country which rewards people who do the right thing and I think if we do that, if you look at where we were in the post-war period where many people didn\u2019t save for their pensions, we\u2019ve created a society where the majority of people do save for their pensions. That\u2019s the change we need for social care. He does not elaborate on what would happen to those who had not saved, nor does he give any details about the amount that would need to be saved to benefit from the cut in costs, nor how much of a cut would be made. Addressing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Hunt says that, while it\u2019s not his preferred option, he would take it if he didn\u2019t think a deal was possible by 31 October \u2013 even though he acknowledges it\u2019d destroy people\u2019s livelihoods. I think that \u201831st of October come hell or high water\u2019 is a fake deadline, because it\u2019s more likely to trip us into a general election before we\u2019ve delivered Brexit, and that would hand the keys to Jeremy Corbyn and then we\u2019d have no Brexit at all. But, in my case, how would I approach this: I think we\u2019ll know very soon well before 31st October if there is a deal to be done along the basis I\u2019ve said. If there isn\u2019t and if no-deal is still on the table, I\u2019ve been very clear: I will leave the European Union without a deal. But I\u2019m not going to do that if there\u2019s a prospect of a better deal and, if I did it, it would be with a heavy heart because businesses up and down the country would face a lot of destruction. I think it\u2019d be very bad for the union, with Scotland where I was at the weekend \u2026 so I would do it though. But as a last resort. Interestingly, Hunt has given himself a significant amount of wiggle-room on the no-deal Brexit question, acknowledging that it may not be \u201con the table\u201d when the 31 October deadline comes around. Any Tory prime minister would be vulnerable to a no-confidence vote and some of the party\u2019s own MPs have already indicated they would vote against it in such an instance if doing so would prevent a no-deal Brexit. Asked about how he can bring together a negotiating team that includes Tories from across the UK, as well as the DUP, who Kuenssberg points out \u201cfundamentally disagree with each other\u201d, Hunt says: Well, this is the big difference between the way I want to handle it and the way we handled it before because, yes, I think there is a deal that can unite all wings of the Conservative party and our friends in the DUP. But it\u2019s got to be different to Theresa May\u2019s deal. We can\u2019t put forward a deal to Brussels unless they absolutely know that it could get through the British parliament. Hunt is asked if his approach \u2013 like that of Johnson \u2013 is not simply \u201csomething that the European Union has said no to on multiple occasions. It\u2019s what Theresa May tried and failed to do many times\u201d. Well, what Theresa May tried to do was a deal involving the backstop. I was in cabinet at the time and I supported her loyally but I never thought that was the right approach. What I\u2019m talking about is a deal that doesn\u2019t involve the backstop as it\u2019s constituted at the moment, so it would be different. Hunt is confronted about his claim he can renegotiate a deal the EU has repeatedly said is not open for renegotiation. He insists, as he has done before, that he\u2019s being given a different message in conversations with European leaders. When I talk to European leaders, what they say is: \u2018look, it\u2019s up to the UK to come up with a solution. But, of course, if you come up with a different solution, something that can work, when we\u2019ll look at the whole package\u2019. Hunt\u2019s claim is led some credence by the admission that Germany is ready to listen to ideas on how to solve the backstop problem. It\u2019s perhaps worth pointing out, however, that what Germany did not say is that it\u2019s willing to back down on the overall object of the backstop: preventing a hard border. Asked what he would change to that end, Hunt acknowledges his plan is similar to that of his opponent. It would be changing the backstop with some guarantees that we\u2019re not going to have a hard border on the island of Ireland for completely obvious reasons. That approach is not too different to what Boris wants. I think it\u2019ll be a technology-led solution. What, exactly, that \u201ctechnology-led solution\u201d entails remains something of a mystery, however, as Hunt is short on details in the interview on how he actually sees it working. He says: I think everyone thinks that, within the next decade, we aren\u2019t going to have big border checks when it comes to goods because we\u2019re going to do all these things online, just like the rest of our lives is transformed. And that discussion is what do you do if there\u2019s a disagreement about what technology can do, so you need some mechanisms that resolve those disputes. While Germany is ready to discuss options, the EU has rejected the idea that solely technological means can effectively replace border checks. In the interview, however, Hunt says he thinks that very solution \u201cis ready\u201d to be put in place right away and that he believes the bloc has simply been unwilling thus far to discuss it because it wants to keep the UK in the customs union. But I think they know now that won\u2019t get through Parliament. So what I\u2019m saying is let\u2019s not be negative, let\u2019s not be pessimistic. There is a way we can do this but what we have to do is send the right prime minister to Brussels to have those negotiations, have those open discussions and then I think there is a deal to be done. In his interview with the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, Hunt returns again and again to the question of character, insisting he can be trusted to negotiate a deal with the EU. Boris and I want to change that deal and the judgement is: who is the person we trust as PM to go to Brussels and bring back that deal? It\u2019s about the personality of our PM. If you choose someone where there\u2019s no trust, there\u2019s going to be no negotiation, no deal. And, quite possibly, a general election, which could mean we have no Brexit either. If you choose someone that the other side will talk to who\u2019s going to be very tough, there will least be in negotiation and I believe this deal to be done. The significance of this approach \u2013 particularly at a time when his opponent has been facing so many questions about his own temperament and attention to detail \u2013 is difficult to overstate. Hunt, however, tries to play it down. Asked if he thinks Johnson would be an untrustworthy prime minister, he says: I would never make those comments about a fellow candidate. I would serve Boris Johnson to the very best of my ability and make his prime ministership a success and I hope he\u2019d do the same for me. It\u2019s pointed out that it\u2019s somewhat implausible \u2013 in a two-horse race \u2013 to suggest he is not casting Johnson as untrustworthy. He responds: No I\u2019m saying I am trustworthy and I do believe that I can be trusted to deliver this deal. He\u2019s also asked how he can be trusted by the EU, given that he caused a major row when he compared the bloc to the Soviet Union last year. He says: I am not afraid to speak uncomfortable truths to our partners in the EU. The point I made in that speech was it was totally inappropriate for an organisation that was set up to defend freedom to make it impossible for a member to leave. I will say tough things when I need to say tough things. But I\u2019ll also preserve the relationship. I think I\u2019ve also shown as foreign secretary that I can have good links with European countries. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m the right person to deliver Brexit. In a week in which his opponent, Boris Johnson, has faced serious questions about his fitness for office, Jeremy Hunt has sought to place temperament and competence at the forefront of the debate in an interview with BBC that has just aired. Here\u2019s a brief summary of the lengthy exchange. I\u2019ll put together more detailed posts on each soon: Hunt seeks to portray himself as the candidate who could be trusted in negotiations with the European Union. The foreign secretary insists he could renegotiate the deal \u2013 despite the EU\u2019s consistent assertions it will not be reopened \u2013 and says he would have the DUP on the negotiating team. He says the backstop would be removed because he would commit to not having a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The solution would be technology-led, he says and, crucially, he insists this is ready to be implemented \u201cnow\u201d. But he doesn\u2019t give any specifics on what the plan actually entails in practice. If he feels there\u2019s no possibility of getting a deal done as 31 October approaches, he will leave with no deal f that option is \u201cstill on the table\u201d at that point. Moving beyond Brexit, he says people should be saving throughout their lives to cover some of the costs of their social care later. And he says he would take steps to cut costs for those people \u2013 and those people only. And, potentially reigniting criticism of his views on abortion, he admitted he might support moves to cut the legal time limit but would not seek to change the law himself. Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK will leave the European Union on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d, as he promised to push for a no-deal Brexit if this was needed to meet the departure deadline. He has also challenged Jeremy Hunt, his opponent in the Tory leadership contest, to match his pledge. (See 4.42pm.) Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused to say whether his campaign team passed a photograph of him and his partner to newspapers as a PR strategy during a radio interview which saw the Tory leadership frontrunner quizzed again about his personal life. Gordon Brown has said the unity of the United Kingdom has never been at greater risk, faced by the \u201chijacking of patriotism\u201d by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage and, what the former prime minister said was a shift by the Scottish National party towards a more extreme nationalism. Germany will fight to the last hour to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal and is willing to hear any fresh ideas for the Irish border backstop, the country\u2019s ambassador to the UK has said. Boris Johnson has been filmed at a private garden party telling Conservative members that the NHS absolutely needs to be reformed, as he fired them up for a general election by asking them to be ready to \u201cwallop Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Britain\u2019s most senior police officer, Cressida Dick, has defended the neighbours of Boris Johnson\u2019s partner after they recorded the couple having a row and reported it to the police. Jeremy Hunt has been accused of trying to boost his Conservative leadership campaign by withdrawing Foreign Office (FCO) support for Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s overseas visits. MPs have condemned The Jeremy Kyle Show as a forum for tearing participants apart in a \u201cRoman Colosseum-type way\u201d, as ITV executives tried to defend the treatment of participants on hit reality shows including Love Island. The UK is suspending future sales of teargas and other crowd control equipment to Hong Kong until an independent investigation is held into allegations of police brutality during mass protests earlier this month. From the Mail\u2019s John Stevens John McDonnell has said he is \u201carguing the case\u201d for Labour to support remain if there is a second referendum on Brexit. Address the Society for Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders summit in London, the shadow chancellor said the Brexit situation was \u201ca complete mess\u201d. He said: The situation is deteriorating rather than getting better. My big concern is that in the Tory leadership election both candidates have kept no-deal on the table. No-deal, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I think it will be catastrophic. It\u2019s a bloody mess, it\u2019s a complete mess. What we are trying to do now is seeing whether or not there is a route through all of this. The discussion we are having in the Labour party now \u2026 is what would our attitude be if there is a referendum. I\u2019ve said personally, I\u2019d vote for remain, I campaigned for remain because I can\u2019t see anything better than what we have got at the moment. I can see the consequences in terms of jobs and living standards. He said Labour policy would \u201cevolve over the next week\u201d because further talks were taking place. Asked later if Jeremy Corbyn would be campaigning for remain, McDonnell replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019m arguing the case\u201d. He also said Corbyn as a leader was \u201ca consensus builder\u201d and that he would arrive at a decision after the consultation was over in the next week or so. And here is Jeremy Hunt\u2019s reply to Boris Johnson. (See 4.42pm.) Ever since he launched his campaign for the Tory leadership Boris Johnson has been saying that he is committed to taking the UK out of the EU by 31 October. But there have been various hints along the way that this might be a promise that he does not expect to keep. At his campaign launch he refused to say he would resign if the UK did not leave by his deadline. A few days later, in an interview for the World at One, he said that it would be wrong \u201cat this stage\u201d to signal a willingness to delay again. At a meeting with business leaders, although Johnson said that he would go for a no-deal if necessary to meet the October deadline, some in the audience concluded he did not mean it. And last week the Evening Standard, edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, said it was backing Johnson for party leader because it thought he would be more flexible on Brexit than any of the other candidates and because he had not \u201cguaranteed\u201d (it judged) Brexit by 31 October. Well, now Johnson is firmly guaranteeing Brexit by 31 October. This morning in an interview he said it was a \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment for him (see 2.11pm) and he has now released an open letter to Jeremy Hunt challenging him to commit, with Johnson, to ruling out any further extension. Johnson firms up his commitment to delivering Brexit by 31 October and challenges Hunt to do the same. He also challenges Hunt to join him in firmly ruling out a second referendum. He says whether or not Brexit happens by 31 October is \u201cthe central issue\u201d of the leadership campaign. Why is Johnson doing this? Conservative party members are to a large extent hardline Brexiters (some 60% of them said they were going to vote for the Brexit party in the European elections, according to one survey) and this is about the one aspect of Brexit policy where Johnson\u2019s policy is clearly different from Hunt\u2019s, because he has refused to rule out a further extension. Otherwise their Brexit plans are very similar, although Hunt claims he is better placed to deliver it because EU leaders trust him, and Johnson claims he is better placed to deliver it because he voted leave in 2016. Gordon Brown\u2019s speech this morning to the Fabian Society/Hope Not Hate is, like most Brown speeches, well worth a read. My colleague Ben Quinn has written it up here, but here are some lengthy extracts which deserved a wider audience. The full text does not seem to be available on the web. Brown said Boris Johnson as prime minister would exploit English nationalism to secure a Tory election victory \u2013 putting the future of the United Kingdom at risk. He said: Unless [Johnson] specifically rules it out, he will almost certainly \u2013 and under the influence of his election guru \u2013 play the \u2018English card\u2019, whipping up English nationalistic fervour against Scotland for English votes that put at risk the union itself. If the precedent was set by David Cameron with his posters of the Labour leader in the pocket of the Scottish first minister, think of a similar Lynton Crosby campaign for Johnson \u2013 the claim that a Corbyn minority government, dependent on SNP votes, would grant another independence referendum to the SNP. It is right to warn of the SNP\u2019s obsession with independence. It is right, too, for us to remind Labour that as a party of the union it can never and must never make a backdoor deal with the SNP. But of course, that\u2019s not the point of the Crosby-Johnson exercise: their interest is not that the SNP or Labour have the best policies in the national interest: their aim is to whip up English nationalist fervour against Scotland simply to secure a Tory victory \u2013 and even at the cost of harming the union. Brown said Johnson was opposed to the principles that underpin the union. He said: Boris Johnson is not just defining his patriotism as being anti-European. Look at what he has written on the union \u2013 not in the heat of the moment during a referendum, but continuously over 20 years. What his writing adds up to is a manifesto vehemently opposing the three constitutional pillars upon which today\u2019s union is built: Scottish representation in the UK parliament, Scottish devolution and Scottish funding. First, representation: he believes that that the number of Scottish MPs in the UK parliament should be substantially reduced. Unable to understand careful care has to be taken in any union \u2013 whether the USA, Germany or Australia \u2013 when considering the representation of minorities, he continues to argue that Scotland is grossly overrepresented at Westminster. When it comes to the devolution settlement, he would curtail the Scottish parliament making their own decisions in devolved areas such as universities and social care. And he also opposes as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cunfair to England\u201d the financial linchpin of the union \u2013 the 40-year-old UK-wide settlement, the Barnett formula \u2013 which allocates resources by taking account of differing needs and changing demography across the four nations of the UK. And if the Scots were in dire need he would have an answer: \u201cI propose that we tell them to hop it.\u201d The SNP think of him as their best recruiting sergeant for independence. And, not surprisingly, few Scots believe the union is safe in his hands, fearing whether through ignorance, carelessness or malice he will be prepared to play fast and loose with the union when it suits his personal electoral needs. Johnson, of course, would dispute this. Recently Nicola Sturgeon said he had jokingly floated the idea of offering Scotland full fiscal autonomy. Brown said the United Kingdom needed more than just four nationalisms to survive. But Scottish nationalism plus English nationalism plus Welsh nationalism plus Ulster nationalism does not add up to a United Kingdom. Four nations united only by nationalism will not sustain the United Kingdom. It means a house divided that cannot stand for long. He criticised Nigel Farage\u2019s style of nationalism. If Britain is seen by us not just as traditionally tolerant and fair-minded but as outward looking, what do we find in the Farage brand of nationalism? A Britain that for him is glorying in isolation, viewing every institution with the word \u201cEuropean\u201d or \u201cglobal\u201d in its title as \u201cthe enemy\u201d or as hostile territory. So where does this intolerant, divisive, inward-looking nationalism take us? It leads us exactly where divisive continental nationalisms led us in the past \u2013 to targeting and then blaming and demonising immigrants, foreigners and anyone who stands in the Farage way \u2013 and, of course, using language designed to induce uncertainty, fear and discord, rebutting any criticisms and countering any arguments with the now familiar trademark accusations of \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Brown argued for an alternative form of patriotism. You can love your country without being made to feel you ever have to hate your neighbour. He claimed the SNP were now pushing for a more extreme form of independence than in 2014. In the 2014 Scottish referendum the nationalists proposed leaving the UK political union but said they wanted to keep the UK pound and to stay inside the UK custom union and the UK single market. Now they are committed to a wholly separate Scottish pound and to abandon, in a quiet, almost furtive way the UK customs union and single market which has given us tariff-free, tension-free trade across the four nations for 300 years and prevented what now seems inevitable under independence: a hard border at Hadrian\u2019s Wall separating Scotland and England and life reduced to an unending battle between us and them. This is an ingenious argument, but not a wholly fair one. In 2014 the Scottish government did not have a straightforward currency policy, because the UK parties rejected its call for a currency union, and this became a big problem for the yes campaign. Now the SNP has agreed that Scotland should have its own currency as soon as possible after independence, but the notion of a \u201chard border at Hadrian\u2019s Wall\u201d is Brown spin. He said citizens\u2019 assemblies could help build a more informed democracy. Even now there may be a way to reset our relationships with the world: recognising that trust has broken down because, in our representative democracies, political parties are no longer performing their traditional role of assembling and then aggregating public opinion to build an informed consensus. And in their place, Facebook, Twitter and our social media give a spurious impression of direct democracy as if leaders and led are communicating with each other on equal terms. However, at its best the internet promotes a shouting match without an umpire and, at worst, an echo chamber isolating and reverberating the most extremist of views. So we should attempt to build a more informed democracy through region-by-region public hearings \u2013 what in Ireland were called citizens\u2019 assemblies \u2013 where we encourage an honest debate on all the specific options for our future. Here is the video of Boris Johnson talking about his secret model bus-making habit. Judging by social media, some people seem to find this account of how Johnson relaxes even less plausible than his Brexit plan \u2026 At Foreign Office questions in the Commons this morning Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, cracked a joke about Boris Johnson\u2019s late-night row with his girlfriend on Thursday last week. Addressing Jeremy Hunt, she said: It gives me an opportunity to congratulate the foreign secretary directly, not just for being in the final two, getting into the final two, but also being the only candidate who has the police outside his house for the right reasons. (Being foreign secretary is one of the few cabinet jobs that comes with 24-hour police protection.) Boris Johnson is campaigning this afternoon in Surrey, according to his team. These are from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar and PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield on today\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s two radio appearances this morning, on LBC and on TalkRadio. Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, downgraded his commitment to cutting taxes for the wealthy, saying that he would prioritise tax cuts that would help the poor. (See 11.38am.) But he did not disavow the plan to lift the rate at which people start paying the higher rate of tax to \u00a380,000, a policy that have proved hugely controversial because it would give \u00a39bn to people who are mostly in the richest 10%. He described delivering Brexit by 31 October as a \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment. He told TalkRadio the UK would leave by then under his premiership \u201ccome what may\u201d. When he was asked if that meant \u201cdo or die\u201d, Johnson replied: \u201cDo or die. Come what may.\u201d He also came closer than ever before to saying he would resign if he did not deliver Brexit by the end of October. At his official campaign launch two weeks ago he notably dodged the question when asked if he would resign if the UK were still in the EU by November. But today, when asked that question, he replied: I think that it follows from everything that I\u2019ve said, that I think politics is at a crossroads in this country. He claimed government \u201cdefeatism\u201d under Theresa May had been partly to blame for the UK not achieving Brexit. Claiming that his own optimism about Brexit would help to secure a deal, he said: I think a bit of positive energy would help, frankly. I\u2019ve never seen such morosity and gloom from a government. For three years we\u2019ve been sitting around wrapped in defeatism telling the British public that they can\u2019t do this or that. It is pathetic, it\u2019s absolutely pathetic. He said that he wanted to agree a new withdrawal agreement with the EU. He said that the current withdrawal agreement would need to go, but that he would want to keep some aspects of it. When asked if that meant he would be pushing for changes to the withdrawal agreement text, and not just changes to the political declaration (the accompanying text, covering the future relationship), Johnson said: [We need] more than a change. It\u2019s got to be, you know, we need a new withdrawal agreement. If we\u2019re going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement. The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, explained its position for the umpteenth time after last week\u2019s EU summit when he said: We are open for talks when it comes to the declaration on the future UK-EU relations if the position of the United Kingdom were to evolve, but the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. Johnson admitted that the UK would not be able to use article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt) to carry on tariff-free trade with the EU unilaterally in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Some Brexiters have implied that article 24 means the UK has nothing to fear from a no-deal Brexit, and Johnson himself suggested as much in the BBC debate last week. But today he was more circumspect. When asked if Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, was right to say article 24 would not apply in a no-deal situation, Johnson told LBC: Well, he\u2019s right in the sense that Gatt article 24 paragraph males it perfectly clear that two countries that are in the process of beginning a free trade agreement may protract their existing arrangements until such time as they have completed any free trade agreement. And that\u2019s a very hopeful prospect. That is the way forward ... Where Mark is right is saying that implies mutuality, there has to be agreement on both sides. Johnson also admitted there had been \u201csome confusion\u201d about article 24. When it was put to him that Carney had said article 24 was not an option for the UK, he replied: \u201cHe\u2019s wrong in thinking it is not an option. It is certainly an option.\u201d But then Johnson admitted he did not know if that is what Carney had said: I don\u2019t know whether [Carney] said it\u2019s not an option. People are wrong if they say it is not an option ... What you can\u2019t do is unilaterally [have] a Gatt 24 solution. But what you could do is agree with our EU friends and partners to go forwards together on that basis. Carney has not said that article 24 would not be an option in any circumstances. He has just said it would not be an option if the UK and the EU were resigned to no-deal. Henry Newman, director of the Open Europe thinktank, says Johnson\u2019s article 24 concession is important. But in an interesting Twitter thread starting here, Ed Conway, Sky\u2019s economics editor, suggests that article 24 argument is like the \u00a3350m per week claim used during the EU referendum - a bogus assertion that receives plenty of media coverage that benefits the Brexiter cause, even while being refuted by fact-checking journalists. Johnson appeared to criticise Mark Carney\u2019s understanding of the article 24 process - before admitting Carney might not have said what he implied he did. Johnson claimed that he would have a better chance of getting a Brexit deal through parliament than Theresa May because both main parties are terrified of what might happen to them if Brexit does not happen. Asked on LBC why he could succeed where May failed, he said: Politics has totally changed since March 29. We are staring down the barrel of defeat. Look at what happened in the European elections, in the council elections. My party, the Conservative party, was on 9% in the European elections. Every Tory MP understands that. And it is not as though Labour are doing that much better. They\u2019ve got the Liberal Democrats ahead of them ... So the challenge for us all in parliament is to get this thing done. But in his answer Johnson is assuming Conservative and Labour MPs both see the failure to deliver Brexit as an existential threat. This ignores the fact that many Labour MPs would be delighted to see Brexit abandoned, and while most Tory MPs accept the need for Brexit to happen, there is a profound split between those who think no-deal is acceptable and those who don\u2019t. Johnson revived his threat to without money from the EU as a means of getting a deal - although he reframed this as \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d. Explaining what he would do, he told LBC: Then what you\u2019ve got to do is look at the money, which is at the high end of [the EU\u2019s] expectations, \u00a339bn. And I think we need a bit of creative ambiguity about when and how much of that money is going to be paid, and what kind of deal it would be payable for. This seems a slightly milder way of expressing a threat he first raised in a Sunday Times interview earlier this month. He criticised Jeremy Hunt, his rival, as someone who would \u201csimply kick the can down the road\u201d on Brexit. He told LBC: There is one candidate standing in this contest who represents a fresh way of actually getting us out of the mire and who will deliver Brexit on October the 31st. I\u2019m afraid the other candidate who is standing would simply kick the can down the road. Johnson refused to say whether his campaign team passed a photograph of him and his partner to newspapers as a PR strategy during a radio interview which saw the Tory leadership frontrunner quizzed again about his personal life. He described claims that that he has been taking advice from Steve Bannon, the far-right former Trump aide, as \u201ccodswallop\u201d. Referring to an Observer story about this, Johnson said: This is the biggest load of codswallop I have ever heard. Asked if he and Bannon exchange text messages regularly, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d he went on: I have met Mr Bannon in the White House when he was chief of staff to the president as you would expect, in the course of my duties as foreign secretary ... It is perfectly true that when the president came to this country last year Steve Bannon texted me on a couple of occasions trying to fix a meeting. I texted back to say that meeting was not possible. That was the \u201csum total\u201d of their exchanges, he said. But he went on: And yet this is turned by people who wish to stop me from achieving what I want to achieve into some crazy kind of alt-right conspiracy involving me and Steve Bannon. Anybody who looks at my record knows that I\u2019m a progressive, modern Conservative. The problem with Johnson\u2019s attempt to blame the Observer is that it is Bannon himself who has been claiming that he influenced what Johnson said in the speech he gave last year after he resigned from cabinet. Johnson\u2019s answer was striking because it showed just how horrified he is by association with the extreme right - even though in his new role as a hardline Brexiter he is picking up support from Tories who were never fans of the liberal, metropolitan conservatism he used to champion earlier in his career. Johnson said he backed calls for the recruitment of an extra 20,000 police officers - although he refused to say when they would be hired if he were PM. He said two principles should apply to reform of adult social care: that no one should have to face the threat of losing their home to pay for care; and that everyone should have dignity in old age. He claimed that he relaxes by making model buses. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and arch-Brexiter, has been appointed chair of the Boris Johnson campaign, it has just announced. Germany will fight to the last hour to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal and is willing to hear any fresh ideas for the Irish border backstop, the country\u2019s ambassador to the UK has said. Speaking at the car manufacturers summit in London, Peter Wittig said Germany cherished its relationship with the UK and was ready to talk about solutions the new prime minister might have over the Irish border. My country is ready to talk, and chancellor [Angela Merkel] once said she would be willing to talk to the last hour not to have a no-deal scenario. It\u2019s a mindset. We are not giving up on achieving an orderly Brexit. Germany has been a very pragmatic voice in this whole tortuous Brexit process and we will continue to be that. Even if we have a short window while the new prime minister is in place, we will welcome any idea how to solve that famous backstop issue and we will be willing to work towards a negotiated deal which is long term the only viable and sensible option for Europe. Asked later if Germany would support another extension in the Brexit process, Wittig said: We can\u2019t be more specific. It is now the turn of the UK government to come up with the plan and talk to us [the EU]. Our mindset is to explore all pathways to come to a negotiated deal. The Conservative party has just sent out this press release saying that the winner of the leadership contest will be announced on Tuesday 23 July. It says: Following the first membership hustings in Birmingham on Saturday, there will be 15 more taking place across every region and nation of the UK over the next four weeks. In addition, a digital hustings will be held on Wednesday 26 June. This will be open to questions from the public ensuring non-members get the opportunity to put questions to the future leader of the Conservative party. The digital hustings will be hosted by freelance journalist Hannah Vaughan Jones and will be live-streamed on the Conservative party\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts. Conservative party members should receive postal ballots between 6 and 8 July. This ballot will close at 5pm on Monday 22 July. The Rt Hon Dame Cheryl Gillan DBE MP and Charles Walker OBE MP will be the returning officers for the membership vote. The announcement of the next leader of the Conservative party will be made on Tuesday 23 July. This process has been agreed with both candidates. Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson\u2019s rival in the Tory leadership contests, says he will take questions from people on Twitter this evening as a substitute for the debate that Sky News was planning to hold but which got cancelled because Johnson would not attend. The most unusual revelation from the two Boris Johnson interviews we\u2019ve had this morning came in the TalkRadio one, where Ross Kempsell asked Johnson what he did to relax. Johnson said that he painted, and that he liked making models of buses. He explained: I get old wooden crates \u2026 and I paint them and they have to contain two wine bottles. And it will have a dividing thing. And I turn it into a bus and \u2026 I paint the passengers enjoying themselves. Boris Johnson has also given an interview to TalkRadio in which he said getting Britain out of the EU by 31 October was a \u201cdo or die, come what may\u201d commitment for him. A full summary of everything in the LBC and TalkRadio interviews is coming soon. Here is Jeremy Corbyn on Boris Johnson\u2019s tax policies. Today the Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a report saying that Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to cut taxes for millions of higher earners would cost \u00a39bn and benefit the richest 10% of households in Britain most. This was a promise that Johnson first unveiled in his Daily Telegraph column, which was written up by the paper as a front-page splash. Johnson has also proposed raising the threshold for paying national insurance \u2013 although, up to now, his campaign has not stressed this plan as much, and he has not said what the new threshold would be. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary who was also a leadership contender before being eliminated in the MPs\u2019 ballot, said the threshold should rise to \u00a312,500, and Johnson has not ruled this out as a target. The IFS says this policy would cost at least \u00a311bn. The full IFS report is here (pdf), and its summary is here. When Boris Johnson was asked in his LBC interview about the IFS saying his tax plans would cost up to \u00a320bn, Johnson said he did not accept the figures. He replied: I don\u2019t recognise those figures. Those aren\u2019t the figures that I have seen. Then he went on to claim that tax cuts for the poor would take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy if he were prime minister. He said: We will bring forward a tax proposal, a package, that actually begins by lifting thresholds for those on lowest pay. I just remind you that when I was mayor \u2026 we massively expanded the London living wage. We put millions of pounds in the pockets of some of the poorest families in our cities, and we brought the city together. And what I want to do as prime minister, if I\u2019m lucky enough to serve, is to bring the whole of the country together. And if you look at what happened in London over those two terms, it was the poorest families who saw the biggest increases in life expectancy and in their prosperity. And that is what we need to do. And we can do it through roughly the same approach, which is a big, broad-minded Conservative agenda of investing in education, in infrastructure and technology to close the gaps in society. Johnson claimed tax cuts for the poor would take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy if he were PM. He claimed that London became more equal in the years he was mayor (from 2008 to 2016) because the poorest families gained most proportionally. I will ask Johnson\u2019s campaign what data they have to back up the claim that London became more equal during his mayoralty. The London mayor has very few powers that have a direct impact on household income, and so what happened to income inequality in the capital while he was in charge probably had very little to do with him anyway. But his mayoralty coincided with the financial crash, which saw salaries in the City shrink as bankers lost their bonuses, and sometimes their jobs, and so the figures may well show a reduction in inequality. But Johnson is wrong to imply that lifting national insurance thresholds mainly benefits the lowest paid. It does help the lowest paid, unlike his plan to increase the higher rate tax threshold, but it helps the rich more. As the IFS report (pdf) says, \u201cthe largest proportional gains [from this policy] go to those in the middle to upper part of the income distribution.\u201d This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the Boris Johnson LBC phone-in. From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov From LBC\u2019s Matthew Thompson From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From my colleague Peter Walker From my colleague John Crace From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From my colleague Jessica Elgot From the Economist\u2019s Anne McElvoy The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has a transcript of the extract from the phone-in where Boris Johnson was refusing to answer questions about the row with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, and the photo released to the media intended to show that they were reconciled. Britain\u2019s most senior police officer, Cressida Dick, has defended the neighbours of Boris Johnson\u2019s partner after they recorded the couple having a row and reported it to the police, my colleague Matthew Weaver reports. The phone-in over-ran by about five minutes. In the closing section, Johnson criticised Jeremy Hunt, claiming that on Brexit Hunt\u2019s policy just amounted to kicking the can down the road. He also confirmed that in the past he had tried class A drugs. And that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll post reaction and a summary shortly. Q: Is it true you have taken advice from Steve Bannon, the far-right former Trump adviser? Johnson describes this story as \u201ccodswallop\u201d. He says when Bannon came to the UK last year, he texted a couple of times to try to arrange a meeting. But Johnson did not agree to a meeting. Johnson dismisses the suggestion that Bannon was giving him advice on what to do. He says he is a \u201cprogressive, modern Conservative\u201d. Johnson dismisses reports that he has taken advice from Steve Bannon as \u201ccodswallop\u201d. Q: What do you say about the Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis of the cost of your tax plan? Johnson says he does not recognise the IFS figures. He says his priority would be lifting the national insurance threshold. This would help the lower paid, he suggests. Johnson refuses to accept the IFS critique of his tax plan. He appears to downgrade his commitment to raising the threshold for paying the higher rate of tax, saying his priority instead would be to lift the national insurance threshold. Q: Can you promise that some of the Brexit bonus money going to the NHS goes to dementia services? Johnson says \u201cof course\u201d he stands by the claim Brexit will release \u00a3350m a week for the NHS. He says he accepts that there should be more dementia funding. But there needs to be national consensus about how to do it. He says the Tory 2017 election manifesto proposal on social care was a \u201cdisaster\u201d. He said there was not time to explain it properly. He says two principles should apply. First, no one should face the threat of losing their home. Second, everyone should have dignity in old age. Q: Should LGBT education continue in schools? Johnson says people should be able to love who they want. He says he does not approve of children being taken out of school to miss these lessons. Johnson is now defending his previous record. He says the Garden Bridge idea was a good one, and could have gone ahead with private funding. And he says the Iranians are to blame for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s detention. Criticising him lets them off the hook, he suggests. Johnson is now on Brexit. He says \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d is needed over when the UK will pay the \u00a339bn to the EU. On the backstop, he says there is no need for a hard border in Ireland. He says the Alternative Arrangements Commission report out yesterday on alternatives to this was \u201cbrilliant\u201d. Q: And you think Ireland will accept this? Yes, says Johnson. Q: And how will the UK and Ireland trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Won\u2019t the GATT rules apply? Johnson says article 24 would allow both sides to continue with existing prospects. Q: Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, says that is wrong. Johnson says Carney was right to say that this would have to be mutually agreed. It is right to say that the UK cannot unilaterally go for this. But it would be an option if both sides agreed, he says. He says it would be \u201cvery bizarre\u201d if the EU decided to impose tariffs. It would be a return to the Napoleonic system. Johnson insists article 24 of GATT could be used to allow the UK and the EU to continue tariff-free trade after Brexit. He suggests Mark Carney\u2019s objections to this have been over-interpreted. Johnson said he backed Sajid Javid\u2019s plan to hire 20,000 more police officers. But he refused to set a timetable for when they might arrive. Johnson backs proposal to hire 20,000 more police officers. Nick Ferrari says Boris Johnson has been described as a coward for not doing interviews. Q: Are you a coward? Johnson says he has a maxim in life, and in politics, nicked from Ronald Reagon, never speak ill of a fellow Conservative. He will not reply to attacks like this, he says. Johnson refuses to respond to Jeremy Hunt\u2019s claim he is a coward. He says both main parties are losing votes. Unless they deliver Brexit, \u201cour generation will not be forgiven.\u201d Q: Why have you dodged tonight\u2019s debate [the planned Sky one]? Johnson says he is doing 16 hustings, and he has done some with Jeremy Hunt already. Q: You are an experienced journalist and editor. Are you saying your private life is not of interest? \u201cOf course things may be of interest,\u201d he says. He understands that. Johnson accepts his private life is of interest to the media. Q: As Guardian editor, would you have run that story. Johnson says he won\u2019t comment \u201con the integrity or discretion of the editor of the Guardian\u201d. He says, as soon as he answers questions like this, he brings his family into the limelight. He refuses to criticise the Guardian for running the story about his row with his girlfriend which was so loud it led to neighbours calling the police. Q: So why the picture today? Johnson tries to change the subject. \u201cThe longer we spend on things ...\u201d He refuses to say where the picture came from. He claims not to have seen most of today\u2019s front pages. Q: But you knew the picture was being put out there? Johnson says there are all sorts of pictures of him on the internet that pop up from time to time. Q: Did you know this picture was out there? Johnson says he knew that picture was out there. Q: So when was it taken? Johnson refuses to say. Q: It is not recent, is it? Johnson says this conversation is \u201cdescending into farce\u201d. Q: This is an old picture, isn\u2019t it? Johnson refuses to say. But he says he no longer has his hair cut by the \u201cTurkish chap\u201d. Q: So this is at least six weeks old? Johnson refuses to comment. Johnson refuses to deny that his team supplied a picture of himself and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, to the media that was intended to show they were reconciled following their row on Thursday night. The Evening Standard put the picture on its front page yesterday, saying that it was taken after the row and that it was intended to quash reports Johnson and Symonds were close to breaking up. But today Johnson refused to deny claims the photograph was several weeks old. Boris Johnson is about to start a half-hour LBC phone-in, hosted by Nick Ferrari. Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, has been giving a speech this morning saying that, if Boris Johnson were to become prime minister, the United Kingdom could break up. He has written a preview of what he will be saying in the Daily Mail, and I will cover more from the speech later. After weeks of maintaining a low profile, Boris Johnson, the clear favourite in the Tory leadership contest, is now starting to speak out a bit more and last night he gave a major interview to the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. You can read our write-up here, the BBC\u2019s write-up here, and the full transcript here. And you can watch the whole interview here. I will be writing more about it later, as well as covering what Johnson says in his LBC phone-in at 9.30am. This morning Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary and a Jeremy Hunt supporter, told the Today programme that Johnson had not done enough to persuade people he had a convincing plan to deliver Brexit. She said: This is an incredibly difficult situation and Boris needs to explain how he will deal with both sides of the Conservative party that have concerns and try and break the impasse with the European Union. Enthusiasm and optimism is not sufficient. My colleague Peter Walker has more on Rudd\u2019s interview here. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson takes part in an LBC phone-in. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 9.45am: Jeremy Corbyn chairs shadow cabinet. 10.30am: ITV and Jeremy Kyle Show executives give evidence to the Commons culture committee about reality TV. 12.50pm: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech at the Centre for Policy Studies\u2019 annual Margaret Thatcher conference. 2.30pm: Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, Stephen Hammond, a health minister, and Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, give evidnce to the Commons health committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime, and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads.

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has hardened his position on leaving the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d by the end of October, as hardline Eurosceptics extended their influence on his faltering campaign to be prime minister. The frontrunner toughened his Brexit stance as criticism continued over his refusal to answer questions about a police visit to his flat following a loud late-night altercation with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds. In a round of interviews designed to put the focus back on his EU policy and away from his personal life, Johnson appeared to signal there was an increasing prospect of a no-deal Brexit three months after he would take office. Johnson first doubled down on his commitment to leaving on 31 October in an interview with Talkradio, saying he was in no way reneging on his firm pledge. \u201cWe are getting ready to come out on 31 October. Come what may,\u201d he said. Asked to confirm this, he added: \u201cDo or die. Come what may.\u201d He then said he would scrap Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and seek a completely new deal before then, as minor changes would not satisfy him. \u201cI mean more than a change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be, we need a new withdrawal agreement \u2013 if we\u2019re going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement.\u201d Not only has the EU said it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, but the timetable would be extremely tight as parliament is in recess over the summer and then sitting for about 10 days before party conference season begins. MPs return midway through October, just a few weeks before the deadline. Johnson then emphasised his position on leaving by 31 October yet again by writing a letter to Jeremy Hunt, his Tory leadership opponent, challenging him to commit to that date \u201ccome what may\u201d. Hunt replied with a dig that Johnson could find out his policy if he turned up to a Sky News head-to-head debate on Tuesday night that Johnson has refused to attend. \u201cHi Boris, it\u2019s good to talk. But no need for snail-mail, why not turn up to Sky tonight and I\u2019ll give you full and frank answers?#BoJoNoShow,\u201d he tweeted. Hunt also tried to claim his Brexit policy was similar to Johnson\u2019s but that he would be a more trusted negotiator to deliver changes that could get through the UK parliament. \u201cWho is the person that we trust to send to Brussels on behalf of the British people and come back with a deal, and that has to be someone that they trust, that they\u2019re prepared to talk to, because in the end you don\u2019t do a deal with someone you don\u2019t trust,\u201d Hunt told the BBC in an interview. In fact, Hunt\u2019s stance is more moderate than that of his rival as he has not committed to leaving on 31 October if he needs more time to do a deal. Johnson also wants to throw out the withdrawal agreement for a new one, while Hunt would be seeking more modest tweaks. In another sign that Johnson\u2019s campaign was taking a more hardline turn, he appointed Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran Eurosceptic and former Tory leader, as his campaign chief.

      "body": "<p>Former Labour minister Angela Eagle has insisted: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to get back in the closet,\u201d as she challenged those protesting against LGBT equality teaching during a Commons debate.</p> \n<p>Eagle, who was the first openly gay female MP when she came out in 1997, said such education is not \u201cpropagandising\u201d or about \u201ctrying to turn people gay\u201d, but about respecting their rights to have an \u201cequal welcome in school\u201d and not be bullied.</p> \n<p>Her voice broke with emotion when speaking during a debate on parental involvement in teaching linked to the Equality Act 2010, called by Labour MP Roger Godsiff, whose Birmingham Hall Green constituency covers one of the schools targeted by protests against lessons on LGBT relationships.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the Commons, Eagle said: \u201cWe know that the motivations of some of those involved in this are reactionary and they are to return us to an era where LGBT people should get back in the closet and hide and be ashamed of the way they are.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to get back in the closet or hide or be ashamed of the way we are and nor are we going to allow a generation of pupils that are now in school to go through what the pupils in the 80s had to go through because this chamber let them down and nor are we going to allow this to happen in the name of religion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters have stood outside Anderton Park primary school every day for 12 weeks with microphones, chanting: \u201cLet kids be kids\u201d and \u201cOur kids, our choice\u201d. Other protesters have carried placards with the message: \u201cAdam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\u201d</p> \n<p>They have also demanded the resignation of the headteacher, Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson. The school does not teach \u201cNo Outsiders\u201d, the programme that informs children about LGBT identities, but it does share equality messages and books with pupils. This month the school and council secured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/11/birmingham-anti-lgbt-protesters-banned-school-injunction\">a new injunction banning protesters</a> from standing at the gates.</p> \n<p>During the debate Godsiff, the local MP, raised concerns about the level of consultation with parents and said those who protested \u201chad some valid reasons for doing so\u201d, challenging allegations of \u201chomophobic hatred\u201d against the campaigners.</p> \n<p>Referring to Anderton Park and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/04/birmingham-school-stops-lgbt-lessons-after-parent-protests\">Parkfield Community school</a> Godsiff said that protests had taken place because parents had not been consulted properly by teachers about equality teachings.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI regret the controversies which have arisen around the two schools in Birmingham. I believe they could have been avoided if the schools had taught the provisions of the Equality Act in different ways and taken the parents\u2019 concerns into account.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAt two schools in Birmingham there has been a major reaction among parents which has become increasingly bitter and polarised. Parents felt the school had no regard for their concerns. At two schools they have got it very wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>He described the protesters as \u201cmostly young mothers\u201d, adding they have \u201cdone nothing wrong, other than be good mothers who want to express concerns about what their children are telling them\u201d.</p> \n<p>Godsiff, who was previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/09/labour-mp-criticised-for-siding-with-birmingham-school-protesters\">reprimanded by Labour\u2019s chief whip</a> after backing the campaigners, concluded his speech with an apology for \u201cany offence caused\u201d by what he has said or written, including to members of the LGBT community in Birmingham and across the country.</p> \n<p>He was heckled throughout his speech by Labour colleagues and others who disputed his claims that the protesters were mainly women and mothers of children.</p> \n<p>Labour MP Stephen Doughty (Cardiff South and Penarth) suggested the protests at the school were due to a small number of individuals \u201cwhipping this up, creating a myth and creating fear\u201d.</p> \n<p>Doughty, who described himself as openly gay, said he had watched scenes in Birmingham with horror. He also revealed that two of the lead protesters from Birmingham had come to his constituency handing out leaflets and trying to give a talk which was subsequently cancelled.</p> \n<p>However, Godsiff maintained that some of those those who protested \u201chad some valid reasons for doing so\u201d, claiming the headteacher seemed \u201ctotally unwilling to have meetings with the parents to address their concerns and to seek a compromise way of resolving the conflict\u201d.</p> \n<p>Education minister Nick Gibb said the government had introduced the regulations for making relationships and sex education (RSE) compulsory in schools and was determined to press ahead with the policy.</p> \n<p>The guidance he added had been \u201cvery carefully crafted and written in order to build the widest possible consensus for this policy\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cAnd I would say that those people who are opposed to it are at the other end of that consensus and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s unlikely that we will bring those extreme ends of the debate into that consensus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Referring to the situation in Birmingham he said: \u201cSo we are working very hard to try to assuage concerns if you like, but ultimately we will be on the side of the headteacher in making these decisions because we do believe that ultimately the content of the curriculum is a matter for schools.\u201d</p> \n<p>The protesters are crowdfunding to contest the injunction, raising more than \u00a38,000 of their \u00a330,000 goal to date. A full hearing to consider the injunction is to take place between 22 and 31 July.</p> \n<p>Godsiff\u2019s move came as the Department for Education (DfE) <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education\">published its updated statutory guidance</a> on relationships, sex and health education, which will involve all primary and secondary school pupils in England receiving lessons on relationships, including LGBT, from September 2020.</p> \n<p>The guidance gives discretion to primary school heads over whether teaching pupils about LGBT relationships is age-appropriate, despite fears from the National Association of Head Teachers that the DfE\u2019s policy leaves schools vulnerable to protests such as those in Birmingham and Manchester.</p> \n<p>Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said the new guidance \u201cis clear that children should leave school having learned about LGBT relationships\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would strongly encourage schools to discuss with children in class that there are all sorts of different, strong and loving families, including families with same-sex parents, while they are at primary school,\u201d Hinds said.</p> \n<p>Ruth Hunt, the chief executive of Stonewall, supported the new policy, saying: \u201cThis guidance is a historic achievement that will change the way LGBT families, people and relationships are taught.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Former Labour minister Angela Eagle has insisted: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to get back in the closet,\u201d as she challenged those protesting against LGBT equality teaching during a Commons debate. Eagle, who was the first openly gay female MP when she came out in 1997, said such education is not \u201cpropagandising\u201d or about \u201ctrying to turn people gay\u201d, but about respecting their rights to have an \u201cequal welcome in school\u201d and not be bullied. Her voice broke with emotion when speaking during a debate on parental involvement in teaching linked to the Equality Act 2010, called by Labour MP Roger Godsiff, whose Birmingham Hall Green constituency covers one of the schools targeted by protests against lessons on LGBT relationships. Speaking in the Commons, Eagle said: \u201cWe know that the motivations of some of those involved in this are reactionary and they are to return us to an era where LGBT people should get back in the closet and hide and be ashamed of the way they are. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to get back in the closet or hide or be ashamed of the way we are and nor are we going to allow a generation of pupils that are now in school to go through what the pupils in the 80s had to go through because this chamber let them down and nor are we going to allow this to happen in the name of religion.\u201d Protesters have stood outside Anderton Park primary school every day for 12 weeks with microphones, chanting: \u201cLet kids be kids\u201d and \u201cOur kids, our choice\u201d. Other protesters have carried placards with the message: \u201cAdam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\u201d They have also demanded the resignation of the headteacher, Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson. The school does not teach \u201cNo Outsiders\u201d, the programme that informs children about LGBT identities, but it does share equality messages and books with pupils. This month the school and council secured a new injunction banning protesters from standing at the gates. During the debate Godsiff, the local MP, raised concerns about the level of consultation with parents and said those who protested \u201chad some valid reasons for doing so\u201d, challenging allegations of \u201chomophobic hatred\u201d against the campaigners. Referring to Anderton Park and Parkfield Community school Godsiff said that protests had taken place because parents had not been consulted properly by teachers about equality teachings. He added: \u201cI regret the controversies which have arisen around the two schools in Birmingham. I believe they could have been avoided if the schools had taught the provisions of the Equality Act in different ways and taken the parents\u2019 concerns into account.\u201d \u201cAt two schools in Birmingham there has been a major reaction among parents which has become increasingly bitter and polarised. Parents felt the school had no regard for their concerns. At two schools they have got it very wrong.\u201d He described the protesters as \u201cmostly young mothers\u201d, adding they have \u201cdone nothing wrong, other than be good mothers who want to express concerns about what their children are telling them\u201d. Godsiff, who was previously reprimanded by Labour\u2019s chief whip after backing the campaigners, concluded his speech with an apology for \u201cany offence caused\u201d by what he has said or written, including to members of the LGBT community in Birmingham and across the country. He was heckled throughout his speech by Labour colleagues and others who disputed his claims that the protesters were mainly women and mothers of children. Labour MP Stephen Doughty (Cardiff South and Penarth) suggested the protests at the school were due to a small number of individuals \u201cwhipping this up, creating a myth and creating fear\u201d. Doughty, who described himself as openly gay, said he had watched scenes in Birmingham with horror. He also revealed that two of the lead protesters from Birmingham had come to his constituency handing out leaflets and trying to give a talk which was subsequently cancelled. However, Godsiff maintained that some of those those who protested \u201chad some valid reasons for doing so\u201d, claiming the headteacher seemed \u201ctotally unwilling to have meetings with the parents to address their concerns and to seek a compromise way of resolving the conflict\u201d. Education minister Nick Gibb said the government had introduced the regulations for making relationships and sex education (RSE) compulsory in schools and was determined to press ahead with the policy. The guidance he added had been \u201cvery carefully crafted and written in order to build the widest possible consensus for this policy\u201d. He said: \u201cAnd I would say that those people who are opposed to it are at the other end of that consensus and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s unlikely that we will bring those extreme ends of the debate into that consensus.\u201d Referring to the situation in Birmingham he said: \u201cSo we are working very hard to try to assuage concerns if you like, but ultimately we will be on the side of the headteacher in making these decisions because we do believe that ultimately the content of the curriculum is a matter for schools.\u201d The protesters are crowdfunding to contest the injunction, raising more than \u00a38,000 of their \u00a330,000 goal to date. A full hearing to consider the injunction is to take place between 22 and 31 July. Godsiff\u2019s move came as the Department for Education (DfE) published its updated statutory guidance on relationships, sex and health education, which will involve all primary and secondary school pupils in England receiving lessons on relationships, including LGBT, from September 2020. The guidance gives discretion to primary school heads over whether teaching pupils about LGBT relationships is age-appropriate, despite fears from the National Association of Head Teachers that the DfE\u2019s policy leaves schools vulnerable to protests such as those in Birmingham and Manchester. Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said the new guidance \u201cis clear that children should leave school having learned about LGBT relationships\u201d. \u201cI would strongly encourage schools to discuss with children in class that there are all sorts of different, strong and loving families, including families with same-sex parents, while they are at primary school,\u201d Hinds said. Ruth Hunt, the chief executive of Stonewall, supported the new policy, saying: \u201cThis guidance is a historic achievement that will change the way LGBT families, people and relationships are taught.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Fighting accusations that he was hiding from scrutiny, Boris Johnson made a largely unannounced visit to a garden in Surrey on Tuesday, questioning schoolchildren about their political allegiances and taking a walk around a lake.</p> <p>\u201cOh God, he shook my hand,\u201d said one Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) employee in Wisley, with apparent disdain. \u201cIs he gone?\u201d</p> <p>The visit, part of Johnson\u2019s secretive whistlestop tour of Tory heartlands, came after he was questioned by Nick Ferrari on LBC about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-team-photo-partner-carrie-symonds\">photo of him</a> and his partner, Carrie Symonds, following which he made a visit to leafy Sheen, west London, for a walkabout, where not even the local Conservative Association had been made aware of the visit.</p> <p>In telephone calls and texts, Johnson\u2019s campaign team gave the Guardian the runaround over his exact location, leading the Guardian on a wild goose chase via Woking and the RHS headquarters in central London, before his team eventually insisted there would be no media access.</p> <p>A taxi driver in Westminster, one of the places the Guardian mistakenly went, said: \u201cI think he\u2019s nothing but a distraction from the reality that Britain is currently facing. He is clearly trying to avoid the public, he doesn\u2019t answer questions at all.\u201d </p> <p>Johnson\u2019s team finally directed the Guardian to Richmond but declined to give specifics. Near the Tory party association headquarters on Upper Richmond Road, on the heels of Johnson\u2019s cadre who had already departed, a painter and decorator who, like all other interviewees, did not want to be named, said: \u201cHe just said hello to us and waved back for about 15 minutes \u2026 I think he\u2019s a good chap, he\u2019s what the world needs, really.\u201d</p> <p>Another bystander, a thirtysomething Tory voter pushing a pram, was less impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has been particularly truthful about his current romantic situation, and if someone does not tell the truth about their personal life then how can they be trusted in office?\u201d</p> <p>Johnson has been increasingly associated with gardens, from the scene of his now infamous photo with Symonds to his doomed Garden Bridge project, so the RHS garden in Surrey was an apt location for the next pitstop.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe he was wasting his time round here,\u201d said a woman who had been having lunch. \u201cHe wanders in with an entourage, security, cars and cameras, instead of being where he should be \u2026 at the debate [against Jeremy Hunt] on Sky which he\u2019s cancelled to come to Wisley.\u201d</p> <p>Her friend, a Tory member who said she would be voting for Johnson, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the man he used to be. He\u2019s not conducting himself in the right way if he really wants to be PM, which is a shame because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone else.\u201d Stopping to collect her thoughts, she added: \u201cHe has changed, I do wonder if he\u2019s going off the idea a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Despite it being in a constituency with a Tory majority of 17,000, most people to whom the Guardian spoke at Wisley were unaware that Johnson had come and gone. \u201cI\u2019m not a Boris fan but it\u2019s an easy audience here, he\u2019s a clever man \u2013 despite acting like he isn\u2019t, quite often,\u201d a woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s all manufactured.\u201d</p> <p>Waiting to be told the location of the next stop, the trusted photographers following Johnson\u2019s entourage admitted they found the tour sycophantic. \u201cHis first question and only question was: \u2018Are you Tory members?\u2019\u201d one said, describing the team around Boris as \u201cfurtive\u201d.</p> <p>After receiving a tip about the next location, they left and apologised for not being able to take anyone with them. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s all about trust.\u201d</p> <p>That location transpired to be Oxshott, an affluent village five miles away. Johnson bought \u00a34.50 worth of fennel and tarragon sausages from the butchers, had a sip of tea in a cafe and drank a glass of water in a pub.</p> <p>Those present said he refused to discuss the provenance of the Symonds photo and rejected suggestions he had avoided scrutiny. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear about it,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond satire.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fighting accusations that he was hiding from scrutiny, Boris Johnson made a largely unannounced visit to a garden in Surrey on Tuesday, questioning schoolchildren about their political allegiances and taking a walk around a lake. \u201cOh God, he shook my hand,\u201d said one Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) employee in Wisley, with apparent disdain. \u201cIs he gone?\u201d The visit, part of Johnson\u2019s secretive whistlestop tour of Tory heartlands, came after he was questioned by Nick Ferrari on LBC about a photo of him and his partner, Carrie Symonds, following which he made a visit to leafy Sheen, west London, for a walkabout, where not even the local Conservative Association had been made aware of the visit. In telephone calls and texts, Johnson\u2019s campaign team gave the Guardian the runaround over his exact location, leading the Guardian on a wild goose chase via Woking and the RHS headquarters in central London, before his team eventually insisted there would be no media access. A taxi driver in Westminster, one of the places the Guardian mistakenly went, said: \u201cI think he\u2019s nothing but a distraction from the reality that Britain is currently facing. He is clearly trying to avoid the public, he doesn\u2019t answer questions at all.\u201d Johnson\u2019s team finally directed the Guardian to Richmond but declined to give specifics. Near the Tory party association headquarters on Upper Richmond Road, on the heels of Johnson\u2019s cadre who had already departed, a painter and decorator who, like all other interviewees, did not want to be named, said: \u201cHe just said hello to us and waved back for about 15 minutes \u2026 I think he\u2019s a good chap, he\u2019s what the world needs, really.\u201d Another bystander, a thirtysomething Tory voter pushing a pram, was less impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has been particularly truthful about his current romantic situation, and if someone does not tell the truth about their personal life then how can they be trusted in office?\u201d Johnson has been increasingly associated with gardens, from the scene of his now infamous photo with Symonds to his doomed Garden Bridge project, so the RHS garden in Surrey was an apt location for the next pitstop. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe he was wasting his time round here,\u201d said a woman who had been having lunch. \u201cHe wanders in with an entourage, security, cars and cameras, instead of being where he should be \u2026 at the debate [against Jeremy Hunt] on Sky which he\u2019s cancelled to come to Wisley.\u201d Her friend, a Tory member who said she would be voting for Johnson, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the man he used to be. He\u2019s not conducting himself in the right way if he really wants to be PM, which is a shame because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone else.\u201d Stopping to collect her thoughts, she added: \u201cHe has changed, I do wonder if he\u2019s going off the idea a bit.\u201d Despite it being in a constituency with a Tory majority of 17,000, most people to whom the Guardian spoke at Wisley were unaware that Johnson had come and gone. \u201cI\u2019m not a Boris fan but it\u2019s an easy audience here, he\u2019s a clever man \u2013 despite acting like he isn\u2019t, quite often,\u201d a woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s all manufactured.\u201d Waiting to be told the location of the next stop, the trusted photographers following Johnson\u2019s entourage admitted they found the tour sycophantic. \u201cHis first question and only question was: \u2018Are you Tory members?\u2019\u201d one said, describing the team around Boris as \u201cfurtive\u201d. After receiving a tip about the next location, they left and apologised for not being able to take anyone with them. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s all about trust.\u201d That location transpired to be Oxshott, an affluent village five miles away. Johnson bought \u00a34.50 worth of fennel and tarragon sausages from the butchers, had a sip of tea in a cafe and drank a glass of water in a pub. Those present said he refused to discuss the provenance of the Symonds photo and rejected suggestions he had avoided scrutiny. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear about it,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond satire.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrat leadership hopeful Ed Davey has been forced to apologise after saying his electoral strategy could \u201cdecapitate that blond head\u201d of Boris Johnson. Davey was criticised by his leadership rival Jo Swinson, as well as several Conservative MPs, for the choice of language in his article for the Times. He had proposed an electoral pact to rob Johnson of his majority, as well as for the next election. \u201cI hereby float the idea of a remain alliance to decapitate that blond head in Uxbridge and South Ruislip if Johnson calls a snap election to deliver Brexit,\u201d he wrote. After the criticism, Davey tweeted he regretted the use of violent language. \u201cI recognise this wasn\u2019t an acceptable choice of phrase and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was careless use of language, meant in electoral sense and in no way literally. While we should be robust in our opposition, we do have to carefully consider impact of our words and I failed to do that.\u201d Swinson said it was important that language was carefully considered. \u201cWe have to be able to have robust debate in our politics without resorting to graphic, violent imagery,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to rediscover the ability to disagree well with each other. \u201cThis is not language I would use, and in the current climate I don\u2019t think we should speak in those terms. Boris will be a disaster for this country, but we can make that case without resorting to violent language.\u201d Tracey Crouch, the Conservative former sports minister, said it was not appropriate after the murder of Jo Cox and other MPs had faced serious death threats. \u201cI have to say after what happened to Jo and subsequent threats to the lives of Rosie Cooper and Anna Soubry, Ed Davey should be pretty ashamed of himself for using phrase \u2018decapitate\u2019 about a colleague,\u201d Crouch tweeted. Conservative MP Nigel Evans, a supporter of Johnson, was among those who criticised the phrasing. \u201cShocking use of language \u2013 decapitate word totally inappropriate,\u201d he tweeted. The new Lib Dem leader will be announced in the same week as the Conservative party elect the new prime minister. The party currently has high hopes of winning an extra seat in parliament after a byelection was announced in Brecon and Radnorshire, where the incumbent MP, Chris Davies, was removed from office by a recall petition after being found guilty of expenses fraud. The Conservatives have said Davies will stand again in the by-election, expected to be held the week after both the new Lib Dem and Conservative leaders are installed.",

Warning against a no-deal Brexit, the former Labour prime minister said the Conservative party had turned what would be an act of economic self-harm into a test of patriotism. He also became the latest high-profile political figure to advocate the use of citizens\u2019 assemblies to overcome the deadlock and confusion around Brexit, calling for the labour movement to take a lead on this if government and other parties failed to do so. Speaking at an event organised by the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate and the Fabian Society, Brown said: \u201cThe country is about to choose the next prime minister but missing so far from the Conservative leadership contest is a serious debate on the biggest existential question of all \u2013 the unity of the United Kingdom and the future of the union \u2013 and how to prevent an even more damaging descent into divisive nationalisms.\u201d In remarks trailed ahead of the speech at Westminster Cathedral Hall, Brown warned: \u201cI believe the union is today more at risk than at any time in 300 years \u2013 and more in danger than when we had to fight for it in 2014 during a bitter Scottish referendum.\u201d \u201cIn jeopardy are both the unity and integrity of the United Kingdom and the shared values \u2013 tolerance, respect for diversity, being outward looking \u2013 that underpin what, for all its ups and downs, has been the most successful example of multinational co-operation anywhere in the world.\u201d Brown, who was a key figure in the campaign for a no vote during the Scottish independence referendum, also said the UK was under threat from what he said was a \u201crecent but little-publicised shift\u201d by the SNP from a soft to hard version of independence.

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. Top stories In case you\u2019ve been residing temporarily on another planet, the former and current foreign secretaries, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, made it through to the final runoff round of the Conservative leadership contest. Almost instantly, Johnson became embroiled in a row over a late-night altercation with his girlfriend that was loud and worrying enough for a neighbour to call the police \u2013 but not for the the potential future PM to answer any questions about. Johnson came under increasing pressure to explain the row not just from Hunt, who accused the former London mayor of trying to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning, but other ministers and a major Tory donor. Hunt later upped the ante as Johnson refused to appear on a Sky debate. Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans \u2013 including a no-deal exit \u201cif necessary\u201d on 31 October, with article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ensuring there would be no tariffs on UK exports to the EU \u2013 were also criticised as pie in the sky by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox. Despite all the above, however, polls found that the former London mayor \u2013 although his popularity took a substantial hit \u2013 was still seen by Conservative members (his immediate electorate) as more trusted to make big decisions and negotiate with the EU, and more competent, than his rival. At an EU summit in Brussels, meanwhile, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, said Johnson might make the Brexit process \u201ceven more exciting\u201d, but the withdrawal agreement had been sealed and would not change. EU leaders now think Britain will crash out of the EU on 31 October unless the deal is ratified or the new PM calls a second referendum or election this summer. Britain\u2019s former envoy to the EU, Ivan Rogers, said the country was being led to no deal by a political elite who had \u201cgreat difficulties discerning and telling the truth\u201d. Should an early election (see below) end up being called, the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, went on the record as saying he would be interested in local coalition pacts with the Conservatives to help ensure the UK left the EU without a deal. At the other end of the political spectrum, Hilary Benn called Brexit a \u201ccomplete and utter mess\u201d and demanded that Labour unambiguously back a second referendum, while Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the party would have to back remain to survive. What next More and more people think early elections are likely after the new prime minister engages unsuccessfully with EU capitals and Michel Barnier\u2019s team to obtain the changes to the Irish backstop he thinks might get the deal through parliament (none exist, as this piece makes clear). Several MPs have \u201chuge concerns\u201d about whether Johnson or Hunt could command the confidence of the Commons and avoid an autumn election, and the junior defence minister Tobias Ellwood said up to a dozen Conservative MPs could support a no-confidence motion against the new government. Johnson could also decide to trigger an election himself with the backing of two-thirds of MPs, but would be unlikely to be able to organise it before the 31 October Brexit deadline without an extension, which he will not want to ask for.

But so too, if there is an election, could be a new Tory government backed by the Brexit party \u2013 or a pro-remain Labour government backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. Best of the rest UK finances forecast to suffer under most forms of Brexit. Brexit: alternative to Irish backstop \u201cfeasible in three years\u201d. Brexit viewed with incredulity overseas, says ambassador. Ease migration rules for Indians to win post-Brexit deals, say MPs. Vital medicine supplies at risk if UK crashes out of EU, MPs warned. Barclay and Barnier clash on citizens\u2019 rights under no-deal Brexit.

How much of that can we reasonably expect to be devoted to the climate crisis?</p> <p>If past debates are any indication, not much. There were no direct questions about climate change posed in either the 2012 or 2016 debates. In refusing grassroots calls for a debate focused on climate change, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez has promised this time would be different. In a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@TomPerezforDNC/on-debates-3f6956696e7e\">Medium post</a> composed after backlash to his decision, Perez wrote that he considers climate a top issue, and \u201cmade clear to our media partners that the issue of climate change must be featured prominently in our debates\u201d. Given that network news spent <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2019/05/21/ABC-News-spent-more-time-on-royal-baby-in-one-week-than-on-climate-crisis-in-one-year/223759\">more time</a> covering the Royal Baby in one week than they\u2019d spent in a year on climate change, that\u2019s not exactly a convincing sell.

As the Trump administration continues to deny the basic reality of climate change \u2013 with some even <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/pompeo-sea-ice-arctic-council/index.html\">cheering it on</a> \u2013 fully owning the climate challenge as their own could be a boon for Democrats. Recent European parliament elections saw a flood of voters to the European Greens, as the climate crisis emerged as a top concern for many on the heels of massive Fridays for Future demonstrations and Extinction Rebellion in the UK. Climate fears are beginning to take hold of voters in the United States as well, and the DNC would be stupid to not capitalize on the fact that their party is the only one with any nominal claim to be taking the potential end of the world seriously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The climate crisis isn\u2019t an \u201cissue\u201d so much as the foundations on which all politics is going to play out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If the DNC isn\u2019t going to take advantage of that fact, then Democratic presidential hopefuls should. When candidate Jay Inslee inquired about doing a special climate-themed debate, the DNC threatened to bar him and any other candidate who participated from the official primary debates. Why not dare them to try?</p> <p>Given the anti-establishment mood of many voters, it could play well for independents to stick it to the stingy party apparatus. Virtually every front-runner except for Joe Biden has backed the idea of a Green New Deal, and even he has called it a \u201ccrucial framework\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/case-primary-debate-about-climate-change/591658/\">Fifteen</a> have also supported the idea of a climate debate. If climate change really does matter to them, then the coherent move would be to rebel against the DNC and give voters a chance to hear their thoughts on the greatest existential threat facing humanity. With Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Matt Gaetz already starting to come around on climate, Democrats\u2019 homefield advantage on the issue may not last long.</p> <p>A climate debate shouldn\u2019t be about haggling over targets and degrees and parts per million, but about the full scope of what the challenge actually entails. From housing to immigration to healthcare, there\u2019s no policy field which won\u2019t be touched by rising temperatures in the coming decades. Contra Perez, the climate crisis isn\u2019t an \u201cissue\u201d so much as the foundations on which <em>all </em>politics is going to play out.</p> <p>Making that a core concern for the party is an opportunity for Democrats to do something they haven\u2019t in a very long time: present a plan for how to make people\u2019s lives better. What candidates can bring forward \u2013 or fail to \u2013 is a vision for what a fairer and more democratic low-carbon world could look like, most thoroughly articulated so far by advocates for a Green New Deal. Promising to be better than Trump on climate is no recipe for the kind of rapid decarbonization required to save our collective skins.</p> <p>A climate debate, as such, should try to accomplish a relatively simple goal: to make candidates explain as succinctly as possible their plans to keep warming below 2C or less, and deal with the effects of whatever level of warming we do get. Leading climate scientists and energy experts can pore over the candidates\u2019 answers in the days and weeks afterward, and evaluate how far each candidate\u2019s plan will actually get us toward that goal.</p> <p>Then voters can decide whether those plans sound like they would build a world worth living in \u2013 DNC be damned.</p> <ul> <li><p>Kate Aronoff is a writing fellow at In These Times.

Recent European parliament elections saw a flood of voters to the European Greens, as the climate crisis emerged as a top concern for many on the heels of massive Fridays for Future demonstrations and Extinction Rebellion in the UK. Climate fears are beginning to take hold of voters in the United States as well, and the DNC would be stupid to not capitalize on the fact that their party is the only one with any nominal claim to be taking the potential end of the world seriously. If the DNC isn\u2019t going to take advantage of that fact, then Democratic presidential hopefuls should. When candidate Jay Inslee inquired about doing a special climate-themed debate, the DNC threatened to bar him and any other candidate who participated from the official primary debates. Why not dare them to try? Given the anti-establishment mood of many voters, it could play well for independents to stick it to the stingy party apparatus. Virtually every front-runner except for Joe Biden has backed the idea of a Green New Deal, and even he has called it a \u201ccrucial framework\u201d. Fifteen have also supported the idea of a climate debate. If climate change really does matter to them, then the coherent move would be to rebel against the DNC and give voters a chance to hear their thoughts on the greatest existential threat facing humanity. With Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Matt Gaetz already starting to come around on climate, Democrats\u2019 homefield advantage on the issue may not last long. A climate debate shouldn\u2019t be about haggling over targets and degrees and parts per million, but about the full scope of what the challenge actually entails. From housing to immigration to healthcare, there\u2019s no policy field which won\u2019t be touched by rising temperatures in the coming decades. Contra Perez, the climate crisis isn\u2019t an \u201cissue\u201d so much as the foundations on which all politics is going to play out. Making that a core concern for the party is an opportunity for Democrats to do something they haven\u2019t in a very long time: present a plan for how to make people\u2019s lives better. What candidates can bring forward \u2013 or fail to \u2013 is a vision for what a fairer and more democratic low-carbon world could look like, most thoroughly articulated so far by advocates for a Green New Deal. Promising to be better than Trump on climate is no recipe for the kind of rapid decarbonization required to save our collective skins. A climate debate, as such, should try to accomplish a relatively simple goal: to make candidates explain as succinctly as possible their plans to keep warming below 2C or less, and deal with the effects of whatever level of warming we do get. Leading climate scientists and energy experts can pore over the candidates\u2019 answers in the days and weeks afterward, and evaluate how far each candidate\u2019s plan will actually get us toward that goal. Then voters can decide whether those plans sound like they would build a world worth living in \u2013 DNC be damned. Kate Aronoff is a writing fellow at In These Times.

      "body": "<p>For almost half a century, something vital has been missing from leftwing politics in western countries. Since the 70s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom. It has exposed capitalism\u2019s cruelties. It has sometimes won elections, and sometimes governed effectively afterwards. But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society \u2013 or even provide a compelling vision of how that might be done. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy.</p> <p>Instead, the right has had one. Privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers \u2013 these interlocking policies have intensified capitalism, and made it ever more ubiquitous. There have been immense efforts to make capitalism appear inevitable; to depict any alternative as impossible.</p> <p>In this increasingly hostile environment, the left\u2019s economic approach has been reactive \u2013 resisting these huge changes, often in vain \u2013 and often backward-looking, even nostalgic. For many decades, the same two critical analysts of capitalism, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, have continued to dominate the left\u2019s economic imagination. Marx died in 1883, Keynes in 1946. The last time their ideas had a significant influence on western governments or voters was 40 years ago, during the turbulent final days of postwar social democracy. Ever since, rightwingers and centrists have caricatured anyone arguing that capitalism should be reined in \u2013 let alone reshaped or replaced \u2013 as wanting to take the world \u201cback to the 70s\u201d. Altering our economic system has been presented as a fantasy \u2013 no more practical than time travel.</p> <p>And yet, in recent years, that system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, the convulsions of populism and the impending climate catastrophe. Even senior rightwing politicians sometimes concede the seriousness of the crisis. At last year\u2019s Conservative conference, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that \u201ca gap has opened up\u201d in the west \u201cbetween the theory of how a market economy delivers \u2026 and the reality\u201d. He went on: \u201cToo many people feel that \u2026 the system is not working for them.\u201d</p> <p>There is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed: fairer, more inclusive, less exploitative, less destructive of society and the planet. \u201cWe\u2019re in a time when people are much more open to radical economic ideas,\u201d says Michael Jacobs, a former prime ministerial adviser to Gordon Brown. \u201cThe voters have revolted against neoliberalism. The international economic institutions \u2013 the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund \u2013 are recognising its downsides.\u201d Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis and the previously unthinkable government interventions that halted it have discredited two central neoliberal orthodoxies: that capitalism cannot fail, and that governments cannot step in to change how the economy works.</p> <p>A huge political space has opened up. In Britain and the US, in many ways the most capitalist western countries, and the ones where its problems are starkest, an emerging network of thinkers, activists and politicians has begun to seize this opportunity. They are trying to construct a new kind of leftwing economics: one that addresses the flaws of the 21st-century economy, but which also explains, in practical ways, how future leftwing governments could create a better one.</p> <p>Christine Berry, a young British freelance academic, is one of the network\u2019s central figures. \u201cWe\u2019re stripping economics back to basics,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want economics to ask: \u2018Who owns these resources? Who has power in this company?\u2019 Conventional economic discourse obfuscates these questions, to the benefit of those with power.\u201d</p> <p>The new leftwing economics wants to see the redistribution of economic power, so that it is held by everyone \u2013 just as political power is held by everyone in a healthy democracy. This redistribution of power could involve employees taking ownership of part of every company; or local politicians reshaping their city\u2019s economy to favour local, ethical businesses over large corporations; or national politicians making co-operatives a capitalist norm.</p> <p>This \u201cdemocratic economy\u201d is not some idealistic fantasy: bits of it are already being constructed in Britain and the US. And without this transformation, the new economists argue, the increasing inequality of economic power will soon make democracy itself unworkable. \u201cIf we want to live in democratic societies, then we need to \u2026 allow communities to shape their local economies,\u201d write Joe Guinan and Martin O\u2019Neill, both prolific advocates of the new economics, in <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/38315422/Joe_Guinan_and_Martin_ONeill_2019_-_From_Community_Wealth_Building_to_System_Change_Local_Roots_for_Economic_Transformation_--_forthcoming_in_IPPR_Progressive_Review_Spring_2019_pre-publication_version_\" title=\"\">a recent article</a> for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) \u2013 a thinktank previously associated with New Labour. \u201cIt is no longer good enough to see the economy as some kind of separate technocratic domain in which the central values of a democratic society somehow do not apply.\u201d Moreover, Guinan and O\u2019Neill argue, making the economy more democratic will actually help to revitalise democracy: voters are less likely to feel angry, or apathetic, if they are included in economic decisions that fundamentally affect their lives.</p> <p>The new economists\u2019 enormously ambitious project means transforming the relationship between capitalism and the state; between workers and employers; between the local and global economy; and between those with economic assets and those without. \u201cEconomic power and control must rest more equally,\u201d declared a report last year by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), a radical London thinktank that has acted as an incubator for many of the new movement\u2019s members and ideas.</p> <p>In the past, left-of-centre British governments have attempted to reshape the economy by taxation \u2013 usually focused on income rather than other forms of economic power \u2013 and by nationalisation, which usually meant replacing a private-sector management elite with a state-appointed one. Instead of such limited, patchily successful interventions, the new economists want to see much more systemic and permanent change. They want \u2013 at the least \u2013 to change how capitalism works. But, crucially, they want this change to be only partially initiated and overseen by the state, not controlled by it. They envisage a transformation that happens almost organically, driven by employees and consumers \u2013 a sort of non-violent revolution in slow motion.</p> <p>The result, the new economists claim, will be an economy that suits society, rather than \u2013 as we have at present \u2013 a society subordinated to the economy. The new economics, suggests Berry, isn\u2019t really economics at all. It\u2019s \u201ca new view of the world\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81acb61c2d73bc6e1ab1afc66826f8d95e644270\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81acb61c2d73bc6e1ab1afc66826f8d95e644270/0_0_1812_1444/1000.png\" alt=\"Nathalie Lees illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the excitable but often intellectually becalmed world of British politics, the arrival of a significant new set of ideas tends to generate certain responses. Events about it are packed out. Ambitious young researchers gravitate towards it. Adventurous older thinkers are intrigued by it. New intellectual institutions are created around it. Mainstream journalists initially dismiss it.</p> <p>Over the past year, the left\u2019s new economics has acquired this status. Jacobs, who is nearing 60, spent the New Labour era trying, and largely failing, to persuade centrist politicians that the economy needed drastically reshaping. \u201cBut nowadays,\u201d he told me, \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018Oh God, we finally might be able to do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Like all the new economists I met, he talks very fast, cutting short sentences as if there is too much to explain in the time available. A longstanding environmentalist, he describes the emerging network of new economists as \u201can ecosystem\u201d. Like the one that produced Thatcherism in the 70s, this network may involve only a few dozen people, whose polemics and talks and policy papers are being followed by an audience in the hundreds, but there is an intoxicating sense of political and economic taboos being broken, and of a potential new consensus being born.</p> <p>\u201cThere are British and American websites that publish a lot of our stuff, like openDemocracy, Jacobin and Novara. There are people producing stuff while freelancing for thinktanks \u2013 or setting up new thinktanks. And social media means the ideas spread, and collaborations happen, much faster than when leftwing economics was just about meetings and pamphlets,\u201d Jacobs says. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly incestuous, but it\u2019s rather thrilling.\u201d</p> <p>This ferment is beginning to solidify into a movement. The New Economy Organisers Network (Neon), a NEF spin-off based in London, runs workshops for leftwing activists, to learn how \u201cto build support for a new economy\u201d \u2013 for example, by telling effective \u201cstories\u201d about it in the mainstream media. <a href=\"https://www.stirtoaction.com/\" title=\"\">Stir to Action</a>, an activist organisation based in Bridport in Dorset, publishes a quarterly \u201cmagazine for the new economy\u201d, and organises advice sessions in left-leaning cities such as Bristol and Oxford: Worker Co-ops: How to Get Started, Community Ownership: What If We Ran It Ourselves?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a totally new impulse to activism about the economy now,\u201d says the magazine\u2019s editor, Jonny Gordon-Farleigh, who was previously involved in anticapitalist and environmental protests. \u201cThe movement has gone from oppose to propose.\u201d</p> <p>Looming over this activity is the possibility, for the first time in decades, of a Labour government receptive to new leftwing economic ideas. \u201c[The shadow chancellor] John McDonnell seems to get it,\u201d says Gordon-Farleigh, guardedly. \u201cHe has some shared history with some of our movements. He has made interesting comments \u2026 about introducing co-operative ownership of the railways, for example.\u201d</p> <p>Others in the movement are more bullish. Last autumn, a <a href=\"http://renewal.org.uk/articles/the-institutional-turn-labours-new-political-economy\" title=\"\">widely circulated article</a> by Guinan and O\u2019Neill in the leftwing journal Renewal claimed that McDonnell could be planning nothing less than a \u201ctransformation of the British economy \u2026 a radical programme for dismantling and displacing corporate and financial power in Britain\u201d, in favour of the less privileged. Guinan told me: \u201cJohn McDonnell is extremely intellectually curious. I haven\u2019t seen another political figure at that level of seniority whose doors are so open to new thinking.\u201d</p> <p>James Meadway, until recently one of McDonnell\u2019s key advisers, is now writing a book about \u201can economy for the many\u201d. Between 2010 and 2015, Meadway worked at NEF, where his reports and articles sketched out many of the new economists\u2019 arguments. Several NEF staffers told me that since McDonnell became shadow chancellor, the usual relationship between leftwing thinktanks and Labour had been reversed: instead of desperately trying to draw the party\u2019s attention to their proposals, they were struggling to keep up with Labour\u2019s appetite for them. \u201cThey\u2019re virtually asking, \u2018Have you got anything else at the back of your cupboard?\u2019\u201d says one delighted but slightly perplexed NEF veteran. \u201cWe scrabble around, and give them anything we can come up with, as quickly as we can.\u201d</p> <p>Last July, NEF published a report advocating a sharp increase in the number of British co-operatives. On one of its later pages, with almost no fanfare, the report also proposed that conventional companies be required to give their employees shares, to create what NEF called an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d. In September, with a few modifications, the proposal became Labour party policy. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, from thinktank idea to adoption as policy!\u201d says Mathew Lawrence, one of the report\u2019s authors. This month, a version of the policy was also adopted by the US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>And yet, outside McDonnell\u2019s circle and the transatlantic radical left, the new economics has gone largely unnoticed \u2013 or been casually derided. The black holes of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are partly responsible, sucking attention away from everything else. But so is the radical nature of the new economics itself. Transforming or ending capitalism as we know it \u2013 the new economists differ as to which is the goal \u2013 is a difficult idea for most British politicians and journalists to take on board. After half a century accepting the economic status quo, they associate any leftwing alternatives to it either with out-of-date postwar social democracy \u2013 aka \u201cthe 70s\u201d \u2013 or with leftwing authoritarianism, with present-day Venezuela or the Soviet Union.</p> <p>However often McDonnell says in interviews that he wants to see a democratic economy, the adjective most frequently applied to him is still \u201cMarxist\u201d. \u201cThe new economic thinking is almost like a frequency that can\u2019t be heard,\u201d says Guinan.</p> <p>But with neoliberalism ailing, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/a-zombie-party-the-deepening-crisis-of-conservatism\" title=\"\">the right bereft</a> of other economic ideas, as the Conservative leadership contest is currently demonstrating, the left\u2019s new economics may have a long future \u2013 whether or not McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party wins power. To borrow a line from Thatcher, there is now an alternative.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The dream of a democratic economy has flickered on the margins of leftwing politics for at least a century. During the early 1920s, the British socialist theorists GDH Cole and RH Tawney both wrote fresh, provocative books arguing that workers should manage themselves, rather than submit to employers or shareholders \u2013 or to the state, as more orthodox Labour thinkers envisaged. In economic life, as in politics, Tawney argued in 1921, \u201cmen should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control\u201d.</p> <p>This empowerment of the workers was intended to be the first step in a larger transformation. \u201cThe real aim,\u201d wrote Cole in 1920, should be \u201cwresting bit by bit from the hands of the possessing classes the economic power which they now exercise\u201d, in order to ultimately \u201cmake possible an equitable distribution of the national income and a reasonable reorganisation of Society as a whole\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Cole was vague about how this overturning of the traditional order would happen. He ruled out a revolution, and a general strike, on the grounds that workers did not have the necessary access to weapons, or the economic resources to beat their employers in a protracted industrial struggle. A bold Labour government could, in theory, pass the necessary legislation; but the Labour administrations of the 1920s and 30s were cautious, and did not last long.</p> <p>When Labour did acquire the confidence and time to reconfigure the economy, during the premierships of Clement Attlee in the 40s and Harold Wilson in the 60s, the party chose to do so through Whitehall plans and bureaucracies, such as Wilson\u2019s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), rather than by democratising the economy. The results were mixed: the DEA lasted only five years.</p> <p>It was not until the 70s that a powerful Labour politician became interested in democratising the economy. Unusually for a Westminster grandee, Tony Benn paid close attention to the decline of deference and growth of individualism during the decade. \u201cMore people want to do more for themselves,\u201d he wrote in 1970. \u201cTechnology releases forces that permit and encourage decentralisation \u2026 It must be a prime objective of socialists to work for the redistribution of power.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61162d8e4d3a6fce00ca14c298f87998e2c5ef0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61162d8e4d3a6fce00ca14c298f87998e2c5ef0a/0_185_4197_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Benn at the Labour party conference in Brighton, October 1979\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn at the Labour party conference in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1974, Wilson made Benn secretary of state for industry. The economy was struggling. Benn oversaw and subsidised worker-run cooperatives at three ailing large businesses: the Scottish Daily News, a Glasgow newspaper; Kirkby Manufacturing and Engineering, a Liverpool maker of radiators; and Meriden, a producer of motorcycles in the West Midlands. The challenges these co-operatives faced \u2013 a lack of previous investment, and strong foreign or domestic competitors \u2013 were made worse by unsympathetic, economically conservative civil servants in Benn\u2019s department. An <a href=\"https://newint.org/features/1981/12/01/giants\" title=\"\">even-handed 1981 report</a> on the cooperatives by the leftwing magazine New Internationalist described them as doomed from the start \u2013 they were \u201ccrippled giants\u201d.</p> <p>The Scottish Daily News cooperative lasted five months. The Kirkby cooperative did better. Eric Heffer, a minister working for Benn, found trade union shop stewards there \u201ctransformed by their experiences\u201d of helping run the business. They became \u201creal worker-managers\u201d. The cooperative made it through the mid-70s recession. But soon after the 1979 election, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s incoming government terminated the experiment by cancelling Kirkby\u2019s subsidies. Meriden survived the change of government, and another recession in the early 80s. But it went bankrupt in 1983.</p> <p>Benn himself lasted only a year in the industry department, before he was removed by Wilson, who had never completely accepted his radicalism. Benn never held such a pivotal economic post again. Just as significantly, the saga \u201cundermined the co-operative option in Labour party policymaking circles for decades to come,\u201d says Gordon-Farleigh.</p> <p>From Benn\u2019s demotion in 1975 until Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as leader 40 years later, the Labour hierarchy broadly accepted that the economy should be based on profit, competition, and top-down management. The attempts by Benn and others on the British left during the 70s to establish what they sometimes provocatively called \u201cworkers\u2019 control\u201d were largely forgotten, or remembered as just another of a derided decade\u2019s failed utopias. The chance for a democratic economy seemed to have gone.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Yet during the lean years that followed for the British left, another experiment in democratising the economy began \u2013 across the Atlantic, in a country less associated with revolts against capitalism. It was more local, but also more thorough than Benn\u2019s backing of a scattering of vulnerable co-operatives, and it sought to mobilise the power of consumers rather than producers.</p> <p>Gar Alperovitz is an 83-year-old American economist and activist. Since the 60s, he has doggedly promoted economic innovations that put social before commercial goals. Often, he has been a fringe figure, but intermittently he has attracted wide attention. In 1983, he featured heavily in a Time magazine cover story about the future of the economy. In 2000, at the University of Maryland, he co-founded the Democracy Collaborative, a centre for research about how to revive the political and economic life of declining parts of the US, which gradually expanded into an activist body as well.</p> <p>\u201cTroubled American cities are in a more advanced state of decay than their British equivalents,\u201d says Guinan, who has worked for the Democracy Collaborative for a decade. \u201cBut American local government also has greater powers. So you have the ability to create radical new models from the ground up.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, the Democracy Collaborative began working in Cleveland, one of America\u2019s poorest big cities, which had been losing jobs and residents for decades. The activists followed an Alperovitz strategy called \u201ccommunity wealth-building\u201d. It aims to end struggling local economies\u2019 reliance on unequal relationships with distant, wealth-extracting corporations \u2013 such as chain retailers \u2013 and to base these economies around local, more socially conscious businesses instead.</p> <p>In Cleveland, the Democracy Collaborative helped set up a solar power company, an industrial laundry, and a city-centre hydroponic farm growing lettuces and basil. All three enterprises were owned by their employees, and some of their profits went to a holding company tasked with establishing more cooperatives in the city. All three enterprises have succeeded, so far. The goal of the project was summed up in blunt, almost populist terms by one of the Democracy Collaborative\u2019s co-founders, Ted Howard, in 2017: \u201cStop the leakage of money out of our community.\u201d Yet \u201ccommunity wealth building\u201d also has a more subtle purpose: it is a concrete demonstration that economic decisions can be based on more than neoliberalism\u2019s narrow criteria.</p> <p>Howard was speaking at a new economics conference in England, which had been organised by McDonnell. The two men are on first-name terms. Last year, McDonnell introduced Howard at another Labour event, in Preston: \u201cWe bring him across on a regular basis now, to explain the work that he\u2019s done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc14fe06f4cf883f72c3ad45829d6acce5e66b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc14fe06f4cf883f72c3ad45829d6acce5e66b5c/0_29_3360_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The renovated market in Preston, Lancashire, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The renovated market in Preston, Lancashire, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McDonnell has long been interested in decentralising and democratising the economy. He frequently cites Tawney, Cole and Benn in speeches. During the 80s, McDonnell was deputy leader and effectively the chancellor of the Greater London Council (GLC), which pursued Benn-style experiments with state-backed co-operatives, with similarly mixed results, until it was abolished by Thatcher in 1986.</p> <p>Contrary to his usual portrayal as a statist ogre, McDonnell believes there are limits to how far the left can increase taxes and government spending. In his view, many voters are unwilling, or simply unable, to pay much more tax \u2013 especially when living standards are squeezed, as now. He also believes that central government has lost authority: it is seen as simultaneously too weak, short of money thanks to austerity; and too strong \u2013 too intrusive and domineering towards citizens. Instead of relying on the state to create a better society, one of McDonnell\u2019s close allies argues, leftwing governments, at both the municipal and national level, \u201chave to get into changing how capitalism works\u201d.</p> <p>In recent years, with McDonnell and Corbyn\u2019s encouragement, and guidance from the Democracy Collaborative, many of the principles of \u201cthe Cleveland model\u201d, as it is reverently known in transatlantic leftwing circles, have been adopted by the Labour-run council in the small, ex-industrial city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/06/brutal-cuts-fight-back-preston-dragons-den\" title=\"\">Preston in Lancashire</a>. The regeneration has been promoted as a foretaste of Britain under a Corbyn government.</p> <p>Preston\u2019s hilltop city centre, which had been fading for decades, now has a refurbished and busy covered market, new artists\u2019 studios in former council offices, and coffee and craft beer being sold from converted shipping containers right behind the town hall. All these enterprises have been facilitated by the council. Less visibly, but probably more importantly, the city\u2019s large concentration of other public sector bodies \u2013 a hospital, a university, a police headquarters \u2013 have been persuaded by the council to procure goods and services locally whenever possible, becoming what the Democracy Collaborative calls \u201canchor institutions\u201d. They now spend almost four times as much of their budgets in Preston as they did in 2013.</p> <p>The council leader is Matthew Brown, an intense, angular 46-year-old who was partly inspired to enter politics by seeing Benn on television as a teenager. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing in Preston is common sense, but it\u2019s also ideological,\u201d Brown told me, when we met in his sparse office. \u201cWe\u2019re living through a systemic crisis of capitalism, and we\u2019ve got to create alternatives.\u201d By doing so \u2013 especially at a time when local councils are supposed to have been hugely weakened by government cuts \u2013 Preston is in small but visible ways undermining the authority of neoliberalism, dependent as it is on the insistence that no other economic options are possible.</p> <p>The council, Brown continued proudly, was \u201csupporting local small businesses rather than big capitalists\u201d. It was using its \u201cleverage\u201d as a procurer to make businesses behave more ethically: pay the living wage, recruit more diverse staff. And it was aiming to make the city a place where cooperatives were mainstream rather than niche: \u201cMy intention is to get them to 30%, 40% of our economy.\u201d</p> <p>I asked whether he had any doubts about a city with a population of less than 150,000 acting as a model for reshaping the whole British economy \u2013 and by implication, economies beyond. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m quite strong-minded.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>There is a confidence about the new economists, which comes as a surprise after all the left\u2019s defeats during the 80s and 90s. But with capitalism less effective and popular than it was then, the new economists believe they are now engaged in what the political theorist Antonio Gramsci \u2013 a big influence on them and McDonnell \u2013 called a \u201cwar of position\u201d: a steady accumulation of alliances, ideas and public credibility. Berry describes this process as a \u201ctransition\u201d that can lead to a different economy. McDonnell told me in 2017 that he wanted \u201ca staged transformation of our economic system\u201d. If enough other Labour councils copy Preston \u2013 and quite a few are interested \u2013 then even without a Corbyn government, let alone any kind of socialist revolution, the British economy will have moved leftwards, both in the priorities it chooses and the interests it favours.</p> <p>A few hours after meeting Brown in Preston, I spoke to McDonnell again about the left\u2019s new intellectual vibrancy. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to reconstruct what we had with Tony Benn in the 70s,\u201d he said. \u201cA range of thinking groups \u2013 NEF and Class [another leftwing economic thinktank] have been revitalised. Michael Jacobs is buzzing with ideas. We\u2019re arguing effectively for a more democratic economy. Doubling the number of cooperatives in the UK\u201d \u2013 as NEF advocated last year \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s relatively timid. We want to go further.\u201d</p> <p>He offered no more details. But the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/24/how-would-labour-plan-to-give-workers-10-stake-in-big-firms-work\" title=\"\">inclusive ownership fund</a>\u201d policy adopted by Labour shows the potential of the new economic ideas. The funds are intended to be Trojan horses: inserting into a company\u2019s ownership structure a group of shareholders \u2013 its employees \u2013 who are more likely to favour higher wages and long-term investment. \u201cThe funds are meant to tip the balance,\u201d says Lawrence, \u201ctowards a different kind of corporate culture.\u201d Or as the writer and activist Hilary Wainwright, one of the Labour left\u2019s shrewdest thinkers since the 70s, puts it: \u201cRadical change, when it destabilises the status quo in the right way, creates further opportunities for change.\u201d</p> <p>But turning the new economics into national policies will be hard, even if Labour wins power. Last summer, the head of NEF, Miatta Fahnbulleh, was invited to an awayday for Treasury civil servants to talk about the new economy. \u201cWhen I got there,\u201d she told me, \u201cI quickly realised that to the Treasury the new economy just means tech [companies]. When I started talking instead about how the economy could operate differently, they bought my premise that the status quo has problems \u2013 they\u2019re the Treasury, they\u2019ve got the data. They thought that the new economics was interesting \u2026 But only in a debating society sort of way.\u201d</p> <p>Before NEF, Fahnbulleh worked for the cabinet office and the 10 Downing Street strategy unit. She predicts there will be Whitehall resistance to the new economics: \u201cWhitehall hates big change \u2013 every time.\u201d Jacobs, who has longer experience of government, is slightly more optimistic. \u201cSome of the younger Treasury people will probably be quite excited by a new economic approach. Some of the older ones will think it\u2019s all wrong. And others will just implement whatever the government asks.\u201d</p> <p>He has helped run seminars for McDonnell and his team about what to expect from Whitehall, and how to respond. \u201cMy advice is, \u2018If you want to do something new, set up a new unit, and recruit. You\u2019ll get people joining who want to do new things.\u201d But Benn\u2019s experience at the department of industry suggest that outflanking Whitehall\u2019s conservatives may not be that simple.</p> <p>And then there is the business establishment. Since Thatcher, it has become accustomed to deferential governments, to getting its own way over other interest groups, and to profits and share prices trumping other measures of a company\u2019s economic or social value. The intention of the new economists to end these imbalances has not gone down well. \u201cThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) really <em>hates</em> inclusive ownership,\u201d says one McDonnell ally. \u201cYou can feel the chill whenever we bring it up.\u201d</p> <p>When I asked the CBI for their thoughts on the new economics, there was a week-long silence, and then, after I chased them, a terse statement: \u201cLabour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business.\u201d</p> <p>The new economists say they are not intimidated. \u201cWe in the movement need to be absolutely frank about this,\u201d says Guinan. \u201cA democratic and an exploitative economy are fundamentally incompatible. We should mount a straightforward, left-populist attack on these business interests. We should say to them: \u2018Off you go to Singapore!\u2019 The left shouldn\u2019t be afraid of a little creative destruction\u201d, he says, cheekily borrowing a phrase usually used by free-marketeers. Jacobs agrees: \u201cExploitative companies can go to the wall.\u201d</p> <p>That might sound like a reckless leftwing fantasy. But the new economists argue convincingly that hugely disruptive change is coming to the British economy, anyway \u2013 thanks to Brexit, automation and the climate emergency. \u201cBrexit alone will require a very interventionist state\u201d to help the economy adapt, says Lawrence. \u201cIt will make it much harder for a civil servant to say, \u2018You simply can\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>But what do the new economists want to come after neoliberal capitalism? In Preston, after Brown had spoken evangelically to me about the virtues of \u201clocal businesses\u201d and \u201clocal jobs\u201d, I asked whether his council was actually saving capitalism in the city \u2013 by making it more socially sensitive \u2013 rather than supplanting it. For once, he paused. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be pragmatic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still in a free-market environment. And I don\u2019t see local businesses as big capitalists, anyway. The vast majority only have one or two people working for them. There\u2019s almost no one to exploit. Shareholders are not involved.\u201d Not everyone on the left would see small businesses \u2013 often keen supporters of rightwing parties and austere social and economic policies \u2013 in such benign terms. But Brown went on: \u201cThe Labour party, nationally, is getting away from the old pro-business/anti-business argument. Creating social value is what matters.\u201d</p> <p>Later I asked McDonnell, too, whether his approach risked saving rather than replacing capitalism. He smiled, and went into the gnomic mode he adopts when talking about tricky issues. \u201cWho incorporates who ...\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate!\u201d Then his smile turned more mischievous. A Corbyn government, he said, would \u201cwelcome\u201d business \u201cinto our warm embrace\u201d.</p> <p>The McDonnell ally I spoke to said that whenever the question of the economy\u2019s long-term trajectory came up in Labour discussions, \u201cWe avoid that conversation. There is no consensus in the party.\u201d Then he added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d be quite happy if Britain ended up as Denmark.\u201d</p> <p>McDonnell often cites Germany as another country where capitalism is more benign. Wainwright, who has known McDonnell for decades, has a usefully flexible prediction about what might happen to Britain\u2019s economic culture if he becomes chancellor. \u201cEn route to a socialist society,\u201d she says, \u201cthere might be moments when a different capitalism emerges\u201d \u2013 ie, a more benign one.</p> <p>Yet the problem for the left with settling for \u201ca different capitalism\u201d, however temporarily, is that it may simply enable capitalism to regroup, and then resume its Darwinian progress. Arguably this is exactly what happened in Britain during the last century. After the politically explosive economic slump of the 1930s \u2013 the precursor to today\u2019s crisis of capitalism \u2013 during the postwar years many business leaders seemed to accept the need for a more egalitarian economy, and developed close relationships with Labour politicians. But once the economy and society had been stabilised, and rightwingers such as Thatcher started making a seductive case for a return to raw capitalism, the businessmen switched sides.</p> <p>Another difficulty for the new economists and their political allies is to persuade voters \u2013 brought up with the idea that profit and growth are the only economic outcomes that matter \u2013 that other values should matter more from now on. Even saving the environment is still a hard sell. \u201cThe effect of economic growth on the planet is not an issue that\u2019s talked about nearly enough on the left,\u201d admits Berry. \u201cAs for de-growth\u201d \u2013 the current green term for dropping growth as an economic objective \u2013 \u201cthe Labour party won\u2019t touch it with a bargepole.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s ally agreed. \u201cDe-growth,\u201d he said, \u201cis just appalling labelling.\u201d Guinan says the problem is not just presentational: \u201ca politics of de-growth has not yet been invented that will carry the public.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d660bbf82c4ca4085e118198e85a415d8d83d1cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d660bbf82c4ca4085e118198e85a415d8d83d1cf/0_5_2936_1761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a Green New Deal event in Washington DC, May 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a Green New Deal event in Washington DC, May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Owen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, Labour have recently begun promoting a version of the Green New Deal: an enticing but still largely theoretical scheme advocated by steadily more leftists and environmentalists in Britain and the US over the past decade. It aims to address the climate emergency and some of capitalism\u2019s problems simultaneously, by a huge increase in government support for green technologies and the highly skilled, hopefully well-paid jobs needed to create them. In a speech this week, McDonnell said that this project needed to be Britain\u2019s biggest peacetime undertaking since the Attlee government\u2019s conversion of the economy from war to peace during the 40s. In April, the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, a McDonnell protege, wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/27/labour-green-industrial-revolution\" title=\"\">Guardian article</a> advocating a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, including \u201cdeep-water turbines in the North Sea\u201d, which \u201ccould provide four times Europe\u2019s entire electricity demand\u201d and \u201ccould be built and delivered from the UK\u201d. It was quite a thrilling vision; but the turbines were the only potential new technology the article mentioned.</p> <p>Another enormous issue that the new economists often skirt is whether many of today\u2019s workers really want more of a voice in their workplaces. When \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d was last a popular idea on the left, in the 70s, work was arguably more fulfilling and central to people\u2019s lives than it had ever been before. Office jobs were replacing factory jobs, work was a strong engine of social mobility, and membership of powerful trade unions had accustomed the majority of British employees to being consulted, of having some agency in their working lives. But in 2019, empowering experiences at work are less common. For more and more people, however well-qualified, employment is short-term, low-status, unrewarding \u2013 barely part of their identity at all.</p> <p>Gordon-Farleigh has spent years trying to interest people in forming co-operatives, and not always succeeding. \u201cContemporary capitalism has produced a pacified, passive workforce,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people even like to feel a bit alienated by capitalism \u2013 to not really understand how it works. They need to be reskilled, politically. Then we have to look at what economic powers they actually want.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In April, after waiting for a pause in the seemingly endless winter of Brexit arguments, Mathew Lawrence launched a new economics thinktank, Common Wealth, which aims to draw all the strands of the movement together, with an evening event in London. After an uplifting but slightly too slick film about Common Wealth\u2019s mission had been shown on a big screen \u2013 which was similar in tone and content to a recent Labour party political broadcast called <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2018/09/watch-together-well-rebuild-britain-labours-party-political-broadcast/\" title=\"\">Our Town</a> \u2013 Lawrence was introduced to the audience by Guinan. In the speech that followed, Lawrence covered so much ground that his voice became a mutter, too fast for anyone unfamiliar with the new economics to follow. During this formal bit of the evening, Common Wealth risked feeling like a project for insiders \u2013 just another London thinktank, with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband on its board.</p> <p>Yet the rest of the launch felt different. The hired room was in the East End, far from the usual thinktank belt around Westminster, and it was packed, and loud with earnest talk. Almost everyone was in their 20s or 30s, many of them with scuffed Dr Martens shoes and austere modern haircuts \u2013 the now-familiar sight of British millennials gathering to discuss changing the world. Two hours after the start of the event, people were still arriving, and hardly anyone had left. When I did, just before 11, the lights were still on in the nearby office towers of the City of London, which overshadows the East End, and the economy of the whole country beyond. But walking away from the buzzing room, especially after a bottle of the Common Wealth craft ale that had been made for the occasion, it was possible to believe that the bankers\u2019 best days might be numbered, and that the new economics would tell us how.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For almost half a century, something vital has been missing from leftwing politics in western countries. Since the 70s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom. It has exposed capitalism\u2019s cruelties. It has sometimes won elections, and sometimes governed effectively afterwards. But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society \u2013 or even provide a compelling vision of how that might be done. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy. Instead, the right has had one. Privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers \u2013 these interlocking policies have intensified capitalism, and made it ever more ubiquitous. There have been immense efforts to make capitalism appear inevitable; to depict any alternative as impossible. In this increasingly hostile environment, the left\u2019s economic approach has been reactive \u2013 resisting these huge changes, often in vain \u2013 and often backward-looking, even nostalgic. For many decades, the same two critical analysts of capitalism, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, have continued to dominate the left\u2019s economic imagination. Marx died in 1883, Keynes in 1946. The last time their ideas had a significant influence on western governments or voters was 40 years ago, during the turbulent final days of postwar social democracy. Ever since, rightwingers and centrists have caricatured anyone arguing that capitalism should be reined in \u2013 let alone reshaped or replaced \u2013 as wanting to take the world \u201cback to the 70s\u201d. Altering our economic system has been presented as a fantasy \u2013 no more practical than time travel. And yet, in recent years, that system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, the convulsions of populism and the impending climate catastrophe. Even senior rightwing politicians sometimes concede the seriousness of the crisis. At last year\u2019s Conservative conference, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that \u201ca gap has opened up\u201d in the west \u201cbetween the theory of how a market economy delivers \u2026 and the reality\u201d. He went on: \u201cToo many people feel that \u2026 the system is not working for them.\u201d There is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed: fairer, more inclusive, less exploitative, less destructive of society and the planet. \u201cWe\u2019re in a time when people are much more open to radical economic ideas,\u201d says Michael Jacobs, a former prime ministerial adviser to Gordon Brown. \u201cThe voters have revolted against neoliberalism. The international economic institutions \u2013 the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund \u2013 are recognising its downsides.\u201d Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis and the previously unthinkable government interventions that halted it have discredited two central neoliberal orthodoxies: that capitalism cannot fail, and that governments cannot step in to change how the economy works. A huge political space has opened up. In Britain and the US, in many ways the most capitalist western countries, and the ones where its problems are starkest, an emerging network of thinkers, activists and politicians has begun to seize this opportunity. They are trying to construct a new kind of leftwing economics: one that addresses the flaws of the 21st-century economy, but which also explains, in practical ways, how future leftwing governments could create a better one. Christine Berry, a young British freelance academic, is one of the network\u2019s central figures. \u201cWe\u2019re stripping economics back to basics,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want economics to ask: \u2018Who owns these resources? Who has power in this company?\u2019 Conventional economic discourse obfuscates these questions, to the benefit of those with power.\u201d The new leftwing economics wants to see the redistribution of economic power, so that it is held by everyone \u2013 just as political power is held by everyone in a healthy democracy. This redistribution of power could involve employees taking ownership of part of every company; or local politicians reshaping their city\u2019s economy to favour local, ethical businesses over large corporations; or national politicians making co-operatives a capitalist norm. This \u201cdemocratic economy\u201d is not some idealistic fantasy: bits of it are already being constructed in Britain and the US. And without this transformation, the new economists argue, the increasing inequality of economic power will soon make democracy itself unworkable. \u201cIf we want to live in democratic societies, then we need to \u2026 allow communities to shape their local economies,\u201d write Joe Guinan and Martin O\u2019Neill, both prolific advocates of the new economics, in a recent article for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) \u2013 a thinktank previously associated with New Labour. \u201cIt is no longer good enough to see the economy as some kind of separate technocratic domain in which the central values of a democratic society somehow do not apply.\u201d Moreover, Guinan and O\u2019Neill argue, making the economy more democratic will actually help to revitalise democracy: voters are less likely to feel angry, or apathetic, if they are included in economic decisions that fundamentally affect their lives. The new economists\u2019 enormously ambitious project means transforming the relationship between capitalism and the state; between workers and employers; between the local and global economy; and between those with economic assets and those without. \u201cEconomic power and control must rest more equally,\u201d declared a report last year by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), a radical London thinktank that has acted as an incubator for many of the new movement\u2019s members and ideas. In the past, left-of-centre British governments have attempted to reshape the economy by taxation \u2013 usually focused on income rather than other forms of economic power \u2013 and by nationalisation, which usually meant replacing a private-sector management elite with a state-appointed one. Instead of such limited, patchily successful interventions, the new economists want to see much more systemic and permanent change. They want \u2013 at the least \u2013 to change how capitalism works. But, crucially, they want this change to be only partially initiated and overseen by the state, not controlled by it. They envisage a transformation that happens almost organically, driven by employees and consumers \u2013 a sort of non-violent revolution in slow motion. The result, the new economists claim, will be an economy that suits society, rather than \u2013 as we have at present \u2013 a society subordinated to the economy. The new economics, suggests Berry, isn\u2019t really economics at all. It\u2019s \u201ca new view of the world\u201d. * * * In the excitable but often intellectually becalmed world of British politics, the arrival of a significant new set of ideas tends to generate certain responses. Events about it are packed out. Ambitious young researchers gravitate towards it. Adventurous older thinkers are intrigued by it. New intellectual institutions are created around it. Mainstream journalists initially dismiss it. Over the past year, the left\u2019s new economics has acquired this status. Jacobs, who is nearing 60, spent the New Labour era trying, and largely failing, to persuade centrist politicians that the economy needed drastically reshaping. \u201cBut nowadays,\u201d he told me, \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018Oh God, we finally might be able to do it.\u2019\u201d Like all the new economists I met, he talks very fast, cutting short sentences as if there is too much to explain in the time available. A longstanding environmentalist, he describes the emerging network of new economists as \u201can ecosystem\u201d. Like the one that produced Thatcherism in the 70s, this network may involve only a few dozen people, whose polemics and talks and policy papers are being followed by an audience in the hundreds, but there is an intoxicating sense of political and economic taboos being broken, and of a potential new consensus being born. \u201cThere are British and American websites that publish a lot of our stuff, like openDemocracy, Jacobin and Novara. There are people producing stuff while freelancing for thinktanks \u2013 or setting up new thinktanks. And social media means the ideas spread, and collaborations happen, much faster than when leftwing economics was just about meetings and pamphlets,\u201d Jacobs says. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly incestuous, but it\u2019s rather thrilling.\u201d This ferment is beginning to solidify into a movement. The New Economy Organisers Network (Neon), a NEF spin-off based in London, runs workshops for leftwing activists, to learn how \u201cto build support for a new economy\u201d \u2013 for example, by telling effective \u201cstories\u201d about it in the mainstream media. Stir to Action, an activist organisation based in Bridport in Dorset, publishes a quarterly \u201cmagazine for the new economy\u201d, and organises advice sessions in left-leaning cities such as Bristol and Oxford: Worker Co-ops: How to Get Started, Community Ownership: What If We Ran It Ourselves? \u201cThere\u2019s a totally new impulse to activism about the economy now,\u201d says the magazine\u2019s editor, Jonny Gordon-Farleigh, who was previously involved in anticapitalist and environmental protests. \u201cThe movement has gone from oppose to propose.\u201d Looming over this activity is the possibility, for the first time in decades, of a Labour government receptive to new leftwing economic ideas. \u201c[The shadow chancellor] John McDonnell seems to get it,\u201d says Gordon-Farleigh, guardedly. \u201cHe has some shared history with some of our movements. He has made interesting comments \u2026 about introducing co-operative ownership of the railways, for example.\u201d Others in the movement are more bullish. Last autumn, a widely circulated article by Guinan and O\u2019Neill in the leftwing journal Renewal claimed that McDonnell could be planning nothing less than a \u201ctransformation of the British economy \u2026 a radical programme for dismantling and displacing corporate and financial power in Britain\u201d, in favour of the less privileged. Guinan told me: \u201cJohn McDonnell is extremely intellectually curious. I haven\u2019t seen another political figure at that level of seniority whose doors are so open to new thinking.\u201d James Meadway, until recently one of McDonnell\u2019s key advisers, is now writing a book about \u201can economy for the many\u201d. Between 2010 and 2015, Meadway worked at NEF, where his reports and articles sketched out many of the new economists\u2019 arguments. Several NEF staffers told me that since McDonnell became shadow chancellor, the usual relationship between leftwing thinktanks and Labour had been reversed: instead of desperately trying to draw the party\u2019s attention to their proposals, they were struggling to keep up with Labour\u2019s appetite for them. \u201cThey\u2019re virtually asking, \u2018Have you got anything else at the back of your cupboard?\u2019\u201d says one delighted but slightly perplexed NEF veteran. \u201cWe scrabble around, and give them anything we can come up with, as quickly as we can.\u201d Last July, NEF published a report advocating a sharp increase in the number of British co-operatives. On one of its later pages, with almost no fanfare, the report also proposed that conventional companies be required to give their employees shares, to create what NEF called an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d. In September, with a few modifications, the proposal became Labour party policy. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, from thinktank idea to adoption as policy!\u201d says Mathew Lawrence, one of the report\u2019s authors. This month, a version of the policy was also adopted by the US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. And yet, outside McDonnell\u2019s circle and the transatlantic radical left, the new economics has gone largely unnoticed \u2013 or been casually derided. The black holes of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are partly responsible, sucking attention away from everything else. But so is the radical nature of the new economics itself. Transforming or ending capitalism as we know it \u2013 the new economists differ as to which is the goal \u2013 is a difficult idea for most British politicians and journalists to take on board. After half a century accepting the economic status quo, they associate any leftwing alternatives to it either with out-of-date postwar social democracy \u2013 aka \u201cthe 70s\u201d \u2013 or with leftwing authoritarianism, with present-day Venezuela or the Soviet Union. However often McDonnell says in interviews that he wants to see a democratic economy, the adjective most frequently applied to him is still \u201cMarxist\u201d. \u201cThe new economic thinking is almost like a frequency that can\u2019t be heard,\u201d says Guinan. But with neoliberalism ailing, and the right bereft of other economic ideas, as the Conservative leadership contest is currently demonstrating, the left\u2019s new economics may have a long future \u2013 whether or not McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party wins power. To borrow a line from Thatcher, there is now an alternative. * * * The dream of a democratic economy has flickered on the margins of leftwing politics for at least a century. During the early 1920s, the British socialist theorists GDH Cole and RH Tawney both wrote fresh, provocative books arguing that workers should manage themselves, rather than submit to employers or shareholders \u2013 or to the state, as more orthodox Labour thinkers envisaged. In economic life, as in politics, Tawney argued in 1921, \u201cmen should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control\u201d. This empowerment of the workers was intended to be the first step in a larger transformation. \u201cThe real aim,\u201d wrote Cole in 1920, should be \u201cwresting bit by bit from the hands of the possessing classes the economic power which they now exercise\u201d, in order to ultimately \u201cmake possible an equitable distribution of the national income and a reasonable reorganisation of Society as a whole\u201d. Yet Cole was vague about how this overturning of the traditional order would happen. He ruled out a revolution, and a general strike, on the grounds that workers did not have the necessary access to weapons, or the economic resources to beat their employers in a protracted industrial struggle. A bold Labour government could, in theory, pass the necessary legislation; but the Labour administrations of the 1920s and 30s were cautious, and did not last long. When Labour did acquire the confidence and time to reconfigure the economy, during the premierships of Clement Attlee in the 40s and Harold Wilson in the 60s, the party chose to do so through Whitehall plans and bureaucracies, such as Wilson\u2019s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), rather than by democratising the economy. The results were mixed: the DEA lasted only five years. It was not until the 70s that a powerful Labour politician became interested in democratising the economy. Unusually for a Westminster grandee, Tony Benn paid close attention to the decline of deference and growth of individualism during the decade. \u201cMore people want to do more for themselves,\u201d he wrote in 1970. \u201cTechnology releases forces that permit and encourage decentralisation \u2026 It must be a prime objective of socialists to work for the redistribution of power.\u201d In 1974, Wilson made Benn secretary of state for industry. The economy was struggling. Benn oversaw and subsidised worker-run cooperatives at three ailing large businesses: the Scottish Daily News, a Glasgow newspaper; Kirkby Manufacturing and Engineering, a Liverpool maker of radiators; and Meriden, a producer of motorcycles in the West Midlands. The challenges these co-operatives faced \u2013 a lack of previous investment, and strong foreign or domestic competitors \u2013 were made worse by unsympathetic, economically conservative civil servants in Benn\u2019s department. An even-handed 1981 report on the cooperatives by the leftwing magazine New Internationalist described them as doomed from the start \u2013 they were \u201ccrippled giants\u201d. The Scottish Daily News cooperative lasted five months. The Kirkby cooperative did better. Eric Heffer, a minister working for Benn, found trade union shop stewards there \u201ctransformed by their experiences\u201d of helping run the business. They became \u201creal worker-managers\u201d. The cooperative made it through the mid-70s recession. But soon after the 1979 election, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s incoming government terminated the experiment by cancelling Kirkby\u2019s subsidies. Meriden survived the change of government, and another recession in the early 80s. But it went bankrupt in 1983. Benn himself lasted only a year in the industry department, before he was removed by Wilson, who had never completely accepted his radicalism. Benn never held such a pivotal economic post again. Just as significantly, the saga \u201cundermined the co-operative option in Labour party policymaking circles for decades to come,\u201d says Gordon-Farleigh. From Benn\u2019s demotion in 1975 until Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as leader 40 years later, the Labour hierarchy broadly accepted that the economy should be based on profit, competition, and top-down management. The attempts by Benn and others on the British left during the 70s to establish what they sometimes provocatively called \u201cworkers\u2019 control\u201d were largely forgotten, or remembered as just another of a derided decade\u2019s failed utopias. The chance for a democratic economy seemed to have gone. * * * Yet during the lean years that followed for the British left, another experiment in democratising the economy began \u2013 across the Atlantic, in a country less associated with revolts against capitalism. It was more local, but also more thorough than Benn\u2019s backing of a scattering of vulnerable co-operatives, and it sought to mobilise the power of consumers rather than producers. Gar Alperovitz is an 83-year-old American economist and activist. Since the 60s, he has doggedly promoted economic innovations that put social before commercial goals. Often, he has been a fringe figure, but intermittently he has attracted wide attention. In 1983, he featured heavily in a Time magazine cover story about the future of the economy. In 2000, at the University of Maryland, he co-founded the Democracy Collaborative, a centre for research about how to revive the political and economic life of declining parts of the US, which gradually expanded into an activist body as well. \u201cTroubled American cities are in a more advanced state of decay than their British equivalents,\u201d says Guinan, who has worked for the Democracy Collaborative for a decade. \u201cBut American local government also has greater powers. So you have the ability to create radical new models from the ground up.\u201d In 2008, the Democracy Collaborative began working in Cleveland, one of America\u2019s poorest big cities, which had been losing jobs and residents for decades. The activists followed an Alperovitz strategy called \u201ccommunity wealth-building\u201d. It aims to end struggling local economies\u2019 reliance on unequal relationships with distant, wealth-extracting corporations \u2013 such as chain retailers \u2013 and to base these economies around local, more socially conscious businesses instead. In Cleveland, the Democracy Collaborative helped set up a solar power company, an industrial laundry, and a city-centre hydroponic farm growing lettuces and basil. All three enterprises were owned by their employees, and some of their profits went to a holding company tasked with establishing more cooperatives in the city. All three enterprises have succeeded, so far. The goal of the project was summed up in blunt, almost populist terms by one of the Democracy Collaborative\u2019s co-founders, Ted Howard, in 2017: \u201cStop the leakage of money out of our community.\u201d Yet \u201ccommunity wealth building\u201d also has a more subtle purpose: it is a concrete demonstration that economic decisions can be based on more than neoliberalism\u2019s narrow criteria. Howard was speaking at a new economics conference in England, which had been organised by McDonnell. The two men are on first-name terms. Last year, McDonnell introduced Howard at another Labour event, in Preston: \u201cWe bring him across on a regular basis now, to explain the work that he\u2019s done.\u201d McDonnell has long been interested in decentralising and democratising the economy. He frequently cites Tawney, Cole and Benn in speeches. During the 80s, McDonnell was deputy leader and effectively the chancellor of the Greater London Council (GLC), which pursued Benn-style experiments with state-backed co-operatives, with similarly mixed results, until it was abolished by Thatcher in 1986. Contrary to his usual portrayal as a statist ogre, McDonnell believes there are limits to how far the left can increase taxes and government spending. In his view, many voters are unwilling, or simply unable, to pay much more tax \u2013 especially when living standards are squeezed, as now. He also believes that central government has lost authority: it is seen as simultaneously too weak, short of money thanks to austerity; and too strong \u2013 too intrusive and domineering towards citizens. Instead of relying on the state to create a better society, one of McDonnell\u2019s close allies argues, leftwing governments, at both the municipal and national level, \u201chave to get into changing how capitalism works\u201d. In recent years, with McDonnell and Corbyn\u2019s encouragement, and guidance from the Democracy Collaborative, many of the principles of \u201cthe Cleveland model\u201d, as it is reverently known in transatlantic leftwing circles, have been adopted by the Labour-run council in the small, ex-industrial city of Preston in Lancashire. The regeneration has been promoted as a foretaste of Britain under a Corbyn government. Preston\u2019s hilltop city centre, which had been fading for decades, now has a refurbished and busy covered market, new artists\u2019 studios in former council offices, and coffee and craft beer being sold from converted shipping containers right behind the town hall. All these enterprises have been facilitated by the council. Less visibly, but probably more importantly, the city\u2019s large concentration of other public sector bodies \u2013 a hospital, a university, a police headquarters \u2013 have been persuaded by the council to procure goods and services locally whenever possible, becoming what the Democracy Collaborative calls \u201canchor institutions\u201d. They now spend almost four times as much of their budgets in Preston as they did in 2013. The council leader is Matthew Brown, an intense, angular 46-year-old who was partly inspired to enter politics by seeing Benn on television as a teenager. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing in Preston is common sense, but it\u2019s also ideological,\u201d Brown told me, when we met in his sparse office. \u201cWe\u2019re living through a systemic crisis of capitalism, and we\u2019ve got to create alternatives.\u201d By doing so \u2013 especially at a time when local councils are supposed to have been hugely weakened by government cuts \u2013 Preston is in small but visible ways undermining the authority of neoliberalism, dependent as it is on the insistence that no other economic options are possible. The council, Brown continued proudly, was \u201csupporting local small businesses rather than big capitalists\u201d. It was using its \u201cleverage\u201d as a procurer to make businesses behave more ethically: pay the living wage, recruit more diverse staff. And it was aiming to make the city a place where cooperatives were mainstream rather than niche: \u201cMy intention is to get them to 30%, 40% of our economy.\u201d I asked whether he had any doubts about a city with a population of less than 150,000 acting as a model for reshaping the whole British economy \u2013 and by implication, economies beyond. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m quite strong-minded.\u201d * * * There is a confidence about the new economists, which comes as a surprise after all the left\u2019s defeats during the 80s and 90s. But with capitalism less effective and popular than it was then, the new economists believe they are now engaged in what the political theorist Antonio Gramsci \u2013 a big influence on them and McDonnell \u2013 called a \u201cwar of position\u201d: a steady accumulation of alliances, ideas and public credibility. Berry describes this process as a \u201ctransition\u201d that can lead to a different economy. McDonnell told me in 2017 that he wanted \u201ca staged transformation of our economic system\u201d. If enough other Labour councils copy Preston \u2013 and quite a few are interested \u2013 then even without a Corbyn government, let alone any kind of socialist revolution, the British economy will have moved leftwards, both in the priorities it chooses and the interests it favours. A few hours after meeting Brown in Preston, I spoke to McDonnell again about the left\u2019s new intellectual vibrancy. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to reconstruct what we had with Tony Benn in the 70s,\u201d he said. \u201cA range of thinking groups \u2013 NEF and Class [another leftwing economic thinktank] have been revitalised. Michael Jacobs is buzzing with ideas. We\u2019re arguing effectively for a more democratic economy. Doubling the number of cooperatives in the UK\u201d \u2013 as NEF advocated last year \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s relatively timid. We want to go further.\u201d He offered no more details. But the \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d policy adopted by Labour shows the potential of the new economic ideas. The funds are intended to be Trojan horses: inserting into a company\u2019s ownership structure a group of shareholders \u2013 its employees \u2013 who are more likely to favour higher wages and long-term investment. \u201cThe funds are meant to tip the balance,\u201d says Lawrence, \u201ctowards a different kind of corporate culture.\u201d Or as the writer and activist Hilary Wainwright, one of the Labour left\u2019s shrewdest thinkers since the 70s, puts it: \u201cRadical change, when it destabilises the status quo in the right way, creates further opportunities for change.\u201d But turning the new economics into national policies will be hard, even if Labour wins power. Last summer, the head of NEF, Miatta Fahnbulleh, was invited to an awayday for Treasury civil servants to talk about the new economy. \u201cWhen I got there,\u201d she told me, \u201cI quickly realised that to the Treasury the new economy just means tech [companies]. When I started talking instead about how the economy could operate differently, they bought my premise that the status quo has problems \u2013 they\u2019re the Treasury, they\u2019ve got the data. They thought that the new economics was interesting \u2026 But only in a debating society sort of way.\u201d Before NEF, Fahnbulleh worked for the cabinet office and the 10 Downing Street strategy unit. She predicts there will be Whitehall resistance to the new economics: \u201cWhitehall hates big change \u2013 every time.\u201d Jacobs, who has longer experience of government, is slightly more optimistic. \u201cSome of the younger Treasury people will probably be quite excited by a new economic approach. Some of the older ones will think it\u2019s all wrong. And others will just implement whatever the government asks.\u201d He has helped run seminars for McDonnell and his team about what to expect from Whitehall, and how to respond. \u201cMy advice is, \u2018If you want to do something new, set up a new unit, and recruit. You\u2019ll get people joining who want to do new things.\u201d But Benn\u2019s experience at the department of industry suggest that outflanking Whitehall\u2019s conservatives may not be that simple. And then there is the business establishment. Since Thatcher, it has become accustomed to deferential governments, to getting its own way over other interest groups, and to profits and share prices trumping other measures of a company\u2019s economic or social value. The intention of the new economists to end these imbalances has not gone down well. \u201cThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) really hates inclusive ownership,\u201d says one McDonnell ally. \u201cYou can feel the chill whenever we bring it up.\u201d When I asked the CBI for their thoughts on the new economics, there was a week-long silence, and then, after I chased them, a terse statement: \u201cLabour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business.\u201d The new economists say they are not intimidated. \u201cWe in the movement need to be absolutely frank about this,\u201d says Guinan. \u201cA democratic and an exploitative economy are fundamentally incompatible. We should mount a straightforward, left-populist attack on these business interests. We should say to them: \u2018Off you go to Singapore!\u2019 The left shouldn\u2019t be afraid of a little creative destruction\u201d, he says, cheekily borrowing a phrase usually used by free-marketeers. Jacobs agrees: \u201cExploitative companies can go to the wall.\u201d That might sound like a reckless leftwing fantasy. But the new economists argue convincingly that hugely disruptive change is coming to the British economy, anyway \u2013 thanks to Brexit, automation and the climate emergency. \u201cBrexit alone will require a very interventionist state\u201d to help the economy adapt, says Lawrence. \u201cIt will make it much harder for a civil servant to say, \u2018You simply can\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d * * * But what do the new economists want to come after neoliberal capitalism? In Preston, after Brown had spoken evangelically to me about the virtues of \u201clocal businesses\u201d and \u201clocal jobs\u201d, I asked whether his council was actually saving capitalism in the city \u2013 by making it more socially sensitive \u2013 rather than supplanting it. For once, he paused. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be pragmatic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still in a free-market environment. And I don\u2019t see local businesses as big capitalists, anyway. The vast majority only have one or two people working for them. There\u2019s almost no one to exploit. Shareholders are not involved.\u201d Not everyone on the left would see small businesses \u2013 often keen supporters of rightwing parties and austere social and economic policies \u2013 in such benign terms. But Brown went on: \u201cThe Labour party, nationally, is getting away from the old pro-business/anti-business argument. Creating social value is what matters.\u201d Later I asked McDonnell, too, whether his approach risked saving rather than replacing capitalism. He smiled, and went into the gnomic mode he adopts when talking about tricky issues. \u201cWho incorporates who ...\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate!\u201d Then his smile turned more mischievous. A Corbyn government, he said, would \u201cwelcome\u201d business \u201cinto our warm embrace\u201d. The McDonnell ally I spoke to said that whenever the question of the economy\u2019s long-term trajectory came up in Labour discussions, \u201cWe avoid that conversation. There is no consensus in the party.\u201d Then he added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d be quite happy if Britain ended up as Denmark.\u201d McDonnell often cites Germany as another country where capitalism is more benign. Wainwright, who has known McDonnell for decades, has a usefully flexible prediction about what might happen to Britain\u2019s economic culture if he becomes chancellor. \u201cEn route to a socialist society,\u201d she says, \u201cthere might be moments when a different capitalism emerges\u201d \u2013 ie, a more benign one. Yet the problem for the left with settling for \u201ca different capitalism\u201d, however temporarily, is that it may simply enable capitalism to regroup, and then resume its Darwinian progress. Arguably this is exactly what happened in Britain during the last century. After the politically explosive economic slump of the 1930s \u2013 the precursor to today\u2019s crisis of capitalism \u2013 during the postwar years many business leaders seemed to accept the need for a more egalitarian economy, and developed close relationships with Labour politicians. But once the economy and society had been stabilised, and rightwingers such as Thatcher started making a seductive case for a return to raw capitalism, the businessmen switched sides. Another difficulty for the new economists and their political allies is to persuade voters \u2013 brought up with the idea that profit and growth are the only economic outcomes that matter \u2013 that other values should matter more from now on. Even saving the environment is still a hard sell. \u201cThe effect of economic growth on the planet is not an issue that\u2019s talked about nearly enough on the left,\u201d admits Berry. \u201cAs for de-growth\u201d \u2013 the current green term for dropping growth as an economic objective \u2013 \u201cthe Labour party won\u2019t touch it with a bargepole.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s ally agreed. \u201cDe-growth,\u201d he said, \u201cis just appalling labelling.\u201d Guinan says the problem is not just presentational: \u201ca politics of de-growth has not yet been invented that will carry the public.\u201d Instead, Labour have recently begun promoting a version of the Green New Deal: an enticing but still largely theoretical scheme advocated by steadily more leftists and environmentalists in Britain and the US over the past decade. It aims to address the climate emergency and some of capitalism\u2019s problems simultaneously, by a huge increase in government support for green technologies and the highly skilled, hopefully well-paid jobs needed to create them. In a speech this week, McDonnell said that this project needed to be Britain\u2019s biggest peacetime undertaking since the Attlee government\u2019s conversion of the economy from war to peace during the 40s. In April, the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, a McDonnell protege, wrote a Guardian article advocating a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, including \u201cdeep-water turbines in the North Sea\u201d, which \u201ccould provide four times Europe\u2019s entire electricity demand\u201d and \u201ccould be built and delivered from the UK\u201d. It was quite a thrilling vision; but the turbines were the only potential new technology the article mentioned. Another enormous issue that the new economists often skirt is whether many of today\u2019s workers really want more of a voice in their workplaces. When \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d was last a popular idea on the left, in the 70s, work was arguably more fulfilling and central to people\u2019s lives than it had ever been before. Office jobs were replacing factory jobs, work was a strong engine of social mobility, and membership of powerful trade unions had accustomed the majority of British employees to being consulted, of having some agency in their working lives. But in 2019, empowering experiences at work are less common. For more and more people, however well-qualified, employment is short-term, low-status, unrewarding \u2013 barely part of their identity at all. Gordon-Farleigh has spent years trying to interest people in forming co-operatives, and not always succeeding. \u201cContemporary capitalism has produced a pacified, passive workforce,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people even like to feel a bit alienated by capitalism \u2013 to not really understand how it works. They need to be reskilled, politically. Then we have to look at what economic powers they actually want.\u201d * * * In April, after waiting for a pause in the seemingly endless winter of Brexit arguments, Mathew Lawrence launched a new economics thinktank, Common Wealth, which aims to draw all the strands of the movement together, with an evening event in London. After an uplifting but slightly too slick film about Common Wealth\u2019s mission had been shown on a big screen \u2013 which was similar in tone and content to a recent Labour party political broadcast called Our Town \u2013 Lawrence was introduced to the audience by Guinan. In the speech that followed, Lawrence covered so much ground that his voice became a mutter, too fast for anyone unfamiliar with the new economics to follow. During this formal bit of the evening, Common Wealth risked feeling like a project for insiders \u2013 just another London thinktank, with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband on its board. Yet the rest of the launch felt different. The hired room was in the East End, far from the usual thinktank belt around Westminster, and it was packed, and loud with earnest talk. Almost everyone was in their 20s or 30s, many of them with scuffed Dr Martens shoes and austere modern haircuts \u2013 the now-familiar sight of British millennials gathering to discuss changing the world. Two hours after the start of the event, people were still arriving, and hardly anyone had left. When I did, just before 11, the lights were still on in the nearby office towers of the City of London, which overshadows the East End, and the economy of the whole country beyond. But walking away from the buzzing room, especially after a bottle of the Common Wealth craft ale that had been made for the occasion, it was possible to believe that the bankers\u2019 best days might be numbered, and that the new economics would tell us how. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Johnson\u2019s waffly claim that there could be \u201ca standstill in our current arrangements under Gatt 24, or whatever it may be\u201d, has been blown out of the water by every expert, including the Brexit-backing attorney general, Geoffrey Cox. It shows how far the party has galloped into fantasy land when Liam Fox, who used to be the furthest extreme, now ranks among the sensibles, dismissing Johnson\u2019s Gatt 24 line. \u201cIt isn\u2019t true\u201d he says; no deal means no implementation time; and yes, all World Trade Organization tariffs apply immediately, 10% on cars, 40% on meat and other produce. Nicky Morgan\u2019s \u201calternative arrangement\u201d yesterday was an imaginary side-deal between the UK and Ireland to let food travel freely across the border: it too was instantly exposed as balderdash by trade experts. Both Hunt and Johnson boast of magic EU negotiating tactics and wizard border wheezes; neither has yet been stripped naked of such nonsense by relentless grilling. Now Theresa May says the next prime minister can avoid scrutiny by the Commons until September. Labour should be ready for an election soon, as both Tory remain rebels and StandUp4Brexit MPs from the European Research Group pledge to pull down a Johnson government if he deviates either way. Nigel Farage yesterday proposed a pact with the Tories that would deliver a devastating hard Brexit crash-out. This could see the remain majority crushed by a minority Tory/Farage Brexit machine. The only salvation would be the remain parties knocking all heads together to fight as an anti-Brexit alliance. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2019.
