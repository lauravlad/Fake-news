      "bodyText": "Council spending on local services has fallen by more than a fifth since 2010, according to a report from Britain\u2019s leading independent economics thinktank. In a reflection of the austerity drive imposed on local authorities by Conservative-led governments during the past decade, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said spending on services in England had fallen by 21% between 2009-10 and 2017-18. In a sign of the increasing difficulties facing local authorities across the country, the leading tax and spending thinktank also said the funds available to councils would become increasingly inadequate in the 2020s, rendering the current financing system for the country\u2019s local authorities through council tax and business rates unsustainable. David Phillips, an associate director at the IFS, said: \u201cCurrent plans for councils to rely on council tax and business rates for the vast bulk of their funding don\u2019t look compatible with our expectations of what councils should provide.\u201d The shifting demands of an ageing population mean the current 3% cap on annual council tax rises would mean adult social care would require 60% of local tax revenues within 15 years, up from 38% now, according to the report. Phillips said a national debate was required on how much citizens would be willing to pay for services. \u201cWithout it, we will default to a situation where the services councils can provide are gradually eroded without an explicit decision being taken.\u201d The warning from the IFS comes as growing numbers of English councils come under intense funding pressures because of central government cuts and increasing demands on services over the past decade from the ageing population. Conservative-controlled Northamptonshire county council declared itself effectively bankrupt in February last year. Nine months later the council was given a de facto bailout when the government gave it permission to sell its HQ and use the \u00a360m proceeds to fund day-to-day services. The IFS report found the steepest cuts in council spending had come in areas such as planning, development and housing services, with reductions of more than 50%. The amount spent on culture and leisure, as well as areas such as highways and transport, has been cut by more than 40%. Cllr Richard Watts, who chairs the Local Government Association\u2019s resources board, said councils in England would face an overall funding gap of \u00a38bn by 2025. According to the LGA, councils will have lost almost 60p in the \u00a31 from the central government for local services in the decade to 2020. \u201cAs this report highlights, pressures continue to grow in children\u2019s services, adult social care, and efforts to tackle homelessness,\u201d Watts said. \u201cThis is leaving increasingly less money for councils to fund other vital services, such as the maintenance of parks, certain bus services, cultural activities and council tax support for those in financial difficulty to try and plug growing funding gaps.\u201d The IFS report showed the cuts since 2010 had been larger in poorer parts of the country, echoing existing research that has shown northern councils and urban areas have been hardest hit. It said spending per head in the most deprived fifth of councils had fallen from 1.52 times that of the least deprived areas in 2009-10 to 1.25 times in 2017-18. The thinktank said ministers were presented with a big choice: either authorities are given additional money to enable them to continue providing existing services, or the government should be upfront with voters that councils cannot afford to maintain the same services they currently provide. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cWe are investing in Britain\u2019s future, and this year\u2019s local government finance settlement includes extra funding for local services.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The Equality and Human Rights Commission has launched a formal investigation into whether the Labour party \u201cunlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\u201d. Labour said it will cooperate fully and rejected \u201cany suggestion that the party does not handle antisemitism complaints fairly and robustly\u201d. The UK\u2019s human rights watchdog is also facing demands to launch an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. The Muslim Council of Britain filed a complaint of more than 20 pages saying calls for the party to allow an independent inquiry have so far been largely ignored. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, revealed that he plans to stay in his post. Bercow told the Guardian it was not \u201csensible to vacate the chair\u201d while there were major issues before parliament. But he risks the fury of hardline Brexiters. He also said a new Tory leader would not be able to force through a no-deal Brexit without Parliament\u2019s approval. Alastair Campbell, the former communications chief to Tony Blair, has been expelled from the Labour party for saying he voted for the Liberal Democrats in the European elections. Labour MPs including Jess Phillips, Darren Jones and Margaret Hodge accused the Labour leadership of double standards after its failure to expel members accused of antisemitism. Campbell also received the backing of Harriet Harman and the former Labour home secretary, Charles Clarke, who said he also backed a party other than Labour. Theresa May says she regrets not being able to push through the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union. The prime minister said she had worked hard, but that her successor would now need to find a way to unite the opposing factions. The BBC and Sky News will both air debates among candidates for the Tory party leadership. The former will run a programme with all those vying for the leadership, while the latter will invite only the final two. An online campaign putting pressure on Conservative MPs to back Boris Johnson as leader of the party is being run by Paul Staines, the founder of the Guido Fawkes blog. Boris on the Ballot, which launched this weekend, is designed to encourage members of the public to write to their local Tory MP and encourage them to nominate Johnson for leader. Jeremy Hunt has warned that pushing for a no-deal Brexit would be political suicide for the Tories. The foreign secretary also pledged to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the help of the DUP and the ERG, but not Nigel Farage. Sajid Javid has ducked the question of whether he would take the UK out of the EU without a deal. He told reporters: \u201cBrexit is clearly going to be one of the big issues that has to be addressed properly and every candidate has to come forward with a credible plan.\u201d Kit Malthouse has also refused to rule out seeking an extension to article 50 as he set out his case for becoming Tory leader. He said: \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate that has proven the ability to unify MPs around a Brexit plan which could deliver us out of this jam.\u201d Tony Blair has urged Jeremy Corbyn to \u201cstop equivocating\u201d and back a second referendum. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, insisted Labour was \u201cmoving towards a clearer line\u201d on a people\u2019s vote. The Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, warned a second referendum would be the \u201cfinal breach of trust with that working-class electorate\u201d. She added: \u201cI strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.\u201d Michael Gove will pledge free British citizenship for 3 million EU nationals after Brexit if he becomes prime minister. The environment secretary, one of the leading figures in Vote Leave, is understood to believe strongly that the pledge would honour the promises given to EU citizens by that campaign during the 2016 referendum. And, if you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Julian Borger and Rowena Mason have the full story on John Bercow\u2019s vow to stay on: John Bercow plans to stay in his post as Speaker of the House of Commons, despite previous expectations he was about to leave, my colleagues Julian Borger and Rowena Mason report. In so doing, the Speaker risks provoking the fury of hardline Eurosceptics who believe he wants to thwart a no-deal Brexit. Bercow told the Guardian it was not \u201csensible to vacate the chair\u201d while there were major issues before parliament. And, amid growing indications that frontrunners for the Conservative leadership are willing to depart the EU without a deal, he warned candidates not to try to force such an outcome without the permission of MPs. The former Labour home secretary, Charles Clarke, has called on Labour to reinstate Alastair Campbell and said he also voted Liberal Democrat in the European elections. I was not aware that Alastair had voted Liberal Democrat in the European election until I heard him say so on television on Sunday evening. His expulsion from Labour party membership is a disgrace and only compounds Labour\u2019s current political difficulties. I also voted Liberal Democrat. This was a one-off decision because of the hopeless incoherence of Labour\u2019s position, particularly that of Jeremy Corbyn, on Brexit. I have been a Labour party member for 47 years and have never before voted anything but Labour. I was chair of the Labour party in 2001-2. I have consistently argued against those who, often in understandable despair at the Labour leadership\u2019s abandonment of Labour\u2019s fundamental values, have either resigned from the Labour party or joined another party. And I shall be voting for Labour\u2019s excellent MP for Cambridge, Daniel Zeichner, in the next general election, whenever it comes. Labour should immediately withdraw its expulsion of Alastair. The elections of two pro-remain candidates to Northern Ireland\u2019s three European Parliament seats is a message that must not be ignored in London, the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says. What I think is really significant, and I hope this has been noticed in Britain, is the result of the European elections in Northern Ireland, where for 40 years there have been two unionists and one nationalist. That is no longer the case. There is one unionist, one Alliance Party MEP and one nationalist. So, two out of the three of the MEPs elected in Northern Ireland supporting the European Union and supporting the backstop and I hope that hasn\u2019t been missed as a fact by the British government and the wider British people. Two out of three support Northern Ireland remaining in the European Union, two out of three support the backstop, I have heard that message - I hope the British government and British people have heard that message too, because it has been heard here in Brussels. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Martina Anderson and the cross-community Alliance Party\u2019s Naomi Long \u2013 who both support remain \u2013 were each elected. The DUP\u2019s Diane Dodds, a Brexiter and a critic of the backstop, was the other candidate returned. Varadkar was speaking at a European Council meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. He also addressed his concerns about the Conservative party leadership contest. I think there is a growing risk of no deal. As I said a few days ago, there is the possibility that the new British prime minister may try to repudiate the withdrawal agreement. There is also the possibility, of course, that there may be a new British government that might follow a different course; a more European course. I can\u2019t predict either of those things. But what I can say is the European Union and Ireland will stand firm in our position that there can\u2019t be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and we need a legal treaty guarantee of that. Sky News will host a live head-to-head debate as part of the Conservative leadership contest, the broadcaster says. Unlike the BBC\u2019s planned offering, only the two final candidates will be invited to take part. It will be held before an audience of Tory voters and broadcast across Sky\u2019s TV and digital platforms, as well as being made available to other media outlets. Sky News\u2019 Kay Burley will host. The BBC has announced plans to hold high-profile debates involving Tory leadership candidates without consulting with some of the candidates. The BBC\u2019s decision to unilaterally announce its own broadcasting plans \u2013 including a hustings in mid-June and a head-to-head debate between the two final candidates \u2013 puts the pressure on individual Tory candidates to take part. But some leadership campaign teams told the Guardian they were unaware of the plans until a press release was issued on Tuesday afternoon and complained it was an attempt to bounce them into taking part. The decision to unilaterally announce the format ensures the broadcaster can avoid the excruciating, lengthy, and ultimately pointless debate over the format of the Brexit television debate that never happened between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at the end of last year. Given the potentially make-or-break nature of the Tory leadership debate \u2013 and the fact that the winner of the contest will almost certainly become prime minister \u2013 the broadcasts could shape the future of British politics, and of the Brexit debate. The format, which will see all the remaining contenders take part in a hustings after two rounds of voting by Tory MPs, could be chaotic if a large number of candidates remain involved. It could also be damaging for Boris Johnson, whose status as frontrunner means he is likely to come under attack from all sides. Other broadcasters, including ITV and Sky, are also planning their own leadership debates. Harriet Harman is another of the prominent Labour figure to back Alastair Campbell after his expulsion from the party. Here, she highlights that Labour\u2019s former director of governance and legal, Mike Creighton, believes that neither voting for another party, nor announcing such after the fact, represents a breach of Labour\u2019s rules. Alastair Campbell has been speaking outside his home in the last hour about the move to expel him from the Labour party, where he indicated that he wouldn\u2019t be going quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I voted against the Labour party. I believe I voted in the best interests of what the Labour Party should be doing,\u201d he said. Campbell said it was \u201cparticularly sad and disappointing\u201d that the move came on a day when he said that the party seemed to be moving towards taking up a sensible and coherent position on Brexit. He added that there are people in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s offices in senior positions who had recommended voting against the Labour party. Corbyn himself, Campbell continued, has in the past \u201cfor reasons best known to himself\u201d congratulated George Galloway for defeating a Labour candidate. Presumably, he was referring to this tweet: \u201cI am not going to leave the party just because some random email comes in,\u201d added Campbell. We\u2019ve also been contacted by readers suggesting that other Labour figures should be expelled for different reasons. One reader cited a piece written by Kate Hoey on the BrexitCentral website under the headline: \u201cWe should acknowledge the Brexit Party\u2019s success and include them in the negotiations.\u201d The fallout is continuing from Labour\u2019s decision to expel Alastair Campbell, the former communications chief to Tony Blair, after he said that he voted for the Liberal Democrats in the European elections. Support for Campbell has been coming from figures including Charlie Falconer, a former Lord Chancellor in Tony Blair\u2019s government, and Fiona MacTaggart, a former Labour minister who was an MP for Slough. The former defence minister, Bob Ainsworth, has also come out to say that he voted for the Green Party during the European Elections. Ainsworth told the BBC: \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to make this public but now Alistair has been expelled for doing the same I feel obliged to do so.\u201d The BBC has announced details of TV debates for the Conservative leadership contest. One of the debates will be moderated by Newsnigh\u2019s Emily Maitlis in the middle of June with all of the candidates (Is there a stage large enough ?) Fiona Bruce will host a Question Time special with the final two. while the same two candidates will also be invited to take part in one-on-one interviews with Andrew Neil. Fran Unsworth, Director BBC News and Current Affairs,said: The decision being made by Conservative Party members will profoundly affect us all, so it feels right that BBC audiences get a chance to see the candidates debate with each other, and that we scrutinise the various policy proposals they will be standing on. Our plans include bringing the final two candidates in front of the same Question Time audience on the same night to be quizzed by the public, as although the final say will fall to Conservative party members, it\u2019s firmly in the public interest for audiences to question and hear from the next potential Prime Minister. Other EU leaders who are arriving in Brussels are also giving their reaction to questions about what a new Tory leader might mean for the negotiations on Brexit between the UK and the EU. https://twitter.com/tconnellyRTE/status/1133389238945406976 As Theresa May arrived in Brussels, Franco-German tensions over who will run the EU\u2019s institutions were played out in public. The Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin reports that Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are divided over the claim of Manfred Weber, the candidate nominated as European commission president by the German chancellor\u2019s political group, the European People\u2019s party (EPP). \u201cI support Manfred Weber,\u201d Merkel told reporters on her way into the summit, adding that she hoped for a decision by the 28 EU leaders before July when the newly elected European parliament is due to sit. \u201cI will appeal this evening for us to show an ability to act.\u201d The French president, whose La R\u00e9publique En Marche (La Rem) gained 22 seats during last week\u2019s elections, and joins an enlarged and emboldened liberal group in parliament, offered a thinly veiled critique of the German MEP who has never held a government position. Macron insisted that the replacements for Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, as presidents of the commission and council, required \u201cexperience and credibility to enable them to carry out these missions\u201d. John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has warned Conservative leadership candidates that they will not be able to force through a no-deal Brexit without parliament\u2019s approval. Speaking in Washington DC, he gave a clear sign that the speaker would make sure parliament has an opportunity to stop the UK leaving without a deal if MPs believe it should be halted. The idea that parliament is going to be evacuated for the centre stage of debate on Brexit is simply unimaginable ... The idea the House won\u2019t have its say is for the birds. He highlighted the fact that, while leaving the EU without a deal is the legal default, there is a \u201cdifference between a legal default position and what the interplay of different political forces in parliament will facilitate\u201d. Three of the candidates \u2013 Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey \u2013 have suggested they could be willing to try to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October, regardless of parliament\u2019s clear view in the past that this should not happen. Bercow is being hosted by the Brookings Institute for an event billed as \u201ca discussion of Parliament\u2019s role in politics and policy at a pivotal time for one of the United States\u2019 closest allies\u201d. May lingered long enough to answer a few questions, one of which was whether or not she worried about the direction of the UK after the European elections. Her reply was that the results had been disappointing \u201cfor my party\u201d and that some very good candidates had failed to get elected and some very good MEPs had failed to keep their seats. The Labour Party also saw \u201csignificant losses,\u201d said May, who added: \u201cI think what it shows is the importance of actually delivering on Brexit.\u201d I think the best way of doing that is with a deal but it will be for my successor and parliament to find a way forward to get a consensus and I hope that those election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver Brexit.\u201d She as gone before the last shouted question - \u201cAre you going to miss Brussels Prime Minister? - but I have a feeling most people will guess what the honest answer to that might have been. The Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, has been among those talking in the meantime about what is likely to happen after May is replaced. Here\u2019s Politico\u2019s Chief Brussels Correspondent: Theresa May has been speaking at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, where she said that she hopes that the European election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver brexit. \u201c I have been to something like 15 council meetings or more and have been working hard to very hard,\u201d the prime minister told journalists outside the summit.\u201d \u201cIt is a matter of great regret to me that I haven\u2019t been able to deliver Brexit but that matter of course is for my successor. They will have to find a way of addressing very strongly held views on all sides.\u201d May is attending the summit where EU leaders are to consider candidates for the Commission\u2019s most important jobs in the wake of parliamentary elections. Looking and sounding fairly relaxed (demob happy even?), the prime minister said that the UK \u201cwould continue to play a constructive role\u201d during the extension which it has been given to its membership of the EU. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened today: Alastair Campbell, the former communications chief to Tony Blair, has been expelled from the Labour party for saying he voted for the Liberal Democrats in the European elections. Labour MPs including Jess Phillips, Darren Jones and Margaret Hodge accused the Labour leadership of double standards after its failure to expel members accused of antisemitism. The UK\u2019s human rights watchdog is facing demands to launch an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. The Muslim Council of Britain filed a complaint of more than 20 pages saying calls for the party to allow an independent inquiry have so far been largely ignored.

Boris on the Ballot, which launched this weekend, is designed to encourage members of the public to write to their local Tory MP and encourage them to nominate Johnson for leader. Jeremy Hunt has warned that pushing for a no-deal Brexit would be political suicide for the Tories. The foreign secretary also pledged to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the help of the DUP and the ERG, but not Nigel Farage. Sajid Javid has ducked the question of whether he would take the UK out of the EU without a deal. He told reporters: \u201cBrexit is clearly going to be one of the big issues that has to be addressed properly and every candidate has to come forward with a credible plan.\u201d Kit Malthouse has also refused to rule out seeking an extension to article 50 as he set out his case for becoming Tory leader. He said: \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate that has proven the ability to unify MPs around a Brexit plan which could deliver us out of this jam.\u201d Tony Blair has urged Jeremy Corbyn to \u201cstop equivocating\u201d and back a second referendum. Shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, insisted Labour was \u201cmoving towards a clearer line\u201d on a people\u2019s vote. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy warned a second referendum \u201cwould be the final breach of trust with that working-class electorate\u201d. She added: \u201cI strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.\u201d Michael Gove will pledge free British citizenship for 3 million EU nationals after Brexit if he becomes prime minister. The environment secretary, one of the leading figures in Vote Leave, is understood to believe strongly that the pledge would honour the promises given to EU citizens by that campaign during the 2016 referendum. We\u2019re pausing the blog for now, but we\u2019ll resume if and when there are important developments. Rory Stewart has gone from Kew Gardens to a fish stall on Lewisham market. No one wants to talk to him about Brexit in Dari, or any other language, he claims in his latest video selfie. Jeremy Corbyn has refused to answer questions about the EHRC investigation into alleged antisemitism in the Labour party. As is often the case, Corbyn declined to talk to reporters outside his North London home. Naz Shah, shadow equalities minister, said the Muslim Council of Britain\u2019s letter about alleged Conservative Islamphobia \u201chighlights the deep-rooted nature\u201d of the problem in the party. She said: \u201cThe countless evidenced examples and failure to swiftly deal with the problems shows us how the problem is not just about a few members sharing hateful views, but about institutionalised Islamophobia that exists right at the top and trickles all the way down. \u201cOnly a few weeks ago, the Conservative party ignored calls from large sections of the Muslim community to adopt the APPG definition of Islamophobia, and instead decided it should be down to two experts to draw up a definition for British Muslims. Those experts should instead start to draw up the terms of reference for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party.\u201d Michael Gove has confirmed that if elected as leader and prime minister he would give free citizenship to all EU citizens living in the UK, as the Guardian reported. The Tory leadership campaign isn\u2019t getting any nicer. The MP Nadine Dorries, who is backing Boris Johnson, has accused Rory Stewart of running a Stop Boris campaign on behalf of Michael Gove. The Conservative party has yet to respond to that call by the Muslim Council of Britain for an EHRC investigation into Islamophobia in the party. Dominic Raab has launched a slick new video to promote his pitch to be the next prime minister. No bagpipes in the background, unlike Sajid Javid\u2019s video pitch. And very different from Rory Stewart\u2019s video selfies. Former chancellor George Osborne has argued for a second referendum as way of stopping Conservatives losing seats to the LibDems. In a letter published in the Evening Standard, which Osborne edits, he said:m: \u201cIf I were a Tory MP in most of the marginal seats facing the Lib Dems, I\u2019d know backing a no-deal Brexit could finish me off locally. Unless the Tories were to replace these losses to the Lib Dems with big gains from Labour, which looks unlikely, that is the end of their Commons majority. But here\u2019s a contrarian thought: perhaps a future Tory PM could make the bold, generous offer of a referendum on Brexit to win grudging Lib Dem support for their government. That could now be the only way, looking at the parliamentary maths, that the Tories could stay in office. And paradoxically, a Tory leader might find it easier to promise a referendum than Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Osborne\u2019s paper backed the LibDems in the European elections. Here\u2019s a copy of the letter sent by Muslim Council of Britain to the EHRC calling for an investigation into alleged Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. There is mounting speculation that Tory deputy chairman, James Cleverly, is about to put his name forward as the 11th candidate in the leadership race. In the wake of the Euro election drubbing, Cleverly said the party needed to look and sound different. One of the architects of Scottish Labour\u2019s disastrous European election campaign, Neil Findlay, has announced he has quit the party\u2019s front bench at Holyrood and is stepping down as an MSP at the next Scottish parliament election in 2021. Findlay is the first casualty of the bitter row which has erupted inside Scottish Labour after the party suffered its worst vote since 1910 in last week\u2019s European election, losing both its MEPs after polling less than 10% of the vote. A combative Corbynite who played a key role in the election of Richard Leonard as Scottish leader in 2017, Findlay was the party\u2019s European election coordinator but has been thought to have become increasingly detached from frontline politics in recent months. However Leonard announced on Monday evening he now believed Scottish Labour should support an automatic second referendum on Brexit after a deal was finalised and suggested that he would vote remain, regardless of the deal. Findlay is thought to be implacably opposed to both positions. Findlay announced his resignation from the front bench 20 minutes before Leonard chaired what is expected to be an angry meeting of Scottish Labour MSPs at Holyrood this lunchtime. Leonard is now facing pressure to consider his own future. Ian Murray, the centrist Labour MP for Edinburgh South, and a leading figure in the people\u2019s vote campaign, told BBC Radio Scotland on Tuesday morning Leonard needed to consider his position after the party\u2019s worst election result in over a century. Murray told Good Morning Scotland Leonard needed to decide whether he was \u201cin the best position to take forward the Scottish Labour party\u201d. Update: Here\u2019s Findlay resignation letter: In his letter to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Muslim Council of Britain\u2019s secretary-general, Harun Khan, said he believed there is \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to suggest there is a \u201cprima facie case to answer of systemic unlawful acts\u201d by the party. He claimed there is a \u201ctolerance for Islamophobia at the highest levels\u201d of the party, and an \u201catmosphere of hostility\u201d towards Muslim members. Khan said around 150 representatives and members of the party have \u201cengaged in Islamophobia\u201d, and accused those responsible for handling complaints of demonstrating a \u201ccallous attitude\u201d - and claimed the party has \u201cdenied\u201d there is a problem. \u201cAny one of these charges should be sufficient to indicate a serious problem,\u201d he wrote to EHRC chief David Isaac. \u201cTaken together, this has led to there being a situation where members of the party, and prospective members from a Muslim background specifically, have felt and publicly stated that there is an institutional problem of Islamophobia, where racism against Muslims is not dealt with other than where there is a media spotlight on the issue.\u201d He added: \u201cDespite the escalation in the number of cases of Islamophobia, there appears to have been no change in the approach taken. \u201cThe party has thus far failed to sufficiently engage with members of the party who have raised these concerns privately and then publicly (from Baroness Warsi and Lord Sheikh to the Conservative Muslim Forum), or Muslim community groups such as the Muslim Council of Britain. \u201cGiven this lack of willingness to take any opportunity to tackle this problem once and for all, we are hoping that the EHRC will be able to launch a formal investigation into this presumed breach of the Equality Act, and identify ways to ensure to rectify this serious issue within the governing party of this country.\u201d Criticism of the Conservative hierarchy\u2019s response has been led by former Tory chairwoman Baroness Warsi, who has called for an independent inquiry into \u201cinstitutional\u201d Islamophobia in the party. It came as the EHRC announced that it had launched a formal investigation into the Labour Party following allegations of anti-Semitism. An EHRC spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have received complaints regarding the Conservative Party and are considering them in line with our usual processes. As part of our standard process, we have written to the Conservative Party to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints.\u201d The Muslim Council of Britain has insisted it was entirely coincidental that it called for an EHRC investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative party on the day that the equalities watchdog launched a separate investigation into claims of antisemitism in the Labour party. The council\u2019s head of media monitoring Miqdaad Versi said: We are an apolitical body, and our evidence was collated a while ago. We released it today (trailed with a few journalists yesterday and others this morning before anyone knew about the antisemitism launch) because we wanted to wait until after the European elections to avoid any accusation of playing politics. It is worth noting that our big splash a year ago, was similarly released after the local elections for the same reason. The idea that we could put together such a collation of evidence, just to deflect attention from another type of racism, is outrageous (and also not sensible practically given coverage), and it speaks more to those who wish to ignore the serious issue of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Labour MPs continue to accuse the leadership of double standards over the swift expulsion of Alastair Campbell. Meanwhile, the Muslim Council of Britain says it has filed a complaint with the Equality and Human Rights Commission over Islamophobia within the Conservative Party today. It says it has repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia within the Conservative Party, but says those calls have been largely ignored. Harun Rashid Khan, the council\u2019s secretary general, said: \u201cIt is a sad day for us to have brought this complaint to the doors of the EHRC, but the concerns of Muslims at large about Islamophobia within the Conservative Party have fallen on deaf ears.\u201d \u201cWe have taken this step after an unprecedented number of cases have been brought to our attention, suggesting a culture within the Conservative Party where Islamophobia is not only widespread, but institutional. We now request the EHRC to look at all the evidence and investigate this matter with great urgency.\u201d Miqdaad Versi, the council\u2019s head of media monitoring, said: \u201cIt is regrettable that the Conservatives have refused to take our concerns seriously or that of their own Conservative peers. Furthermore, the current Conservative-led government has also decided to reject a definition of Islamophobia as accepted by the MCB and key Muslim stakeholders, which leads us to question, what message do the Conservatives want to send to Muslim communities?\u201d \u201cAs the leadership race ensues, will any of the candidates prioritise dealing with the sheer scale of Islamophobia that has consumed the Conservative Party?\u201d Labour has defended its decision to expel Alastair Campbell. A spokesman said \u201csupport for another political party or candidate is incompatible with Party membership\u201d. Margaret Hodge, aLabour MP and fierce critic of Jeremy Corbyn has this: Labour MP Neil Coyle makes a similar point: Luciana Berger, who left the Labour Party to join the Independent Group over antisemitism, points out that the threshold EHRC investigation is \u201cextremely high\u201d. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications director, has been expelled from the Labour party for voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections, he has said. Campbell said on Twitter: Read the full story here: Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far today: The Equality and Human Rights Commission has launched a formal investigation into whether the Labour Party \u201cunlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\u201d. Labour said it will cooperate fully and rejected \u201cany suggestion that the party does not handle antisemitism complaints fairly and robustly\u201d. An online campaign putting pressure on Conservative MPs to back Boris Johnson as leader of the party is being run by Paul Staines, the founder of the Guido Fawkes blog. Boris on the Ballot, which launched this weekend, is designed to encourage members of the public to write to their local Tory MP and encourage them to nominate Johnson for leader. Jeremy Hunt has warned that pushing for a no-deal Brexit would be political suicide for the Tories.

Shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, insisted Labour was \u201cmoving towards a clearer line\u201d on a people\u2019s vote. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy warned a second referendum \u201cwould be the final breach of trust with that working-class electorate\u201d. She added: \u201cI strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.\u201d Michael Gove will pledge free British citizenship for 3 million EU nationals after Brexit if he becomes prime minister. The environment secretary, one of the leading figures in Vote Leave, is understood to believe strongly that the pledge would honour the promises given to EU citizens by that campaign during the 2016 referendum. Labour said it would \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with the EHRC, and rejected \u201cany suggestion that the party does not handle antisemitism complaints fairly and robustly\u201d. A party spokeswoman said: \u201cLabour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism in any form. \u201cWe reject any suggestion that the Party does not handle antisemitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the Party has acted unlawfully, and we will continue to cooperate fully with the EHRC. \u201cWe support the efforts of the EHRC to draw attention to the obligations all political parties have under the Equality Act. But its ability to do so has been undermined by a 70% budget cut since 2010. \u201cLabour is the party of equality and in government we will strengthen the powers and functions of the commission. \u201cThere has been a deeply worrying rise in antisemitism in the UK and across Europe. We are taking action to root it out of our party by strengthening our rules and procedures. \u201cBut the issue can only be properly dealt with by all political parties working together to protect the interests of the Jewish community and to combat racism in politics, the media and in society more broadly. \u201cThat includes the need for the Conservatives and other parties taking action to deal with racism in their own ranks.\u201d There\u2019s more on the EHRC investigation here: The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it has launched a formal investigation into whether the Labour Party \u201cunlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\u201d. It said: We are pleased that The Labour Party has committed to co-operate fully with this investigation. We contacted Labour after receiving a number of complaints about allegations of antisemitism in the Party. We have carefully considered the response we received from the Party and have now opened a formal investigation under section 20 of the Equality Act 2006 to further examine the concerns. The investigation will seek to determine: whether unlawful acts have been committed by the Party and/or its employees and/or its agents whether the Party has responded to complaints of unlawful acts in a lawful, efficient and effective manner The full terms of reference are available on our investigation page. Once we have concluded our investigation we will publish a report of our findings, which may include recommendations. In March the equality watchdog said it believed Labour may have \u201cunlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs\u201d when it announced the first step of a statutory inquiry into the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints. At the time it said: \u201cHaving received a number of complaints regarding antisemitism in the Labour party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs. \u201cOur concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour party to give them an opportunity to respond.\u201d Stewart is heading to Leave-backing Wigan on Wednesday. Here\u2019s what he might find: Stewart\u2019s around-Britain videos are getting a mixed reaction from the commentariat. Rory Stewart is the only candidate who can speak the Afghan language Dari. The International Development Secretary tweeted a clip of himself meeting a voter in Barking, east London. \u201cPractising my now - rather rusty - Dari,\u201d he said. Stewart, who has so far secured the backing of only two Tory MPs, lived in Afghanistan for several years as chairman of a human development organisation. Channel 4 News journalist Fatima Manji questioned whether his language skills would get him the support he needed to become Tory leader. Stewart has since moved on to Kew Gardens. The crowded field for Tory leadership is threatening to get even busier. Treasury minister, Jesse Norman, emails to say he is considering a run. He said: \u201cNow is the time for moderate, decent people to speak up. Let us start the long process of reconstruction.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is incumbent upon all politicians\u2014Ministers or backbenchers, across political divides\u2014to step up and deliver a sane and workable Brexit for our country. But it is no less important, now more than ever, that all the candidates for the leadership should be able to set out not just their own policy ideas, beliefs and experience, but the deeper principles and purpose that underlie them. \u201cWhatever one\u2019s politics, we need the candidates to use the public platform, the hustings, the debates, the soapbox and interviews not to bring each other down but to build mutual understanding and trust and love, to find and renew a sense of common purpose, for the longer term.\u201d An online campaign putting pressure on Conservative MPs to back Boris Johnson as leader of the party is being run by Paul Staines, the founder of the Guido Fawkes blog. The campaign attracted attention amid ongoing questions over the funding and backing of online campaign groups, especially following the Guardian\u2019s revelations that employees of Sir Lynton Crosby were running influence campaigns for a hard Brexit. Boris on the Ballot, which launched this weekend, is designed to encourage members of the public to write to their local Tory MP and encourage them to nominate Johnson for leader. The former foreign secretary\u2019s supporters fear Tory MPs could stop Johnson making the final shortlist of two leadership candidates which are put to party members for a vote. Staines confirmed he is running the campaign group \u2013 which is also collecting contact details on potential backers \u2013 through the Irish-registered company CampaignAction Ltd, registered with the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. \u201cThere\u2019s no intention of covering my tracks. I\u2019m the sole director and sole shareholder,\u201d said Staines, who said he had not asked for permission from Johnson\u2019s team before launching the campaign. He said he had acted because he did not think the official campaign would \u201cget their act together\u201d in time. The Guido Fawkes blog is running a rival Tory leadership tally based on which candidates Tory MPs claim they intend to back (it is not always easy to tell). Guido says Raab and Gove are the front runners with 19 MPs each, and Johnson is on third with 17. And while Conservative Home claims 29 MPs have backed Hunt, Guido claims only 13 have done so. It also claims Malthouse has already picked up two backers. The backstory of Labour MP Jess Phillips is to be turned into a TV Drama by the makers of Happy Valley and Queer as Folk, according to PA. The Labour politician has spoken out over the hundreds of rape threats she has received on Twitter. She has also revealed that she was sexually assaulted at the age of 19. Her book is described as a \u201ccollection of empowering stories from her own life, told with honesty and hilarity\u201d. The drama will be made by RED Production Company - whose hits have included Happy Valley, Clocking Off, Queer As Folk, Scott &amp; Bailey and the recent Years And Years - with executive producer Lucy Dyke, whose credits include Black Mirror and Ripper Street. The Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley said: \u201cThey make the kind of television that truly represents people and events as they are and that was deeply important to me. The story of women in politics is complex and nuanced and intriguing, and it\u2019s a story that needs telling.\u201d Ukip candidate Carl Benjamin failed in his bid to get elected to the European Parliament after saying he \u201cwouldn\u2019t even rape\u201d the Labour MP. He also refused to apologise for the remarks. Jeremy Hunt is winning the race to be Tory leader, according to a tally being run by Conservative Home. It claims that 129 Tory MPs (more than 41% of the parliamentary party) have already backed one of the candidates. Hunt is top with the backing of 29 MPs, with Boris Johnson second with 24 backers. Close behind is Johnson\u2019s old rival Michael Gove on 23 and Dominic Raab on 20. Sajid Javid is the only other candidate to break into double figures with the support of 12 MPs. Andrea Leadson and Rory Stewart have only manage two backers each, and none have yet plumped Kit Malthouse. The UK will be forced into a general election that will obliterate the Conservative party if a new leader pushes for the UK to leave the EU with no deal in October, Jeremy Hunt has said. Having written in a Telegraph article that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d, Hunt said on Tuesday he did not believe parliament would allow the UK to leave with no deal on 31 October and would force an early election. \u201cI\u2019m making this argument because I want to solve the Brexit crisis we are in and I\u2019m worried if we don\u2019t solve it we will face a political crisis that is far bigger than our legal relationship with the EU; it could lead to the destruction of our party system and the end of my own party,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Tony Blair has urged Jeremy Corbyn to \u201cstop equivocating\u201d and back a second referendum. Speaking to Sky News he said: \u201cThe risk for Labour is that if it doesn\u2019t put forward a set of policies that can command support in the centre as well as on the left then it can\u2019t get to a majority. On Europe he [Corbyn] has just got to come to a clear position. Both party leaderships have made the same mistake which is to think that it is possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides. The European elections show that isn\u2019t possible.\u201d Blair also praised Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has been pushing for a second referendum. He said: \u201cI think Tom Watson has shown a lot of leadership in the last year or so and I support what he is trying to do within the Labour party which is to give a broad shelter to those MPs that believe Labour wins when it wins from a centre left position.\u201d Asked if he was talking to Watson, Blair said: \u201cYes of course. I talk to a lot of Labour MPs. The former Labour prime minister said he voted Labour in the European elections with \u201cno enthusiasm\u201d. On the Conservative leadership race, Blair said: \u201cThere is no Tory leader that would be crazy enough to try and tip this country into no-deal Brexit without going back to the people.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat Jeremy Hunt has said is absolutely right: the Conservatives would be certifiably insane to do a general election in the shadow of Brexit. This Tory leadership competition is going to a competition in Brexitness. Whoever emerges will go back to Europe, they are still trying to pitch this idea that Europe is going to allow us access into the market without abiding by the rules. They will find that Europe says no to that. Europe will not make concessions to a hardline Tory leader that they were not prepared to give to Theresa May.\u201d Sajid Javid has ducked the question of whether he would take the UK out of the EU without a deal. Challenged on a no-deal Brexit by reporters outside his home the home secretary said: \u201cBrexit is clearly going to be one of the big issues that has to be addressed properly and every candidate has to come forward with a credible plan. So I will have much more to say on that in the coming days.\u201d His use of the words \u201ccredible plan\u201d appears to be a swipe at some of the candidates who have called for UK to leave the EU with or without deal on 31 October. He added: \u201cWhat the public wants to see is much more trust with their politicians. A much stronger more confident relationship and I am concerned about the future and how we do that and that\u2019s why I think we need the right type of leadership. \u201cSadly I think there are too many divides in our country today, whether someone was Leave or Remain, or whether in the north or the south, whether they are young or they are old. And I think we shouldn\u2019t be exploiting any of these divisions. What we need to do is bring people together.\u201d Here\u2019s more on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s warning that pursuing no-deal would be catastrophic for the Tories and his call for finding a different way of getting a deal. He said: \u201cI\u2019m worried that if we don\u2019t solve it (Brexit), we will face a political crisis that is far bigger actually than our legal relationship with the EU, it could lead to the destruction of our party system and the end of my own party,\u201d he told Today. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed we should keep no deal on the table, I\u2019ve always thought that\u2019s the best way of getting a good deal and I\u2019ve always thought that ultimately our economy would find a way to flourish even with the shock of no deal, but the biggest risk to Brexit now is ... a general election.\u201d \u201cWe must not go back to the electorate asking for their mandate until we\u2019ve delivered what we promised we would do last time, which is to deliver Brexit, it would be absolutely catastrophic for us as a party.\u201d In his interview Hunt suggested he would also involve Scotland and Wales in the negotiations as well as the DUP and the ERG. He said: \u201cI think what we need to do is have a new negotiating team. In that team needs to to be not just the Government, but the DUP, the ERG, I think you should have someone from Scotland and Wales so that the Union side of these issues is properly thought through.\u201d His team has since clarified that he meant Tory representatives from these countries, according to Huff Post\u2019s Paul Waugh Hunt said the Labour frontbench \u201chas shown that they aren\u2019t prepared to do this in good faith, so I don\u2019t think that would work\u201d. Nigel Farage, he added, was not in parliament and did not want a deal. Hunt added that having \u201cproper representation\u201d in the negotiating team from \u201cother voices ... can then give Brussels confidence that they are talking to someone who can deliver a deal\u201d. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has insisted there would be no contradiction between having a second referendum and respecting the result of the one in 2016, as another senior Labour MP warned the party would lose the trust of its traditional voters. Abbott said the party was \u201csupporting a people\u2019s vote strongly now because it\u2019s the right thing to do and it\u2019s the democratic thing to do\u201d \u2013 though she said it was uncertain that remain would win a fresh poll. \u201cNow at minutes to midnight on these negotiations, the Tories have plunged into their leadership contest so we get no sense out of them for a few months. We think it\u2019s important to foreground the people\u2019s vote,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Earlier on Tuesday, the Labour MP Lisa Nandy warned a second referendum would lead to the country voting for no deal with the EU and said it would destroy trust in Labour. Kit Malthouse has refused to rule out seeking an extension to article 50, unlike some of hard Brexit candidates in the race. Speaking on BBC News he stopped short of saying he would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, as Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey have all pledged. Asked whether he could guarantee there would be no extension beyond 31 October, Malthouse said only: \u201cAn extension would be extremely difficult, I\u2019ve never voted an extension in parliament.\u201d He added: This debate is coming down to the question of no deal and whether the prime minister is willing to go over the line on no deal. We delude ourselves if we think no deal is entirely in our control. President Macron has said that he wouldn\u2019t allow us to go beyond 31 October. My primary objective is to get a deal around which we can all unite. We need to get to 31 October ready and able to take no deal if we want to. Those people who say no deal is going to be a catastrophe are wrong, but also so are those people who say it is going to be a walk in the park. Malthouse said he had showed he could unite the party after securing the Malthouse compromise on the Irish border that was agreed by former Remainers like Nicky Morgan and Robert Buckland and Brexiters like Steve Baker. He said: I\u2019m the only candidate that has proven the ability to unify MPs around a Brexit plan which could deliver us out of this jam. That is going to be my primary appeal beyond this really compelling domestic agenda focussed around children and schools and investing in the future. The country remains hopelessly divided still on this issue and we still have a mathematical problem in parliament. And unless the Conservative party can find a way to come together as a whole and take us over the line on 31 October, then we will remain in this jam. Housing Minister Kit Malthouse set out his case to become Tory leader in the Sun. He said: \u201cThis leadership campaign cannot be about the same old faces, scarred by wars that have split the Tory party over three years. \u201cWe need to end the Brexit paralysis, and while I voted to leave the EU, I know that without unity across the UK, we cannot get a deal over the line. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new generation to lead the charge into our future with boldness and vision.\u201d Malthouse, widely credited as the convener of both Conservative Leavers and Remainers to develop a compromise on May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, said there was a \u201cyearning for change\u201d. The 52-year-old is a former deputy mayor of London and entered the Commons in 2015 as David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives won a majority. His name was given to the so-called Malthouse Compromise - a proposal drawn up by backbenchers from Leave and Remain wings of the Tory Party, which would have implemented May\u2019s withdrawal deal with the backstop replaced by alternative arrangements. Hunt claimed that inviting the DUP and the ERG into the negotiations would give the EU confidence that whatever was agreed would be passed in the House of Commons. He also said it was important to get the tone right in the negotiations with Brussels. He claimed that a hardline stance would prompt a hardline response from the EU. Hunt admitted that he had not asked the DUP and the ERG whether they would be willing to join negotiations led by him. \u201cWe can\u2019t escape the parliamentary arithmetic,\u201d he said. Unlike Rory Stewart, Hunt said he would be \u201cdelighted\u201d to serve in a government led by Boris Johnson. Jeremy Hunt has defended his warning that pursuing no-deal would be political suicide. He told Today that the biggest risk to the government and Brexit would be holding an election before Brexit had been delivered. \u201cWe would be very severely punished and we would risk having the most left wing prime minister in history,\u201d Hunt said. He insisted that the best way to secure Brexit was to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement secured by Theresa May. \u201cWe have to have a go at this\u201d, he said. Hunt said he would bring in the DUP and the ERG into the negotiations, but he ruled out inviting Nigel Farage into the talks as the Brexit leader has demanded. Here\u2019s more from Diane Abbot\u2019s interview. She said: The people\u2019s vote has always been part of our policy package and as Kier Starmer put it, \u2018we move through the gears\u2019. But now at minutes to midnight on these negotiations, we think it is important to foreground the people\u2019s vote. If we are not going to have a general election we would support a people\u2019s vote. There is no inherent contradiction between respecting the result of the referendum and having a people\u2019s vote. I\u2019ve always argued that it is perfectly possible that Leave would win again. But we are supporting a people\u2019s vote strongly now, because it is the right thing to do and the democratic thing to do. Asked if Labour was only supporting another vote in certain circumstances she said: \u201cWe are clear that our ideal situation would be a general election, in the event there was a people\u2019s vote and remain was on the ballot paper, I personally would be supporting remain. We are consulting now with Members of Parliament. This is something we are going to have to decide collectively.\u201d Earlier, Wigan MP Lisa Nandy warned a second referendum \u201cwould most likely result in a no-deal outcome\u201d, adding \u201cthis could be the final breach of trust with that working-class electorate\u201d. She told Today: \u201cObviously in constituencies like Wigan you get very mixed views, you get different views like everywhere in the country, but to most people the idea of a second referendum just seems quite absurd. \u201cPeople were asked what they think, you can see from the results that we had here, that very few people have changed their minds and if there is a shift in this area of the country I think it\u2019s towards no-deal Brexit.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to wake up to the seriousness not just of what we\u2019re about to do to the Labour Party, but what we\u2019re about to do the country because I strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.\u201d \u201cThere is a huge frustration amongst Labour voters who voted Leave in towns like mine to see leading figures from the Labour Party out calling for a second referendum before there\u2019s been any serious attempt to implement the result of the first.\u201d Shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has pushed Jeremy Corbyn to go further on backing a second referendum. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme she said the party was \u201cmoving towards a clearer line\u201d on a people\u2019s vote. \u201cWe do want a people\u2019s vote on any deal\u201d she told the programme. She claimed the party is now \u201cforegrounding\u201d what has always been Labour\u2019s policy. But Abbott refused to be drawn on Paul Mason\u2019s Guardian article which called for members of Corbyn\u2019s team to be sacked over their opposition to a second referendum. Welcome to Politics Live as the race to become the next prime minister intensifies and recriminations from the European Parliamentary elections continue. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has put himself at odds with many hard Brexit candidates in the race by warning that pursuing a no-deal exit from the EU would be committing \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d. Writing in the Daily Telegraph he claims advocating a no-deal exit would risk losing a confidence vote in Parliament and prompting a general election. \u201cTrying to deliver no deal through a general election is not a solution; it is political suicide,\u201d he writes. His column prompted this riposte from fellow leadership contender Esther McVey: The issue of a no-deal Brexit is threatening to dominate the campaign. But the Tory MP Alberto Costa is trying raise another issue of UK citizenship for EU nationals. He has praised Michael Gove for pledging to give 3 million EU national free UK citizenship, and criticised Home Secretary Sajid Javid for failing to do so. Meanwhile, Kit Malthouse has become the 10th Conservative MP to confirm he has joined the race to be Tory leader. The housing minister is known for brokering the Malthouse compromise as an alternative arrangement to the hated backstop on the Northern Ireland border. It is popular with Brexiters but has been rejected by European Union. Over on Labour\u2019s side its evolving new position on whether to hold a second referendum on whatever Brexit deal is agreed is coming under fire. Former front bencher, Lisa Nandy, says promoting a second referendum will be seen as a \u201cfinal breach of trust\u201d in her Leave-backing constituency of Wigan.",

The broadcaster said it wanted to host the event in mid-June but it is understood the candidates were not consulted about the format, which would involve a clash between all those left in the race at that point \u2013 likely to include Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove. One supporter of Johnson said the frontrunner was not invited to take part before the announcement was made, although he had been approached by Sky News and ITV about whether he would be prepared to do a head-to-head debate if he was one of the final two candidates. The frontrunners in the contest have the most to lose by doing television debates in the early stages of the race when they are trying to get through the rounds of votes by MPs, so it is possible some may refuse to take part. The BBC also said it wanted to hold a second event, in a Question Time format hosted by Fiona Bruce, at the point where the contest moves on to a vote by Conservative members on which of the two finalists to make prime minister. This would give the leading two candidates the chance to submit themselves to audience questions. The BBC also wanted the two remaining candidates to be subject to interviews by the political journalist Andrew Neil in separate standalone programmes. After the BBC announcement, Sky News released its own plans for a live head-to-head debate as part of the Conservative leadership contest. It said it would host the two final candidates in the battle for No 10 in front of a studio audience made up of Conservative voters, moderated by presenter Kay Burley. The leadership contest will formally start on 10 June but all except the top four to six candidates are expected to drop out after the first couple of rounds of voting by Conservative MPs. Before this Friday\u2019s deadline for applications, an 11th candidate, James Cleverly, announced he had joined the race for the party leadership. Cleverly, a junior Brexit minister and former deputy party chairman,said in a letter to constituents: \u201cWe cannot bring the country back together unless the party of government is united, and the party cannot unite if it is led from its fringes. \u201cI believe the case for Brexit is still valid, and I have not wavered in that belief. But I have never been blind to the complexities of the process and I have always been uncomfortable with those who offer artificially simple solutions. \u201cIt would be best for the UK to leave the EU with some form of deal, and the EU must now recognise the need for flexibility as the current deal has been rejected by our parliament.\u201d Kit Malthouse, a former deputy mayor to Johnson, was also a surprise addition to the race, having decided he was the man to deliver the so-called \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d on Brexit, which was named after him. The compromise \u2013 replacing the Irish backstop with alternative arrangements, or negotiating a longer-term transition to a no-deal exit \u2013 has been backed by Conservative leavers and remainers but was rejected as unworkable by Downing Street.

Imagine there is a world where the Labour leadership were not just wary of the anger that taking a stronger position on Brexit and a second referendum might trigger, and instead tried to convince people that there was another way.</p> <p>This is the curse of British politics at this moment. It is not one of polarisation, but lack of conviction. Whether it is those who back remain with so much fervour that there is no discussion to be had about the nature of a second referendum, just that it must include remain as an option, or those for whom Brexit now simply means no deal, so much of it now is posturing. Who is hard enough to dunk on Brexit voters, tell them they were wrong, and get enough support to pull it off? Who has the gumption to take the keys of No 10 and no-deal the hell out of it? Even the way the media covered last week\u2019s European elections followed the same pattern, splicing the votes along leave and remain lines, with the Green party support being an inconvenient anomaly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/26/brexit-top-tories-would-bring-down-any-pm-who-backs-no-deal\">Brexit: top Tories would bring down any PM who backs no deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everyone is trying to divine which way the wind is blowing and either take shelter from it, hoping it will pass, or be swept away, all the while shelving policies or positions that are in the real interests of the voting public, in order to be spared its ire at the ballot box. The question for the Conservatives and Labour after their erosion at last week\u2019s elections is: how\u2019s that working out for you?</p> <p>It\u2019s not, and it never does. Take the hostile environment: both the Conservative and Labour parties decided that the public wanted a harder line on immigration and passed anti-immigration policies, or at least abstained from opposing them, too afraid to make a pro-immigration case and convince the British public with strength and vision. That position paved the way for Ukip, for Brexit, and the two parties\u2019 own eventual cannibalisation by policies and rhetoric they established.</p> <p>Rory Stewart will almost inevitably lose to Boris Johnson, a man who is the final destination in this race to the bottom. He will lose to a man often referred to as one who waits to see the way the crowd is running before dashing in front of it and saying \u201cfollow me\u201d.

Imagine there is a world where the Labour leadership were not just wary of the anger that taking a stronger position on Brexit and a second referendum might trigger, and instead tried to convince people that there was another way. This is the curse of British politics at this moment. It is not one of polarisation, but lack of conviction. Whether it is those who back remain with so much fervour that there is no discussion to be had about the nature of a second referendum, just that it must include remain as an option, or those for whom Brexit now simply means no deal, so much of it now is posturing. Who is hard enough to dunk on Brexit voters, tell them they were wrong, and get enough support to pull it off? Who has the gumption to take the keys of No 10 and no-deal the hell out of it? Even the way the media covered last week\u2019s European elections followed the same pattern, splicing the votes along leave and remain lines, with the Green party support being an inconvenient anomaly. Everyone is trying to divine which way the wind is blowing and either take shelter from it, hoping it will pass, or be swept away, all the while shelving policies or positions that are in the real interests of the voting public, in order to be spared its ire at the ballot box. The question for the Conservatives and Labour after their erosion at last week\u2019s elections is: how\u2019s that working out for you? It\u2019s not, and it never does. Take the hostile environment: both the Conservative and Labour parties decided that the public wanted a harder line on immigration and passed anti-immigration policies, or at least abstained from opposing them, too afraid to make a pro-immigration case and convince the British public with strength and vision. That position paved the way for Ukip, for Brexit, and the two parties\u2019 own eventual cannibalisation by policies and rhetoric they established. Rory Stewart will almost inevitably lose to Boris Johnson, a man who is the final destination in this race to the bottom. He will lose to a man often referred to as one who waits to see the way the crowd is running before dashing in front of it and saying \u201cfollow me\u201d. Perhaps this is Stewart\u2019s \u201csuicide mission\u201d, in a final act, to show that there is another way, if only one chooses to put principle before power. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

John Crellin Addingham, West Yorkshire \u2022 Polly Toynbee rightly calls for anti-Brexit forces to unite across party lines (Remainers won these elections. They\u2019d win a referendum too, 28 May). The problem is that this is unlikely to happen if we wait for the respective leaderships to get the message: despite some encouraging signs, they have too much invested in dysfunctional party tribalism. Now is the time for those opposed to Brexit, and in favour of the UK playing a constructive role in the EU, to take the lead and come together at constituency, borough and even ward level to end the narrow-minded nightmare that leavers are trying to drag us into. Members of any or, like me, no party should speedily form alliances to work for this end. Roger Hallam Palmers Green, London \u2022 If Labour\u2019s Methodist forebears were still around, they would surely have pointed Jeremy Corbyn towards the words of Paul, also known as Saul of Tarsus, and full-time organiser of the early Christians. \u201cFor if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? \u2026 except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood \u2026 ye shall speak into the air\u201d (I Corinthians 14:8). To put it another way, repeating endlessly that you have a clear policy is not the same as actually having one. Judith Condon Halesworth, Suffolk \u2022 Is there a better example of triangulation than Owen Jones proposing his newest solution to Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit (A second referendum is a bad option for Labour. But it may be the only one left, 27 May). The tortuous path of outlining a compromise when he could just say, \u201cI got it wrong\u201d.

      "bodyText": "European leaders will meet on Tuesday to launch the process for divvying up the European Union\u2019s top jobs. At the end of this year, five big jobs fall vacant. The EU will need a replacement for Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European commission, and Donald Tusk, president of the European council. The EU also needs new presidents at the European Central Bank and the European parliament, and a new foreign policy high representative \u2013 a post currently held by Italy\u2019s Federica Mogherini. EU appointments are always a fiendishly difficult political Rubik\u2019s cube. The bloc wants a spread of leaders balancing west and east, men and women, right, left and centre. Adding to the complexity, the European parliament has insisted it should have the biggest say over who leads the European commission. Each political group has its own lead candidate, or spitzenkandidat. But EU leaders, who have the right under European law to propose a commission president, mostly oppose what they see as a power grab by the parliament. Here are some of the names in the frame to lead the European commission and council. Manfred Weber Although he has been an MEP for 15 years and leads the European People\u2019s party group in the parliament, Manfred Weber is little known beyond Brussels. Even in his native Germany, barely a quarter of people know his name. The softly spoken Bavarian MEP has been campaigning across the continent in a quest to become European commission president. But French president Emmanuel Macron opposes his appointment, while many have doubts over his lack of executive experience. Unlike previous commission presidents, Weber has been neither a government leader nor a national government minister. He is also struggling to win backing from fellow MEPs. But he is the candidate of German chancellor Angela Merkel, although she has misgivings about the spitzenkandidaten system that might propel him to office. Frans Timmermans The chances of the commission\u2019s first vice-president, Frans Timmermans, getting the top job have improved after Social Democrats across Europe exceeded expectations in last week\u2019s elections, especially in his native Netherlands. Timmermans, a former foreign minister, who speaks six languages, is best known for his eloquent defence of the rule of law against backsliding from governments in Poland, Hungary and Romania. On the campaign trail he frequently stressed Europe\u2019s role in tackling the climate crisis and plastic pollution, including taking a shot at Donald Trump \u201cand his idiocy on climate change\u201d. He is also seen as a plausible candidate to be EU foreign affairs chief, although faces tough competition from Spain\u2019s outgoing foreign minister, Josep Borrell, as Madrid battles for greater influence in the EU. Margrethe Vestager Best known for taking on Apple, Amazon and Google as the EU\u2019s competition tsar, Margrethe Vestager wants to be the first woman to lead the EU commission. Born in Zealand, Denmark, Vestager was the country\u2019s economy minister, pushing through cuts in social benefits, and becoming an inspiration for hit drama Borgen. A Liberal, she was long thought to be a favourite of Macron. But the French president has cooled on her, since she ruled against a merger of France\u2019s Alstom and Germany\u2019s Siemens, a tie-up both governments deemed necessary in the face of Chinese competition. Michel Barnier The EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator is not a candidate to become European commission president. Not officially. But since the British government signed the Brexit withdrawal agreement last November, Barnier has been on an EU-wide speaking tour, where he has set out his vision for the continent, touching on issues from air pollution to artificial intelligence. The Frenchman had a long political career before becoming embroiled in Brexit and backstops. He was European commissioner for the internal market and France\u2019s foreign minister. Barnier has \u201cgreat qualities\u201d, Macron said in a recent interview with Belgian newspaper Le Soir that fell just short of an endorsement. For others, he lacks the easy communication style that some think a modern commission president needs. Kristalina Georgieva The Bulgarian economist quit her job as European commission vice president in 2017 to become chief executive officer of the World Bank. But some would like her to return to the Berlaymont. Several EU leaders proposed her name at a recent summit in Sibiu, according to Bloomberg. Georgieva was a well-regarded EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, before becoming commission vice-president, with responsibility for the EU budget. She began her political career at the World Bank and has written a textbook on microeconomics. Working in her favour, she ticks two important EU boxes: a woman and she is from eastern Europe. Other possible candidates Many EU jobs have gone to unheralded outsiders.

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has rejected a plea from the Foreign Office to hand over \u00a3400m owed by the UK government to Iran from a decades-old British tank sale, saying it is not prepared to give the money to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the Guardian understands.</p> \n<p>The case is important because if the money were transferred, as an international arbitration court has ruled it should be, it is more likely that the jailed British-Iranian woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a> would be released.</p> \n<p>Ministerial sources say the successive defence secretaries Sir Michael Fallon and Gavin Williamson have opposed releasing the payment, saying they are not prepared to hand over the money because they claim it will end up in the hands of Iranian forces determined to pursue what they see as a malign military agenda in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.</p> \n<p>It is the first time there has been such a clear political, as well as legal, motive ascribed to the MoD\u2019s refusal to hand over the money.</p> \n<p>Iranian authorities have not made an explicit link between the outstanding payment and the fate of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year jail sentence for espionage, but in private Iranians cite the \u00a3400m as one reason for the lack of trust between Tehran and London.</p> \n<p>The UK and Iran put their legal arguments about the payment to a high court hearing last week and a ruling is expected soon.</p> \n<p>The IRGC is the military wing of the Iranian government. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/08/trump-designates-irans-revolutionary-guards-as-foreign-terrorist-organization\">It has been declared a terrorist organisation by the US</a>, but not by the UK.</p> \n<p>One source said the records would show there had been some heated exchanges between the Foreign Office and the MoD about the debt.</p> \n<p>Some members of the government have argued that the UK lost the international arbitration case, owed the money and had to show a willingness to work with Iran.</p> \n<p>It was pointed out that the UK is actively trying to set up a special purposes vehicle designed to ease trade between Iran and the UK, so should not join a US economic blockade of Tehran.</p> \n<p>It was also argued the money could be given to Iran by the UK in a way that avoids current EU sanctions, a case UK government lawyers do not accept.</p> \n<p>Lawyers for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, have frequently pressed UK ministers to discuss the means by which the debt could be paid to an Iranian government entity other than its ministry of defence, or through humanitarian channels. Another option is for the UK Treasury\u2019s office of financial sanctions to issue a licence that would make the payment permissible under EU law.</p> \n<p>At the weekend, the veil of secrecy over the decades-old dispute was lifted when the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffes-freedom-depends-on-400m-payment-to-tehran-05rj6flx7\">Sunday Times</a> won a court order allowing the arguments in the case to be published, a decision welcomed on Tuesday by Ratcliffe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d3b7f24b-2281-4563-8116-8fbdcc6b24da\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(April 3, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Arrest in Tehran</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is arrested at Imam Khomeini airport as she is trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her daughter, Gabriella.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(July 12, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Release campaign begins</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Her husband, Richard Radcliffe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-iran-husband-urges-cameron-help\">delivers a letter to David Cameron in 10 Downing Street</a>, demanding the government do more for her release.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(September 9, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Sentenced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>She is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/british-iranian-woman-jailed-five-years-in-iran-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">sentenced to five years in jail</a>.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has rejected a plea from the Foreign Office to hand over \u00a3400m owed by the UK government to Iran from a decades-old British tank sale, saying it is not prepared to give the money to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the Guardian understands. The case is important because if the money were transferred, as an international arbitration court has ruled it should be, it is more likely that the jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be released. Ministerial sources say the successive defence secretaries Sir Michael Fallon and Gavin Williamson have opposed releasing the payment, saying they are not prepared to hand over the money because they claim it will end up in the hands of Iranian forces determined to pursue what they see as a malign military agenda in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. It is the first time there has been such a clear political, as well as legal, motive ascribed to the MoD\u2019s refusal to hand over the money. Iranian authorities have not made an explicit link between the outstanding payment and the fate of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year jail sentence for espionage, but in private Iranians cite the \u00a3400m as one reason for the lack of trust between Tehran and London. The UK and Iran put their legal arguments about the payment to a high court hearing last week and a ruling is expected soon. The IRGC is the military wing of the Iranian government. It has been declared a terrorist organisation by the US, but not by the UK. One source said the records would show there had been some heated exchanges between the Foreign Office and the MoD about the debt. Some members of the government have argued that the UK lost the international arbitration case, owed the money and had to show a willingness to work with Iran. It was pointed out that the UK is actively trying to set up a special purposes vehicle designed to ease trade between Iran and the UK, so should not join a US economic blockade of Tehran. It was also argued the money could be given to Iran by the UK in a way that avoids current EU sanctions, a case UK government lawyers do not accept. Lawyers for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, have frequently pressed UK ministers to discuss the means by which the debt could be paid to an Iranian government entity other than its ministry of defence, or through humanitarian channels. Another option is for the UK Treasury\u2019s office of financial sanctions to issue a licence that would make the payment permissible under EU law. At the weekend, the veil of secrecy over the decades-old dispute was lifted when the Sunday Times won a court order allowing the arguments in the case to be published, a decision welcomed on Tuesday by Ratcliffe. The court papers show Iran had asked the Treasury to approve the payment from a government-owned defence company to the Central Bank of Iran. Iranian officials believe the payment can be made without breaching EU sanctions. The dispute is over a 1970s defence deal between the Iranian defence ministry and a now near-defunct UK government defence trading service, International Military Services. IMS signed contracts in 1971 to sell more than 1,500 Chieftain tanks and armoured vehicles to the Shah of Iran. The contracts were cancelled after the shah was deposed in the 1979 revolution but Iran had already paid for the undelivered tanks and demanded its money back. It won an arbitration case at the Hague-based international chambers of commerce in May 2001 for repayment of the funds, but IMS, acting on behalf of the UK government, appealed against the size of the settlement. To avoid contempt of court charges, the IMS agreed in December 2002 to pay money to the high court as security, but there is now a dispute over the interest to be paid on the sum. In addition, the MoD said even if an agreement on the amount payable was reached, the money could not be handed to Iran\u2019s military sales arm because the body is under EU sanctions. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said there had never been a government policy to keep the court hearings private, rather, it was just normal legal practice for such arbitration cases to be held in private. \u201cWe are very happy for it to be public,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday. Hunt, who has claimed that Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being used as a diplomatic pawn in a wider dispute between Iran and the UK, appeared to liken any handover of the debt to ransom money. \u201cThe problem is if you pay ransom money to someone who is a hostage then all that happens is you might get that hostage out, but the next time they want something they\u2019ll just take someone else hostage. That is the conundrum we have.\u201d Ratcliffe\u2019s supporters said Hunt\u2019s description of the payment as ransom money was surprising given the government acknowledges that a payment is owed and that this predates Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s case by more than a decade. Zaghari-Ractliffe was convicted in Iran in September 2016 on spying charges, which she denies. Ratcliffe said that until the Sunday Times intervened, the government would not even tell parliament the day the hearing was happening. Ministers also gave a succession of written answers insisting the proceedings must remain private and confidential since they concerned an arbitral award. Ratcliffe said the case \u201cmatters to us since we have been told explicitly that we are linked to this court case. It feels like we are a very explicit bargaining chip that is being used.\u201d In a Westminster debate in March 2014, Ben Wallace, who was then a backbencher but is now a security minister, described the British handling of the case as \u201cun-British since it has been marred by double dealing and obfuscation\u201d. During his time as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson had briefed selective journalists that the money would be paid, but then discovered he could not deliver on the commitment because of resistance from government lawyers and the MoD. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 May 2019 to amend a time period.",

It is about framing \u2013 20% of the vote can be a win or a loss, depending on the previous result as well as the predictions in the last polls. The European elections are no exception and thus Monday was more important than Sunday.</p> \n<p>On Sunday the results began to emerge, albeit in the form of exit polls, and on Monday politicians and pundits came out to try to shape the interpretation of those exit polls.</p> \n<p>The powerful secretary general of the European commission, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2017/oct/24/martin-selmayr-brexit-rasputin\" title=\"\">Martin Selmayr</a>, used a well-planned <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/2019-european-elections/\" title=\"\">Politico Europe</a> event to sell his narrative, which was shared by many prominent pro-EU politicians. \u201cThe so-called populist wave, I think it was contained,\u201d he said to a relieved and sympathetic audience. Taking it even a step further, and praising the higher turnout and a few carefully selected election results, he declared, \u201cThe real winner of this election is democracy.\u201d If only.</p> \n<p>True, the \u201cpopulist wave\u201d is contained. Populism per se didn\u2019t win in the European elections, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/26/european-elections-centrist-parties-projected-lose-grip-power\" title=\"\">populist radical right</a> did. Left populism suffered big losses in its few remaining strongholds \u2013 La France Insoumise in France, Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain \u2013 while the idiosyncratic Five Star Movement lost too. While not all far-right parties won, overall the number of far-right MEPs increased significantly, mainly because a few populist radical right parties won (big) in big countries \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/matteo-salvini-far-right-league-party-tops-italy-eu-election-polls\" title=\"\">notably Matteo Salvini\u2019s League</a> in Italy. In other words, populism is dead. Long live the far right!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/27/far-right-eu-elections-europe-centre-green-liberal-surge\">The far right didn\u2019t sweep the EU elections. Europe\u2019s centre is holding | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But the analysis that populism was contained is also wrong because it externalises \u201cpopulism\u201d to parties that are part of the nontraditional political groups in Brussels, most notably the three rightwing Eurosceptic groups. Together these three groups have roughly as many MEPs as the pro-EU liberal and green groups combined. But there are more subtle changes within the various groups, which show a partly different story.</p> \n<p>First, the new rightwing populist group, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/12/european-parliamentary-elections-new-political-divides-far-right\" title=\"\">European Alliance of Peoples and Nations</a> will not only be (much) bigger than its predecessor, the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), it will also have a new biggest party. Since 1989 the Front National (now called National Rally) has dominated the European populist radical right, accounting for almost half of the ENF seats in the previous legislature. But Salvini\u2019s League is bigger than Marine Le Pen\u2019s party. Moreover, with neither Le Pen nor Salvini actually in the European parliament, the new group will have more footsoldiers, but fewer (if any) generals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c1e27b16-4be5-4f23-a08f-db6fc2691534\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qw-8AOpoBPA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Second, populist parties, as well as parties that pander to nativist and populist audiences, increased their representation, and therefore power, within the various \u201cmainstream\u201d groups. Poland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/european-elections-sex-and-religion-dominate-campaigning-in-poland\" title=\"\">Law and Justice party</a> (PiS) became the biggest political party within the \u201cconservative\u201d Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group, accounting for almost half of all MEPs. It has traditionally been dominated by the British Conservative party. And Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, from the 13th biggest country in the EU, is the third biggest faction within the \u201ccentre-right\u201d European People\u2019s party. In fact, Fidesz was the only party to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/27/european-elections-far-right-surge-ends-in-a-ripple\" title=\"\">win a majority of its country\u2019s seats</a> in this year\u2019s European elections, albeit not in truly democratic elections.</p> \n<p>Third, the two traditional big groups, the European People\u2019s party and the centre-left Socialists &amp; Democrats, lost their majority in the parliament, and will need to depend on (shifting?) coalitions with the liberals and greens. But the old and new centrist groups do not differ only ideologically, but also geographically. Power rests solidly within the west among the liberals and greens, but much less so in the European People\u2019s party and the centre-left Socialists &amp; Democrats. This could be highly problematic when it comes to sociocultural issues, as the vastly different responses between east and west towards the so-called refugee crisis of 2015 demonstrated.</p> \n<p>Fourth, while Selmayr and others celebrate the increased turnout, which is indeed good news, with barely half of the population voting in the 2019 European elections, democracy is hardly the big winner.

      "bodyText": "Elections are not about the actual results, but about the interpretation of those results. It is about framing \u2013 20% of the vote can be a win or a loss, depending on the previous result as well as the predictions in the last polls. The European elections are no exception and thus Monday was more important than Sunday. On Sunday the results began to emerge, albeit in the form of exit polls, and on Monday politicians and pundits came out to try to shape the interpretation of those exit polls. The powerful secretary general of the European commission, Martin Selmayr, used a well-planned Politico Europe event to sell his narrative, which was shared by many prominent pro-EU politicians. \u201cThe so-called populist wave, I think it was contained,\u201d he said to a relieved and sympathetic audience. Taking it even a step further, and praising the higher turnout and a few carefully selected election results, he declared, \u201cThe real winner of this election is democracy.\u201d If only. True, the \u201cpopulist wave\u201d is contained. Populism per se didn\u2019t win in the European elections, the populist radical right did. Left populism suffered big losses in its few remaining strongholds \u2013 La France Insoumise in France, Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain \u2013 while the idiosyncratic Five Star Movement lost too. While not all far-right parties won, overall the number of far-right MEPs increased significantly, mainly because a few populist radical right parties won (big) in big countries \u2013 notably Matteo Salvini\u2019s League in Italy. In other words, populism is dead. Long live the far right! But the analysis that populism was contained is also wrong because it externalises \u201cpopulism\u201d to parties that are part of the nontraditional political groups in Brussels, most notably the three rightwing Eurosceptic groups. Together these three groups have roughly as many MEPs as the pro-EU liberal and green groups combined. But there are more subtle changes within the various groups, which show a partly different story. First, the new rightwing populist group, the European Alliance of Peoples and Nations will not only be (much) bigger than its predecessor, the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), it will also have a new biggest party. Since 1989 the Front National (now called National Rally) has dominated the European populist radical right, accounting for almost half of the ENF seats in the previous legislature. But Salvini\u2019s League is bigger than Marine Le Pen\u2019s party. Moreover, with neither Le Pen nor Salvini actually in the European parliament, the new group will have more footsoldiers, but fewer (if any) generals. Second, populist parties, as well as parties that pander to nativist and populist audiences, increased their representation, and therefore power, within the various \u201cmainstream\u201d groups. Poland\u2019s Law and Justice party (PiS) became the biggest political party within the \u201cconservative\u201d Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group, accounting for almost half of all MEPs. It has traditionally been dominated by the British Conservative party. And Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, from the 13th biggest country in the EU, is the third biggest faction within the \u201ccentre-right\u201d European People\u2019s party. In fact, Fidesz was the only party to win a majority of its country\u2019s seats in this year\u2019s European elections, albeit not in truly democratic elections. Third, the two traditional big groups, the European People\u2019s party and the centre-left Socialists &amp; Democrats, lost their majority in the parliament, and will need to depend on (shifting?) coalitions with the liberals and greens. But the old and new centrist groups do not differ only ideologically, but also geographically. Power rests solidly within the west among the liberals and greens, but much less so in the European People\u2019s party and the centre-left Socialists &amp; Democrats. This could be highly problematic when it comes to sociocultural issues, as the vastly different responses between east and west towards the so-called refugee crisis of 2015 demonstrated. Fourth, while Selmayr and others celebrate the increased turnout, which is indeed good news, with barely half of the population voting in the 2019 European elections, democracy is hardly the big winner. And the argument that the increased turnout was because of the importance of the EU or the prominence of European issues is wishful thinking, given that the biggest increases in turnout were in countries with particularly polarised national politics (such as Austria, Hungary and Romania). Rather than a victory for democracy, the European elections, and the responses to the results, show how much populism in general, and the populist radical right in particular, has become mainstreamed and normalised. We find it normal that a neo-Nazi party is the third biggest party in a member state, that a populist radical right wins more than half of the vote in non-democratic elections, and that the populist radical right is the biggest party in several EU member states. We celebrate that \u201cthe majority has voted for pro-European parties\u201d. We ignore that turnout in one in five member states was (well) below one-third of eligible voters.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to support a second referendum on any Brexit deal after the Labour leadership came under overwhelming pressure to halt the exodus of its remain voters who backed pro-EU parties at the European elections. The Labour leader said he was \u201clistening very carefully\u201d to both sides of the debate after the party fell behind the Liberal Democrats and also lost ground to the Greens. Labour\u2019s preference would be a general election but any Brexit deal \u201chas to be put to a public vote\u201d, he said. Several Labour sources noted this was a shift from his previous position that a second referendum was being kept as an option on the table to stop a damaging Tory Brexit. He later wrote to MPs: \u201cIt is clear that the deadlock in parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote. We are ready to support a public vote on any deal.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s statement, after a day of frantic lobbying from senior party figures in response to disappointing European election results and recrimination against his senior advisers, moves the party closer to backing a people\u2019s vote. But it does not go quite far enough to satisfy the demands of those in the party who want full backing for a second referendum to be held without delay \u2013 and a commitment that the party will campaign on the remain side. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was among the Corbyn allies who hardened their position, saying on Monday that a second referendum was inevitable because Tory MPs would not back an election. Asked whether it was time to support a second referendum in any circumstances, McDonnell said: \u201cI think it is, yes.\u201d He added: \u201cOur only option now is to go back to the people in a referendum and that is the position we\u2019re in now.\u201d Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, also called for a clearer position in favour of a people\u2019s vote on Brexit in light of the European election results. Starmer said a second referendum was the \u201conly way to break the Brexit impasse\u201d with a \u201ccredible leave option and remain\u201d, while Thornberry said: \u201cI fear we will have no deal and we must be clear it will be a disaster for the country so we must have a second referendum.\u201d In the European elections, Labour was left with just 14.6% of the vote share, and halved its MEPs to 10. Overall, it fell into third place behind the Brexit party and Liberal Democrats, dropping to fifth position with no MEPs in Scotland and coming behind Plaid Cymru in Wales for the first time in a national poll. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh Labour leader and first minister, said the party in Wales now wanted a second referendum and would back a remain vote. Pressure on Corbyn also came from Tom Watson, the deputy leader, who has given his backing to grassroots groups demanding a ballot of all members or a special conference to formally shift the position, as he believes the party cannot wait until its autumn conference to fully support a second referendum. This would have to be granted by the national executive committee (NEC). A People\u2019s Vote source said the idea of a ballot of members ought to focus the leadership\u2019s attention, saying: \u201cThat threat is there and Jeremy could avoid the kind of summer-long party split that would end up in humiliation \u2013 if he moves fast now.\u201d Paul Mason, the Corbyn-supporting journalist, also backed a Left 2030 petition for a ballot of members and in a Guardian article called for \u201cthe officials who designed this fiasco, and ignored all evidence that it would lead to disaster, [to] be removed from positions of influence\u201d. Labour insiders said Corbyn was keen to avoid being forced into a new position by a damaging public row caused by a members\u2019 ballot but they described the leader as still somewhat torn over the issue as many of his closest advisers and shadow cabinet ministers are in favour of respecting the referendum result. On the calls to remove Corbyn\u2019s advisers, one source close to the Labour leadership said: \u201cThere is absolutely no way they\u2019ll be successful. And they are going for the wrong people. Jeremy\u2019s view is influenced more by the shadow cabinet \u2013 people like Jon Trickett, Dan Carden. It is majority leavers.\u201d A number of Labour MPs who represent leave constituencies are also anxious about backing a second referendum, with Gloria De Piero urging colleagues not to let a second referendum \u201cwreck\u201d the Labour party. She warned a move to such a policy of overriding the 2016 result \u201cwould be an effective ending of Labour\u2019s historic coalition of working-class, middle-class, city and non-city voters.\u201d Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, went so far as to accuse some of those calling for a second referendum of trying to whip up a coup against the leadership. \u201cLabour has been the only party that has sought to unite the nation on Brexit and this is an honourable objective that must not be abandoned,\u201d he said. In a veiled dig at Watson, his old adversary, McCluskey said: \u201cFaced now with the serious prospect of a no-deal Tory prime minister, Labour must stay united and show the country that it is ready to lead. There are some rushing to advance other agendas but are doing so to undermine Jeremy Corbyn. They will be seen for what they are and never forgiven by the members.\u201d One shadow minister said the leadership was \u201cracked by paranoia about plots\u201d but the truth was that the membership actually wanted to change the policy rather than the leader. \u201cThere is a war going on,\u201d the shadow minister said. \u201cThere are people around Jeremy doing everything possible to stop the policy going to a full second referendum.
