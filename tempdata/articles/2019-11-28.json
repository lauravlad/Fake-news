Overall pitch Berry: Only the Greens will put the climate and biodiversity crises at the very top of the government\u2019s priorities, and other parties are only taking these issues seriously now because the Greens have won the argument. Corbyn: Unlike the Tories, Labour has a climate plan and it will create huge numbers of jobs in a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d encompassing offshore wind farms, housing upgrades, nationalised railways and energy, and a lot of new trees. Price: The Plaid Cymru leader made a strong pitch that Wales has been neglected by Westminster governments handing out infrastructure investment, which is vital to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sturgeon: Scotland is already a leader in onshore and offshore wind, and could go much further in renewable energy generation, as well as tree-planting and nature conservation. Swinson: The Liberal Democrats have traditionally been the strongest on green issues among the three main parties but have struggled to regain lost ground after taking part in the coalition, which failed to fulfil its promise to be \u201cthe greenest government ever\u201d. Swinson\u2019s commitments, for instance on achieving net zero only five years before the Tories, looked less impressive when compared with other parties. Best line Berry: The Greens have had the climate at the top of their agenda for years while the others are just catching up, Berry pointed out: \u201cDo you trust them to get this done without more Greens in parliament?\u201d Corbyn: \u201cThis election is the last chance to tackle our climate emergency.\u201d Corbyn did a good job of showing that he knows the issues, even if he didn\u2019t have answers for all of them. Price: \u201cAfter Scotland, Wales has the best resources [for renewable energy]. Wales was the cradle of the industrial revolution \u2013 and can be of the next one.\u201d The country famous for coal can generate renewable energy and green jobs. Sturgeon: \u201cCOP26 will be in Glasgow \u2013 Scotland will be leading the way.\u201d Next year, a international conference called COP26, where governments from every country will gather to determine the fate of the Paris climate agreement, will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. Sturgeon made it clear she will make the most of that international stage, and the Tories may regret their decision to award host status to the city. Swinson: Pointed out that small contributions by individuals are not enough \u2013 we need systemic change, and only politicians can achieve that. \u201cMaking it easier and cheaper to make the right thing, so it becomes the obvious decision to make.\u201d Strategy Berry: This debate was one for the Greens to shine, so in response to any commitment made by other parties \u2013 on how soon to reach net-zero carbon, on how much money to invest, on how to protect nature \u2013 Berry\u2019s trump card was that the Greens would go further and faster. Corbyn: Labour put the \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d at the top of its manifesto, and Corbyn has a personal image for green living, from his allotment to his self-professed \u201cmiserable-ness\u201d in refusing to turn on the heating. Corbyn would also seek international cooperation on the global problem of the climate. Price: Stressed Wales\u2019s potential contribution and future growth from renewable energy. Sturgeon: Scotland has a strong story on renewable energy. Just don\u2019t mention North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: Frequent flyer levy on anyone taking more than three international return flights a year. Worst moment Berry: Failed to explain why scrapping HS2 was a good idea, when calling for less flying. Corbyn: Defending nationalisation of the electricity grid, which Price suggested would divert investment from renewables, by claiming it would be easier to sell biogas back into the grid. Price: A rather feeble brag of claiming green credentials for changing his reusable nappies for his newborn son. Sturgeon: Refusing to directly address the question of North Sea oil and gas, preferring vague references to a \u201cjust transition\u201d to low-carbon jobs. Swinson: Floundering while trying to explain why the Lib Dems\u2019 target of net zero by 2045 was so much better than the Tories\u2019 2050 target. Unanswered questions Berry: Is it realistic to borrow \u00a31tn over the next decade? Corbyn: Does the party back Heathrow expansion, which half of Labour MPs voted for, and nuclear power? Price: Can Wales make the transition from a former coal-based economy to low-carbon industry? Sturgeon: North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: The Lib Dem record in the coalition. Verdict Berry: Berry showed a depth of familiarity with the issues that is her party\u2019s key selling point. Corbyn: Believable on these issues, and with a strong manifesto on the green industrial revolution. Price: Hammered home the point that Wales\u2019s potential has been overlooked and undermined by Westminster. Sturgeon: SNP are comfortable on renewables and the natural environment, less so on the North Sea. Swinson: Struggling to reclaim what used to be an easy win for the Lib Dems in being one of the greenest parties \u2013 now looking outflanked by Labour.

A second ice sculpture took the place of Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1200112941170937859\">who also refused to take part</a>.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives accused the broadcaster of bias for not allowing Michael Gove to take Johnson\u2019s place, accusing them of \u201cconspiring\u201d with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to block the party from making their case.</p> \n<p>Gove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence.</p> \n<p>The opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/eu-parliament-declares-climate-emergency\">urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</a>.</p> \n<p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Si\u00e2n Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be \u201csiloed\u201d.</p> \n<p>The leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis. All pushed manifesto commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by dates from 2030 to 2045, a few years before the Conservatives\u2019 pledge for net zero by 2050.</p> \n<p>The expansion of Heathrow airport \u2013 passed by MPs last year \u2013 and the HS2 rail link were all discussed.</p> \n<p>Si\u00e2n Berry, the Green party leader said they were the only party who wanted to cancel HS2. She said more than half of Labour MPs voted for Heathrow Expansion while the SNP abstained. She said a minority of people took most flights and should be targeted.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe question now is how we share out the flights that we can take more fairly. It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,\u201d said Berry.</p> \n<p>Challenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: \u201cDo people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,\u201d said Sturgeon.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>More than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets.</p> \n<p>Corbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: \u201cWe can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson\u2019s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part. But on Thursday night, Stanley Johnson \u2013 who was present at the studio \u2013 said Channel 4 should have let Gove debate, saying he \u201cwould have made a big, big contribution\u201d.</p> \n<p>He insisted that Gove\u2019s appearance at the studios had not been a stunt, saying that the Conservatives had been given the impression that he could appear. Johnson showed journalists a text message from the prime minister saying: \u201cGove on!\u201d</p> \n<p>On leaving, Gove was confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist, Izzy Warren, about Johnson\u2019s failure to attend and the Tories\u2019 green policies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2b530aa2-8581-4c2e-a8f7-f2ec2533945a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yIoNUVt1RRM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian, Izzy said: \u201cI asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn\u2019t here today.\u201d</p> \n<p>He told her that it shouldn\u2019t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. \u201cThis is a party that has been in power for 10 years and we haven\u2019t seen climate action,\u201d she said.<br><br>Asked if he looked surprised, she added: \u201cI think older men, quite frankly, aren\u2019t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The scale of the task facing any new government was made clear this week when scientists warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/27/climate-emergency-world-may-have-crossed-tipping-points\">the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points</a>, resulting in \u201ca state of planetary emergency\u201d.</p> \n<p>To meet net-zero targets by 2050, analysts say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/28/uk-needs-billions-a-year-to-meet-2050-climate-targets\">would need as much as \u00a320bn a year in investment to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide</a> from the atmosphere. </p> \n<p>Sturgeon was challenged on her failure to support the Green party call for the decommissioning of oil rigs in fossil fuel rich Scotland. </p> \n<p>\u201cIf we were to stop tomorrow in terms of oil production, we would make ourselves more reliant on imports so that transition has got to be done in a way which decreases our emissions,\u201d Sturgeon said.</p> \n<p>Swinson, who is promising an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, linked the fight to tackle climate change to Brexit. \u201cBrexit is a climate crime, it is morally wrong to leave our seat at the table and give away our influence to create change,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Price said there was no choice but to cut to net zero by 2030: \u201cWe have the technology now to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 what is lacking is the political will.\u201d</p> \n<p><br></p>",

Gove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence. The opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Si\u00e2n Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate. Johnson\u2019s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be \u201csiloed\u201d. The leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis.

It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,\u201d said Berry. Challenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: \u201cDo people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.\u201d \u201cWhere flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,\u201d said Sturgeon. The Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper. \u201cI think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,\u201d he said. More than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets. Corbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: \u201cWe can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.\u201d Hundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson\u2019s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part. But on Thursday night, Stanley Johnson \u2013 who was present at the studio \u2013 said Channel 4 should have let Gove debate, saying he \u201cwould have made a big, big contribution\u201d. He insisted that Gove\u2019s appearance at the studios had not been a stunt, saying that the Conservatives had been given the impression that he could appear. Johnson showed journalists a text message from the prime minister saying: \u201cGove on!\u201d On leaving, Gove was confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist, Izzy Warren, about Johnson\u2019s failure to attend and the Tories\u2019 green policies. Speaking to the Guardian, Izzy said: \u201cI asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn\u2019t here today.\u201d He told her that it shouldn\u2019t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. \u201cThis is a party that has been in power for 10 years and we haven\u2019t seen climate action,\u201d she said. Asked if he looked surprised, she added: \u201cI think older men, quite frankly, aren\u2019t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.\u201d The scale of the task facing any new government was made clear this week when scientists warned that the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points, resulting in \u201ca state of planetary emergency\u201d. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, analysts say, would need as much as \u00a320bn a year in investment to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Sturgeon was challenged on her failure to support the Green party call for the decommissioning of oil rigs in fossil fuel rich Scotland. \u201cIf we were to stop tomorrow in terms of oil production, we would make ourselves more reliant on imports so that transition has got to be done in a way which decreases our emissions,\u201d Sturgeon said. Swinson, who is promising an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, linked the fight to tackle climate change to Brexit. \u201cBrexit is a climate crime, it is morally wrong to leave our seat at the table and give away our influence to create change,\u201d she said. Price said there was no choice but to cut to net zero by 2030: \u201cWe have the technology now to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 what is lacking is the political will.\u201d",

It wasn\u2019t any of the individual leaders, who all put their best foot forward, though weren\u2019t without their less appealing moments.</p> \n<p>It was the magnificent insufficiency of politics, all its conventions, all its rubric, in the face of this disaster. There is nothing like watching five people who fundamentally agree \u2013 who all believe the science, who all want to see children grow up into a liveable world, who all see this as the most pressing challenge humanity could face \u2013 try to suck endless arguments out of who believes it the most, and whose track record shows them in the best light, that makes you doubt our collective ability to fix this, or indeed, anything.</p> \n<p>Green co-leader Sian Berry was superb at points, but there was this lacuna where her honest opinion should have been. Maybe never before or after, but at this point in time, a serious Green would be asking people to stop a Conservative majority \u2013 which would not, even with Swinsonian delusion, involve voting Green, except in two or three places in the country.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Corbyn momentarily rehumanised himself by admitting that he was too miserable to turn the central heating on, but was forced by the invisible hand of political normalcy to attack the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon.</p> \n<p>Adam Price asserted Plaid Cymru\u2019s determination to halt the third runway in Heathrow and HS2, which realistically they could only ever do as handmaidens to a Labour government, which will involve cooperating, so why not start cooperating now?</p> \n<p>Sturgeon paraded her green credentials as the party of government in Scotland, but it was ridiculous; of course she\u2019s planted 22m trees and what\u2019s everyone else done? She\u2019s in government!</p> \n<p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson made her opening statement about Brexit, which far from sounding like a gestalt answer to all British politics, made her look as though she could only see any issue for its political advantage.</p> \n<p>They all say what we need is systems change, but their adversarial parade that stands in for discussion is one of the systems that needs to change first.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alice-bell\">Alice Bell</a>: No one seemed to grasp the challenge of decarbonising heat</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"033492cf160bd3b7c3440a1ad51dad21bbd93f37\"> \n <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/11/28/Alice_Bell.png\" alt=\"Alice Bell\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Overall, it was a reasonably positive hour of political telly. There was very little point-scoring, and time to get into some juicy details without wasting precious minutes just shouting Brexit soundbites at each other.</p> \n<p>Still, the danger was that it would be boring. Do these parties have anything very much to argue about when it comes climate and nature? It turns out they did.</p> \n<p>Labour and the SNP both came in for criticism over airport expansion. Everyone wriggled a bit when it came to questions about food, seemingly scared of upsetting farmers and meat-eaters, and no one really seemed to grasp the challenge of decarbonising heat, or was willing to admit how disruptive it might to our homes or how much it might cost, despite some excellent probing from Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Plus there was the predictable spat over whether 2030, 2045 or 2050 was a good target for net zero carbon emissions (when arguably the important thing is what we do now).</p> \n<p>The other leaders ganged up on Labour a bit over nuclear. But the party that really needed more attention was the Conservatives. In fact it took nearly half an hour before anyone mentioned them. And as a result, their record wasn\u2019t examined, and it needed to be.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, if Johnson wants to lead us through the vital next five years, we need to publicly scrutinise what he plans to do. In many ways the ice sculptures that stood in for the Tory and Brexit party leaders were genius, and I hope the image of them dripping haunts those who didn\u2019t turn up. But I worry they left Johnson in particular off the hook. Channel 4 might have been better served filling his empty chair with a fact-checkers tasked with examining the Conservative record on each of the topics raised instead.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Alice Bell is co-director of climate charity Possible</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnvidal\">John Vidal</a>: There was surprising harmony and politeness</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"467b1b7e5bed2ac258cc77323059a616018da7d9\"> \n <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/11/28/John_Vidal.png\" alt=\"John Vidal\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Hours after the European parliament declared a climate emergency, a day after scientists warned that we are close to irreversible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/27/climate-emergency-world-may-have-crossed-tipping-points\">climate disaster</a>, and a week before the start of the most important UN climate meeting since 2015, the man most likely to be prime minister ducked out of a debate about what most people understand is the most important issue of the age.</p> \n<p>Well, wouldn\u2019t you if you had shafted solar power, backed fracking, said concern for climate change was primitive fear, banned wind power on land and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/21/dear-extinction-rebellion-aims-worthy-take-pink-boat-china-instead/\">called</a> young protesters \u201csmug, irritating and disruptive\u201d?</p> \n<p>It didn\u2019t matter.

      "bodyText": "Zoe Williams: It showed the insufficiency of politics in the face of this disaster The climate change debate left me mournful: it wasn\u2019t the montage of environmental emergency that opened it, though if I never heard the sound of a koala in pain again, that would be a-OK. It wasn\u2019t any of the individual leaders, who all put their best foot forward, though weren\u2019t without their less appealing moments. It was the magnificent insufficiency of politics, all its conventions, all its rubric, in the face of this disaster. There is nothing like watching five people who fundamentally agree \u2013 who all believe the science, who all want to see children grow up into a liveable world, who all see this as the most pressing challenge humanity could face \u2013 try to suck endless arguments out of who believes it the most, and whose track record shows them in the best light, that makes you doubt our collective ability to fix this, or indeed, anything. Green co-leader Sian Berry was superb at points, but there was this lacuna where her honest opinion should have been. Maybe never before or after, but at this point in time, a serious Green would be asking people to stop a Conservative majority \u2013 which would not, even with Swinsonian delusion, involve voting Green, except in two or three places in the country. Jeremy Corbyn momentarily rehumanised himself by admitting that he was too miserable to turn the central heating on, but was forced by the invisible hand of political normalcy to attack the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon. Adam Price asserted Plaid Cymru\u2019s determination to halt the third runway in Heathrow and HS2, which realistically they could only ever do as handmaidens to a Labour government, which will involve cooperating, so why not start cooperating now? Sturgeon paraded her green credentials as the party of government in Scotland, but it was ridiculous; of course she\u2019s planted 22m trees and what\u2019s everyone else done? She\u2019s in government! Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson made her opening statement about Brexit, which far from sounding like a gestalt answer to all British politics, made her look as though she could only see any issue for its political advantage. They all say what we need is systems change, but their adversarial parade that stands in for discussion is one of the systems that needs to change first. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Alice Bell: No one seemed to grasp the challenge of decarbonising heat Overall, it was a reasonably positive hour of political telly. There was very little point-scoring, and time to get into some juicy details without wasting precious minutes just shouting Brexit soundbites at each other. Still, the danger was that it would be boring. Do these parties have anything very much to argue about when it comes climate and nature? It turns out they did. Labour and the SNP both came in for criticism over airport expansion. Everyone wriggled a bit when it came to questions about food, seemingly scared of upsetting farmers and meat-eaters, and no one really seemed to grasp the challenge of decarbonising heat, or was willing to admit how disruptive it might to our homes or how much it might cost, despite some excellent probing from Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Plus there was the predictable spat over whether 2030, 2045 or 2050 was a good target for net zero carbon emissions (when arguably the important thing is what we do now). The other leaders ganged up on Labour a bit over nuclear. But the party that really needed more attention was the Conservatives. In fact it took nearly half an hour before anyone mentioned them. And as a result, their record wasn\u2019t examined, and it needed to be. Ultimately, if Johnson wants to lead us through the vital next five years, we need to publicly scrutinise what he plans to do. In many ways the ice sculptures that stood in for the Tory and Brexit party leaders were genius, and I hope the image of them dripping haunts those who didn\u2019t turn up. But I worry they left Johnson in particular off the hook. Channel 4 might have been better served filling his empty chair with a fact-checkers tasked with examining the Conservative record on each of the topics raised instead. \u2022 Alice Bell is co-director of climate charity Possible John Vidal: There was surprising harmony and politeness Hours after the European parliament declared a climate emergency, a day after scientists warned that we are close to irreversible climate disaster, and a week before the start of the most important UN climate meeting since 2015, the man most likely to be prime minister ducked out of a debate about what most people understand is the most important issue of the age. Well, wouldn\u2019t you if you had shafted solar power, backed fracking, said concern for climate change was primitive fear, banned wind power on land and called young protesters \u201csmug, irritating and disruptive\u201d? It didn\u2019t matter. His place was taken by a melting ice cube and his non-existence was treated like an embarrassing smell coming off the Arctic permafrost. Without Tory bluster, and with sensible questions from Krishnan Guru-Murthy, there was surprising harmony and politeness, with the five leaders often competing to agree with each other, with cries of \u201cabsolutely\u201d, and \u201cof course\u201d \u2013 the kind you get from people who have just woken to the fact that buses, soil, trees and lagging is really, really interesting and important and that the fate of the world has been totally ignored for too long. Yes, there was old thinking. No one committed to ruling out new roads or airport expansions. Jo Swinson seemed astonished that houses in Yorkshire could be made warm in November without heating. Corbyn still warmed to nuclear. But there was much more of the new. Adam Price of Plaid Cyrmu promised to turn to reusable nappies and Corbyn promised to plant 2bn trees in 10 years. But the overriding impression was of leaders with a modicum of vision of a new industrial revolution, with new thinking about the land and a new agenda to push. \u201cIs any of this real?\u201d cried Krishnan Guru-Murthy. \u201cIt\u2019s progress,\u201d said Sian Berry, a Green co-leader, delighted to see her party\u2019s ideas finally in the mainstream. But the ice cube had by then probably melted. \u2022 John Vidal is the Guardian\u2019s former environment editor Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan: The leaders should have joined together to condemn the absence of Boris Johnson When writing snap reactions to political debates, one is usually expected to pick a winner. But I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you which leader won the climate debate as it was so esoteric and interminably boring I found it hard to focus.

Following predictions that Boris Johnson will reap a comfortable majority and Labour briefing that it will make more efforts to woo leave supporters, Tory sources said their main concern was that \u201cinertia\u201d could descend upon voters. \u201cIf the polls are wrong by a few points, and they have been wrong before, we end up with a hung parliament. Our team know that, and now we have to convince the public. There should be no complacency or let-up or change of direction. We will continue with our central messages: get Brexit done, more hospitals, more nurses, more police,\u201d a senior party source said. A seat-by-seat YouGov poll on Wednesday predicted that the Conservatives would win 359 seats, Labour 211, the SNP 43 and the Liberal Democrats 13 if the election were held immediately. That result would give Johnson a majority of 68, making gains at Labour\u2019s expense in the Midlands and north of England. Labour would suffer its second-worst postwar defeat, with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s total two above Michael Foot\u2019s in 1983. The Guardian understands that Labour\u2019s key strategists recognise that they now have much more to do to hold constituencies in Brexit-voting areas. They plan to present a pared-down set of manifesto commitments that will offer to put money directly in the pockets of voters in these constituencies. Shadow ministers from leave constituencies are expected to be given more prominence at election events. The prime minister\u2019s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, told the Conservatives to expect a drop in support before the election. In a lengthy blogpost, the former Vote Leave strategist wrote: \u201cYou will see many polls in the coming days. Some will say Boris will win. Trust me, as someone who has worked on lots of campaigns, things are MUCH tighter than they seem and there is a very real possibility of a hung parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a majority, the nightmare continues. ALL other MPs will gang together to stop Brexit and give EU citizens the vote. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d An analysis by the pressure group Best for Britain found that Johnson could be deprived of a Commons majority if just 117,000 people voted tactically to defeat the Tories. Conservative strategists said they were planning more \u201cget Brexit done\u201d set-pieces next week, believing that the message has been central to their current position in the polls. This will be followed by announcements on defence policy in preparation for the 70th anniversary of Nato in London on 3 December. \u201cIt will be an opportunity to show Corbyn\u2019s weakness on Trident and the armed forces with traditional Labour voters,\u201d said a Conservative party source. Party officials remained bullish about the possible appearance of more Labour leave shadow ministers during the campaign. \u201cIf the answer is Ian Lavery, you are asking the wrong question,\u201d said one. The party is braced for Donald Trump\u2019s two-day visit for the Nato summit which begins on 2 December. The US president\u2019s arrival will prompt further questions about Washington\u2019s expectations regarding access to the NHS in any future trade deal. A firm supporter of Brexit, Trump is expected to praise the UK\u2019s decision on the trip, and to attract protests and controversy. One Tory official said Johnson\u2019s team were \u201cbraced\u201d for his arrival during an election campaign. During his last visit, Trump alarmed his British hosts by criticising the way Theresa May was conducting the Brexit negotiations in an interview with the Sun.",

On Wednesday Nicola Sturgeon railed against Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s failure to deal with antisemitism when she launched her party\u2019s manifesto in Glasgow. It is alleged Hanvey, a former SNP group leader on Fife council, circulated an article from the Kremlin-backed news agency Sputnik in August 2016 about the Hungarian financier George Soros, illustrated with an image showing him holding puppets of world leaders. In a statement issued via his Twitter account, Hanvey issued an \u201cunequivocal apology\u201d for posting two items which he now realised were offensive, inappropriate and \u201cdreadful errors of judgment\u201d. He said he fully supported the SNP\u2019s decision to remove him as its candidate and suspend his party membership pending investigation. Laird was widely expected to be the most senior Scottish Labour casualty of the election. Opinion polls have shown Labour\u2019s support in Scotland has plummeted, with one poll released on Thursday by Ipsos Mori for STV putting its support at 16%, far behind the SNP on 44%. A YouGov poll for the Times on Wednesday predicted Labour would hold two of its seven Westminster seats \u2013 Edinburgh South and Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. The SNP said it had consulted Jewish community leaders about the handling of the case. It is unable to replace Hanvey as its official candidate as his name is now on the ballot paper. Nominations closed on 14 November. The Scottish Greens said their candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, Scott Rutherford, had been endorsed by the pro-independence campaign Yes Kirkcaldy as after Hanvey\u2019s suspension. The Scottish Greens have been the SNP\u2019s closest allies in the independence movement. Rutherford said this meant he was now the best candidate to challenge Labour in the seat, where his party has never before stood in a Westminster election.",

Officials were expected to hand over the report on Monday, days before Britain\u2019s first general election leaders\u2019 debate on the climate crisis, after the information tribunal ruled it was in the public interest to disclose its findings in full. The Cabinet Office is understood to have received the tribunal\u2019s order to release the documents on 28 October after a multi-year battle with Greenpeace, but by Thursday evening the government had yet to hand over the 2016 report or give an explanation for ignoring the court order. Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: \u201cThe Tories\u2019 failure to publish this crucial report on fracking shows contempt for democracy and serves as a stark warning on what lies ahead if Boris Johnson is re-elected.\u201d Labour said the government\u2019s refusal to reveal the documents cast doubt over its commitment to end fracking in England, weeks after it declared a fracking moratorium in the run-up to the election. \u201cLabour will ban fracking, expand the Freedom of Information Act and introduce tough new transparency rules,\u201d Trickett added. Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said the government was \u201cignoring the courts in order to avoid scrutiny of this dangerous and dirty industry\u201d. The campaign group uncovered some of the report\u2019s findings last year through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request but its investigations arm was barred by Cabinet Office officials from obtaining the full report. The FoI revealed that government ministers had known for years that fracking companies had exaggerated the economic benefits of the UK shale gas boom. It showed that only 4% of the UK\u2019s potential shale projects were likely to go ahead, contradicting public claims that a shale revolution could spur \u00a333bn of investment and create more than 64,000 jobs. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what further revelations are in the report they\u2019re still hiding, but the government are clearly very keen that the public don\u2019t find out, which makes it all the more important that we do,\u201d Parr said. As part of its ruling, the information tribunal said it had noted \u201can unfortunate tendency\u201d on the part of the Cabinet Office to be content to release positive information about the fracking industry but \u201canxious to withhold more negative information\u201d. \u201cIt is no secret that the government supported the development of the industry and the report was designed to address how the government could help it to develop; it was in our view in the public interest that the public should know how far officials were suggesting government might go in doing so,\u201d it said. It is understood the Cabinet Office will comply with the ruling in due course. It declined to comment on the reason behind the delay. Boris Johnson snubbed the leaders\u2019 debate on the climate, which was due to take place on Thursday evening.",

They\u2019ve missed the 4D chess. They\u2019ve fallen for a classic piece of misdirection. Remember: it\u2019s never a cock-up, it\u2019s always a conspiracy. Previously a fairly precise term of political arcana \u2013 it was a Lynton Crosby fave \u2013 the dead cat\u2019s most enthusiastic adopters have now decided it can mean anything that distracts from bad news.</p> \n<p>And this is the great felinicide election, where everything is judged by some keyboard Metternich to be a deliberate and masterful distraction from something else. Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s repulsive Grenfell comments were a dead cat, apparently. They\u2019re trying to divert you from the fact they haven\u2019t released the Russia report! They\u2019re trying to hoodwink you into stopping watching Corbyn\u2019s Andrew Neil interview! They\u2019re trying to draw your eye away from them doing a black Friday deal on the NHS!

But now, \u201cdead cat\u201d is the go-to political buzzphrase of every armchair campaign strategist who can\u2019t wait to tell anyone paying attention to almost any part of this election that they should in fact be paying attention to something completely different. They\u2019ve missed the 4D chess. They\u2019ve fallen for a classic piece of misdirection. Remember: it\u2019s never a cock-up, it\u2019s always a conspiracy. Previously a fairly precise term of political arcana \u2013 it was a Lynton Crosby fave \u2013 the dead cat\u2019s most enthusiastic adopters have now decided it can mean anything that distracts from bad news. And this is the great felinicide election, where everything is judged by some keyboard Metternich to be a deliberate and masterful distraction from something else. Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s repulsive Grenfell comments were a dead cat, apparently. They\u2019re trying to divert you from the fact they haven\u2019t released the Russia report! They\u2019re trying to hoodwink you into stopping watching Corbyn\u2019s Andrew Neil interview! They\u2019re trying to draw your eye away from them doing a black Friday deal on the NHS!

      "body": "<p>Tonight, Channel 4 will host the first ever election debate on the climate crisis. All of the major party leaders have confirmed their attendance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/boris-johnson-election-leaders-debate-climate-crisis\" title=\"\">save for Boris Johnson</a> and Nigel Farage. The Brexit party doesn\u2019t have a climate platform, so that squares, but Johnson would be a curious absence. The Conservative government recently passed a commitment to reach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\">net-zero emissions by 2050</a>; the party\u2019s manifesto repeats that pledge, and includes new spending for environment and climate policies. Until now, the Tories haven\u2019t seemed afraid to talk climate.</p> <p>This distinguishes them from other rightwing parties in the English-speaking world. The US and Australia especially seem doomed to forever re-fight the climate denial battles of the mid-00s \u2013 witness <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1090074254010404864\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s tweets</a> about cold weather contradicting \u201cglobal warming\u201d, or the now Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, triumphantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/feb/09/scott-morrison-brings-a-chunk-of-coal-into-parliament-video\" title=\"\">brandishing a chunk of coal</a> in parliament.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>New denialism isn\u2019t anti-science specifically \u2013 it\u2019s a reactionary project, which seeks to uphold or re-assert the status- quo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in the UK, since they overwhelmingly supported the 2008 Climate Change Act, the Tories seem to have come around and fully accepted the science. No one in the party openly questions the link between carbon emissions and warming, or the need for action. Its once-vocal science denier fringe has been almost entirely silenced, or, like former minister Ann Widdecombe, decamped to the Brexit party.</p> <p>But it should be clear to us now that it is possible for leaders to accept the scientific consensus, attend the meetings, meet the activists, nod gravely, sign the pledges and then effectively do nothing.

      "bodyText": "Tonight, Channel 4 will host the first ever election debate on the climate crisis. All of the major party leaders have confirmed their attendance, save for Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. The Brexit party doesn\u2019t have a climate platform, so that squares, but Johnson would be a curious absence. The Conservative government recently passed a commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050; the party\u2019s manifesto repeats that pledge, and includes new spending for environment and climate policies. Until now, the Tories haven\u2019t seemed afraid to talk climate. This distinguishes them from other rightwing parties in the English-speaking world. The US and Australia especially seem doomed to forever re-fight the climate denial battles of the mid-00s \u2013 witness Donald Trump\u2019s tweets about cold weather contradicting \u201cglobal warming\u201d, or the now Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, triumphantly brandishing a chunk of coal in parliament. But in the UK, since they overwhelmingly supported the 2008 Climate Change Act, the Tories seem to have come around and fully accepted the science. No one in the party openly questions the link between carbon emissions and warming, or the need for action. Its once-vocal science denier fringe has been almost entirely silenced, or, like former minister Ann Widdecombe, decamped to the Brexit party. But it should be clear to us now that it is possible for leaders to accept the scientific consensus, attend the meetings, meet the activists, nod gravely, sign the pledges and then effectively do nothing. It\u2019s time to ask whether this approach is really a marked improvement on denying the climate crisis altogether. There is a term currently floating around activist circles, \u201cnew denialism\u201d. This is attached to ways of thinking that acknowledge the reality of climate change, but don\u2019t lead to what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls the \u201crapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\u201d needed to avoid 1.5C warming. New denialism accepts the basic atmospheric science, but rejects the immense volume of further scientific work suggesting that we can change things \u2013 either because it would be too disruptive to our current way of life, or to the way we\u2019ve organised our economy. It can seem like a vague category: it encompasses over-cautious incremental policies and tepid market-based solutions; insistence that some not-yet-existing technology will emerge to wipe out our carbon debts; and even arguments that we\u2019re too far gone, and should focus our efforts on adaptation. These all acknowledge the problem, but reject the solutions that scientists insist on: immediate, radical reductions in carbon emissions. This seems markedly less evil than the cartoon-villain propaganda of climate science deniers. And at close range it is. But any future moral accounting of the climate crisis is unlikely to distinguish bad faith from good intentions; rather it will be weighed in megatonnes of carbon, which hit another all-time high this year. As the academics Philip Mirowski, Jeremy Walker and Antoinette Abboud noted in 2013, the thinktanks behind climate denial never thought they would win the war of ideas with academic science \u2013 they simply wanted to stall for as long as they could anything that would threaten the interests of the fossil fuel industry. Seen this way, new denialism isn\u2019t anti-science specifically \u2013 it\u2019s a reactionary project, which seeks to uphold or reassert the status quo. And if denialism is about stopping action, then anything that needlessly obstructs action is denial. Ultimately, then, there\u2019s no fundamental difference between outright denialism and new denialism.

      "bodyText": "Everyone is wondering whether, after refusing to take part in Channel 4\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate, Boris Johnson is now going to avoid being scrutinised by Andrew Neil. I have some experience on this front: last week I was informed that the prime minister would not be turning up to a local hustings in his constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where I am running as the Labour candidate. In stark contrast to former Tory prime ministers Theresa May and David Cameron, who attended local hustings in 2017 and 2015, Johnson would \u201cnot be available\u201d, while the local Conservative Association was \u201cnot minded to send a substitute\u201d, according to an email I received from the reverend of St Andrew\u2019s church. That particular event has now been cancelled. Another one is scheduled for 5 December, but the prime minister has told organisers he won\u2019t be turning up for that either. He is denying his constituents the occasion to question, critique and evaluate their candidates side by side. On the one hand, Johnson\u2019s arrogant absence is fitting: he has never been there for the people of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. When the critical children\u2019s ward at Hillingdon hospital was forced to close because the \u201cbuilding was falling apart\u201d, he had nothing to offer. As locals demanded the right to breathe clean air through a categorical commitment to stop Heathrow expansion, he flew off to Afghanistan and avoided the parliamentary vote on the issue. When we begged that he address the cuts to youth services that have starved young people of the social support they need, leaving them vulnerable to violence \u2013 as shown by tragic stabbing after stabbing in our constituency \u2013 he offered little but condolences. Johnson was parachuted into Uxbridge. This area I grew up in and studied in, and where I live and work today, was a mere stepping-stone to power for him. Some of us knew this at the time of his arrival, but the reality of it has dawned upon many more since. On more than one occasion residents have told us they had hoped Boris Johnson would leave for a \u201csafer\u201d Conservative seat, as rumoured earlier in the election campaign.

The Conservatives came second from bottom, scoring only 7 points, ahead only of the Brexit party on a single point.</p> <p>Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cSome parties clearly recognise that [global heating] is an emergency and have included policies with the ambition needed to meet the scale of the challenge in front of us. But some have failed to adequately prepare.\u201d</p> <p>She said voters were engaged on green issues in the election: \u201cWith environmental concerns rocketing up the public and political agenda, voters want to know what politicians plan to do to get us out of this mess and seize the opportunity for a greener and fairer future. Our ranking exposes their policies for all to see, allowing people to make an informed decision on 12 December.\u201d</p> <p>In June, one of the last acts of Theresa May as Conservative prime minister was to commit the UK to reaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\">net zero carbon emissions by 2050 </a>, one of the first major economies to do so.

      "bodyText": "The climate emergency merits a mere 10 mentions in the Conservative manifesto, despite being rated as one of the most pressing issues by voters, a Guardian analysis has found. Labour and the Liberal Democrats devote large portions of their manifestos to the issue, with Labour giving its plans for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d top billing ahead of high-profile concerns such as the NHS and Brexit. Both parties refer to the climate 59 times, while the Scottish National party makes 33 references. The Conservative Party document is the shortest of the four manifestos analysed. But even when the mentions are counted as a proportion of the total word count, Johnson\u2019s party still falls far behind the opposition parties. The SNP mentions climate at three times the rate of the Tories, while Labour and the Lib Dems mention it almost five times as often. The way in which the parties refer to the climate emergency varies across the four policy documents. Despite parliament unanimously declaring a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d in May, the Conservative party prefers to use the term \u201cclimate change\u201d. The SNP uses \u201cclimate change\u201d 22 times compared to seven for \u201cclimate emergency\u201d. Both Labour and the Lib Dems refer to a climate \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201ccrisis\u201d more often than \u201cclimate change\u201d. The Conservatives also use the terms \u201cenvironment\u201d and \u201cenvironmental\u201d at a lesser rate than either Labour or the Liberal Democrats. Boris Johnson, the Conservative leader, has refused to take part in a leaders\u2019 debate on the climate to be broadcast by Channel 4 news on Thursday evening, with the broadcaster possibly presenting an \u201cempty chair\u201d in his place. Separate to the Guardian\u2019s analysis, Greenpeace has conducted its own scorecard on the main parties\u2019 environmental commitments. The group\u2019s ranking found the Green party topping the list when its commitments to invest in a green economy, reduce emissions from energy, preserve nature and show global leadership on environmental issues were taken into account. The Greens scored 19 out of a possible 20 for the scale and breadth of its pledges, in the Greenpeace ranking. Labour came second in the Greenpeace ranking with 16 points, just nudging the Lib Dems into third place with 15. The Conservatives came second from bottom, scoring only 7 points, ahead only of the Brexit party on a single point. Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cSome parties clearly recognise that [global heating] is an emergency and have included policies with the ambition needed to meet the scale of the challenge in front of us. But some have failed to adequately prepare.\u201d She said voters were engaged on green issues in the election: \u201cWith environmental concerns rocketing up the public and political agenda, voters want to know what politicians plan to do to get us out of this mess and seize the opportunity for a greener and fairer future. Our ranking exposes their policies for all to see, allowing people to make an informed decision on 12 December.\u201d In June, one of the last acts of Theresa May as Conservative prime minister was to commit the UK to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 , one of the first major economies to do so. The party\u2019s manifesto, published on Sunday, refers to that commitment, but uses terms such as \u201cnet zero\u201d, \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d, \u201cemissions\u201d and other related terms just 17 times, according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis. The Lib Dems also point to their net-zero target, committing to deliver a \u201c10-year emergency programme to cut emissions substantially straight away, and phase out emissions from the remaining hard-to-treat sectors by 2045 at the latest\u201d. Their manifesto uses such terms at three times the rate of the Conservatives. Labour has the most ambitious deadline of all the parties, committing \u201cto put the UK on track for a net-zero-carbon energy system within the 2030s \u2013 and go faster if credible pathways can be found\u201d. The party uses carbon-related terms at almost twice the rate of the Tory document. The SNP pushes for a \u201c75% reduction in emissions by 2035, net zero carbon emissions no later than 2040 and net zero of all emissions by 2045\u201d and mentions carbon-related terms at 2.7 times the rate of the Tories. None of the party manifestos pay much attention to fracking but all four state their intention to ban it, though the Conservatives would placed a \u201cmoratorium\u201d on the controversial practice, with the possibility of resumption should safety concerns be addressed in future. Methodology: Each manifesto has been analysed from the foreword onwards, ignoring the title and index pages, although Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cGuarantee\u201d has been included. Captions are excluded as are words that appear in images. Headers and footers are excluded from the analysis as are chapter titles. Section and paragraph titles have been retained.

It plans to hammer home the benefits of a pared-down set of its manifesto commitments that will put money directly in the pockets of voters in these constituencies. Labour strategists also say they will focus relentlessly on the risk of returning Boris Johnson to No 10 for five years, and seek to make the election a binary choice between Labour and the Tories in the hope of squeezing the Liberal Democrat vote further. Even before Wednesday evening\u2019s YouGov projection, which gave Boris Johnson a 68-seat majority and predicted Labour would lose 44 seats, party strategists were concerned about the imperative of appealing to leave supporters. They point out that even in the 2017 general election, the six seats Labour lost were all in leave areas; and, even in those they held, the increase in Labour\u2019s vote share was significantly lower than elsewhere. The YouGov projection, which showed the Lib Dems failing to make inroads in many of the seats Labour is targeting, has strengthened the hand of those who have been making that argument internally. These include the \u201cfour Ms\u201d \u2013 Seumas Milne, Andrew Murray, Len McCluskey and Karie Murphy, Labour sources suggested. It was McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, who warned against expanding freedom of movement, as some Labour activists had hoped to. In traditional Labour heartlands the reaction among candidates to a new focus on their constituencies was mixed. Great Grimsby candidate Melanie Onn said she had not had a single visit arranged centrally to help her defend her 2,565-majority in her heavily leave-voting seat, so was surprised to hear about a shift in focus to the north of England and Midlands. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to wait and see what this refocus is, I\u2019m not really sure what it means,\u201d she said. The shadow health minister, Jon Ashworth, appears to be acting as a bridge between Corbyn, his shadow cabinet and those candidates in northern and Midland constituencies with a leave majority. As well as helping Onn launch her campaign he has also visited Stoke, which voted 72% leave, for a joint event in support of Labour candidates there. Sonya Ward, who is trying to take back the traditional Labour heartland seat of Mansfield from Tory Ben Bradley, said she had been frequently visited by the shadow cabinet \u2013 including Corbyn. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty well supported to be honest.\u201d One Labour source in a heartland seat said: \u201cI think they have seen the polls, after ignoring the polls for a long time. Six months ago I started saying we were losing our vote. To be honest I think they\u2019ve realised a little bit too late that they\u2019ve been more interested in trying to save Emily Thornberry\u2019s seat in Islington than Labour heartlands.\u201d Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman, defending Huddersfield, which voted 51% leave in the referendum, said he would welcome more support for his colleagues in Yorkshire. While he has a healthy 12,000-majority, some female politicians elsewhere in the region risk losing their seats. The Tories are predicted to pick up three seats in South Yorkshire, including Don Valley, Penistone and Stocksbridge and Rother Valley, and four in West Yorkshire including Dewsbury, Keighley and Wakefield. He said: \u201cI think anything that targets any vulnerable seats where we have got absolutely first-class MPs \u2013 some of whom are the leading female MPs in parliament \u2013 is important, so any help that can be brought to them I would really welcome.\u201d",

Heavy discounting at furniture stores also played a part in average prices rising more slowly along with price cuts across the recreation and culture sectors, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a>. Core inflation, which strips out volatile fuel costs, stayed at 1.7%, only marginally below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. Bank of England officials, who meet eight times a year to set interest rates, could cut the cost of borrowing in the new year if the decline continues, but few City analysts believe a decision is imminent. The higher level of core inflation was the result of increases in clothing and footwear that pulled down inflation from its recent peak of 3.1% in 2017. Most forecasters predict inflation will stay steady for the next few months, but could rise next year after a Brexit deal likely to send the value of the pound down and the cost of imports up.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Trade boosted by rise in exports</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;trade&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s trade position improved in September after a 5.2% rise in exports that narrowed the trade gap, but not by as much as City economists had hoped. Much of the increase came from the services sector after increases in the export of business services, intellectual property, financial services and travel consultancy work. A \u00a34.3bn increase in goods exports to \u00a389.7bn was driven largely by machinery and transport equipment and chemicals. But the ONS said it was concerned about its own data and how it showed a surge in exports when other indicators pointed in the opposite direction. The ONS also highlighted how the annual trend had worsened. Over the last 12 months, the total trade deficit widened by almost \u00a319bn to \u00a351.6bn. Poorer exports would also fit with the trends in global trade, which has declined since it became clear that the US president, Donald Trump, was serious about launching a full-blown economic war with China. The OECD, the Paris-based club for the wealthiest 36 nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/21/tories-no-deal-brexit-plans-damage-uk-economy-oecd-eu\">said earlier this month</a> that global growth was likely to slow to 2.9% this year before stabilising in 2020 and rising back to 3% in 2021.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Business activity has sharpest drop since the referendum</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"pmi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;pmi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A long slide into recession seemed inevitable after figures from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index showed all areas of Britain\u2019s private sector entering a period of contraction. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/22/uk-service-sector-suffers-sharpest-drop-since-brexit-vote\">A flash publication of the index</a> covering about 85% of business activity in manufacturing and the services industry showed that in November, UK companies had the sharpest drop in activity since the EU referendum.

The ONS said employment had fallen by 58,000 during the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 the biggest fall since May 2015. A 93,000 drop in female employment appeared to indicate the trouble faced by high street stores, which employ large numbers of women and have closed at an alarming rate over the last year. The number of men in employment increased by 35,000. Meanwhile, Brexit uncertainty was also evident in the supply of labour, with non-EU nationals accounting for almost all the net growth in migrant employment over the past year.

City analysts had expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/12/uk-shopping-centres-owner-posts-147m-loss\">heavy discounting by retailers</a> to drive up sales. Instead the October figure for retail volumes represented the weakest monthly figure since April last year. Some analysts speculated that shoppers were reluctant to spend before the proposed 31 October <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> deadline. Others believed the prospect discount shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday later this month, and Christmas had deterred shoppers from spending vital cash in October. There was also speculation that recent declines in employment and wages growth had deterred consumers from spending on big-ticket items such as furniture and cars. Sales fell in all main retail sectors apart from food stores. Once petrol and diesel sales were stripped out the drop was even more severe at 0.3%. Department stores fared a little better than over the previous year, but the rise in sales was modest compared with the battering these large outlets have faced as shoppers desert the high street in favour.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Public finances hit by Brexit spending</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"borrowing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;borrowing&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Extra government spending since last year on Brexit preparations, the health service and a welter of new posts in Whitehall has dented the public purse and pushed ministers\u2019 deficit reduction plans off course.

The ONS said borrowing in the first seven months of the 2019-20 financial year was \u00a346.3bn, an increase of \u00a34.3bn on the same period in 2018-19. Not only was spending up, but tax receipts were almost flat at just 0.4% higher from the same month last year, with the weakness spread across VAT and taxes on income and companies. City analysts said the annual shortfall was only going to get larger once the next government has begun to include its election promises in the calculation. Before the election, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had already announced the budget deficit in 2020-21 would be lifted appreciably by a \u00a313.8bn increase to public spending (4.1% in real terms and the fastest increase in 15 years).</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>House prices on hold while buyers wait and see</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"rics\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;rics&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>House prices have remained steady in most parts of the country over the last year, despite Brexit uncertainty.

      "bodyText": "Sterling rebounds as no-deal risk declines The pound stabilised this month near $1.30 after a recovery in October from the summer woes that pushed sterling down below $1.20 and almost to parity against the euro. To the relief of holidaymakers going to the continent, the pound now stands at \u20ac1.18. The recovery was connected with the slowly evaporating threat of leaving the EU without a deal before the 31 October deadline. Support for sterling also came from poor economic figures from the eurozone, which indicated the currency bloc was entering a period of stagnation. A slowdown in the US also helped the pound\u2019s rebound. This month currency traders have remained on guard against Brexit developments, but with the election in full swing, they must wait until its conclusion before the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU becomes a little clearer. Share prices lose ground against Europe and the US Shares in London hit a 12-month peak in July, before entering a jittery period that continued last month. Concerns over Britain\u2019s future trading arrangements was the main cause, but figures showing the UK economy slowing down also dragged on share values. The index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies dropped as low as 7,200 over the last month and only rarely pushed above 7,400 to fall well short of July\u2019s 7,700 high point. Stock markets across Europe and the US have proved to be much more buoyant, shrugging off the gloom to register strong gains. The S&amp;P 500 in New York has risen almost 7% since August. France is best performing major economy in Europe this year and since August has seen its stock market, the CAC 40, rise by more than 10%. Even the struggling German stock market, the Dax, ahead by 13% rise over the same period. Better than forecast Inflation drops back after heavy discounting Inflation dropped to 1.5% in October after a slide in fuel and energy prices.

      "body": "<p>From this point in the coverage of an election, everything shrinks into minutiae. Whose campaign bus is hurtling into what marginal? Which niche of voters is being wooed by the small print on that policy? Whose poll lead is getting squeezed? What fun it is to play trivial pursuits! Yet it jars a little in this election, because this one bears such significance. Not just for the next five years, not only over Brexit and not solely in the UK. This election puts Britain at the frontline of the international political battle of our time. The votes we cast on 12 December will shape the answer to two questions of far-reaching importance.</p> <p>The first is whether the new hard right can be beaten: whether our democracies can put a halt to the forces represented here by Boris Johnson, or around the world by Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/09/how-matteo-salvini-pulled-italy-to-the-far-right\" title=\"\">Matteo Salvini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/26/india-muslims-narendra-modi-bjp-new-dawn\" title=\"\">Narendra Modi</a>, to name just a few. If we cannot block these nationalist hardmen democratically, then they will deform democracy until it is unrecognisable and illegitimate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour\u2019s new manifesto puts the party squarely at the cutting edge of what is now mainstream leftwing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second big question is if the new left is yet capable of winning power. The generation radicalised by the banking crisis of 2008 \u2013 and which camped on Wall Street and outside St Paul\u2019s cathedral, before marching against austerity and climate chaos \u2013 now provides much of the energy for Labour, the US Democratic party and the European left. Post-crash politics has gone mainstream; it is yet to be seen whether it can go into government.</p> <p>Since the summer, the UK has been governed by a prime minister who in the referendum of 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/boris-johnson-350-million-claim-bogus-foreign-secretary\" title=\"\">told 350 million lies</a> to the public, and who after entering No 10 tried unlawfully to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49810261\" title=\"\">shut down parliament</a>. He has bullied when he should have united, fibbed when he should have been straight, and he has undermined an already shaky constitutional settlement.</p> <p>Just like Trump, he exercises power by outraging democratic norms. The links between the two are underlined by yesterday\u2019s leak from Jeremy Corbyn of t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/27/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-dossier-proving-nhs-up-for-sale\" title=\"\">rade talks between Whitehall and Washington</a>. Those papers illustrate just what Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Baker and the rest of the hard-right headbangers behind Johnson mean by our \u201cglobal opportunities\u201d \u2013 bargaining away workers\u2019 rights, food labelling and drug prices. Ministers may not have prompted or agreed any of these compromises, but they are where the fever-dreams of the new hard right inevitably lead a country like the UK, shredding its already tattered social settlement.</p> <p>One section of the leaked document shows US officials telling their UK counterparts they will \u201cban\u201d any \u201cmention of greenhouse gas emissions\u201d in negotiations. If, as Johnson has claimed, this is \u201cpure invention\u201d, he has the perfect opportunity to deny it in public next week when Trump visits London. My hunch is he wouldn\u2019t dare.</p> <p>Against Johnson and Trump, the liberal establishment has so far reacted with proceduralism \u2013 with justified appeals to civility, with a blizzard of ingenious parliamentary amendments, with deep-voiced barristers in horsehair wigs. Yet this has had only limited success \u2013 because its opponents demonstrably do not care about liberal norms. And so each failure has chipped away further at our democracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a73a9697fd49704bf4316fadda8198f308b096b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a73a9697fd49704bf4316fadda8198f308b096b0/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Sean Simmers/PennLive.com via AP/Matt Cardy/Getty Images/AP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Should Johnson be re-elected you can expect him to keep on attacking the country\u2019s institutions.

Only politics, of course, which in England and Wales primarily means Corbyn\u2019s Labour. In all the focus on the leader, what is less often interrogated is the change in the party\u2019s grassroots. Reporting on Labour\u2019s ground campaign, I was struck by how many of the most engaged activists had been involved in protests over student fees at the start of the decade, or other social movements, and had opted to throw in their lot with parliamentary politics.

To put it mildly, this is an experiment that went beyond either side\u2019s expectations \u2013 but it is hard to imagine the party going back to its pre-2015 configuration.

      "bodyText": "From this point in the coverage of an election, everything shrinks into minutiae. Whose campaign bus is hurtling into what marginal? Which niche of voters is being wooed by the small print on that policy? Whose poll lead is getting squeezed? What fun it is to play trivial pursuits! Yet it jars a little in this election, because this one bears such significance. Not just for the next five years, not only over Brexit and not solely in the UK. This election puts Britain at the frontline of the international political battle of our time. The votes we cast on 12 December will shape the answer to two questions of far-reaching importance. The first is whether the new hard right can be beaten: whether our democracies can put a halt to the forces represented here by Boris Johnson, or around the world by Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini and Narendra Modi, to name just a few. If we cannot block these nationalist hardmen democratically, then they will deform democracy until it is unrecognisable and illegitimate. The second big question is if the new left is yet capable of winning power. The generation radicalised by the banking crisis of 2008 \u2013 and which camped on Wall Street and outside St Paul\u2019s cathedral, before marching against austerity and climate chaos \u2013 now provides much of the energy for Labour, the US Democratic party and the European left. Post-crash politics has gone mainstream; it is yet to be seen whether it can go into government. Since the summer, the UK has been governed by a prime minister who in the referendum of 2016 told 350 million lies to the public, and who after entering No 10 tried unlawfully to shut down parliament. He has bullied when he should have united, fibbed when he should have been straight, and he has undermined an already shaky constitutional settlement. Just like Trump, he exercises power by outraging democratic norms. The links between the two are underlined by yesterday\u2019s leak from Jeremy Corbyn of trade talks between Whitehall and Washington. Those papers illustrate just what Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Baker and the rest of the hard-right headbangers behind Johnson mean by our \u201cglobal opportunities\u201d \u2013 bargaining away workers\u2019 rights, food labelling and drug prices. Ministers may not have prompted or agreed any of these compromises, but they are where the fever-dreams of the new hard right inevitably lead a country like the UK, shredding its already tattered social settlement. One section of the leaked document shows US officials telling their UK counterparts they will \u201cban\u201d any \u201cmention of greenhouse gas emissions\u201d in negotiations. If, as Johnson has claimed, this is \u201cpure invention\u201d, he has the perfect opportunity to deny it in public next week when Trump visits London. My hunch is he wouldn\u2019t dare. Against Johnson and Trump, the liberal establishment has so far reacted with proceduralism \u2013 with justified appeals to civility, with a blizzard of ingenious parliamentary amendments, with deep-voiced barristers in horsehair wigs. Yet this has had only limited success \u2013 because its opponents demonstrably do not care about liberal norms. And so each failure has chipped away further at our democracy. Should Johnson be re-elected you can expect him to keep on attacking the country\u2019s institutions. At this autumn\u2019s Conservative conference in Manchester, I sat in on a Brexit fringe event where a QC proposed the abolition of the dangerously independent supreme court. His fellow panellists \u2013 including John Redwood, Arlene Foster and Mark Francois \u2013 did not protest but merely nodded in assent.
