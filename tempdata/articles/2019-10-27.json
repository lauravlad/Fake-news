The current parliament has not yet sat for two and a half, which is less than half of its term. It is not even close to outliving its usefulness. Contrary to Downing Street\u2019s lies, this parliament does not refuse to allow Brexit. Indeed it voted for Brexit only last week in the shape of the withdrawal agreement bill.

This parliament, elected in 2017 when Theresa May tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to get a large majority for her hard-Brexit terms, has plenty of usefulness left in its tank. This parliament has had to develop a uniquely detailed knowledge of the issues and implications <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/parliament-and-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">involved in Brexit</a>. This parliament has learned that it is now facing a double-dealing administration led by a prime minister whose word cannot be trusted. This parliament is therefore supremely well qualified to decide on the subject. The point of this parliament is that this is absolutely not the time for a parliament of novices, over whose eyes the wool could be pulled more easily.</p> <p>Last week, parliament voted for the withdrawal bill and called for more time to scrutinise it. Mr Johnson refused. Since then, it has become clear why he did so. Last Tuesday he told Labour MPs who were considering voting for the bill that <a href=\"https://infacts.org/6-more-porkies-and-6-more-fishy-promises-from-johnson/?mc_cid=42e54e0b03&amp;mc_eid=067467c118\" title=\"\">\u201cthere can be no regression\u201d</a> from existing employment rights after Brexit.

The government has tabled a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) during which MPs debate and vote on a general election for 12 December. However, under the FTPA only the votes of two-thirds or more of all MPs can trigger an election, and with Labour still resistant, the numbers are not there.

Whereas in the past prime ministers could simply seek an election from the Queen whenever happened to appear electorally advantageous to them, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/18/what-is-the-fixed-term-parliaments-act\">FTPA</a> allows early polls only if a particular motion is tabled and two-thirds of MPs \u2013 at least 434 of them \u2013 back the plan. More than a third of all MPs are Labour, meaning the party has, in effect, a veto.</p> <h2>Are there other ways to trigger an election?</h2> <p>Yes. The main alternative \u2013 one now mooted by both the Lib Dems and government \u2013 is either to amend the FTPA or pass a separate, one-line bill specifying that there will be an election on a certain date. The advantage of this route is that, as a traditional bill, it only requires a straightforward majority to pass the Commons. The issue for Johnson is that \u2013 unlike a motion under the FTPA \u2013 a bill can be amended, for example to extend the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, or EU nationals. Finally, Johnson could always resign, or call a no-confidence motion in himself. However, the FTPA dictates that rather than this triggering an immediate election, MPs would get a chance to try to form an alternative government.</p> <h2>Could there be a bill for an election?</h2> <p>Possibly, but as with so many things with the Brexit impasse the main obstacle is trust. Downing Street rejected the Lib Dem/SNP plan for such an election as a stunt, since it would require Johnson to abandon any plans to get his Brexit-enabling withdrawal agreement bill through the Commons before the vote. If time runs out for the bill, No 10 could potentially agree to an election anyway, but would want assurances about no amendments being tabled.</p> <h2>What would be the government\u2019s ideal election scenario?</h2> <p>Given the choice, Johnson would pilot the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament and go to the public as the PM who unblocked the Brexit log-jam. However, Downing Street would still be happy to fight the much-touted \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election if MPs block the bill. The Tories do, however, want any election sooner rather than later.</p> <h2>How about the Lib Dems and SNP?</h2> <p>The Lib Dems\u2019 first priority is fighting an election where Brexit has not been decided. As a party pitched squarely at remain voters, its appeal could diminish if people believe that the argument has been settled, however unhappy they might be with the outcome. For the SNP, meanwhile, there is speculation that the party would prefer an election before the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50122740\">trial in January of its former leader</a>, Alex Salmond, on charges including attempted rape and sexual assault.</p> <h2>And what of Labour?</h2> <p>Opinion is very much split.

The scale of these assurances has gradually broadened, so now Labour wants Johnson to publicly rule out no-deal not only in January but also if no permanent trade deal is reached by the end of 2020. Behind this, some in the leadership team are more bullish whereas others, including many Labour MPs, are worried about the prospects for a party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/labour-jeremy-corbyn-party-leader-brexit-boris-johnson\">currently lagging 15% or more in the polls</a>.

      "bodyText": "The British government has been accused of making \u201canother silly gesture\u201d after it emerged that UK officials attended slightly more than half of EU ministerial meetings since a pledge to skip \u201cmost\u201d of them to focus on Brexit. Since the government announced it would abandon most EU meetings from 1 September, a British minister or official has attended eight out of 15 ministerial meetings, according to research by the Guardian. The purpose of mostly quitting the EU council of ministers \u2013 one of the bloc\u2019s most powerful decision-making bodies \u2013 was to allow officials to focus on UK\u2019s \u201cfuture relationship with the EU and other partners around the world\u201d the government had said in the summer. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said attendance would be reduced by \u201cover half\u201d to \u201cfree up time for ministers and their officials to get on with preparing for our departure on 31 October and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead\u201d. Barclay attended an EU council last week dedicated to EU enlargement in the western Balkans. With Brexit talks at a crucial stage, he also met Ireland\u2019s foreign minister Simon Coveney, as well as ministers or officials from Poland, Greece, Denmark, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Portugal. Separately, Boris Johnson took the floor during a debate between European leaders on EU enlargement into the Balkans, after clinching his Brexit deal last Thursday. Three other ministers attended EU meetings after 1 September. Sajid Javid joined European finance ministers in Helsinki for a discussion on EU financial market rules. At the monthly foreign affairs council, Middle East minister Andrew Murrison agreed the UK would take part in EU-wide restrictions on selling weapons to Turkey, in response to the offensive in northern Syria. Following the EU move, the UK said it was suspending the sale of arms to Turkey that might be used in Syria, without spelling out how that would be determined. Energy minister Lord Duncan also joined his counterparts to discuss the EU\u2019s 2050 climate targets under the Paris agreement, earlier in October. The government said it would attend meetings in \u201cthe national interest\u201d, especially those concerning Brexit, foreign policy, security or finance. But British officials have also taken part in talks touching on the EU\u2019s post-Brexit future. The UK\u2019s deputy ambassador to Brussels, Katrina Williams, attended all-day talks on reforming the common agricultural policy and the EU fisheries fund after 2020, as well as preparations for the EU\u2019s annual negotiations with Norway on fishing quotas. Another UK official attended a meeting of finance ministers to discuss the EU\u2019s anti-money laundering action plan, while an unnamed UK representative took part in discussions on future EU trade policy. The UK skipped meetings on the rule of law in Hungary, transport, energy and agriculture. Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies, who chairs the European Parliament\u2019s fisheries committee, said the empty chair policy was \u201cjust another silly gesture like not signing the letter\u201d, referring to the prime minister\u2019s grudging request for a Brexit delay beyond 31 October. \u201cAs for the people who are not attending the meetings: they are phoning up their friends from other countries to find out what is going on so they can report back to Whitehall,\u201d he said. Davies, an architect of recent reforms to the EU common fisheries policy, said the British government had fallen silent in his policy area. He contended that the UK could be blocking a proposed hike in EU subsidies for larger fishing fleets that risks exacerbating overfishing, were it not for a decision to be silent in meetings. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt that the UK could have built up a blocking minority to prevent such unsustainable legislation, which could have prevented finance being used for purposes to promote unsustainable fishing.\u201d The empty chair policy is meant to free up officials to work on Brexit, but a former UK ambassador to the EU, Lord Hannay called the notion that staff could be redeployed so quickly \u201ccomplete rubbish\u201d. He condemned the policy as \u201ca really futile gesture\u201d that was \u201cdamaging to Britain\u2019s interests\u201d \u2013 points echoed by two other former UK ambassadors to Brussels, who said the gesture was \u201cpetulant\u201d and \u201cBoris Johnson playing poker\u201d. The empty chair policy applies to all EU meetings, including dozens of routine official-level ones not in the public domain. The government is understood to have taken part in fewer than half those meetings. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have said that the UK will attend fewer than half of all EU meetings, and that is exactly what we have done.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Canterbury has warned the inflammatory language used by Boris Johnson and other parliamentarians risks pouring petrol over Brexit divisions. Justin Welby said the UK had become consumed by \u201can abusive and binary approach to political decisions\u201d and amplification on social media made it \u201cextraordinarily dangerous to use careless comments\u201d. The prime minister has refused to stop describing the Benn act, which is designed to block a no-deal Brexit, as the \u201csurrender act\u201d, despite criticism of the way in which this paints his opponents in parliament as traitors guilty of a betrayal. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Welby said he was shocked by Johnson\u2019s recent dismissal of concerns about threats to MPs as \u201chumbug\u201d. Johnson went on to say the best way to honour the memory of the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right terrorist during the EU referendum campaign, was \u201cto get Brexit done\u201d. Welby said: \u201c[Concerns] should never be dismissed in that way. Death threats are really serious and they need to be taken seriously. All sides need to say: \u2018That is totally and utterly unacceptable.\u2019\u201d Welby said politicians could no longer behave like Johnson\u2019s political hero. \u201c[Winston] Churchill was well known for his somewhat inflammatory putdowns in parliament. But this is happening at a time when we have social media, which amplifies things,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a time of deep uncertainty, a much smaller amount of petrol is a much more dangerous thing than it was in a time when people were secure.
