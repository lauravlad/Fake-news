      "body": "<p>We are living in highly volatile times. Two-and-a-half years ago, in the first general election I contested as Labour leader, our party increased its share of the popular vote by 10 percentage points. On Thursday, on a desperately disappointing night, we fell back eight points.</p> \n<p>I have called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/devastating-exit-poll-triggers-bitter-blame-game-within-labour\" title=\"\">a period of reflection in the party</a>, and there is no shortage of things to consider. I don\u2019t believe these two contrasting election results can be understood in isolation.</p> \n<p>The last few years have seen a series of political upheavals: the Scottish independence campaign, Labour\u2019s transformation, Brexit, the Labour electoral surge, and now Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d victory. None of that is a coincidence.</p> \n<p>The political system is volatile because it is failing to generate stable support for the status quo following the financial crash of 2008. As Labour leader I\u2019ve made a point of travelling to all parts of our country and listening to people, and I\u2019ve been continually struck how far trust has broken down in politics.</p> \n<p>The gap between the richest and the rest has widened. Everyone can see that the economic and political system is not fair, does not deliver justice, and is stacked against the majority.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/corbyn-takes-share-responsibility-defeat\">I take my share of responsibility for this defeat, says Jeremy Corbyn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That has provided an opening for a more radical and hopeful politics that insists it doesn\u2019t have to be like this, and that another world is possible. But it has also fuelled cynicism among many people who know things aren\u2019t working for them, but don\u2019t believe that can change.</p> \n<p>I saw that most clearly in the former industrial areas of England and Wales where the wilful destruction of jobs and communities over 40 years has taken a heavy toll. It is no wonder that these areas provided the strongest backlash in the 2016 referendum and, regrettably for Labour, in the general election on Thursday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"552dfdf4-676d-48d6-93d3-025c582213a8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yFHvyYHT1GE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In towns where the steelworks have closed, politics as a whole wasn\u2019t trusted, but Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 sold as a blow to the system \u2013 was. Sadly that slogan will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is, shattering trust even further.</p> \n<p>Despite our best efforts, and our attempts to make clear this would be a turning point for the whole direction of our country, the election became mainly about Brexit.</p> \n<p>A Conservative party prepared to exploit divisions capitalised on the frustration created by its own failure to deliver on the referendum result \u2013 to the cost of a Labour party seeking to bring our country together to face the future.</p> \n<p>The polarisation in the country over Brexit made it more difficult for a party with strong electoral support on both sides. I believe we paid a price for being seen by some as trying to straddle that divide or re-run the referendum.</p> \n<p>We now need to listen to the voices of those in Stoke and Scunthorpe, Blyth and Bridgend, Grimsby and Glasgow, who didn\u2019t support Labour. Our country has fundamentally changed since the financial crash and any political project that pretends otherwise is an indulgence.</p> \n<p>Progress does not come in a simple straight line. Even though we lost seats heavily on Thursday, I believe the manifesto of 2019 and the movement behind it will be seen as historically important \u2013 a real attempt at building a force powerful enough to transform society for the many, not the few. For the first time in decades, many people have had hope for a better future.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea54c358bef27cd458e3df4dda7bcfb4ba6954ff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea54c358bef27cd458e3df4dda7bcfb4ba6954ff/0_46_1213_728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn leaves the Labour party\u2019s headquarters in the early hours of Friday morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn leaves the Labour party\u2019s headquarters in the early hours of Friday morning.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That experience, shared by hundreds of thousands of people, cannot be erased. Our task as a movement, and a party that has more than doubled in size, is not over: it now has the urgent task of defending the communities that will come under sustained assault from Boris Johnson\u2019s government and the toxic deal he wants with Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>And it must set about ensuring that sense of hope spreads and deepens. As socialists we seek to raise people\u2019s expectations. People in our country deserve so much more \u2013 and they can have it, if we work together to achieve it.</p> \n<p>I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate. But I regret that we did not succeed in converting that into a parliamentary majority for change.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions. The question is, how can we succeed in future where we didn\u2019t this time?</p> \n<p>There is no quick fix to overcome the distrust of many voters. Patronising them will not win them over. Labour has to earn their trust. That means the patient work of listening and standing with communities, especially as the government steps up its assault. And it means ensuring that the working class, in all its diversity, is the driving force within our party.</p> \n<p>The media attacks on the Labour party for the last four and a half years were more ferocious than ever \u2013 and of course that has an impact on the outcome of elections. Anyone who stands up for real change will be met by the full force of media opposition.</p> \n<p>The party needs a more robust strategy to meet this billionaire-owned and influenced hostility head-on and, where possible, turn it to our advantage.</p> \n<p>We have suffered a heavy defeat, and I take my responsibility for it. Labour will soon have a new leader. But whoever that will be, our movement will continue to work for a more equal and just society, and a sustainable and peaceful world.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve spent my life campaigning for those goals, and will continue to do so. The politics of hope must prevail.</p>",

I don\u2019t believe these two contrasting election results can be understood in isolation. The last few years have seen a series of political upheavals: the Scottish independence campaign, Labour\u2019s transformation, Brexit, the Labour electoral surge, and now Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d victory. None of that is a coincidence. The political system is volatile because it is failing to generate stable support for the status quo following the financial crash of 2008. As Labour leader I\u2019ve made a point of travelling to all parts of our country and listening to people, and I\u2019ve been continually struck how far trust has broken down in politics. The gap between the richest and the rest has widened. Everyone can see that the economic and political system is not fair, does not deliver justice, and is stacked against the majority. That has provided an opening for a more radical and hopeful politics that insists it doesn\u2019t have to be like this, and that another world is possible. But it has also fuelled cynicism among many people who know things aren\u2019t working for them, but don\u2019t believe that can change. I saw that most clearly in the former industrial areas of England and Wales where the wilful destruction of jobs and communities over 40 years has taken a heavy toll. It is no wonder that these areas provided the strongest backlash in the 2016 referendum and, regrettably for Labour, in the general election on Thursday. In towns where the steelworks have closed, politics as a whole wasn\u2019t trusted, but Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 sold as a blow to the system \u2013 was. Sadly that slogan will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is, shattering trust even further. Despite our best efforts, and our attempts to make clear this would be a turning point for the whole direction of our country, the election became mainly about Brexit. A Conservative party prepared to exploit divisions capitalised on the frustration created by its own failure to deliver on the referendum result \u2013 to the cost of a Labour party seeking to bring our country together to face the future. The polarisation in the country over Brexit made it more difficult for a party with strong electoral support on both sides. I believe we paid a price for being seen by some as trying to straddle that divide or re-run the referendum. We now need to listen to the voices of those in Stoke and Scunthorpe, Blyth and Bridgend, Grimsby and Glasgow, who didn\u2019t support Labour. Our country has fundamentally changed since the financial crash and any political project that pretends otherwise is an indulgence. Progress does not come in a simple straight line. Even though we lost seats heavily on Thursday, I believe the manifesto of 2019 and the movement behind it will be seen as historically important \u2013 a real attempt at building a force powerful enough to transform society for the many, not the few. For the first time in decades, many people have had hope for a better future. That experience, shared by hundreds of thousands of people, cannot be erased. Our task as a movement, and a party that has more than doubled in size, is not over: it now has the urgent task of defending the communities that will come under sustained assault from Boris Johnson\u2019s government and the toxic deal he wants with Donald Trump. And it must set about ensuring that sense of hope spreads and deepens. As socialists we seek to raise people\u2019s expectations. People in our country deserve so much more \u2013 and they can have it, if we work together to achieve it. I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate. But I regret that we did not succeed in converting that into a parliamentary majority for change. There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions. The question is, how can we succeed in future where we didn\u2019t this time? There is no quick fix to overcome the distrust of many voters. Patronising them will not win them over. Labour has to earn their trust. That means the patient work of listening and standing with communities, especially as the government steps up its assault. And it means ensuring that the working class, in all its diversity, is the driving force within our party. The media attacks on the Labour party for the last four and a half years were more ferocious than ever \u2013 and of course that has an impact on the outcome of elections. Anyone who stands up for real change will be met by the full force of media opposition. The party needs a more robust strategy to meet this billionaire-owned and influenced hostility head-on and, where possible, turn it to our advantage. We have suffered a heavy defeat, and I take my responsibility for it. Labour will soon have a new leader. But whoever that will be, our movement will continue to work for a more equal and just society, and a sustainable and peaceful world. I\u2019ve spent my life campaigning for those goals, and will continue to do so. The politics of hope must prevail.",

John McDonnell has said he will leave the shadow cabinet. \u201cThe new leader will come in place, appoint the shadow cabinet. I won\u2019t be part of the shadow cabinet,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cI\u2019ve done my bit.\u201d He was seen by some as a possible interim leader, but, as a key figure in Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a second referendum, he has also faced criticism from those who think the party\u2019s Brexit position was a key reason for its defeat. McDonnell said the current shadow cabinet would stay in place for the interim period, and would respond to the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. The shadow chancellor also said that the NEC officers \u2013 a sub-group of senior members of Labour\u2019s ruling body \u2013 would meet next week and decide the timetable for a leadership election in the new year. \u201cIt will be the usual time \u2013 a couple of months or something,\u201d he said. Members of the wider NEC \u2013 who said that they had only been contacted by the party\u2019s leadership to be told not to speak to the media about the election results \u2013 argued on Twitter that they would expect the leadership election timetable to be decided by a meeting of all of the committee\u2019s members. Boris Johnson told an audience of supporters in the now Tory seat of Sedgefield, Country Durham, that the UK has \u201cembarked on a wonderful adventure\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to recover our national self-confidence, our mojo, our self-belief, and we\u2019re going to do things differently and better as a country,\u201d he said. He thanked voters across Labour\u2019s former heartlands: I can imagine people\u2019s pencils hovering over the ballot paper and wavering, before coming down for us and the Conservatives. And I know that people may have been breaking the voting habits of generations to vote for us and I want the people of the north-east to know that we in the Conservative party, and I, will repay your trust. Charities helping the most vulnerable in society have reported an increase in support after the Conservative victory in the general election, reports Georgina Hayes. Shelter, Refuge, the Trussell Trust and the Biscuit Fund have all confirmed they have seen a sharp increase in donations and/or registered supporters as a result of the election outcome. While unable to give exact numbers, the UK homelessness and housing charity Shelter said it had seen an increase in the number of people signing up as supporters since the result. EU leaders would take the initiative and request an extension to the transition period, keeping the UK under Brussels regulations beyond 2020, under a plan mooted for dealing with Boris Johnson refusing to seek a delay \u2013 reports Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey. The move is being considered by EU officials as a way out of the problem posed by the short time available to negotiate a new relationship and the prime minister\u2019s insistence that he will not seek an extension beyond 11 months. With a majority of 80 secured by the prime minister, the UK is expected to leave the EU on 31 January \u2013 in fewer than 50 days. At the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the UK is set to exit the EU\u2019s customs union and single market and enter newly-negotiated arrangements. Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said that negotiating a future relationship in such a timeframe would be very challenging. Speaking on Friday at the end of a two-day leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels, she said the negotiations would have to prioritise key EU issues, such as trade in goods and fisheries, and leave others for after 2020. Such a \u201csequencing\u201d could leave arrangements for the UK\u2019s financial services sector and the landing rights of British air carriers out of an initial deal, among other issues. Read the full story here: More concerns from NEC members that the timetable for selecting a new Labour leader will be taken out of their hands. The Observer journalist Tim Adams has been in the former Labour safe seat (and Tony Blair\u2019s old constituency) of Sedgefield today, where the prime minister gave a triumphant speech to activists this morning. The new Tory MP in Sedgefield, Paul Howell, a retired accountant, is the unlikely latest heir to Blair. He had watched hope harden into expectation a week into the campaign. He had walked down a street in the former mining village of Cornforth, north of Trimdon, knocking on doors. He went through a dozen without finding a Labour voter; the 13th was an ex-Labour councillor who also pledged him a vote. There were so many following winds here: but the Brexit factor and the Corbyn factor were the big ones, while Boris was seen as someone who can deliver. Personally, I think people only ever lend you their votes. It\u2019s up to you to make them trust you again to give it again. The talk in the air is of a new Thatcherism, but \u201cwithout the tribal connotations\u201d. Oliver Peeke, who works in admin for the council, admits he is one of those referred to by Johnson whose grandparents would be spinning in their grave to see him wearing a Tory rosette. A lot of our family were Labour, but I\u2019m desperate that this time it will stick. I don\u2019t want to go back to the dark old days when people would just scream Thatcher at you when you walk up the drive with a Tory leaflet. There has to be more to politics that that. The defeated Labour candidate, Phil Wilson, told the Observer that \u201cif Johnson was going to park his tanks on any lawn this morning it was going to be here. He wants to say to the world that New Labour is history.\u201d Wilson puts his defeat squarely at the door of the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. He is angry that his party has proved itself \u201cunable to connect with people who are not in London\u201d, and presented a manifesto \u201cthat was an essay about the past\u201d with \u201cnothing to say about the future\u201d. Members of Labour\u2019s NEC saying on Twitter they haven\u2019t been told about a possible meeting next week. (McDonnell said this morning that Labour\u2019s ruling body would meet next week.) The Huffington Post\u2019s Rachel Wearmouth reports that the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, plans to run for the deputy leadership. The hashtag #backburgon was trending this morning, after what appeared to be a parody campaign page was created on Twitter called \u201cBack Burgon\u201d. The editor of Labour List reports that NEC members are concerned the leader\u2019s office is trying to \u201ccling on to power\u201d. This is from Sky News\u2019s political correspondent Rob Powell: Boris Johnson has told an audience of supporters in the now Tory seat of Sedgefield, Country Durham, that the UK has \u201cembarked on a wonderful adventure\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to recover our national self-confidence, our mojo, our self-belief, and we\u2019re going to do things differently and better as a country,\u201d he said. He thanked voters across Labour\u2019s former heartlands: I can imagine people\u2019s pencils hovering over the ballot paper and wavering, before coming down for us and the Conservatives.

The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said he will leave the shadow cabinet. \u201cThe new leader will come in place, appoint the shadow cabinet. I won\u2019t be part of the shadow cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done my bit.\u201d He was seen by some as a possible interim leader, but, as a key figure in Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a second referendum, he has also faced criticism from those who think the party\u2019s Brexit position was a key reason for its defeat. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s three sons have condemned the \u201cdespicable attacks\u201d their father has faced hours after he said he would stand down following the party\u2019s historic defeat. The Labour leader\u2019s youngest son, Tommy, shared a statement on Twitter on Friday night lamenting the loss but adding that it was wrong to assume the \u201cideologies\u201d their father stood for were outdated. Michael Heseltine, the Europhile Tory grandee who urged voters to back the Liberal Democrats in the election, has admitted that the remain position on European Union membership has lost and declared that he thinks the debate is over for at least a generation. \u201cWell, we have lost,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cLet\u2019s not muck about with the language. We have lost. Brexit is going to happen and we have to live with it.\u201d The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has been doorstepped by the BBC, heading out to a constituency surgery. She is one of those tipped as a possible candidate for Labour leader. Frankly there\u2019s going to be an awful lot of work to do over the next five years given we\u2019ve got this terrible Tory government coming. I fear that my surgery is going to be very full indeed with people who are getting their benefits cut. Asked if she would run for Labour leader, she said: \u201cI\u2019m still in a period of mourning. We need to be able to have a chance to stop and think.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of Johnson\u2019s speech in Sedgefield. Speaking to activists and new MPs, he said: Nobody wanted this election in the run-up to Christmas, but what an incredible thing you have done. You have changed the political landscape. You have changed the Conservative party for the better and you\u2019ve changed the future of our country for the better. I want to thank all the people of Sedgefield, of Bishop Auckland, of Stockton South, of Darlington \u2013 where my ancestors come from, it turns out \u2013 north-west Durham, Blyth Valley and Redcar. I want to thank all of you for the trust that you have placed in the Conservative party and in me. I know how difficult it was, and it can be, to make that kind of decision. And I can imagine people\u2019s pencils hovering over the ballot paper and wavering, before coming down for us and the Conservatives. And I know that people may have been breaking the voting habits of generations to vote for us and I want the people of the north-east to know that we in the Conservative party, and I, will repay your trust. He said the Tories had \u201cgone over the timetable\u201d and that it was definitely possible to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament before Christmas. He said that after that they would get on with delivering other manifesto commitments. \u201cHow many more hospitals?\u201d he asked the crowd, referring to the dubious manifesto pledge. \u201cForty,\u201d they responded. \u201cHow many more nurses?\u201d he asked (another controversial pledge), with the response \u201c50,000\u201d. He said the new government was \u201cgoing to do some fantastic things\u201d. \u201cOur country has now embarked on a wonderful adventure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to recover our national self-confidence, our mojo, our self-belief, and we\u2019re going to do things differently and better as a country.\u201d Johnson says its time for the UK to recover its \u201cmojo\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a wonderful, wonderful time in the country,\u201d he says. He says to new Tory MPs: \u201cRemember, we are not the masters, we are the servants now.\u201d Boris Johnson is speaking to a crowd of supporters in Sedgefield, County Durham, Tony Blair\u2019s former seat which fell to the Tories for the first time since the 1930s. You can watch the live stream at the top of the blog. He says he will take the UK out of the EU by 31 January. He repeats his questionable pledge to deliver \u201c50,000 more\u201d nurses and says his new government will hire more police. Some reaction to that McDonnell news (see last post). He was seen by some as a possible interim leader, but, as a key figure in Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a second referendum, he has also faced criticism as one of the masterminds behind the party\u2019s election campaign. John McDonnell has said he will not be returning to the shadow cabinet. The shadow chancellor denied that he had backed the wrong Labour leader, saying Corbyn was \u201cone of the most principled, honest, sincere, committed, anti-racist politicians\u201d. The new leadership coming in, I think, will enable us to move forward on the key issues \u2013 getting a Brexit deal that works for all of us, tackling these grotesque levels of inequality. But the big one ... is climate change and my fear is five years of a fossil fuel-backed government under Boris Johnson means we will miss this five-year opportunity of saving our planet. ... I didn\u2019t back the wrong person because Jeremy was the right leader. We could have won in 2017. Things moved on, Brexit dominated everything and that was the horns of a dilemma we were on. The new leader will come in place, appoint the shadow cabinet. I won\u2019t be part of the shadow cabinet. I\u2019ve done my bit. We need to move on at that stage, with that new leader, and I think we will be in a position [to be] learning lessons, listening to people and constructing a broad coalition right the way across the country. McDonnell said there needed to be a debate about how \u201csomeone \u2013 who I think is one of the most principled, honest, sincere, committed, anti-racist politicians \u2013 [was] demonised by a smear campaign\u201d. \u201cI think we have a wider debate here about the role of social media and the media overall,\u201d he said. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks writes that there is an excellent inside story from the Herald\u2019s political editor Tom Gordon, which explains how the SNP managed to exceed its own expectations thanks to high turnout. While turnout was down in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, it was up in Scotland, rising 1.6 points to 68.1%. Across the UK it fell 1.5 points to 67.7%. According to Gordon, SNP strategists believe this is what pushed their final tally to 48 MPs \u2013 actually 47 plus one suspended member who still appeared on the ballot as SNP. Meanwhile, the Telegraph Scotland reports that Boris Johnson is planning a major charm offensive in Scotland after accepting that his personal unpopularity contributed to his party losing seven of their 13 seats. Apparently he has already spoken to senior Scottish Tories to pledge he will visit Scotland more often in the new year in the hope of winning over sceptical Scots with a one nation agenda. Johnson and the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have already clashed over the SNP\u2019s insistence that the results are a mandate for a second independence referendum, with the prime minster immediately reiterating that he will not grant the necessary powers for Holyrood to hold one. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s three sons have condemned the \u201cdespicable attacks\u201d their father has faced hours after he said he would stand down following the party\u2019s historic defeat. The Labour leader\u2019s youngest son, Tommy, shared a statement on Twitter on Friday night lamenting the loss but adding that it was wrong to assume the \u201cideologies\u201d their dad stood for were outdated. He described the manifesto his father produced as the \u201cmost wonderful this country has ever seen\u201d. His statement read: \u201cLast night hurt, today hurts a bit more, tomorrow it will hurt even more. \u201cJeremy has dedicated each day of his political life for the less fortunate amongst us. Unwaveringly, he has fought and campaigned for people who suffer and people in hardship. \u201cBeing honest, humble and good natured in the poisonous world of politics has meant that he has endured the most despicable attacks filled with hatred for the duration of his 36 years in public life.\u201d It continued: \u201cTo say we are proud is a vast understatement. To assume the ideologies he stands for are now outdated is so wrong. In the coming years we will see that they are more important than ever. \u201cThank you to every person who saw his vision and supported it and supported him. From the three proudest sons on the planet, please continue the fight.\u201d The former Labour MP, Anna Turley, who lost her seat in Redcar, has written for the Independent, describing the election result for Labour as \u201ca disgrace\u201d. Her twitter bio now reads simply: \u201cFree\u201d. To blame Brexit is to miss the point. There would be no Brexit if Labour had had credible leadership in the 2016 referendum, standing up for our party\u2019s values of cooperation, internationalism and partnership. Instead, we had a guy who dressed up in a fur coat to go on The Last Leg and give the EU \u201cseven and a half out of ten\u201d. No one put forward an argument to working-class Labour communities about why the EU mattered to them, because the leader didn\u2019t believe that it did. Ever since, instead of strong leadership and a clear position, we have had three years of U-turns, triangulation and dancing on pinheads. I have never been able to tell my constituents what Labour\u2019s Brexit position truly was \u2013 only my own. And so to this disgrace. Despite 10 years of Tory austerity that has led to Dickensian levels of poverty, and the end of 175 years of steel-making in my constituency, people didn\u2019t believe Labour would be any better. This is a failure on an epic scale, and a betrayal of those communities that need Labour most. The BBC\u2019s director general has expressed his exasperation with \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d about the broadcaster\u2019s election news coverage, although some of its journalists privately fear that errors during the campaign may have hit public trust in the corporation. The Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, reports that Tony Hall emailed staff on Friday to thank them for their work on the BBC\u2019s coverage, which came under intense online scrutiny. This followed criticism of the editing out of laughter aimed at Boris Johnson in a news bulletin, reporters uncritically repeating Conservative sources, such as when a Labour activist was erroneously accused of punching a Tory aide, and the prime minister escaping scrutiny after dodging a one-on-one interview with Andrew Neil. Hall said the BBC\u2019s critics were often seeing bias in what were genuine human errors: \u201cIn a frenetic campaign where we\u2019ve produced hundreds of hours of output, of course we\u2019ve made the odd mistake and we\u2019ve held up our hands to them. Editors are making tough calls every minute of the day. But I don\u2019t accept the view of those critics who jump on a handful of examples to suggest we\u2019re somehow biased one way or the other.\u201d You can read the full story here: Former Labour MPs who lost their seats in Thursday\u2019s election have been speaking to the BBC. They blamed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and the party\u2019s alienation of its northern voters for the loss, PA Media reports. The former Bishop Auckland MP Helen Goodman told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme \u201cthe biggest factor was obviously the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader\u201d. The fact of the matter is that Jeremy Corbyn failed as a communicator, whatever his good personal qualities, and he undoubtedly has good personal qualities, he failed as a communicator. The ex-shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman, who lost her seat in Darlington, said: You can\u2019t run a political party that wants to be a party of government but only really appeals to about a third of the electorate and those are people that live in cities who are fairly well-off people. The real question we have to ask ourselves now is do we want the Tories, do we want to give them another five years or another 15 years, because if we get this wrong now as a party, this could very well be the end of the Labour movement. The former Labour MP Anna Turley, who lost her seat in Redcar, said: I think it\u2019s quite overwhelming. You have to listen to the people, that\u2019s the first thing that we have to do. And for me, when you\u2019re getting four doors in a row of lifelong Labour voters saying: \u2018I\u2019m sorry Anna, I\u2019m a lifelong Labour voter, I like what you\u2019ve done, but I just can\u2019t vote for that man to be prime minister\u2019, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a fundamental barrier that we just couldn\u2019t get across. Turley said Corbyn was more of a reason than Brexit for her constituents voting for another party. In my constituency, even though it was a 67% leave constituency, it was four-to-one the leadership over Brexit. I mean obviously the issues run deeper than that, the Labour party is bigger than just one person, but the reality is there were issues around our perception around competence. The Labour MP for York Central, Rachael Maskell, who retained her seat, insisted it wasn\u2019t just Corbyn who should take responsibility for Labour\u2019s defeat. We\u2019ve all got to take responsibility but I don\u2019t think apportioning blame to a complex situation in a simplistic way is really the way to approach this, we\u2019ve got to understand what is really happening across our political system. The Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme a little earlier. He said that whether or not the Tories can achieve a political declaration with zero tariffs on goods between the UK and the EU \u201cdepends on whether the Tory party is, again, able to face up to its own contradictions\u201d. They want the deepest possible access to the European single market, yet they want to undercut significantly EU legislation, and you can\u2019t have both. So either you want total regulatory freedom and you do whatever you like \u2013 and if you want to undercut EU legislation then you do it, but then you lose access. Or you want access and you have basically to remain aligned with EU legislation. That will be the decision that Boris Johnson will need to make. Raoul Ruparel, who was Theresa May\u2019s special adviser on Europe during her time as prime minister, told the programme it would be possible to reach a deal with the EU next year but \u201cthe short time frame does limit the level of ambition\u201d. I think it is possible to get a free trade agreement in place that looks at quite standard provisions on level playing fields, such as the type that the EU have done with other countries, and also offers zero tariffs. But I think what it\u2019s harder to do, is what Philippe Lamberts was alluding to, is removing the regulatory barriers and the checks behind the border which would require some level of alignment of rules. And I think at the moment, despite his large majority, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the sort of deal that Boris Johnson envisages, and it\u2019s something that he\u2019s consistently fought against. On the possibility of a no-deal Brexit if the UK fails to reach an agreement by the end of next year, he said: I think it is possible to get something done in the next year but I think the short time frame does limit the level of ambition potentially, because you would be looking at a narrower and shallower deal than you might have otherwise envisaged given the speed needed. Here is what the European papers had to say yesterday about the election result: Michael Heseltine, the Europhile Tory grandee who urged voters to back the Liberal Democrats in the election, has admitted that the remain position on European Union membership has lost and declared that he thinks the debate is over for at least a generation. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the remain cause was over, Lord Heseltine answered: Well, we have lost. Let\u2019s not muck about with the language. We have lost. Brexit is going to happen and we have to live with it. I\u2019ve made my views pretty clear and there will now be a long period of uncertainty, but you can\u2019t escape from that so we must do the best we can. Asked if he would ever campaign for the UK to rejoin the EU, Heseltine said no. I don\u2019t think that battle has gone, but it won\u2019t be my generation, it will be 20 years or something before the thing is once again raised as an issue. And, of course, you can\u2019t escape the devastating results on Scotland and Northern Ireland, so the agenda is not going away. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has written in today\u2019s Telegraph, saying he will \u201cnot [be] too far away from the action\u201d, after his party failed to win any seats in the general election. He said the Conservative party\u2019s 80-seat majority was an \u201coverwhelming mandate ... to get Brexit done\u201d, and that he was now concerned with the form of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc, rather than whether it would happen at all. The truth is that the threat from the Brexit party, together with the influence of the European Research Group in parliament, has disappeared for the time being. Questions over the future shape of Brexit and Britain\u2019s place in the world are now entirely in the hands of Johnson. With half of his cabinet having voted remain, and substantial global pressures on him, it will be tempting for him to pursue the easy option of a soft Brexit. The Brexit party contested 273 seats in this election. They took 2% of votes but won no seats. Farage continued: Having endured three elections in the last 30 months, let us hope the country can look forward to a prolonged period of political stability and certainty. Whatever happens over the coming months, I will make sure I am not too far away from the action. The fact is that if Brexit does not \u2018get done\u2019, as Johnson has promised repeatedly over the last six weeks, pressure will have to be reapplied. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s politics live blog. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be bringing you all of the day\u2019s political news in the wake of yesterday\u2019s general election result. Boris Johnson is set to embark on a whirlwind tour of northern seats taken by the Conservatives in the election, in which he secured an 80-seat majority. It\u2019s been reported that he could visit Tony Blair\u2019s former seat of Sedgefield in the north-east, which had been held by Labour since 1935 prior to the poll. In a speech outside No 10 on Friday, Johnson said he would \u201cwork round the clock\u201d to repay the trust of those who voted Conservative for the first time, including those whose \u201cpencils may have wavered over the ballot and who heard the voices of their parents and their grandparents whispering anxiously in their ears\u201d. Appearing on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight last night, the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the government would look to redirect investment towards those communities that felt they were not being heard. We are very grateful to these traditional Labour voters, in many cases, for lending us their support on this occasion, perhaps because of Brexit. We need to earn that trust now and hopefully we will have five years ahead of us to do that.",

      "bodyText": "John McDonnell has said he will not return to the shadow cabinet after Labour\u2019s worst general election result in a generation. The shadow chancellor, seen as one of the architects of Labour\u2019s shift to the left, has been a major figure at the top of the party since Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s surprise 2015 leadership victory. But he had been criticised for his influence on Labour\u2019s decision to support a second Brexit referendum, which alienated many voters in the party\u2019s once solid heartlands who had voted to leave the European Union. McDonnell said on Saturday he had \u201cdone his bit\u201d and it was time for the party to move on. \u201cThe new leadership coming in, I think, will enable us to move forward on the key issues \u2013 getting a Brexit deal that works for all of us, tackling these grotesque levels of inequality,\u201d he told BBC News. \u201cBut the big one \u2026 is climate change, and my fear is five years of a fossil fuel-backed government under Boris Johnson means we will miss this five-year opportunity of saving our planet.\u201d McDonnell denied that he had backed the wrong Labour leader, saying Corbyn could have won in 2017. But this time, he said: \u201cThings moved on, Brexit dominated everything, and that was the horns of a dilemma we were on. \u201cThe new leader will come in place, appoint the shadow cabinet,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cI won\u2019t be part of the shadow cabinet. I\u2019ve done my bit. We need to move on at that stage, with that new leader, and I think we will be in a position [to be] learning lessons, listening to people and constructing a broad coalition right the way across the country.\u201d He said the current shadow cabinet would stay in place for the interim period, and would respond to the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. \u201cMy fear is that we\u2019re in for a long haul now, possibly five years,\u201d he said. McDonnell said there needed to be a debate about how \u201csomeone [Corbyn] \u2013 who I think is one of the most principled, honest, sincere, committed, anti-racist politicians \u2013 [was] demonised by a smear campaign\u201d. \u201cI think we have a wider debate here about the role of social media and the media overall,\u201d he said. Positioning in the race to become the next Labour leader has already started, with the ardent remainer David Lammy confirming he was considering putting his name forward. Others being touted to take over include Lisa Nandy, who represents leave-voting Wigan, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner, Sir Keir Starmer, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry. McDonnell named the shadow business secretary, Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, Rayner, and the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, as part of a \u201cnew generation\u201d who could be expected to take leading positions. John McDonnell said that the NEC officers \u2013 a sub-group of senior members of Labour\u2019s ruling body \u2013 would meet next week and decide the timetable for a leadership election in the New Year. \u201cIt will be the usual time \u2013 a couple of months or something,\u201d he said. Members of the wider NEC \u2013 who said that they had been contacted by the party\u2019s leadership only to be told not to speak to the media about the election results \u2013 argued on Twitter that they would expect the leadership election timetable to be decided by a meeting of all of the committee\u2019s members. \u201cAny decisions on the future of the party and the leadership must be made by the full NEC, not the small officer\u2019s group,\u201d wrote NEC member James Asser. An NEC meeting is scheduled for the end of January, but members said they would expect to be called to an emergency meeting before then. Several former Labour MPs who lost their seats in the election have blamed Corbyn for the party\u2019s defeat. Helen Goodman, the former Labour MP for Bishop Auckland, said Corbyn had \u201cfailed as a communicator\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe biggest factor was obviously the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn as leader. The fact of the matter is that Jeremy Corbyn failed as a communicator, whatever his good personal qualities \u2013 and he undoubtedly has good personal qualities \u2013 he failed as a communicator.\u201d Anna Turley, who lost her seat in Redcar in the north-east, described Corbyn\u2019s leadership as a barrier. She said: \u201cFor me, when you\u2019re getting four doors in a row of lifelong Labour voters saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Anna, I\u2019m a lifelong Labour voter, I like what you\u2019ve done, but I just can\u2019t vote for that man to be prime minister,\u2019 I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a fundamental barrier that we just couldn\u2019t get across.\u201d She said Corbyn was \u201cabsolutely\u201d more of a reason than Brexit for her constituents choosing to vote for another party, adding: \u201cIn my constituency, even though it was a 67% leave constituency, it was four to one the leadership over Brexit.\u201d She said former Labour voters \u201cdidn\u2019t trust him to put our country first\u201d because of \u201chis history and his baggage around security and terrorism\u201d.

She has clearly made fighting systemic corruption and putting the government on the side of everyday people instead of powerful corporate interests at the centerpiece of her campaign \u2013 a theme that resonates with Democrats, independents and Republicans.\u201d Glenn Greenwald, a journalist at the Intercept, tweeted: \u201cHow come Corbyn\u2019s defeat in Brexit-complicating UK proves the left can\u2019t win in US, but the stunning victory by Argentina\u2019s leftist Fernandez/Kirchner ticket doesn\u2019t show undiluted leftism is necessary to win? Maybe people are manipulating inapplicable results for their own ends?\u201d He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to exploit foreign election outcomes to try to bolster your own ideological preferences in the US, try not to be so glaringly selective in how you do it. The left is winning in many places; you need to grapple with those victories, too.\u201d Neil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive group Democracy for America, pointed out that US politicians would probably use the British results to bolster their own argument. He said: \u201cNumber one, everybody overnight becomes a comparative politics expert. Number two, anyone who says that there are direct lessons about what\u2019s going to happen in the 2020 US election based on what happened in 2019 has an agenda that they\u2019re trying to sell you. \u201cIt makes sense that Joe Biden wants to try to make that argument. I don\u2019t think it will be very effective here in the United States writ large. It shouldn\u2019t be convincing to anyone who actually knows anything about electoral politics in the United States and electoral politics in the United Kingdom.\u201d And Sidney Blumenthal, a former assistant and senior adviser to Clinton, observed: \u201cJohnson overwhelmingly won the Commons. Trump cannot win the House back and it is very likely the Democrats will increase their majority and I think very likely the Democrats will pick up Senate seats and possibly win the Senate. \u201cIf Trump hangs on, it will be nothing like a Boris Johnson Tory triumph that we\u2019ve just seen and so the Democratic party is not going to suffer the kind of internal and external collapse that the Labour party has.\u201d",
