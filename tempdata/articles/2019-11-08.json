The announcement comes as the shock of Tom Watson\u2019s resignation as deputy leader continues to ripple through the party. Watson\u2019s allies have called his decision a \u201cbig loss\u201d for the centre, with one saying \u201cit leaves some of us feeling abandoned. Tom was our shield.\u201d The race to replace him has already begun, with Dawn Butler, the women\u2019s and equalities shadow minister, the first to announce she will be throwing her hat in the ring for the job.

      "bodyText": "Three Labour candidates have been embroiled in controversies around antisemitism. It was announced that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will face each other in a live BBC debate in Southampton on 6 December, six days before the election. Boris Johnson told Northern Ireland businesses they can put customs declarations forms \u201cin the bin\u201d because there will be \u201cno barriers of any kind\u201d to trade crossing the Irish Sea. Dawn Butler said Labour would \u201cdismantle the structural barriers\u201d women face in the workplace with new policies of flexible working and increased maternity leave. Nicola Sturgeon launched the SNP campaign with a pledge to support revoking article 50. And the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Jo Swinson travelled to Scotland where she vowed that her party would never support another Scottish independence referendum. The Liberal Democrats would never allow another Scottish independence referendum, Jo Swinson has said, as she pledged to keep Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU. On a campaign visit to North East Fife, the most-marginal constituency at the last election, Swinson said another referendum is \u201cthe last thing we need\u201d, warning it would just create further \u201cchaos\u201d, PA Media reports. Following the Prime Minister\u2019s promise to voters about never allowing another referendum on Scotland\u2019s future, Swinson also said her party would try to block any attempts by the SNP to hold another vote. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely clear, Liberal Democrats will not be allowing another independence referendum,\u201d Swinson told reporters on her visit to a Crafty Maltsters, a farm in Auchtermuchty. The SNP should be learning the lessons of Brexit, not repeating the mistakes. This is about stopping chaos. If you have an independence referendum, that\u2019s about adding more chaos, more uncertainty, more cost and difficulties for families across Scotland and it\u2019s the last thing we need. We are in a situation here in Scotland where we\u2019ve had this constitutional obsession for eight years now. People actually just want government to get on with making their lives better. They are worried about the experience their children are having in schools, they are worried about the fact that their loved ones might struggle to get mental health treatment in anything like a reasonable timeframe, they\u201dre worried about the future of our planet. These are the thing governments should be getting on with, frankly, whether that\u2019s the government in Holyrood or whether that\u2019s the government in Westminster. So stop Brexit, stop this obsession with independence and get on with making people\u2019s lives better. A Labour government would \u201cdismantle the structural barriers\u201d women face in the workplace with new policies of flexible working and increased maternity leave, shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler has said. According to a report from PA Media, Butler said that Labour\u2019s proposed workplace reforms are \u201cthe common sense approach to the modern way of life\u201d. She added that a Labour government would aim to implement all of the policies within the first 100 days of being in office. Labour\u2019s proposals include creating a new workers\u2019 protection agency with powers to fine employers who fail to report or take action to deal with their \u201cgender pay gap\u201d, increasing statutory maternity pay from nine to 12 months, and a \u201cpresumption\u201d in favour of flexible working from the first day an employee joins an organisation. Butler said that white, straight men have \u201ca privilege code to the lift\u201d, fast tracking them into managerial positions, and that a Labour government would \u201clay the grounds for an elevator\u201d for women, to help them secure a level playing field in the world of work. Speaking to a group of businesswomen at the Business and Technology Centre in Stevenage, Butler said: \u201cI have announced today some policies around flexible working in the workplace to ensure flexible working is available from day one. \u201cMy whole thing is flipping the script from employees always having to push an agenda to the employer, making it their responsibility.\u201d Ms Butler added: \u201cBasically, my whole thing is just about respecting women, our bodies, what we go through, and making workplaces more acceptable and friendly so everybody can contribute to the economy. \u201cAll these policies are saying women matter.\u201d Labour says the Conservative party has taken nearly half a million pounds so far this year from just three wealthy individuals with close ties to Moscow, in the latest on the ongoing saga of Russian influence in UK politics. Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said that the Tories had an \u201congoing relationship with Russian money\u201d. Describing the Conservatives as the party of the \u201csuper-rich\u201d, Trickett said political donations in Britain needed urgent reform and \u201ccleaning up\u201d. His comments come amid a row over Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to publish an explosive parliamentary report on Kremlin attempts to subvert British democracy. Downing Street has effectively shelved the long-awaited report by the intelligence and security committee. It is now unlikely to be published before the election. The dossier is understood to examine the flow of Russian money into UK politics in general and the Conservative party in particular. It looks at the assaults carried out by Russian spies on British soil, including last year\u2019s novichok attack in Salisbury on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, and at attacks on the UK\u2019s allies. Boris Johnson has told Northern Ireland businesses they can put customs declarations forms \u201cin the bin\u201d because there will be \u201cno barriers of any kind\u201d to trade crossing the Irish Sea, PA Media reports. The Prime Minister has suggested Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay had been wrong to say goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would face checks as a result of the Brexit deal struck with the European Union. Barclay previously told MPs that \u201csome information\u201d and \u201cminimal targeted interventions\u201d would be required on goods travelling between the two areas of the UK, due to Northern Ireland remaining aligned with Dublin and Brussels\u2019 trading rules for agricultural products and manufactured items as part of the exit terms. Labour activists know that their success in this election will rely to a large extent on mobilising younger voters who support Jeremy Corbyn. To try to encourage young voters to register, activists from the grime inflected #FckBoris campaign, who organised mass protests on the PM\u2019s first day in power, are publicising more than two dozen \u201cDIY register &amp; Rave parties\u201d in towns and cities across the UK. Rosa Caradonna, activist in the #FckBoris campaign, said: Boris has the backing of millionaires and climate change deniers. He has already tried to block students, young and BAME people voting - and we are saying NAH. We are building a grassroots network of thousands of pissed-off young people who are going to kick Boris out. It\u2019s our generation that have to deal with the worst effects of the climate crisis, rising racism and xenophobia, the destruction of the NHS and years of Tory cuts to our basic services. Not to mention that most of us have thousands of pounds of debt just for trying to get an education. The first register and rave party Glasgow this Saturday, 9 November, while campaigners say they have a register to vote stalls in Barnet and Hendon, north London, today. Next Saturday they plan to take the fight to Boris in his Uxbridge constituency with a \u201cregister to vote parade\u201d, complete with a carnival-style soundsystem on an open top bus. Hello, Damien Gayle taking over the live blog now. Jonathan Freedland\u2019s report of a fourth Labour potential parliamentary candidate being identified as having made antisemitic comments has proven false. We earlier shared on the blog a tweet from the Guardian columnist which claimed to have identified a shortlisted candidate from Birmingham Hall Green as having been fined over comments made on Facebook. Freedland has since deleted his tweets and replaced it with this correction. He later followed up with this apology. BBC Scotland is to stage a general election leaders debate less than 48 hours before the polls open, which could exclude the Scottish Greens or the Brexit party if they fail to stand enough candidates. The broadcaster announced that the live debate would be staged at its Pacific Quay headquarters in Glasgow at 8pm on Tuesday 10 December, but the full line-up of party leaders has not yet been confirmed. The BBC will make an invitation conditional on how many Westminster candidates a party puts up for the election \u2013 risking another bitter row with any parties excluded from taking part. Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP, and Jo Swinson for the Lib Dems, have already protested at decisions by broadcasters to exclude them from some UK-level debates. The Scottish Greens are holding talks later on Friday with the BBC about the threshold it will expect parties to meet. Scotland has 59 Westminster constituencies and the Scottish Greens, which is separate from the Green party of England and Wales, only have candidates for 21 contests at present, with only three or four of its branches still to decide on whether to stand or not. The rest have opted not to put up candidates. Nominations close on 14 November. The BBC expects to have Sturgeon, Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, Jackson Carlaw, interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Lib Dems. Their parties are contesting all 59 seats. The Brexit party has still to declare how many candidates it will stand in Scotland, but may struggle to contest all 59 seats. YouGov has published a thread with predicted voting intentions in the general election by region. This just in from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: Several commentators wonder why the shortlist of Conservative candidates for Bassetlaw, a potential swing seat the Tories will need to target, has only been announced today. Bassetlaw was held by Labour MP John Mann from 2001 to 2019, before he stepped down to become a member of the House of Lords. The constituency has not been won by the Conservatives since 1924, but had a 67 per cent vote for leave in the 2016 referendum. Bassetlaw is making headlines with the deselection of Labour candidate Sally Gimson who was barred from standing by the NEC after internal complaints were made against her. Mann called the removal of Gimson a Momentum \u201cstitch-up\u201d. This from the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman: My colleague Rajeev Syal has written about the former Labour candidate Gideon Bull, who pulled out of the election race for the Clacton seat after accusations that he used the insulting term \u201cShylock\u201d in a meeting attended by a Jewish councillor. Here\u2019s an excerpt: Bull told the Guardian he made the comment in a clumsy attempt to describe a person who relentlessly tries to get what they want. \u201cI\u2019m standing down because I don\u2019t want anything to deflect from the fact that Clacton has had years of neglect under the Tories. It was an honest mistake. The fact that there was a Jewish councillor in the room had no bearing on me saying it.\u201d Bull claims he did not realise the character from The Merchant of Venice was Jewish and said he would have known if his schooling had been better. The Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger has criticised he BBC for excluding Jo Swinson from the standoff debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, arguing the decision granted an exclusive platform to two pro-Brexit leaders. A third Labour candidate in one day has been been embroiled in controversy surrounding allegations of antisemitism. Jewish News reported that Laura McAlpine, the party\u2019s candidate for Harlow, defended her chief campaigner after he wrote about a \u201cJewish final solution\u201d to the Israel and Palestine conflict. McAlpine, who is aiming to unseat the Tory MP Robert Halfon, refused to condemn the remarks of Brett Hawksbee, despite a party official having warned that Hawksbee had \u201cbreached IHRA (the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism) in almost every single way possible\u201d, the article stated. Hawksbee blogged in September 2018: \u201cThe fear of many on the left is that the ideological successors of the bombers of the King David hotel, the mass murderers who decimated Deir Yassin, would be quite happy to see a pogrom in Gaza and the West Bank, a Jewish final solution to the Palestine problem.\u201d According to the article, one email circulated to Labour staffers stated that McAlpine \u201cisn\u2019t happy with the first line (of the apology) because she doesn\u2019t want to be disloyal to someone who \u2018organises so much for her and who she is on the phone with three times a day\u2019\u201d. Boris Johnson has turned his failed \u201cBrexit - do or die\u201d pledge into a \u201cdo or dry\u201d, claiming he has given up alcohol until after Brexit is sorted, PA Media reports. But according to the report, the prime minister was \u201cwatched sipping whisky during a distillery visit in Scotland on Thursday, casting doubt on his commitment to the alcohol ban\u201d. His [\u201cdo or dry\u201d] remark came while chatting about health matters with nurses at the King\u2019s Mill hospital in Nottinghamshire. Johnson asked them to tell him more about the local Ashfield area, noting: \u201cSomeone said there\u2019s a lot of first-time mums who are smoking or something like that. Is that right?\u201d The PM was told a lot of people smoke in Ashfield, before he switched his attention to vaping, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not certain about it. It might just encourage them to get into nicotine.\u201d He then asked: \u201cWhat about alcohol?\u201d before adding: \u201cI\u2019ve had to give it up until we get Brexit done.\u201d Johnson did not clarify whether he meant the first phase of Brexit \u2013 until the end of January 2020 \u2013 or the end of the transition period \u2013 in December next year \u2013 or what would happen if the UK remained in the EU. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will face each other in a live BBC debate in Southampton on 6 December just six days before Britons head to the polls. The BBC will also present a live seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK\u2019s major political parties on 29 November in Cardiff. The Today presenter and former BBC political editor Nick Robinson, who will present the two debates, said he hoped they would \u201cilluminate the choice we all face between competing parties, leaders, policies and visions for the country\u201d. This from Kamal Ahmed, the BBC\u2019s editorial director: Nicola Sturgeon had previously described the decision by Sky to only invite Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson for a live debate as \u201coutrageous\u201d: A good point made by the Sun\u2019s Kate Ferguson: This from my colleague Kate Proctor, reporting from Nigel Farage\u2019s rally in Pontypool, south Wales. Pontypool is in the Torfaen constituency, which has been held by the Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds since 2015. As predicted by some, the official Twitter account of the Conservative party just shared a meme featuring Nicola Sturgeon with a miniature Jeremy Corbyn in her pocket. Many of you, dear readers, will remember the original, a billboard showing Ed Miliband stuffed into the pocket of Alex Salmond, with some believing it was this poster that forced Miliband to rule out an SNP coalition during the 2015 general election campaign. While Nicola Sturgeon used her election campaign launch speech to declare war on Boris Johnson, he was given a tour of a school and tried to make a clay figure inspired by British sculptor Sir Antony Gormley, PA Media reports: Speaking at the George Spencer Academy, near Nottingham, the prime minister remarked he had \u201cgunk\u201d on him before declaring the task would be \u201ca piece of cake\u201d. But seconds later, Johnson paused before joking: \u201cIt\u2019s all going horribly wrong\u201d as he had not followed the guide, and noted he was creating a figure similar to \u201cTerminator\u201d. He also told pupils: \u201cHe\u2019s an interesting chap Antony Gormley \u2013 all his sculptures are modelled on himself and then he persuades people to pay colossal sums for his own image around the world. It\u2019s amazing success he\u2019s had.\u201d Political commentators widely consider Sturgeon\u2019s hints that Labour might support a second Scottish referendum a boost for the Tory campaign. This from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: And this from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield: This from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall on Sturgeon\u2019s speech, making a point others have previously made about the Catalonia independence referendum: Here are Sturgeon\u2019s comments on the possibility of a hung parliament, courtesy of the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: Will Nicola Sturgeon also demand that the Trident missile system be moved from Scottish waters before she will support a Corbyn government? This from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith: Sturgeon said her party would not lend support to any party that would stand in the way of a new Scottish independence referendum. It will be interesting to see how this pledge will be compatible with her statement that the SNP MPs \u201cwould seek to form a progressive alliance to lock the Tories out of government\u201d. This is the take of Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: This from Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen: Sturgeon wraps up and says she looks forward to the campaign trail. My colleague Severin Carrell asks: One of the key challenges for Corbyn would be getting a budget passed. Would the SNP not pass that budget if Labour wouldn\u2019t support another Scottish referendum? Sturgeon says it can\u2019t be expected of the SNP to support anybody who doesn\u2019t recognise the Scottish right to self-determination. Sturgeon adds that Corbyn is someone who supports self-determination \u201cfor literally every other country in the world\u201d. It would be \u201cmighty strange\u201d if he didn\u2019t support it for Scotland. We don\u2019t even know whether Jeremy Corbyn would campaign for remain or leave, Sturgeon says. That\u2019s why voting SNP is the best way for the Scottish to avoid Brexit, she adds. Any party that doesn\u2019t offer another Scottish independence referendum would not be supported, Sturgeon says. But there are many other significant issues facing Scotland, such as devolution and climate change. Sturgeon says the PM is not a man whose word can be taken seriously. When asked whether she would seek to prevent a Tory government by putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10, she says she\u2019s no fan of Jeremy Corbyn and that she would never support a Conservative government. Nicola Sturgeon just delivered her campaign launch speech. She said Scotland had world-class institutions and should be entering a \u201cgolden era\u201d. \u201cIf you are sick of the chaos ... vote SNP to escape Brexit,\u201d she said. People who despair over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s lack of leadership should also vote SNP. The SNP would support revoking article 50, she tells a reporter but reiterates that Scotland needs to take its fate into its own hands. My colleague Kate Proctor will be reporting from a Nigel Farage rally in Wales this morning. My colleague Severin Carrell, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, will be at the SNP\u2019s election campaign launch with Nicola Sturgeon near Holyrood, and will keep us updated on the campaign of the Scottish Greens, which is set to launch at 11.30. There is no love lost between the two parties, he says. The Greens are refusing to stand down candidates in key marginals, on a pro-indy pro-remain alliance basis. My colleague Jonathan Freedland is talking about the shambolic start to the general election campaign on the latest episode of the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast. Boris Johnson told broadcast reporters today that suggesting the NHS could be up for grabs under his deal was \u201cpure Loch Ness monster\u201d territory, the Press Association reports. Asked whether he would legislate to protect the NHS from US intervention, the PM said: We can do free trade deals with countries around the world but under us the NHS is not for sale. It\u2019s not going to be on any kind of international trade negotiation. This is pure Loch Ness monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff. The NHS, free at the point of use, is a fantastic service and we not only believe in it, but are investing more in it than at any time in recent memory and we\u2019ll continue to do so. And back to election fever. Rumours say the former Labour MP Roger Godsiff, who was axed by the Labour party as its candidate for Birmingham Hall Green over comments on LGBT teaching, is to be replaced with Ibrahim Dogus, the mayor of Lambeth, who is backed by the Labour leadership and trade unions. Dogus was previously in the running to stand in Labour-held Vauxhall to replace Kate Hoey, but lost to Florence Eshalomi. In other news: The 30% Club, which campaigns for better gender balance through voluntary action from businesses, has launched its The Missing Millions report at the London Stock Exchange Group this morning. According to the report, companies that fail to prioritise gender equality are missing out on millions of pounds. The report quotes a US study of 350 start-ups founded and co-founded by women, which reveals they generated 10% more in cumulative revenue over a five-year period and delivered twice as much for every dollar invested as those set up by men. Neither Labour nor the Conservatives are off to a good start today, with a video of Boris Johnson stating falsehoods about post-Brexit trade with Northern Ireland circulating widely, and the fall of two Labour candidates for the upcoming general election because of anti-Semitism allegations. There is much anger and scorn on the wires about both situations. This from Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer: And this from MailOnline\u2019s Jack Maidment: And here we have the same point made by the Lib Dem\u2019s Tom Brake: This from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges on the two disgraced Labour candidates: This from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield: According to LBC, the Labour candidate Ian Byrne, who is running in the safe seat of Liverpool West Derby, is responsible for a number of misogynist social media comments against female politicians. In a post on Facebook in 2015 about Michelle Mone, the founder of underwear brand Ultimo, he called on his supporters to \u201chit the c**t where it hurts\u201d. It emerged yesterday that the Tory candidate Nick Conrad will not stand in the Broadland seat in Norfolk, due to controversial comments about rape in 2014. My colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson has written a story on how thousands of children in care whose immigration status will be affected by Brexit could face homelessness, immigration detention or deportation. This from Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner: Nancy Kelley, deputy chief executive of NatCen Social Research, has written an interesting comment about the voting age for the Times Red Box, stating that the majority of the public (60 per cent) think we should leave things as they are, while 19 per cent think 16 and 17 year olds should be allowed to vote, and 16 per cent say the voting age should be raised to 21. \u201cNearly a quarter of those aged 65 or over think older is better when it comes to voting in general elections,\u201d she writes. Quick reminder that\u2019s it worth refreshing this blog every once in a while, as sometimes posts get amended, but especially if you dislike typos. The SNP parliamentary leader, Ian Blackford, told the Today programme that his partywas \u201cdetermined\u201d to pass legislation that would allow it to hold another referendum on Scottish independence. He added that the referendum needed to happen in 2020, so that Scotland could inform the EU of its wish to remain and then move into independent EU membership. Asked whether the SNP would be prepared to support Jeremy Corbyn if he offered a referendum, Blackford said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of supporting Jeremy Corbyn, because it\u2019s a question that we would put to whoever is in 10 Downing Street, that they must respect the votes of the people of Scotland. \u201cWe\u2019ve won every election over the course of the last few years in Scotland, but crucially we won a mandate to have a referendum on Scottish independence.\u201d A second Scottish Labour election candidate has been dropped after she posted an image on Twitter which appeared to threaten the Scottish National party candidate Joanna Cherry, who is defending her seat of Edinburgh South West. Frances Hoole was selected to stand against Cherry, who won Edinburgh South West in 2015 and held it in 2017. She was brought before Scottish Labour national executive on Wednesday after posting a composite image of Cherry\u2019s face being sprayed from a Cillit Bang household cleaner bottle with the caption \u201cBang. And the terf is gone.\u201d \u201cTerf\u201d is the term used by trans-rights activists to describe women who are critics as \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminists\u201d. Cherry has been a leading figure in the campaign by women parliamentarians and activists in the SNP challenging some gender-recognition plans, including altering census questions. Hoole apologised on Twitter and told the Edinburgh Evening News she accepted her tweet was unacceptable and apologised. \u201cI am genuinely really sorry I posted it. I\u2019m sorry about the violent content. \u201cI apologised about the actual content of the meme. It was silly, I posted it without looking very hard at it.\u201d Her removal came on the same day another Scottish Labour candidate, Kate Ramsden, stood down in Gordon in north east Scotland after a blog emerged where she described Israel as \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d. According to the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson, an alliance of 51 Labour MPs has signed a letter pledging \u201cto campaign to Remain in any confirmatory referendum\u201d. Signatories include Wes Streeting, David Lammy, Margaret Beckett, Rosie Duffield and Helen Hayes. The letter states: Nothing in politics is inevitable. Brexit can be stopped, but only through the Labour Party. Remain Labour is pleased to announce that 51 Labour Parliamentary Candidates have signed an election pledge which states: \u201cLabour is committed to a confirmatory referendum, to give you the final say on Brexit. If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.\u201d Below is the current list of signatories to the pledge, which we fully expect to grow during the campaign. If you are a candidate who would like to sign our pledge, please contact laura@remain-labour.co.uk. Tonia Antoniazzi, Gower Margaret Beckett, Derby South Ben Bradshaw, Exeter Ruth Cadbury, Brentford and Isleworth Janet Daby, Lewisham East Geraint Davies, Swansea West Thangam Debbonaire, Bristol West Stephen Doughty, Cardiff South and Penarth Rosie Duffield, Canterbury Maria Eagle, South Liverpool and Halewood Paul Farrelly, Newcastle-under-Lyme Vicky Foxcroft, Lewisham Deptford Helen Hayes, Dulwich and West Norwood Darren Jones, Bristol North Susan Jones, Clwyd South Ged Killen, Rutherglen and Hamilton West Peter Kyle, Hove David Lammy, Tottenham Kerry McCarthy, Bristol East Siobhain McDonagh, Mitcham and Morden Alison McGovern, Wirral South Catherine McKinnell, Newcastle upon Tyne Anna McMorrin, Cardiff North Ian Murray, Edinburgh South Madeleine Moon, Bridgend Stephen Morgan, Portsmouth South Mathew Pennycook, Greenwich and Woolwich Steve Reed, Croydon North Ellie Reeves, Lewisham West and Penge Andy Slaughter, Hammersmith and Fulham Wes Streeting, Ilford North Paul Sweeney, Glasgow North East Jo Stevens, Cardiff Central Gareth Thomas, Harrow West Anna Turley, Redcar Daniel Zeichner, Cambridge Marina Ahmad, Beckenham Callum Anderson, South West Bedfordshire Fleur Anderson, Putney Karen Davies, Norwich North Pam Duncan-Glancy, Glasgow North Rachel Eden, Reading West Flo Eshalomi, Vauxhall Dan Greef, South Cambridgeshire Faten Hameed, Glasgow Central Peter Lamb, Crawley Martin McCluskey, Inverclyde Cheryl Pidgeon, Rushcliffe Moira Ramage, Paisley and Renfrewshire Matt Uberoi, Chelsea and Fulham Emma Whysall, Chipping Barnet The crossbench peer Gus O\u2019Donnell has said on the Today programme that the future chancellor would have to increase taxes in order to fund the government\u2019s and the opposition\u2019s current spending promises. \u201cWhen you look at the big capital spending increases \u2013 it\u2019s about 50 billion for Labour, 20 billion for the Conservatives - do we have the capacity?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe civil servants who are writing their briefing packs for the incoming ministers for various parties will be thinking: well what could you spend this on? \u201cWhat\u2019s, as it were, shovel ready? Will you get good value for money if you rush at it this quickly? \u201cSo I think there\u2019ll be lots of bottlenecks.\u201d The Liberal Democrat MP for Edinburgh West, Christine Jardine, has criticised the SNP\u2019s push for another independence referendum, and told Sky that she believes the SNP needs \u201cto start thinking about what\u2019s best for the people of Scotland, not independence\u201d. The Clacton Labour candidate, Gideon Bull, has quit over the accusation that he used an antisemitic term in front of a Jewish Labour councillor. According to the BBC\u2019s Simon Dedman, Bull admitted in an interview with BBC Essex to using the term \u201cShylock\u201d in a meeting, but added: \u201cThe allegation that I called a Jewish cabinet member \u2018Shylock\u2019 is entirely false.\u201d While on the campaign trail, Boris Johnson promised there won\u2019t be any checks on goods coming from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK, a comment that has caused much furore on Twitter. This from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll: And this from Sky\u2019s deputy political editor, Sam Coates: And this from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall: While membership growth is of course a boost for Labour\u2019s chances at the polls next month, it remains to be seen whether the party will be able to overcome scepticism amongst moderate supporters. Mike Gapes, the long-standing MP for Ilford South, who left the Labour party earlier this year, accused Shami Chakrabarti of \u201cwhitewashing\u201d in regard to her comments today on antisemitism. The Spectator\u2019s editor, Fraser Nelson, has gone as far as suggesting that Tom Watson\u2019s resignation as the party\u2019s deputy leader and Ian Austin\u2019s decision to leave the party and endorse the Conservatives is a sign that \u201ctrue Labour supporters need to vote for Boris Johnson\u201d. Labour party membership numbers are recovering, according to PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield. In July, it emerged that tens of thousands of members had quit, causing membership to shrink to less than half a million. The Labour peer and shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the Labour party had dragged its feet over complaints about antisemitism. When asked about an opinion poll in the Jewish Chronicle newspaper, according to which the vast majority of British Jews consider Jeremy Corbyn to be an antisemite, she responded: \u201cThat obviously is incredibly alarming and disappointing. Because we dragged our feet on implementation for so long there is a trust gap. \u201cAnd so even though I believe that our procedures are way better now than they were a few years ago, it\u2019s going to take time to rebuild trust, and it\u2019s going to take more than procedures.\u201d Chakrabarti also described Labour\u2019s pledge to change the way women are treated at work as \u201cperhaps the most radical offer to women in 50 years\u201d. Under a Labour-led government, mothers will be given maternity pay for a full year after the birth of their children and all employees will have a right to work flexibly, according to the party\u2019s manifesto. Hello, I\u2019m taking over the blog from my colleague Kate Lyons. The SNP is launching its election campaign today. Hours ahead of the launch, the party\u2019s official Twitter account shared an article from the Scotsman, in which it was reported yesterday that Boris Johnson would not allow another Scottish independence referendum, and that the PM had claimed the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and Jeremy Corbyn were \u201cyoke-mates of destruction\u201d over the threat they both pose to the future of the UK. Sturgeon is to seek a section 30 order before the end of the year from whoever will be the next PM, which would allow Scotland to stage another vote on leaving the UK. Speaking before the launch, Sturgeon said: A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit and to give people in Scotland the chance to choose a better future as an independent country so we never have to worry about our NHS being sold off by a Westminster government. [...] And while the Scottish parliament has control of health policy, we cannot currently stop Westminster signing away that protection in a trade deal, or entering agreements that dramatically push up drug prices or risk our public services, including the NHS. Boris Johnson has been very clear about his desire for a post-Brexit trade deal with Donald Trump \u2013 and no one should underestimate the threat which that poses. PA Media has this report on Margaret Hodge\u2019s interview on BBC Radio 4 this morning: Hodge, when asked who she would prefer to have as prime minister \u2013 Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 said: \u201cI want a Labour government.\u201d When pressed on the issue, the Labour candidate told the Today programme: \u201cI think any government is more than any individual. And I want a Labour government. And I think that was as true of the past as it is of the present.\u201d She told the programme there are parts of the current Labour project with which she disagrees: \u201cI will not give up fighting for what I believe to be right and moral and important. I will never do that.\u201d Hodge said there was \u201csome hostility\u201d to the work she had done around fighting antisemitism, adding: \u201cI do think it\u2019s a terrible reflection that actually there is myself and Ruth Smeeth and we\u2019re the only two women Jewish MPs left on the Labour side.\u201d The papers Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, on Boris Johnson: What\u2019s happening today? Nigel Farage is heading to Wales and will be attending a rally for the Brexit party in Pontypool at about midday and then another at Newport in the evening. Labour will be holding a lunchtime event in Stevenage featuring Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, who announced last night she would be throwing her hat into the ring for the job of deputy Labour leader. Jo Swinson is in Fife and Boris Johnson is on pooled visits, though it\u2019s unclear exactly where. The list of candidates who have stood down for inappropriate behaviour continues to grow. A former radio host running as a Conservative candidate for Broadland in Norfolk withdrew from the race after saying women should keep their \u201cknickers on\u201d to avoid rape and a Labour candidate who had been standing for Gordon in Aberdeenshire announced she would no longer run after it emerged she had made comments comparing Israel to \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d. Roger Godsiff, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hall Green, was among those told this week by the national executive committee that he would not be endorsed as a Labour candidate over his support for people protesting against the teaching of LGBT equality classes at a local school. He has confirmed he will run as an Independent Labour candidate. Good morning! It\u2019s day two of the election campaign and we hope you\u2019re still brimful of energy for political news. I\u2019m Kate Lyons and will be bringing you the day\u2019s political news early in the morning, before I hand over the blog. As usual, you can get in touch via Twitter or email. The parties have started unveiling their plans and promises as leaders travel the country, laying out their stalls for election. Boris Johnson has announced a plan for half-price visas and preferential immigration processes for doctors and nurses wanting to work in the UK. The new NHS visa would cost just \u00a3464 and would operate under a fast-track process, with applicants guaranteed a decision within two weeks. Labour has unveiled its plans to improve equality in the workplace, pledging to introduce maternity pay for a full year after the birth of a child and give workers the rights to choose hours that suit them, putting the onus on employers to explain why they cannot offer flexible working hours. The announcement comes as the shock of Tom Watson\u2019s resignation as deputy leader continues to ripple through the party. Watson\u2019s allies have called his decision a \u201cbig loss\u201d for the centre, with one saying \u201cit leaves some of us feeling abandoned. Tom was our shield.\u201d The race to replace him has already begun, with Dawn Butler, the women\u2019s and equalities shadow minister, the first to announce she will be throwing her hat in the ring for the job. Rajeev Syal has written this guide to the runners and riders for the job. But both parties have been warned by the Institute of Fiscal Studies about their ambitious spending promises, saying that the public spending bidding war Labour and the Conservatives are engaged in may return infrastructure investment back to 1970s levels, but may also be undeliverable.

      "bodyText": "The spectacle of Boris Johnson in a suit is increasingly disconcerting. Everything the prime minister says would make much more sense if he was wearing just his pants and a three-day-old dressing gown, and slurring, \u201cI promise you I\u2019ll CHANGE \u2026\u201d at one of the mothers of his children. It goes without saying that he might win a majority. Then again, he might not. It\u2019s certainly been quite a taboo-busting start to the Conservatives\u2019 election campaign, featuring monstrous Grenfell insults, allegations of deliberately collapsed rape trials, and the blithe suggestion that Jeremy Corbyn might literally shoot the rich. I think this is the bit where we\u2019re meant to ask what they call their act, and for Johnson to triumphantly declare: \u201cThe Aristocrats!\u201d Either way, it has felt worth remembering all week that Johnson did actually have a clear majority for something. Namely, his Brexit deal, which was voted in favour of three weeks ago, but which he then went and pulled, on the pretext that the House of Commons asked for more than 15 minutes or so to debate it. Had the PM permitted parliament that non-luxury, he could have passed it into law and gone to the country with it in his back pocket, with Nigel Farage a more neutered force, and a few more weeks\u2019 election planning than those that have yielded the current masterclass. But he knew best. Or did he? This remains to be seen, but if it turns out that Johnson needlessly brought about his own downfall via misplaced pride, it will be awkward to know quite what to say. Other than: don\u2019t suppose you know any Ancient Greek, babe? Because I heard they had a word for this. I\u2019ll lend you a Ladybird book about it while you contemplate a future phoning your speaking agent to scream: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d book Stephen Fry and not me \u2013 I\u2019m a 10th of his price!\u201d On the subject of presumably competitively priced after-dinner speakers, what a week to learn that Theresa May has been signed up to the circuit, believed to have fought off a bid from the speaking clock for her services. May bills herself as a specialist in \u201cinspiring lives\u201d and how to \u201cachieve progress\u201d. Why not just add election-winning and contemporary streetdance? In for a penny; in for an unspecified number of pounds an hour. The news did seem to confirm that irony-manufacture is our sole thriving industry. Indeed, merely hours after both Sajid Javid and John McDonnell promised \u00a322bn and \u00a355bn of investment respectively, it was revealed that Crossrail is currently going to be at least three years late and several billion over budget. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is advising huge caution over both Javid and McDonnell\u2019s promises, but it feels perfectly conceivable to imagine either of these chancellors getting at least one set of public lavatories and a couple of extra tube stops for their promised bazillions, albeit not until the turn of the 2030s.

A survey of lead councillors for children\u2019s services in England just published by the Local Government Association delivers a devastating assessment of the factors behind massive and rising demand, while the same relentless cuts fuelling it prevent local authorities from providing the care and support that is so badly needed. While much of the debate about council funding has focused on adult social care, the survey reveals that for each of the three years between 2015 and 2018, well over half the councils had to make significant cuts to children\u2019s services. Half of the 152 councils in England responded to the survey, with 47% saying that budget shortfalls last year created a severe or significant risk to children\u2019s social care. Cuts to services such as policing and youth work are aggravating factors, and there are major concerns about what will happen following the end of the current budget for the Troubled Families programme. Against this backdrop of financial atrophy, demand for services is swelling. Around 64% of the lead councillors said the number or complexity of children\u2019s cases had increased \u201cto a great extent\u201d over the past four years. Poverty and its consequences are pushing this demand. Of the councils seeing rising need, 81% said it was being driven by escalating family conflict, with causes such as domestic abuse, substance misuse and criminality, while 70% said growing family hardship \u2013 such as poverty, poor housing and debt \u2013 had played a part. Austerity drives people struggling to keep their lives together over the edge. Two years ago, the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services warned that the relentless cuts were pushing families into crisis, as punitive welfare policies such as the two-child limit and housing benefit cuts \u2013 imposed by politicians with little understanding of the reality of many people\u2019s lives \u2013 took their toll. In 2017/18, more than 75,000 children were in care \u2013 an increase of 24% in a decade. More than 170,000 child in need assessments that year identified domestic abuse is a factor \u2013 a scandalous number and a quarter of the total.

It is sickening to see them report that the Homelessness Reduction Act 2018 has driven up homelessness. As well as exacerbating the conditions that lead to children being harmed, austerity has stripped away vital support to cope with the consequences. To give just one example, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that local authorities in England cut their spending on domestic violence refuges by 24% between 2010 and 2017. Last year\u2019s home affairs select committee report on domestic abuse said the impact on children included mental illness, education difficulties, poor cognitive development and trauma from parental breakup. Children make up around half the residents of women\u2019s refuges, but support for them is often poor. The pattern seen with domestic abuse \u2013 austerity driving up demand and driving down support \u2013 is mirrored in areas such as substance abuse and homelessness. With both Conservatives and Labour promising a post-election spending spree, it is tempting to believe that the dark clouds of austerity will soon lift, but they will not. Even if there is a sudden increase in local government funding for day-to-day services \u2013 and it is far from clear that will happen \u2013 it will take years to rebuild lost capacity such as the hundreds of shuttered Sure Start centres, countless voluntary sector programmes and the loss of experienced staff. Unless there is a surprise in their manifesto, the Conservatives show no sign of recanting on their welfare reforms, and the practical and emotional damage already inflicted on families on the edge will endure for many years whatever the policy changes. Austerity has assailed children from every angle, fracturing their homes and depriving them and their families of help. \u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2019.

Although the ruling socialist party (PSOE) won the most votes in the last election seven months ago, it fell short of a majority and was unable to enlist the necessary support to form a government.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Spain heading to the polls so often?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Spanish politics has grown increasingly fragmented and polarised over recent years. The PSOE and their conservative rivals in the People\u2019s party (PP) ruled for decades until their duopoly was challenged by the emergence of the anti-austerity Podemos (We Can) party and the centre-right Citizens party.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The political picture has been further complicated by the advent of Vox, the first far-right party to win more than a single seat in congress since Spain\u2019s return to democracy, and by the appearance of M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds, a new leftwing party led by I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, one of the founders of Podemos.</p>\n    <p>That means there are now three parties chasing votes on the left, and three chasing votes on the right.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What will happen on Sunday? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The PSOE is once again expected to finish first, but it will almost certainly fall well short of a majority and could lose a few of the 123 seats it won last time. The PP is predicted to rally after April\u2019s abysmal performance, Citizens to plummet, Unidas Podemos to dip slightly, and Vox to surge ahead, possibly becoming the third biggest party in congress.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>And then? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Back to the negotiating table and a familiar sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. With rightwing parties unlikely to win the 176 seats needed for a majority in the 350-seat parliament between them, it will again be up the PSOE to try to cut a deal with Podemos and others to regain office. Past experiences suggest the negotiations will be long, difficult and quite possibly fruitless.

      "bodyText": "The two women who stand chatting in the porch of San Gin\u00e9s church in Guadalajara on a crisp November afternoon speak eloquently for a large portion of the Spanish nation. \u201cEstoy hasta el gorro,\u201d says one after shaking her head and delivering a fusillade of sighs: I\u2019m sick to the back teeth of it all. Her companion nods: \u201cWe need a government that can actually govern.\u201d Like most Spaniards, the pair, who do not want to give their names nor say how they would vote, are not relishing Sunday\u2019s general election \u2013 the country\u2019s fourth in as many years. \u201cI just feel fed up and defrauded,\u201d says the first woman. \u201cNone of the politicians here seems to get it. We can\u2019t go on like this. We can\u2019t go on with more and more problems and more and more unemployment. People keep saying things are getting better but they\u2019re not.\u201d The latest general election comes just seven months after the previous one, and fewer than six months after European, regional and municipal elections were held. Since the end of April, the country has been in the hands of the acting government of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose ruling Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) won the last election but failed to win a majority. The PSOE\u2019s attempts to form a government came to nothing after the centre-right Citizens party ruled out any form of co-operation, and efforts to make a deal with the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos also proved fruitless. S\u00e1nchez claims that his rivals\u2019 intransigence left him with no choice but to call another election. The timing, however, is far from ideal. The bitterly divisive question of Catalan independence re-erupted last month after Spain\u2019s supreme court jailed nine separatist leaders for sedition over their roles in the failed push for independence two years ago, prompting violent protests on the streets of Barcelona. The unrest was seized on by the parties of the Spanish right, who accused S\u00e1nchez of weakness in the face of such separatist provocation. It has proved a particular gift to the far-right Vox party, which has seen a surge in support amid its calls for a radical recentralisation of Spain. Polls suggest the party could now become the country\u2019s third largest political force after the PSOE and the socialists\u2019 traditional rival, the conservative People\u2019s party (PP). The Citizens party looks set to pay a high price for its decision to forfeit the centre ground and lurch to the right in the hope of competing with the PP and Vox. If recent polls prove accurate, the party will see its seat count tumble from 57 to 20 or fewer. To make matters worse, Spain\u2019s unemployment figures rose by almost 100,000 in October and the European commission has revised the country\u2019s growth forecast down from 2.3% to 1.9% for this year, and from 1.9% to 1.5% for 2020. Then there is the question of frustration and apathy. In April, turnout reached 75.5%, well up from the 69.8% of voters who headed to the polls in June 2016. Jos\u00e9 Pablo Ferr\u00e1ndiz, chief researcher for the polling firm Metroscopia, believes turnout will be somewhere around 70% on Sunday. In places such as Guadalajara, which lies an hour\u2019s drive north-east of Madrid in Castilla-La Mancha, Citizens\u2019 collapse could be Vox\u2019s triumph. Six months ago, the PSOE, the PP and Citizens each took one of the province\u2019s three seats, with the latter edging out Vox by fewer than 3,500 votes. \u201cIf you look at the map of the last election, the people scrapping over the last seat in many places were Citizens and Vox,\u201d said Ferr\u00e1ndiz. \u201cCitizens won them last time round, but the party\u2019s fall means that Vox won\u2019t need to pick up many more votes to take them.\u201d Although the PSOE are again expected to finish first, polls suggest they may lose some of the 123 seats they won in April. \u201cS\u00e1nchez thought he\u2019d keep the voters who supported him six months ago but also pick up some more from Citizens and so win a larger majority,\u201d said Ferr\u00e1ndiz. \u201cBut neither of those things appears to be happening. The battle is now between the other parties on the right \u2013 and abstention.\u201d In keeping with the growing political fragmentation of recent years, things are also growing crowded on the Spanish left, with the PSOE and Podemos now joined by M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds (More Country), a party led by \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, one of the founders of Podemos. Whatever the result this weekend, negotiations to form a government promise to be as fraught and tortuous as last time, and a renewed impasse beckons. Despite the weariness though, Vox is not the only party looking forward to Sunday. The PP is expected to bounce back from its terrible showing in April, while the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) \u2013 the largest and most moderate of Catalonia\u2019s three pro-independence parties \u2013 is expected to finish first in the region and perhaps extend its lead over the Catalan branch of the socialist party. The ERC favours a less confrontational and more pragmatic approach to the quest for Catalan independence than Together for Catalonia, the separatist party led by the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. The strategy appears to be paying off in a large chunk for the region \u2013 where many people are still furious over the supreme court\u2019s verdict. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re the ones who can make more progress than anybody else because we keep our ideas but we have a plan to implement the republic, even if it\u2019s not magic and we\u2019re not saying that things can be done overnight,\u201d said Alfred Bosch, the ERC politician who serves as the region\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cPerhaps that looks more realistic and more appealing.\u201d Realism may abound in places such as Guadalajara, but political appeal is in rather shorter supply. Jes\u00fas Iglesias, a 49-year-old security guard from the city, lists his worries as he takes a cigarette break: pensions; the cost of renting; the situation in Catalonia, and what he sees as an excess of ineffectual publicly elected officials. \u201cWe need to get rid of the political old guard and get some new, young people in,\u201d he says. \u201cGiven the size of the country, we have far too many politicians and local councillors.\u201d Iglesias may also be \u201chasta el gorro\u201d, and torn between the PP and Citizens, but he knows he once again has a democratic duty to fulfil on Sunday. And besides: \u201cIf I don\u2019t vote, I can\u2019t complain.\u201d",

Leena Sarah Farhat, from the language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith, said: \u201cIf we can all say \u2018D\u00e1il\u2019 or \u2018Bundestag\u2019 without the need for an official English name, why can\u2019t we do the same with Senedd? We\u2019re calling on our politicians to show confidence in our unique language, confidence in Wales and all its people \u2013 whether they speak Welsh or not \u2013 by giving our Senedd a Welsh-only name, a name that can belong to us all. \u201cMost people already call the institution the \u2018Senedd\u2019 \u2013 just as they proudly sing the Welsh words of our national anthem. Everyone, from every background, has the right to celebrate these uniquely Welsh things, and no-one has the right to tell non-Welsh speakers otherwise. By giving the Senedd an additional English name, it will inevitably lead to less use of the Welsh name.\u201d",
