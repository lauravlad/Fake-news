class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>(This is an expanded and slightly revised version of the snap verdict posted earlier.)</em></p> \n  <p>The conventional wisdom among the punditocracy has been that this was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last chance to change the dynamics of this contest, and if that was the case he didn\u2019t manage it, even though in parts he had the best of the debate. The YouGov poll suggests Boris Johnson narrowly came out on top when viewers were asked who won, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1203072894563213314\">on another measure Corbyn did better.</a></p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s message about Labour not offering certainty on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> is a powerful one, and if anything the PM made it even more effectively tonight than he did in the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago. </p> \n  <p>That said, Corbyn had the best moment, when he came back at Johnson over \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d and said what was a failure of leadership was using racist language. It was a powerful blow, and perhaps the best moment of the debate. After a question about Islamophobia and antisemitism, when Corbyn condemned racism in general terms, but declined to say that Johnson was personally culpable in this regard, Johnson switched the topic back to leadership. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that, you know, Mr Corbyn, I\u2019m sure is very well intentioned. But I think in his handling of this particular issue, his unwillingness to take a stand, to stand up for Jewish people in the Labour party. His unwillingness to protect them, to put an arm round them, is in my view a failure of leadership. You cannot be neutral on questions like this, any more, in my view, than you can try to lead this country and be neutral on the issue of Brexit. It is a failure to take a stand, to have a point of view, that in the end will cost this country gravely and deeply.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>At this point Corbyn hit back:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A failure of leadership is when you use racist remarks to describe people in different countries or in our society. I will never do that and my party will never do that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In the first debate between the two leaders, Johnson\u2019s track record of using racist language in his journalism did not come up at all, and this moment left one wondering if Corbyn should have gone on the offensive on this issue much earlier in the campaign. It was an effective retort, but it did not silence Johnson and he recovered very well by pivoting back to Brexit, and asking of Corbyn\u2019s solution to Brexit: where is it?</p> \n  <p>This has been Johnson\u2019s most powerful message throughout the campaign and tonight, although much of what he said was familiar, he was probably sharper and more incisive on this point than he has been before. He joked about how Corbyn\u2019s Brexit deal would be a \u201cmystery deal\u201d, because it was not clear what would be in it, and how he could not identify who would negotiate it in the shadow cabinet because most of Corbyn\u2019s team back remain. Johnson also claimed that, if he were able to get the UK out of the EU by the end of January next year, investment worth \u00a3150bn would come flooding into the country (an assertion that is unlikely to survive factchecking). For Corbyn, Brexit was defensive territory, but at least the audience was not as sceptical when he was explaining Labour\u2019s policy as it was in the ITV debate and he may have made an impression with his argument that Johnson\u2019s trade deal with the US might take seven years to negotiate \u2013 a point he made repeatedly. </p> \n  <p>Corbyn was better on domestic policy. Although he may have overdone the tendency to reference the 1940s, he was calm and persuasive when arguing that Labour\u2019s plans to increase the level of state spending would only take the UK up towards an EU average, and on crime and the London Bridge terror attacks his points about the impact of prison cuts were at least as potent as anything Johnson said about sentencing.</p> \n  <p>Much of what was said replicated what was said in the ITV debate, and that probably explains why the YouGov snap polling has recorded almost exactly the same verdict as it did last month. The most interesting question of the night came when Nick Robinson asked them which had done most to raise living standards: socialism or capitalism. Because it was a quick-fire round, we just got stock answers. But a one-hour debate between Johnson and Corbyn exploring this topic alone in more detail would have made excellent TV, and would probably have ended up being more illuminating.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T23:10:03.279Z\">at 11.10pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5deac9888f08e7796de8e3c3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T21:39:12.560Z\">9.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">YouGov poll suggests Johnson beat Corbyn by 52% to 48%</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is the verdict from the<strong> YouGov</strong> poll.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1203065175181537280\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Leaving aside your own party preference, who do you think performed best overall in tonight\u2019s debate? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BBCDebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BBCDebate</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BBCLeadersDebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BBCLeadersDebate</a> <br><br>Boris Johnson - 52%<br>Jeremy Corbyn - 48%<br><br>Figures rebased to exclude don't knows<a href=\"https://t.co/Br3goxInv9\">https://t.co/Br3goxInv9</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wn9Dy4XSKw\">pic.twitter.com/wn9Dy4XSKw</a></p>\u2014 YouGov (@YouGov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1203065175181537280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 6, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>This is almost identical to the result of the poll from the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago, which had Johnson winning that encounter by 51% to 49%.

And I say to those of my generation who voted for it, with age can come the wisdom of lived experience. But it is youth that has its finger on the beating pulse of the future and we have no right to steal that future from them.</p> \n   <p>They know the world today works through connections, and Brexit breaks them. They see how success belongs to the open mind; Brexit closes that of their nation. They understand that their hopes will never prosper in the modern world without attachment to the hopes of their neighbours; Brexit throws those hopes on a bonfire of confusion, confusion between national pride and nationalism.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He mocked the claims made by Brexiters in 2016.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Remember when they promised that Britain\u2019s exit would be just the first, and once the rest of Europe saw the genius of our move, they would fall like dominoes.

Instead we are outside their door in anxious supplication. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the DUP were \u201cprime witnesses\u201d to how Boris Johnson could not be trusted.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When John Major and I warned the Irish border would create a dilemma between keeping the Good Friday agreement and undermining it, they derided us, promising the Irish cake would be had and eaten.</p> \n   <p>And now the backstop is a front stop, we have not one border but two and the Democratic Unionists are prime witnesses to the dangers of trusting Boris Johnson.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said it was undemocratic to use a general election to resolve the Brexit issue.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will tell you what is undemocratic: mixing up Brexit with a general election.</p> \n   <p>If Brexit is the question, ask us about Brexit. That is the democratic way. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the Tories did not deserve a majority.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Do not give Boris Johnson a majority, he does not deserve it. This Conservative party which now expels the likes of Michael Heseltine, disowns the statesmanship of John Major.</p> \n   <p>A party whose chancellor, as of July this year, is now exiled in the wilderness for the temerity to say what he knows to be true, namely that a no-deal Brexit is a risk no responsible government would take. Such a Conservative party does not deserve to govern unchecked and the country would not be wise to let them.</p> \n   <p>Some groan at the idea of a hung parliament.

I am voting Labour. But let me put it this way: if you look, constituency by constituency, you will know the best candidates to back. Back them!</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He ended by saying this was the most important election of his lifetime.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Six days to a decision of destiny.

But in at least one policy area there has been a minor retreat. In 2017 <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/labour-manifesto-2017.pdf\">the manifesto (pdf)</a> said Labour would consider the option of a land value tax. However critics attacked the idea as a \u201cgarden tax\u201d and in <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Real-Change-Labour-Manifesto-2019.pdf\">the 2019 version (pdf)</a> this is just an option for commercial property. The manifesto says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A Labour government will review the option of a land value tax on commercial landlords as an alternative [to business rates].</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>John McDonnell,</strong> the shadow chancellor, was asked about this when he did <a href=\"https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/mumsnet_live_events/3760829-Webchat-with-John-McDonnell-Shadow-Chancellor-Friday-6-December-at-12-midday?pg=3&amp;reverse=1\">a webchat with Mumsnet</a> earlier today. This is what he said about the policy.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We haven\u2019t put forward proposals on land tax but are encouraging a debate around land value taxation to ensure that, for example, when developments occur within an area, and individuals or companies benefit from those developments and their land values escalate, whether some of that value should be shared by the wider community. So I give the example in my own constituency, now that Crossrail is going through, paid for by public money, and land values are increasing fairly fast, local people are being squeezed out of being able to purchase a home in the area. One argument around land value taxation in these circumstances is that an element of the increased value going to corporations could assist in our local housing programme, providing benefits for the local people rather than, in some instances, overseas speculators. But there will be a full consultation in all our discussions on this. We will not be considering land value taxation on residential properties but on development land held by businesses and corporations. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"082a1c67ddb763743b086aa21e6b89e74a8df094\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/082a1c67ddb763743b086aa21e6b89e74a8df094/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T18:05:46.153Z\">at 6.05pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea85ba8f08eef22867ed13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T16:46:06.087Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4248d055c6d6c8de2c6a357a256d839c2ef0c0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b4248d055c6d6c8de2c6a357a256d839c2ef0c0/0_65_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson during a visit to the Parkview Community Playgroup at the Hiltingbury Community Centre in Hampshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Swinson during a visit to the Parkview Community Playgroup at the Hiltingbury Community Centre in Hampshire.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea85008f08eef22867ed04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T16:43:17.427Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>By a margin of five to one, voters do think Boris Johnson should agree to an interview with Andrew Neil, according to a YouGov poll.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1202974696322543616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">67% of Brits - including 55% of Tory voters - say that Boris Johnson should sit down to an interview with BBC's Andrew Neil <a href=\"https://t.co/vkoZyFx2uM\">https://t.co/vkoZyFx2uM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xxJ8Bmk4MI\">pic.twitter.com/xxJ8Bmk4MI</a></p>\u2014 YouGov (@YouGov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1202974696322543616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 6, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea82898f08e7796de8e0a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T16:32:23.985Z\">4.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from the former Conservative leader<strong> Iain Duncan Smith.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MPIainDS/status/1202969400514625536\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kinder, gentler politics...during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GE2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GE2019</a>, not at all.

But, with wintry weather forecast across Scotland next Thursday, it does make me wonder how much this election may be dominated by postal voters. </p> \n  <p>The received wisdom is that postal voters tend to be older Tory women. But I\u2019ve been really struck by how many activists of all parties report that of those mortified by Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour in the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on the benches and wotnot, it is older women who are most horrified. </p> \n  <p>Anecdotally, I\u2019ve had lots of these conversations with older voters myself, and don\u2019t forget the Waspi (Women Against State Pensions Inequality) issue, which Johnson has not been convincing on.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/06/general-election-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-final-tv-debate-live-news?page=with:block-5dea337b8f08e7796de8dc5c#block-5dea337b8f08e7796de8dc5c\"> 11.09am.)</a></p> \n  <p>Major is formally endorsing three former Tories who are now running as independents because they had the whip withdrawn after voting to facilitate the Benn Act, the legislation that ruled out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. According to the news release issued in advance, he is backing David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton.</p> \n  <p>Commenting on them, Major will say in a video message:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me make one thing absolutely clear: none of them has left the Conservative party, the Conservative party has left them. Without such talent on its benches, parliament will be the poorer, which is why \u2013 if I were resident in any one of their constituencies \u2013 they would have my vote.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Major is also going to back calls for a second referendum. Addressing young people directly (the rally has been jointly organised with For Our Future\u2019s Sake, a second referendum campaign focusing on young people), he will describe Brexit as \u201cthe worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime\u201d. He will go on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It will affect nearly every single aspect of our lives for many decades to come. It will make our country poorer and weaker. It will hurt most those who have least. Never have the stakes been higher, especially for the young. Brexit may even break up our historic United Kingdom.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And, making the case for a second referendum, he will say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When the nation voted on Brexit, they did so on a diet of fiction and undeliverable promises. As the facts become known, it is extraordinary that a new vote is denied: extraordinary and undemocratic.</p> \n   <p>Your vote is absolutely crucial \u2013 for you have the longest lease on our country\u2019s future, and our place in the wider world \u2026 Don\u2019t wake up on Friday 13 December and regret not making a choice. So choose the future you believe in \u2013 for your own generation and the next.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>According to the news release, Major will say tribal loyalty to a party has its place. But he will also say that no single party has a monopoly on wisdom, and that:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Sometimes you need to vote with your head and your heart for your country and your future ... This is such a time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Like most political parties, the Conservative party has rules saying members are not allowed to endorse other parties at a general election and, from the way the news release is worded, it sounds as if Major wants to avoid anything that would lead to him being thrown out of the party he used to lead.</p> \n  <p>But it is impossible to read these words without concluding that he wants people to vote tactically to deny Johnson a majority. If overturning Brexit is the priority (and the rally is called \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d), then that could only happen if Jeremy Corbyn were to form a government and hold a referendum, or another party were to make a referendum a condition of supporting a minority Tory government.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d02c359e6358c725be355006dc950b1d4d9f23e7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d02c359e6358c725be355006dc950b1d4d9f23e7/4_7_2686_1612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir John Major.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir John Major.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T16:02:48.065Z\">at 4.02pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea62e18f08eef22867eac7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T14:18:00.848Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from <strong>David Merritt</strong>, whose son Jack was killed in the London Bridge terror attack last week. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/butwhatifitsall/status/1202928234373009408\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">POLITICAL TWEET WARNING: Jack Merritt, who lived in a Con held Con/Lib marginal, but who was a natural Labour supporter, was intending to vote tactically next week.

Probably not, he thinks. He explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Opinion pollsters I\u2019ve spoken to this morning are united in saying this row is a less serious problem for Mr Johnson than his opponents think. They offer three broad reasons.</p> \n   <p>First, people will view this row through the prism of their pre-existing support. Voters who dislike Mr Johnson think he is being cowardly. People who warm to him think it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue at the margins,\u201d said Ben Page, head of Ipsos Mori. \u201cThe people it excites are people who already don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Second, the fact that Mr Johnson is appearing in a BBC head-to-head debate with Mr Corbyn tonight helps neutralise the damage. \u201cBack in the 2017 election campaign, Theresa May refused to debate head-on with Corbyn and that undermined her claim to be a strong leader,\u201d said Marcus Roberts, a former Labour strategist now at YouGov. \u201cMany voters will see Johnson debating Corbyn this evening and wonder what the fuss is about Andrew Neil.\u201d</p> \n   <p>A third factor that should not be ignored is that this is a row that helps the Tories. The party is 10 points ahead of Labour in the polls. By filling the airwaves with lots of headlines about what is fundamentally an issue of process, they stop Labour getting on the front foot on issues that really could affect the election, like the state of the National Health Service and public services. In other words, this row suits the Conservatives\u2019 defensive election strategy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T15:29:00.125Z\">at 3.29pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea5c248f08e7796de8de53\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/frances-perraudin\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T13:53:16.265Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Leaked document on trade deal impact on Northern Ireland just 'initial appraisal' by junior officials, government source claims</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A senior government source said the document produced by Labour about the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on trade with Northern Ireland (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/06/general-election-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-final-tv-debate-live-news?page=with:block-5dea25148f08bacaf000b2b4#block-5dea25148f08bacaf000b2b4\">9.59am</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/06/general-election-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-final-tv-debate-live-news?page=with:block-5dea2e508f08e7796de8dc2d#block-5dea2e508f08e7796de8dc2d\">10.45am)</a> was an \u201cinitial appraisal\u201d compiled by junior civil servants that had not been signed off at a senior level.</p> \n  <p>The Conservative party said the document had been produced immediately after Johnson\u2019s deal was struck and was not written, or used, for decision-making purposes. </p> \n  <p>They pointed to a number of question marks in the document, which they said showed it was an incomplete analysis.

Lewie Magarshack, 31, small business worker, South Yorkshire</em></p> \n  <p>If we take \u201cthe north\u201d in its greatest sense then I think there\u2019s a chance that Barrow and Grimsby might go Tory. Ashfield perhaps too, although the flooding may not play in the prime minister\u2019s favour. I have also heard from Labour MPs campaigning in Yorkshire mining communities that they are hearing people go Tory for the first time. It\u2019s an anecdote but an interesting one. On the other hand, it also seems very likely that the Labour vote holds in ultra-marginals because the Brexit party may shave a few thousand off the Tory vote.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What chance does the Brexit party have of winning any seat and continuing to function as a party if the conservatives win the GE? Jonathan, 22, games designer, Sheffield</em></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s difficult to see that they have a realistic chance of winning any seat. Early on, there was hope in Hartlepool, which is why the party\u2019s most senior figure after Farage, Richard Tice, decided to run in that seat. But people on the ground there say they think they will even struggle to get the vote out at all, let alone get a surge for one particular party over another. This does appear to be a recurring theme \u2013 people who just don\u2019t have the desire to vote at all.

Will they pick up many votes from \u201cnon-voters\u201d? Tee, 32, Bristol</em></p> \n  <p>They are proposing reform to the voting system by looking at more proportional methods and by introducing citizens\u2019 initiatives to allow people to call referendums if there are 5 million registered voter signatures. This proposal for direct democracy is a highly unusual addition to government, particularly for the UK, although something similar exists in Switzerland. It could be possible they pick up the vote of typical \u201cnon-voters\u201d. Certainly on the doorsteps people have said the only time they ever voted in their lives was for leave in the EU referendum. This might work in the Brexit party\u2019s favour at the ballot box. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Is covering the Brexit party as soul-crushingly depressing as it sounds? Tom, Lewisham </em></p> \n  <p>No not at all! It\u2019s been really fascinating to see how Farage still operates after 25 years in politics and if his message cuts through. He is a performer and seems to really animate the audiences he assembles around him. Although these gatherings are a tenth of the size of some of the rallies he did earlier in the year. The most interesting thing is that many of the party\u2019s candidates are from Labour families who have turned their back on that party because they feel it no longer represents the working class. Their inability to support Jeremy Corbyn comes up in most of the seats I have visited. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T13:56:15.484Z\">at 1.56pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea4ec18f08bacaf000b476\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T13:03:53.974Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>You have been sending in your questions about the Brexit party which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ask_us_a_question_brexit_party\">here</a>.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Does the Brexit party mind what kind of Brexit we get? Milly McEwen, retired, Deal</em></p> \n  <p>Farage has repeatedly talked of a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d, or, in reality, a different way of saying \u201chard Brexit\u201d. This was understood to mean leaving the single market and customs union and working with other countries on World Trade Organisation terms. Crucially, it also means having no political alignment with the EU. He has now said he will accept Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal because the prime minister has promised to try to negotiate a \u201csuper Canada-plus\u201d free trade agreement with the EU, and also to not extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020. In the Canada model, 98% of all tariffs on goods traded between Canada and the EU are duty free. Canadian importers do not have to pay around \u00a3529m in taxes on goods imported from the EU and European importers have a zero tariff on 9,000 Canadian goods. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Does the Brexit party support Johnson\u2019s deal or is it a capitulation to the EU? John Hibs, Glasgow</em></p> \n  <p>They do now support Johnson\u2019s deal, although Farage says it is far from perfect. He did initially have significant problems with it, saying it was a sellout and, as you say John, a capitulation to the EU. This is because he said it would not get Brexit done and meant up to three years of negotiations and difficulty in achieving true free trade deals. There would also be continued regulatory alignment in social policy and environmental law. \u201cIt is not Brexit!\u201d he shouted on 4 November to members. By 11 November he said he could tolerate it because he was putting country before party. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T13:24:53.730Z\">at 1.24pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea4bd78f08eef22867e992\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T12:50:47.793Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Why did Mr Farage decide not run for a seat at this election? If he loses his seat as an EU MEP how can he be Brexit party leader? Maud, 46, scientist, London</em><br></p> \n  <p>He decided not to run himself as an MP because he said he would be better served darting around the country giving speeches in marginal seats day after day. Sticking to one place geographically during the campaign might not have helped spread his message to the north of England, Wales and Midlands, he has said. Had he stood this would have been his eighth attempt to get into parliament. You can be leader of a political party without having an elected position in Westminster, like Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. He does continue to have his seat as an MEP but has said he has no idea what the future holds after this general election. There are rumours that he might work more in the US. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will the Brexit party cease to exist if and when the UK exits the EU? Andrew, 39, public servant, Glasgow</em></p> \n  <p>They have sought to explain they are a party of wider political reform and have a life beyond Brexit which is why abolishing the House of Lords, scrapping postal voting and looking at new voting systems is all part of their offer. However the name is a bit of an issue. Farage said in the last week that he might need to change it to the Reform party. But yes, it\u2019s possible their initial reason to exist may at some point disappear. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea4c568f08bacaf000b457\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T12:42:43.016Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Once again, Jeremy Corbyn is brandishing leaked documents that don\u2019t back up his wild conspiracy theories.

Matt, 23, civil engineer, Leeds</em></p> \n  <p>They are funded by donors, some of whom used to give money to the Tories, and also by the public. Businessman Jeremy Hosking is one such donor and he gave them \u00a3250,000 in November. In August of this year the Electoral Commission reported they had taken \u00a31 million in donations. To become a registered supporter there is a \u00a325 joining fee and \u00a3100-a-month club for members. They also run a pretty expansive merchandise website, with Brexit party T-shirts and baseball caps. During the general election they have charged \u00a32.50 for people to attend their rallies. The Electoral Commission has asked them to review how they take donations as they were using Paypal, which risked cash being sent from abroad.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What other policies do they have, besides Brexit? Paul, 47, company director, Merseyside</em></p> \n  <p>Farage does not talk about himself as having prime ministerial ambition, it appears he wants to operate in parliament by holding the leader to account over Brexit and ensuring it is delivered. He believes even a small number of Brexit party MPs could have a huge impact on votes and legislation in the Commons, similar to the way the DUP had a grip over parliament. This election he has talked about scrapping the House of Lords, voter reform, a points based immigration system, ending the export of British waste to developing countries, and planting millions of trees. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dea49438f08e7796de8dd6b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T12:30:14.784Z\">12.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and I will be answering your questions on the Brexit party today.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson of having made \u201cracist remarks\u201d as the pair clashed over Islamophobia and antisemitism in their parties, during a crucial head-to-head debate less than a week before polling day. As Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor report, Corbyn made the allegation as he defended himself against Johnson\u2019s charge that his handling of antisemitism complaints within the Labour party was a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d. Here is their story in full. And here are verdicts on the debate from a Guardian panel, with contributions from Martin Kettle, Katy Balls, Owen Jones, and Gaby Hinsliff. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. And here are the figures from the YouGov poll showing who won on particular issues. Boris Johnson was ahead on being likeable, on being prime ministerial, on Brexit, on goverment spending and on security and terrorism. And Jeremy Corbyn was ahead on being trustworthy, on being in touch with ordinary people. The results are roughly the same as they were when YouGov did a poll after the ITV leaders\u2019 debate last month. But I\u2019ve included figures showing how the gap between the leaders on each measure has changed. The biggest change has been on government spending. Johnson is still ahead on this measure, but by much less than after the ITV debate. Issues on which Boris Johnson won Who do you think came across as more likeable? 55% Boris Johnson, 36% Jeremy Corbyn, 9% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 19 points (+2 from his lead on this measure in the YouGov poll after the ITV debate) Who do you think came across as more prime ministerial? 54% Boris Johnson, 30% Jeremy Corbyn, 17% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 14 (-1) Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on Brexit? 62% Boris Johnson, 29% Jeremy Corbyn, 9% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 33 (-3) Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on government spending? 48% Boris Johnson, 43% Jeremy Corbyn, 9% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 5 (-10) Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on security and anti-terrorism? 55% Boris Johnson, 34% Jeremy Corbyn, 11% Don\u2019t know Johnson ahead by 21 (this question was not asked after the ITV debate) Issues on which Jeremy Corbyn won Who do you think came across as more trustworthy? 38% Boris Johnson, 48% Jeremy Corbyn, 14% Don\u2019t know Corbyn ahead by 10 points (+5 from his lead on this measures in the YouGov poll after the ITV debate) Who do you think came across as more in touch with ordinary people? 29% Boris Johnson, 57% Jeremy Corbyn, 14% Don\u2019t know Corbyn ahead by 28 (-6) Who do you think performed best during the section of the debate on NHS? 38% Boris Johnson, 55% Jeremy Corbyn, 8% Don\u2019t know Corbyn ahead by 17 (+1) Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s take on how Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn both performed. Here are more findings from the YouGov polling. (This is an expanded and slightly revised version of the snap verdict posted earlier.) The conventional wisdom among the punditocracy has been that this was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last chance to change the dynamics of this contest, and if that was the case he didn\u2019t manage it, even though in parts he had the best of the debate. The YouGov poll suggests Boris Johnson narrowly came out on top when viewers were asked who won, but on another measure Corbyn did better. Johnson\u2019s message about Labour not offering certainty on Brexit is a powerful one, and if anything the PM made it even more effectively tonight than he did in the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago. That said, Corbyn had the best moment, when he came back at Johnson over \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d and said what was a failure of leadership was using racist language. It was a powerful blow, and perhaps the best moment of the debate. After a question about Islamophobia and antisemitism, when Corbyn condemned racism in general terms, but declined to say that Johnson was personally culpable in this regard, Johnson switched the topic back to leadership. He said: I think that, you know, Mr Corbyn, I\u2019m sure is very well intentioned. But I think in his handling of this particular issue, his unwillingness to take a stand, to stand up for Jewish people in the Labour party. His unwillingness to protect them, to put an arm round them, is in my view a failure of leadership. You cannot be neutral on questions like this, any more, in my view, than you can try to lead this country and be neutral on the issue of Brexit. It is a failure to take a stand, to have a point of view, that in the end will cost this country gravely and deeply. At this point Corbyn hit back: A failure of leadership is when you use racist remarks to describe people in different countries or in our society. I will never do that and my party will never do that. In the first debate between the two leaders, Johnson\u2019s track record of using racist language in his journalism did not come up at all, and this moment left one wondering if Corbyn should have gone on the offensive on this issue much earlier in the campaign. It was an effective retort, but it did not silence Johnson and he recovered very well by pivoting back to Brexit, and asking of Corbyn\u2019s solution to Brexit: where is it? This has been Johnson\u2019s most powerful message throughout the campaign and tonight, although much of what he said was familiar, he was probably sharper and more incisive on this point than he has been before. He joked about how Corbyn\u2019s Brexit deal would be a \u201cmystery deal\u201d, because it was not clear what would be in it, and how he could not identify who would negotiate it in the shadow cabinet because most of Corbyn\u2019s team back remain. Johnson also claimed that, if he were able to get the UK out of the EU by the end of January next year, investment worth \u00a3150bn would come flooding into the country (an assertion that is unlikely to survive factchecking). For Corbyn, Brexit was defensive territory, but at least the audience was not as sceptical when he was explaining Labour\u2019s policy as it was in the ITV debate and he may have made an impression with his argument that Johnson\u2019s trade deal with the US might take seven years to negotiate \u2013 a point he made repeatedly. Corbyn was better on domestic policy. Although he may have overdone the tendency to reference the 1940s, he was calm and persuasive when arguing that Labour\u2019s plans to increase the level of state spending would only take the UK up towards an EU average, and on crime and the London Bridge terror attacks his points about the impact of prison cuts were at least as potent as anything Johnson said about sentencing. Much of what was said replicated what was said in the ITV debate, and that probably explains why the YouGov snap polling has recorded almost exactly the same verdict as it did last month. The most interesting question of the night came when Nick Robinson asked them which had done most to raise living standards: socialism or capitalism. Because it was a quick-fire round, we just got stock answers. But a one-hour debate between Johnson and Corbyn exploring this topic alone in more detail would have made excellent TV, and would probably have ended up being more illuminating. And here is the verdict from the YouGov poll. This is almost identical to the result of the poll from the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago, which had Johnson winning that encounter by 51% to 49%. See 7.32pm. The conventional wisdom among the punditocracy has been that this was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last chance to change the dynamics of this contest, and if that was the case he probably didn\u2019t manage it, even though he may well have had the best of the debate. The Johnson message about Labour not offering certainty on Brexit is a powerful one, and if anything the PM made it even more effectively tonight than he did in the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago. That said, Corbyn had the best moment, when he came back at Johnson over \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d and said what was a failure of leadership was using racist language. It was a powerful blow, and perhaps the best moment of the debate. Corbyn also seemed stronger than Johnson on domestic policy. But probably not strong enough to shake up a campaign that (in terms of voting intention) the Tories seem to be winning. I will post a beefed-up version of this shortly. They are now on closing statements. Corbyn says on Thursday we can vote for real change. And Johnson says on Thursday we can vote to get Brexit over and move on. And that\u2019s it. The debate is over. I will have a verdict, reaction, analysis and a summary coming up. Q: What punishment should there be for politicians who lie during an election campaign? Johnson says they should have to go on their knees and (he pauses for a bit), and scourge themselves in the Commons with copies of the documents they claim say one thing when they actually say another. Q: Does it bother you that a diplomat has resigned today because she thinks the government is lying? Johnson says he does not know about this case. Corbyn says, when people put false numbers on buses in campaigns, there is a case for someone to police false claims. Johnson says the amount of money we are paying to the EU is going up. And he says, with the debate almost over, we still don\u2019t know what Corbyn\u2019s Brexit plan is. Q: What would you do to keep the hate out of politics? Johnson says this is an important point. On prejudice, Islamophobia, antisemitism \u2013 he is going to have an independent inquiry. Anyone in his party who is guilty will be out \u201cfirst bounce\u201d. Johnson says the scratchiness of politics, and the acrimony, is a consequence of the failure to get things done. Q: You say people get thrown out on first bounce. But you have candidates have have retweeted Tommy Robinson criticising Muslims. Johnson says all those candidates have apologised, or are being investigated. He says Labour\u2019s record on antisemitism is worse. Corbyn says there never will be any place for antisemitism in his party. Q: People says, if blacks were complaining about racism in your party, you would accept what they said. But you don\u2019t with Jewish people. Corbyn says has accepted there is a problem. He says he never uses racist language in any form. Q: Are you saying Johnson does? Corbyn leaves the audience to draw its own conclusion. Johnson says Corbyn\u2019s failure to take a stand on this is a failure of leadership. He says this is like Corbyn\u2019s failure of leadership of Brexit. Corbyn says a failure of leadership is when you use racist language to describe people in our society, and he will never do it. Of course there must be a solution to Brexit, he says. Johnson asks: What is it? He says he has not heard it. Corbyn says he hopes Johnson will understand the importance of using appropriate language. Factcheck Claim: Johnson says the Parole Board and probation were not involved in the release of Usman Khan, the terrorist behind the London Bridge attack on 29 November. Reality: The Parole Board was not involved in the case of Khan as he was released on automatic release. But the probation service is always involved in the release of any offender on licence, as it is the body responsible for the management of offenders in the community. Corbyn says there are no plans whatsoever to disband MI5, or any part of our security services. He says he has had terrorist attacks in his constituency. He knows how important it is to keep people safe. Factcheck Claim: A \u201cblockade\u201d in parliament is blocking the government\u2019s ability to change the law on automatic early release. Reality: During their party conference, the Conservatives proposed to scrap the automatic release at the midway point for some serious sexual and violent offenders. The government could present a bill to pass through parliament regardless of whether Brexit or the election is happening. To tie it to the Brexit deadlock is misleading. Q: Are you prepared to put public safety ahead of human rights? Corbyn says it is not an either/or. You have to ensure the police, the prison service and the probation service are there, and properly funded. Human rights are our defence. There is no reason to compromise them. Johnson says he agrees there is no need to compromise human rights. But he does not think it was right that the London Bridge attacker was allowed out early. Q: What is wrong with the idea that prisoners should serve their full sentence? Corbyn says one day almost all prisoners will come out. You need proper rehabilitation. He says early release can help with that. And you need to fund probation properly. If you don\u2019t, we all pay a price. Q: Jack Merritt\u2019s father said his son did not want a society where we lock people up and throw away the key. Johnson says he feels very sorry for Merritt\u2019s family. But we must put public safety first. Automatic early release is completely unreasonable. Q: What about Corbyn\u2019s point that you have decimated the prison service and the probation service? Johnson says, in this case, the probation service was not involved. Corbyn says we have seriously overcrowded prisons, and when that happens rehabilitation suffers. He says he accepts that there should be a review before people are released. What happened is appalling. Johnson says Corbyn has consistently voted against longer sentences. And Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has called for it to be disbanded. (Johnson is referring to a Commons early day motion Abbott signed in the 1980s.) Factcheck Claim: Brexit will allow a Conservative government to cut VAT on sanitary products, Johnson claims. Reality: EU rules do currently prevent a UK government from reducing VAT on sanitary products from the current rate of 20% to anything below 5%, so the statement is correct. However, new rules proposed by the EU will allow governments to introduce a 0% rate on these products. Q: What do you say to the claim that businesses need certainty, and that they would not get it under you? Corbyn says under Labour there would be one of two Brexits. And people would know what Brexit would be like. Q: You are both planning lots of spending. How will we pay? Johnson says he plans to spend more in areas like the police and the NHS, but the Tories would not borrow to increase spending as much as Labour. Under Labour\u2019s plans, ordinary people would pay more, he says. Corbyn says Labour is the only party with a fully costed plan. He says we have gone too far in the direction of free market economics. If all Labour\u2019s plans were implemented, the size of the state would only just about reach France\u2019s. Johnson says he won\u2019t rack up such debts that you end up with huge interest rates. He says Labour always ends with a crisis. Corbyn and McDonnell would start with one. Q: The IFS said your plans were not realistic. Corbyn does not accept that. He says they questioned some aspects of it. Johnson says, if you are going to have a dynamic economy, you cannot clobber business with higher tax. Q: The IFS says your plan is not credible. On the contrary, says Johnson. He says it is a great, great programme. Labour would have a fiscal meltdown. He says he would get the country move. The economy drag anchor of Brexit on the economy should not be underestimated, he says. Corbyn says the Tories always look after those at the top. It is communities that pay for it. He says we must rebalance our society. He would raise corporation tax to 26%. That would be lower than it was in 2010, lower than in France, and lower than in the USA. Johnson says a Corbyn-Sturgeon coalition would be an economic disaster. Corbyn says business organisation cannot stand the uncertainty they have. Factcheck Claim: Jeremy Corbyn says his party will invest \u00a340bn in the NHS. Reality: Labour party literature consistently says that \u00a326bn will be committed to the NHS. The \u00a340bn figure appears to be new. It is unclear if increasing health spending by Labour\u2019s previous figure of \u00a326bn would be enough to deliver all the improvements it is seeking. Q: What does more to raise living standards \u2013 socialism or capitalism? Corbyn says socialism, in this country and in other countries, for instance under the postwar government. Johnson says he believes in supporting capitalism under a one nation government. Q: Labour sent out an email asking people to consider what it would be like having a five-figure bill for cancer treatment. Why did you do that? Corbyn says that is what you would end up with under a Trump trade deal. Q: Are you still claiming the NHS is up for sale? The documents you released don\u2019t say that. Corbyn says people should read them. Extending the life of patents would increase drug costs. He says President Trump says people don\u2019t pay enough for American drugs. Johnson says this is Bermuda Triangle stuff. Corbyn will be talking about little green men next. He says he loves the NHS, and will not sell it off. Q: The documents show the US wants more access to the NHS. Johnson says he has made it clear that won\u2019t happen. He says it was Labour that introduced privatisation in the first place. Corbyn says Johnson\u2019s party opposed the NHS in the first place. Johnson says that was in the 1940s. He says he believes passionately in the NHS. Corbyn says it is a fact that there are 43,000 nurse vacancies. Factcheck Claim: Boris Johnson will spend at least seven years negotiating with the US on access to our public services and the price of medicines, which Jeremy Corbyn says are up for negotiation, and he knows he can\u2019t get a deal quickly with the US because of the way the political system works there. Reality: It will not necessarily take that long for a deal to be worked out \u2013 the US has previously agreed trade deals with countries in a matter of months \u2013 a deal with Jordan, for instance, took just four months. However, a deal with the UK is likely to be a lot more complex and lengthy. Unredacted documents released by Labour revealing details of high profile UK-US trade talks showed that over the last two years officials have regularly discussed healthcare, including the structures in place which moderate the prices of drugs in the UK. The NHS may not be \u201cfor sale\u201d but healthcare is certainly on the table. Q: I am going to retrain as a nurse. How will you make people like me stay? Johnson says he is bringing back bursaries for nurses. The Tories would have special visa applications for nurses, he says. He says he cannot understand how Labour thinks it could help the NHS by having a four-day week. Corbyn says it was the Tories who cut the bursary for student nurses. Labour would fund the NHS properly. He says Johnson promised 40 new hospitals, which became 20, and then six. Johnson says he has a clear agenda, to build 40 hospitals. Only six are funded now. But the seed funding is going in, so after 10 years there will be 40. Corbyn says it is not credible to make promises like this without having a proper plan. Q: Is it credible to have a four-day working week? Corbyn says he wants to bring down working hours. But there would not be a four-day week in the NHS. Johnson claims John McDonnell said there would be a four-day working week in the NHS. He claims there is investment worth \u00a3150bn waiting to come into the UK if he can get Brexit done. Factcheck Claim: There will be no border in the Irish Sea as a result of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Reality: The amount of friction in trade moving both ways across the Irish Sea is not wholly in the government\u2019s control, but will depend on negotiations with the EU. Friction on the trade route from Northern Ireland will also depend on WTO rules as well as measures introduced by the UK government. As a result, there is still a lot of work to be done before it is established how trade can and will operate between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Q: How will the UK be better off outside the EU? Johnson says the UK can have new rules on animal welfare, and new regulations on bio-science, and free ports. And it can control immigration, he says. Corbyn says, under his plans, manufacturing would be able to continue trading. He says many jobs have been lost. He repeats the point about a trade deal with the US taking seven years. Q: Why won\u2019t you say where you stand on Brexit. Is it because you don\u2019t know? Or because you won\u2019t say? Corbyn says it is because he has to bring people together. Johnson says you cannot end the uncertainty if you don\u2019t know what you want to do. It is a failure of leadership, he says. Q: You say you will get a trade deal done. But you don\u2019t have one yet? Johnson says he has a fantastic deal. Q: Not on trade. Johnson says he has ample time to negotiate a trade deal. Corbyn says Johnson will spend years negotiating with the US. And he has not been straightforward on the impact of the deal on Northern Ireland. He says the documents show there will be charges and restrictions on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Johnson says that is not true. The UK will come out as one. Johnson says it says \u201cunfettered access\u201d. Corbyn says the document does, but it also highlights things that would impact on trade. Johnson says he finds it a curiosity to be lectured on the union by someone who supported the IRA and Irish independence. Q: Johnson says you don\u2019t support the union. Corbyn says he has always supported a peace process in Northern Ireland. He pays tribute to the Labour government for achieving it. Q: Can you guarantee Brexit will happen next year? Q: How would Brexit make Britain better off? Corbyn explains his policy. Within three months, he will negotiate a new agreement, and then hold a referendum. As PM, Corbyn says his role would be to carry that out. No one voted to lose their job. Johnson says he is frustrated too. He will get it down by 31 January. Then he will be able to improve animal standards, cut VAT on tampons, have free ports and control immigration. He says he does not see who will negotiate the Labour deal. There is no one who will campaign for it. Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet backs remain. Corbyn says it will take seven years to negotiate a deal with the US. There could be delays at ports. Johnson says there would be a period of negotiation \u201cabout the mystery deal, led by someone we cannot identify\u201d. Parliament would spend a whole year more locked in debate about Brexit. Corbyn says Johnson will spend seven years negotiating with the US on access to our public services, access to our health services. He won\u2019t get a deal, so he will be left with nothing. Johnson rejects this. He says the UK will be able to take back control. Factcheck Claim: A Conservative government will recruit 20,000 more police officers and 50,000 more nurses. Reality: Two familiar lines from the Conservative offer in Johnson\u2019s opening. It\u2019s important to put the recruitment of 20,000 police officers into the context of the cuts over the last nine years, which saw around 21,000 cut. It\u2019s proposed that the officers will be recruited over the next three years - with 6,500 in the first year. As for the nurses, the Conservatives have confirmed that 50,000 target will include 20,000 retained nurses, who would have otherwise left the NHS - with no detail on how they will convince those nurses to stay. Q: Is Sir John Major\u2019s intervention worrying to you, Mr Johnson? And is Mr Blair\u2019s worrying to you, to Mr Corbyn? Will they make a difference? Or are they both has-beens? Johnson says he has the utmost respect for all former Tory leaders, but he does not think Major is right. He has a deal read to go, it is oven-ready. Unlike Major, he leads a party that is totally united. Because you got rid of people who did not agree with you, says Robinson. Johnson says it\u2019s because they agree with him. The mystery is Labour\u2019s position. Corbyn says the question is do we continue as we are, and have a Trump trade deal, or do we choose change. He says Blair and Major should consider the need for change. Q: Why can\u2019t Blair back you? Corbyn says he wants to change Britain. Q: People don\u2019t like either of you. Johnson says he will have massive investment, and take the country forward. Boris Johnson says next Thursday is a turning point. We can spread opportunity, and improve our services. But that will only happen with a Conservative government. If Labour gets in there will be chaos and two referendums. Jeremy Corbyn gives his opening statement. Labour is ambitious for the country, and for you. He wants a society where everyone is supported, and looked after in old age. Millions of people are struggling. They need an ambitious government on their side. A vote for Labour is a vote for real change. Nick Robinson starts by saying one of these men will be PM next week. Nick Robinson opens the debate. From Boris Johnson, or whoever runs his Twitter account From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley These are from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. From Jeremy Corbyn (or whoever runs his Twitter feed) Nick Robinson, the former BBC political editor who is now a Today programme presenter, is chairing the debate tonight. He posted this on Twitter earlier. From the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope Before the ITV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn last month, I posted what was in effect a five-point guide as to why TV debates don\u2019t tend to be as all-important as the broadcasters who host them sometimes suggest. If you missed it then, it all still applies. YouGov is going to release snap polling on who wins tonight\u2019s debate. In a press release the polling firm said: YouGov will be releasing a snap poll within minutes of the debate finishing at 9.30pm, revealing who viewers thought performed best out of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn. During the ITV head-to-head debate, YouGov had results with a 1,500+ sample within 180 seconds of the debate finishing \u2013 the result showed a dead heat with 51% thinking Johnson won the debate while 49% thought Corbyn won ... YouGov will also be asking the public who performed best on the topics covered during the discussion and will be releasing characteristic ratings, such as who looked the most prime ministerial and who was the most trustworthy. As YouGov says, the poll immediately after the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago gave Boris Johnson a very narrow win. But about an hour later YouGov published more figures from the poll, and they gave a more nuanced picture. They suggested that while Johnson won on Brexit, being prime ministerial, being likeable and government spending, Corbyn won on being in touch with ordinary people, on the NHS, on being trustworthy and on other issues. And these figures also showed that more people thought Corbyn did well than thought Johnson did well. (That is paradoxical, but it may say something about expectations; there may have been people who thought Johnson won, but that Corbyn did better than they were expecting.) When the full tables (pdf) were published the following day, it also emerged that voters who had not yet decided how they would vote in the election clearly thought Corbyn was the winner. From the Labour South East account Michael Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister, also addressed the Stop the Brexit Landslide rally. This is how he wrapped up his speech. As a member of the Conservative party, as a foot soldier in its ranks through most of its recent battles, as a citizen proud of its achievements, I must put my country first. And the only way to revisit the Brexit dilemma is to vote first for the disenfranchised Conservatives, and then Liberal Democrat candidates and create a coalition of power. Only in that way can we clear the obstacle of Brexit and tackle the domestic agenda so long frustrated by the most divisive, corrosive, irrelevant political deviation of modern times. Jeremy Corbyn has arrived for the BBC debate in Maidstone, PoliticsHome\u2019s Alain Tolhurst reports. Here are the key points from Tony Blair\u2019s speech at the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally in London. Some of the quotes were released in advance. (See 3.22pm.) Blair praised Sir John Major and other Conservatives supporting the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d campaign. This is how he started his speech. Here are five words I never thought I would say: Thank God for John Major. To John, to Michael Heseltine, for years I stood against you. Tonight, it is an honour to stand with you. And to David Gauke and many others \u2013 good, smart, capable people across the political spectrum prepared to speak out, to put country before party and principle before position \u2013 your courage is an example. He said Brexit was a disaster, particularly for the young. Brexit is not a mistake, I wish it were, it is a disaster, a disaster our country cannot afford. And I say to those of my generation who voted for it, with age can come the wisdom of lived experience. But it is youth that has its finger on the beating pulse of the future and we have no right to steal that future from them. They know the world today works through connections, and Brexit breaks them. They see how success belongs to the open mind; Brexit closes that of their nation. They understand that their hopes will never prosper in the modern world without attachment to the hopes of their neighbours; Brexit throws those hopes on a bonfire of confusion, confusion between national pride and nationalism. He mocked the claims made by Brexiters in 2016. Remember when they promised that Britain\u2019s exit would be just the first, and once the rest of Europe saw the genius of our move, they would fall like dominoes. No other nation has followed, none will follow, and indeed there are nations to the east queuing to join. They promised a new trade deal would be easy, the Europeans battering our door down in surrender before the brilliance of our negotiating skill. Instead we are outside their door in anxious supplication. He said the DUP were \u201cprime witnesses\u201d to how Boris Johnson could not be trusted. When John Major and I warned the Irish border would create a dilemma between keeping the Good Friday agreement and undermining it, they derided us, promising the Irish cake would be had and eaten. And now the backstop is a front stop, we have not one border but two and the Democratic Unionists are prime witnesses to the dangers of trusting Boris Johnson. He said it was undemocratic to use a general election to resolve the Brexit issue. I will tell you what is undemocratic: mixing up Brexit with a general election. If Brexit is the question, ask us about Brexit. That is the democratic way. He said the Tories did not deserve a majority. Do not give Boris Johnson a majority, he does not deserve it. This Conservative party which now expels the likes of Michael Heseltine, disowns the statesmanship of John Major. A party whose chancellor, as of July this year, is now exiled in the wilderness for the temerity to say what he knows to be true, namely that a no-deal Brexit is a risk no responsible government would take. Such a Conservative party does not deserve to govern unchecked and the country would not be wise to let them. Some groan at the idea of a hung parliament. But better a parliament that\u2019s hung for want of a majority than a country hung for want of a leader. He urged people to vote tactically against the Tories. Its not one general election but 650 individual ones. There are great Labour candidates who deserve whole-hearted support. I am voting Labour. But let me put it this way: if you look, constituency by constituency, you will know the best candidates to back. Back them! He ended by saying this was the most important election of his lifetime. Six days to a decision of destiny. Six days to reclaim our future and shape it. Not in my lifetime, and maybe never again in yours, has there been a choice of such moment. So I beg you, I beg you with all my heart and all my mind, choose wisely. At the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally in London the video message from John Major (see 2.52pm) has been played. And Tony Blair has finished his speech. As expected (see 3.22pm), Blair said that he personally would be voting Labour, but he urged people to vote tactically to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority, to create the possibility of a second referendum that could halt Brexit. Here are some lines from his speech. Downing Street has been forced to change its telephone switchboard message after a cabinet minister invited members of the public to ring up to find out the prime minister\u2019s diary details. As PA Media reports, Michael Gove told BBC Radio 5 Live listeners to call No 10 \u2013 and he read out the number \u2013 after being asked about the chances of Boris Johnson taking part in an interview with the corporation\u2019s veteran journalist Andrew Neil. Presenter Chris Warburton said: On a scale of one to 10, what\u2019s the chance of the Andrew Neil interview with Boris Johnson happening? Just give us a number? Gove replied: I think the number would be 0207 930 4433. That\u2019s the Downing Street number, and if you ring the prime minister\u2019s diary secretary, he will know, or she will know, what the prime minister is going to do. I am not the prime minister\u2019s diary secretary. As PA Media reports, No 10 has subsequently changed its pre-recorded switchboard message. Callers are now told: You have reached the Downing Street switchboard. Unfortunately we are unable to give out any information relating to the prime minister\u2019s diary on this phone line. To listen to further contact details, please press one. From the Financial Times\u2019 John Burn-Murdoch These are from Sky\u2019s Jason Farrell, who is covering the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally in London. In many respects Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto is more radical than the one it proposed two years ago. But in at least one policy area there has been a minor retreat. In 2017 the manifesto (pdf) said Labour would consider the option of a land value tax. However critics attacked the idea as a \u201cgarden tax\u201d and in the 2019 version (pdf) this is just an option for commercial property. The manifesto says: A Labour government will review the option of a land value tax on commercial landlords as an alternative [to business rates]. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was asked about this when he did a webchat with Mumsnet earlier today. This is what he said about the policy. We haven\u2019t put forward proposals on land tax but are encouraging a debate around land value taxation to ensure that, for example, when developments occur within an area, and individuals or companies benefit from those developments and their land values escalate, whether some of that value should be shared by the wider community. So I give the example in my own constituency, now that Crossrail is going through, paid for by public money, and land values are increasing fairly fast, local people are being squeezed out of being able to purchase a home in the area. One argument around land value taxation in these circumstances is that an element of the increased value going to corporations could assist in our local housing programme, providing benefits for the local people rather than, in some instances, overseas speculators. But there will be a full consultation in all our discussions on this. We will not be considering land value taxation on residential properties but on development land held by businesses and corporations. By a margin of five to one, voters do think Boris Johnson should agree to an interview with Andrew Neil, according to a YouGov poll. This is from the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. Andrew Neil said that if he got the chance to interview Boris Johnson he would want to ask a series of questions about trust. Johnson is frequently accused of being dishonest, and this afternoon a story from the US has provided a fresh example. According to a CNN scoop, the official in the British embassy in Washington responsible for matters relating to Brexit, Alexandra Hall Hall, has quit. Hall Hall was a career diplomat and CNN quotes from her resignation letter, which it says was widely circulated among diplomats. In it she said: I have been increasingly dismayed by the way in which our political leaders have tried to deliver Brexit, with reluctance to address honestly, even with our own citizens, the challenges and trade-offs which Brexit involves; the use of misleading or disingenuous arguments about the implications of the various options before us; and some behaviour towards our institutions, which, were it happening in another country, we would almost certainly, as diplomats, have received instructions to register our concern. It makes our job to promote democracy and the rule of law that much harder if we are not seen to be upholding these core values at home ... I am also at a stage in life where I would prefer to do something more rewarding with my time, than peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust. Here is more from the Conservative response to the Labour leak of the government document about how the PM\u2019s Brexit deal would affect Northern Ireland. (See 9.59am, 10.45am and 1.53pm.) This is what the party is saying in a briefing note for journalists. This leaked document is just an immediate assessment, not a detailed analysis of the deal, and misses key points. This document was produced immediately after the deal was struck and represents a \u2018flash analysis\u2019 of what the obligations of the protocol might be. It appears to have been based on a partial reading of the final deal. This document was not written for, and was not used for, decision-making purposes. This document has not been seen by the chancellor, the prime minister or any of the senior officials involved in the negotiations. The document contains a number of question marks which shows that it is an incomplete analysis. The paper does not highlight the power of the joint committee to address the issues that the paper identifies, or the power of key clauses to also address these issues. Here is the set for the BBC Boris Johnson/Jeremy Corbyn debate taking place tonight at 8.30pm in Maidstone, Kent. Peter Foster, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, has a detailed and revealing Twitter thread on the leaked document about the impact of the PM\u2019s Brexit deal on Northern Ireland that starts here. And John Campbell, BBC Northern Ireland\u2019s economics and business editor, also has posted two good threads on the document. The first one starts here. And the second one starts here. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip and the candidate for Lagan Valley, has said the government document unveiled by Labour earlier (see 9.59am, 10.45am and 1.53pm) shows why Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cbad for Northern Ireland\u201d. In a statement he said: This latest leak from HMT is further demonstration that the prime minister\u2019s deal would be bad for Northern Ireland. The DUP warned the Prime Minister about this. Despite his protestations, the facts are in black and white. That is why we opposed the deal in the House of Commons and why Northern Ireland needs the deal changed. With polls narrowing in GB, we are urging voters to return a strong team of DUP MPs who will seek a better deal which works for every part of the United Kingdom. We have demonstrated over the last three years that we will stand up and speak up for Northern Ireland to ensure our economy is not decimated by a bad deal. Jeremy Corbyn is using this as a campaigning tool but no unionist will be tricked by his rhetoric. He has in the past and would in the future work in cahoots with those who want to destroy the union. Northern Ireland\u2019s best option is to elect a strong team of DUP MPs who will use their influence with the government. The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair is also due to speak at the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally later this afternoon. We quoted some of his words earlier. (See 11.12am.) Like Sir John Major, he is also implying that people should vote tactically to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority, instead of just voting Labour. He will say: Do not give Boris Johnson a majority ... It\u2019s not Brexit that\u2019s getting done. We\u2019re getting done. This is the final chance for a final say. It\u2019s not one general election but 650 individual ones. Think long. Think hard. Time to choose. Choose wisely. At an event earlier in the campaign Blair said that he would be voting Labour personally, even though he could see why people might support the Lib Dem Chuka Umunna in his constituency. As a former party leader, he was in a special position, he explained. But he also said he did not want either of the main parties to form a majority govenrment. Here is a version of the video message from Sir John Major for the \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d rally taking place later today in London. Out with the SNP canvassers in East Dunbartonshire yesterday, I came across an interesting fact: 12,000 postal ballots had already been returned in that constituency by Thursday. Compare this with the total turnout in 2017 of 51,801. About 18% of the Scottish electorate are registered as postal voters, pretty similar to what it usually is for a general election, so no particular December surge as some predicted. But, with wintry weather forecast across Scotland next Thursday, it does make me wonder how much this election may be dominated by postal voters. The received wisdom is that postal voters tend to be older Tory women. But I\u2019ve been really struck by how many activists of all parties report that of those mortified by Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour in the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on the benches and wotnot, it is older women who are most horrified. Anecdotally, I\u2019ve had lots of these conversations with older voters myself, and don\u2019t forget the Waspi (Women Against State Pensions Inequality) issue, which Johnson has not been convincing on. So does that make the postal voting constituency less predictable than usual? We\u2019re constantly being told that this is the most unpredictable election ever, so I suppose this is just one more factor to chuck into the mix. The Evening Standard, which is edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, is also reading John Major\u2019s comments as a call for widespread tactical voting. (See 2.52pm.) I\u2019m told Major\u2019s office is not contesting this interpretation. We have already covered some of what Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, is due to say to a rally this afternoon organised by Vote for a Final Say, a campaign being run by people who were involved in the People\u2019s Vote campaign until it imploded in infighting. (See 11.09am.) Major is formally endorsing three former Tories who are now running as independents because they had the whip withdrawn after voting to facilitate the Benn Act, the legislation that ruled out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. According to the news release issued in advance, he is backing David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton. Commenting on them, Major will say in a video message: Let me make one thing absolutely clear: none of them has left the Conservative party, the Conservative party has left them. Without such talent on its benches, parliament will be the poorer, which is why \u2013 if I were resident in any one of their constituencies \u2013 they would have my vote. But Major is also going to back calls for a second referendum. Addressing young people directly (the rally has been jointly organised with For Our Future\u2019s Sake, a second referendum campaign focusing on young people), he will describe Brexit as \u201cthe worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime\u201d. He will go on: It will affect nearly every single aspect of our lives for many decades to come. It will make our country poorer and weaker. It will hurt most those who have least. Never have the stakes been higher, especially for the young. Brexit may even break up our historic United Kingdom. And, making the case for a second referendum, he will say: When the nation voted on Brexit, they did so on a diet of fiction and undeliverable promises. As the facts become known, it is extraordinary that a new vote is denied: extraordinary and undemocratic. Your vote is absolutely crucial \u2013 for you have the longest lease on our country\u2019s future, and our place in the wider world \u2026 Don\u2019t wake up on Friday 13 December and regret not making a choice. So choose the future you believe in \u2013 for your own generation and the next. According to the news release, Major will say tribal loyalty to a party has its place. But he will also say that no single party has a monopoly on wisdom, and that: Sometimes you need to vote with your head and your heart for your country and your future ... This is such a time. Like most political parties, the Conservative party has rules saying members are not allowed to endorse other parties at a general election and, from the way the news release is worded, it sounds as if Major wants to avoid anything that would lead to him being thrown out of the party he used to lead. But it is impossible to read these words without concluding that he wants people to vote tactically to deny Johnson a majority. If overturning Brexit is the priority (and the rally is called \u201cStop the Brexit Landslide\u201d), then that could only happen if Jeremy Corbyn were to form a government and hold a referendum, or another party were to make a referendum a condition of supporting a minority Tory government. This is from David Merritt, whose son Jack was killed in the London Bridge terror attack last week. Boris Johnson has cancelled a visit to Rochester at the last minute, PA Media reports. He was due to give a stump speech to Tory supporters near Ye Arrow pub. A small number of protesters also arrived holding signs that read \u201cTories out\u201d, \u201cAusterity killed over 130,000, the blood is on your hands\u201d and \u201cNo to racism, no to Boris Johnson\u201d. A decision was taken to cancel the visit and the Conservatives claimed it was because of \u201clogistical reasons\u201d. In his lunchtime Brexit election briefing email, the Financial Times\u2019s James Blitz assesses whether Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to agree to an interview with Andrew Neil will make any difference. Probably not, he thinks. He explains: Opinion pollsters I\u2019ve spoken to this morning are united in saying this row is a less serious problem for Mr Johnson than his opponents think. They offer three broad reasons. First, people will view this row through the prism of their pre-existing support. Voters who dislike Mr Johnson think he is being cowardly. People who warm to him think it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue at the margins,\u201d said Ben Page, head of Ipsos Mori. \u201cThe people it excites are people who already don\u2019t like him.\u201d Second, the fact that Mr Johnson is appearing in a BBC head-to-head debate with Mr Corbyn tonight helps neutralise the damage. \u201cBack in the 2017 election campaign, Theresa May refused to debate head-on with Corbyn and that undermined her claim to be a strong leader,\u201d said Marcus Roberts, a former Labour strategist now at YouGov. \u201cMany voters will see Johnson debating Corbyn this evening and wonder what the fuss is about Andrew Neil.\u201d A third factor that should not be ignored is that this is a row that helps the Tories. The party is 10 points ahead of Labour in the polls. By filling the airwaves with lots of headlines about what is fundamentally an issue of process, they stop Labour getting on the front foot on issues that really could affect the election, like the state of the National Health Service and public services. In other words, this row suits the Conservatives\u2019 defensive election strategy. A senior government source said the document produced by Labour about the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on trade with Northern Ireland (see 9.59am and 10.45am) was an \u201cinitial appraisal\u201d compiled by junior civil servants that had not been signed off at a senior level. The Conservative party said the document had been produced immediately after Johnson\u2019s deal was struck and was not written, or used, for decision-making purposes. They pointed to a number of question marks in the document, which they said showed it was an incomplete analysis. They added that the deal was fully compliant with the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. Thanks for all your questions Our political team will answer any questions you have about the election on Monday at 12.30pm. You can ask your question via our form here. Q: As a northern Labour voter, I think the patronising way in which it is being reported that northern Brexiters will vote Tory for the first time as they are hoodwinked by Brexit is being massively overblown. Everyone I know is voting Labour. What do you think the realistic chances are of the Tories or Brexit party gaining in the north? Lewie Magarshack, 31, small business worker, South Yorkshire If we take \u201cthe north\u201d in its greatest sense then I think there\u2019s a chance that Barrow and Grimsby might go Tory. Ashfield perhaps too, although the flooding may not play in the prime minister\u2019s favour. I have also heard from Labour MPs campaigning in Yorkshire mining communities that they are hearing people go Tory for the first time. It\u2019s an anecdote but an interesting one. On the other hand, it also seems very likely that the Labour vote holds in ultra-marginals because the Brexit party may shave a few thousand off the Tory vote. Q: What chance does the Brexit party have of winning any seat and continuing to function as a party if the conservatives win the GE? Jonathan, 22, games designer, Sheffield It\u2019s difficult to see that they have a realistic chance of winning any seat. Early on, there was hope in Hartlepool, which is why the party\u2019s most senior figure after Farage, Richard Tice, decided to run in that seat. But people on the ground there say they think they will even struggle to get the vote out at all, let alone get a surge for one particular party over another. This does appear to be a recurring theme \u2013 people who just don\u2019t have the desire to vote at all. They do have elected councillors and MEPs under the Brexit party name so it is expected that the party will have to continue in some format. Good Afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Sarah Marsh. I will be here for the rest of the day, covering the debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on BBC One at 8.30pm. This is what Labour is saying about Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion that turning down an interview with Andrew Neil was like turning down an interview with Lord Buckethead. Incidentally, it is worth pointing out that Johnson\u2019s quote (see 12.25pm), particularly when read alongside the briefing we have had from CCHQ about the apparent flaws with the extended interview format (see 9.45am - it is a self-serving view, not shared by most journalists, who value the extended interview format), effectively amount to a confirmation that he won\u2019t do the interview. Only yesterday he was not formally ruling it out. Just under 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the Brexit party. Send them in to us here. Q: As the Brexit party appears to be filling the void for people disillusioned with politics in general, why are they not proposing more radical reforms to the current system? Will they pick up many votes from \u201cnon-voters\u201d? Tee, 32, Bristol They are proposing reform to the voting system by looking at more proportional methods and by introducing citizens\u2019 initiatives to allow people to call referendums if there are 5 million registered voter signatures. This proposal for direct democracy is a highly unusual addition to government, particularly for the UK, although something similar exists in Switzerland. It could be possible they pick up the vote of typical \u201cnon-voters\u201d. Certainly on the doorsteps people have said the only time they ever voted in their lives was for leave in the EU referendum. This might work in the Brexit party\u2019s favour at the ballot box. Q: Is covering the Brexit party as soul-crushingly depressing as it sounds? Tom, Lewisham No not at all! It\u2019s been really fascinating to see how Farage still operates after 25 years in politics and if his message cuts through. He is a performer and seems to really animate the audiences he assembles around him. Although these gatherings are a tenth of the size of some of the rallies he did earlier in the year. The most interesting thing is that many of the party\u2019s candidates are from Labour families who have turned their back on that party because they feel it no longer represents the working class. Their inability to support Jeremy Corbyn comes up in most of the seats I have visited. You have been sending in your questions about the Brexit party which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: Does the Brexit party mind what kind of Brexit we get? Milly McEwen, retired, Deal Farage has repeatedly talked of a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d, or, in reality, a different way of saying \u201chard Brexit\u201d. This was understood to mean leaving the single market and customs union and working with other countries on World Trade Organisation terms. Crucially, it also means having no political alignment with the EU. He has now said he will accept Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal because the prime minister has promised to try to negotiate a \u201csuper Canada-plus\u201d free trade agreement with the EU, and also to not extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020. In the Canada model, 98% of all tariffs on goods traded between Canada and the EU are duty free. Canadian importers do not have to pay around \u00a3529m in taxes on goods imported from the EU and European importers have a zero tariff on 9,000 Canadian goods. Q: Does the Brexit party support Johnson\u2019s deal or is it a capitulation to the EU? John Hibs, Glasgow They do now support Johnson\u2019s deal, although Farage says it is far from perfect. He did initially have significant problems with it, saying it was a sellout and, as you say John, a capitulation to the EU. This is because he said it would not get Brexit done and meant up to three years of negotiations and difficulty in achieving true free trade deals. There would also be continued regulatory alignment in social policy and environmental law. \u201cIt is not Brexit!\u201d he shouted on 4 November to members. By 11 November he said he could tolerate it because he was putting country before party. Q: Why did Mr Farage decide not run for a seat at this election? If he loses his seat as an EU MEP how can he be Brexit party leader? Maud, 46, scientist, London He decided not to run himself as an MP because he said he would be better served darting around the country giving speeches in marginal seats day after day. Sticking to one place geographically during the campaign might not have helped spread his message to the north of England, Wales and Midlands, he has said. Had he stood this would have been his eighth attempt to get into parliament. You can be leader of a political party without having an elected position in Westminster, like Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. He does continue to have his seat as an MEP but has said he has no idea what the future holds after this general election. There are rumours that he might work more in the US. Q: Will the Brexit party cease to exist if and when the UK exits the EU? Andrew, 39, public servant, Glasgow They have sought to explain they are a party of wider political reform and have a life beyond Brexit which is why abolishing the House of Lords, scrapping postal voting and looking at new voting systems is all part of their offer. However the name is a bit of an issue. Farage said in the last week that he might need to change it to the Reform party. But yes, it\u2019s possible their initial reason to exist may at some point disappear. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, said: Once again, Jeremy Corbyn is brandishing leaked documents that don\u2019t back up his wild conspiracy theories. This is just another desperate attempt to distract from his refusal to take a position on the biggest issue of the day. He simply cannot be trusted. He won\u2019t honour the result of the first referendum and now wants to fiddle a second referendum by changing the rules and allowing millions of EU nationals to cast ballots too. Labour have been exposed \u2013 they are planning to rig our whole democracy in a desperate bid to force us to stay in the EU. The Conservatives have negotiated a great new deal with the EU which takes the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, out of the EU. The choice is clear: Corbyn\u2019s Labour, with a gridlocked hung parliament and the chaos of two more referendums, or a majority Conservative government that will end the uncertainty, get Brexit done and unleash Britain\u2019s potential. Some of your questions so far have been about funding and the party\u2019s policies: Q: Who funds the Brexit Party? Matt, 23, civil engineer, Leeds They are funded by donors, some of whom used to give money to the Tories, and also by the public. Businessman Jeremy Hosking is one such donor and he gave them \u00a3250,000 in November. In August of this year the Electoral Commission reported they had taken \u00a31 million in donations. To become a registered supporter there is a \u00a325 joining fee and \u00a3100-a-month club for members. They also run a pretty expansive merchandise website, with Brexit party T-shirts and baseball caps. During the general election they have charged \u00a32.50 for people to attend their rallies. The Electoral Commission has asked them to review how they take donations as they were using Paypal, which risked cash being sent from abroad. Q: What other policies do they have, besides Brexit? Paul, 47, company director, Merseyside Farage does not talk about himself as having prime ministerial ambition, it appears he wants to operate in parliament by holding the leader to account over Brexit and ensuring it is delivered. He believes even a small number of Brexit party MPs could have a huge impact on votes and legislation in the Commons, similar to the way the DUP had a grip over parliament. This election he has talked about scrapping the House of Lords, voter reform, a points based immigration system, ending the export of British waste to developing countries, and planting millions of trees. I\u2019m Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and I will be answering your questions on the Brexit party today. I have been following Nigel Farage and his party around Labour heartland seats in the North of England, Wales and Midlands during the general election campaign. I have covered politics for six years, locally and nationally, and arrived in the lobby at Westminster the day after Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour party. Before joining the Guardian I worked for the Evening Standard for three years as their political reporter, and was the Yorkshire Post\u2019s political correspondent. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Speaking at a Conservative campaign event at Kent showground near Maidstone, Johnson defended his decision not to submit himself to an interview by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. \u201cI think most people would say I\u2019m the only prime minister to have done not one but, tonight, two head-to-head debates, I\u2019ve done 118 sit-down interviews with journalists, fielded innumerable questions at press conferences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot accommodate everyone. There\u2019s a guy called Lord Buckethead who wants to have a head-to-head debate. Unfortunately I am not able to fit him in. We can\u2019t do absolutely everything.\u201d Johnson was also asked about former prime minister John Major\u2019s criticisms of his administration. \u201cI think it\u2019s very sad and I think he\u2019s wrong. He represents a view that is outdated, alas.\u201d Johnson said he respected Major and his record. \u201cI must respectfully disagree with my illustrious predecessor and urge people on Thursday, come on, let\u2019s get this thing done.\u201d Channel 4 has apologised after subtitles below a speech made by Boris Johnson suggested he said he wanted democratic control over the migration of \u201cpeople of colour\u201d. It said: \u201cBoris Johnson says \u2018people of talent\u2019 not \u2018people of colour\u2019. Our earlier tweet was a mistake. We misheard and we apologise.\u201d A senior Tory source said: This shows why it has been impossible to cooperate with Channel 4 News. They are campaigners in this election, inventing the most damaging things possible to further their campaign against Brexit. This sort of thing is why so many media organisations have collapsing audiences. We sadly do not expect the senior management at Channel 4 to take this terrible mistake seriously and we expect more of the same. Jeremy Corbyn was asked by Channel 4\u2019s political correspondent, Liz Bates, whether he thinks Labour would fare better among working-class voters with a different leader. He replied: \u201cI think Marmite\u2019s really good for you. Some people like it and some people don\u2019t. I lead the party and I\u2019m proud to lead the party.\u201d The Labour leader has produced a leaked report on Northern Ireland and customs checks, describing it as \u201ccold, hard evidence\u201d that Boris Johnson has been misleading people about his Brexit deal. Corbyn revealed the confidential document, titled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market, at a press conference in central London on Friday. Ask our experts a question As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until election day. Today, Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will answer your questions about the Brexit party. You can ask your question via our form here. At a Conservative campaign event at Kent showground near Maidstone, Boris Johnson was asked about the documents. (See 10.45am.) He insisted it is \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d to suggest his Brexit deal would lead to customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He said: I haven\u2019t seen the document you\u2019re referring to but that\u2019s complete nonsense, and what I can tell you is that with the deal that we have we can come out as one whole UK. He said voters should believe him when he says there will be no checks on goods going between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \u201cThey should believe exactly what I say, which is that there will be no goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland or from Northern Ireland to Great Britain because we are going to come out of the EU whole and entire, and that was the objective that we secured.\u201d Channel 4 has issued an apology after subtitles below a speech made by Boris Johnson suggested he said he wanted democratic control over the migration of \u201cpeople of colour\u201d. It said: \u201cBoris Johnson says \u2018people of talent\u2019 not \u2018people of colour\u2019. Our earlier tweet was a mistake. We misheard and we apologise.\u201d Footage of the leader speaking on Friday was put on Twitter with the subtitles. It sparked social media fury after it was believed Johnson said: \u201cI am in favour of having people of colour come to this country but I think we should have it democratically controlled.\u201d But the audio from the clip suggests he in fact refers to \u201cpeople of talent\u201d. Even the leader of the Scottish National party, Nicola Sturgeon, responded. In a tweet, now deleted, she said: \u201cAnd the Tories claim that their obsession with immigration is nothing to do with race. This is a shocking \u2013 and very revealing \u2013 comment.\u201d Nigel Farage had been billed to speak at a Brexit party defence rally in Westminster but failed to show up. A party spokesman said Farage felt his presence would be a \u201cdistraction\u201d at the event, following the resignations of four Brexit party MEPs. They walked out on Thursday to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cThis was an event about defence but if Nigel was here every question would have been about the defections,\u201d the spokesman said. Ann Widdecombe, the party\u2019s defence spokeswoman, led the speeches at the rally, pushing for Britain to leave the \u201cEuropean defence union\u201d after Brexit and strengthen ties with Nato. The Ulster Unionist party appears to trust Jeremy Corbyn rather than Boris Johnson over the Labour leader\u2019s leaked Treasury document stating that there will be a border down the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland. Steve Aiken, the former submarine commander and now UUP chief, said the material Corbyn was given proved that the Brexit withdrawal agreement would have \u201cruinous consequences for Northern Ireland\u201d. Johnson has insisted his agreement would not lead to customs checks between Britain and the region. Aiken said the information contained in the leak \u201ccomes as no surprise as our analysis of the withdrawal agreement since it first appeared in December 2017 was this was would be the inevitably grim consequences for Northern Ireland\u201d. The UUP leader said: \u201cThe fact that this identifies that Northern Ireland\u2019s SMEs will be likely to struggle to bear the cost should set alarm bells bringing in all sections of the business community and beyond.\u201d Aiken claimed the Boris Johnson withdrawal agreement puts the region \u201con the brink of being torn away from our biggest market (UK) with totally ruinous consequences\u201d. Boris Johnson has unveiled a new election poster in a visit to Kent. It declares: \u201cGet Britain out of neutral.\u201d The poster does not state which gear the Conservatives want to put Britain in but it shows a choice of gears. Channel 4 has apologised, saying Boris Johnson said \u201cpeople of talent\u201d and not \u201cpeople of colour\u201d. They said he had been misquoted. A lot of people expressed their concern at reports of Boris Johnson\u2019s comments on immigration, after it was alleged he said: \u201cI\u2019m in favour of people of colour coming to this country but I think we should have it democratically controlled.\u201d However, Channel 4 News later apologised saying it had misheard him and the prime minister had actually said: \u201cI\u2019m in favour of people of talent coming to this country.\u201d The leader of the Scottish National party, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted about the incident but has since removed it. The former labour prime minister Tony Blair will also speak at a rally in London demanding a second EU referendum. Blair will say: \u201cThis Conservative party which now expels the likes of Michael Heseltine, disowns the statesmanship of John Major, a party whose chancellor as of July this year is now exiled in the wilderness for the temerity to say what he knows to be true, namely that a no-deal Brexit is a risk no responsible government would take, such a Conservative party does not deserve to govern unchecked and the country would not be wise to let them. \u201cIt\u2019s not Brexit that\u2019s getting done. We\u2019re getting done. This is the final chance for a final say. It\u2019s not one general election but 650 individual ones. Think long. Think hard. Time to choose. Choose wisely.\u201d The former Conservative prime minister John Major is expected to urge voters to back rebel candidates running against Boris Johnson in the general election. In a video message, Major will describe Brexit as \u201cthe worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime\u201d. He will say that \u201cit will make our country poorer and weaker and \u201churt most those who have least\u201d. The comments come at the Stop the Brexit Landslide rally organised by campaigners who want to stop Boris Johnson. Other people attending include the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair. Major\u2019s message will endorse three former ministers \u2013 David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton \u2013 who he says are \u201cprincipled decent human beings\u201d. They are all running against Tory candidates. Jeremy Corbyn was asked by Channel 4\u2019s political correspondent, Liz Bates, whether he thinks Labour would fare better among working-class voters with a different leader. He replied: \u201cI think Marmite\u2019s really good for you. Some people like it and some people don\u2019t. I lead the party and I\u2019m proud to lead the party. \u201cAs prime minister, I want to bring our country together. I could reply in lots of ways but I believe personal abuse and personal attacks demean and lower politics, so I never reply. That\u2019s how it is with me, I\u2019ve got a jar of Marmite in my cupboard to prove it.\u201d He said he feels like he could be in the world of Alice In Wonderland, with facts becoming \u201ca little bit elusive\u201d in the election thanks to the prime minister. \u201cHence we have made this document available today,\u201d the Labour leader said. Boris Johnson visited a bakery in Golders Green, north London, on Friday morning. He tweeted: The Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has shared a document marked \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d that he says shows Boris Johnson has been \u201cmisleading\u201d the public on his Brexit deal. See pages from it below: A press conference is about to begin with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Corbyn said the report claimed Mr Johnson\u2019s deal would be \u201chighly disruptive to the Northern Irish economy\u201d. \u201cIt says this deal will be the equivalent of imposing tariffs on 30% of all purchases made in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. The Labour leader also said the report warns of the potential for fraud, saying Northern Ireland could become a \u201cbackdoor into the GB market for the avoidance of import duties\u201d. The BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that the document was not \u201csurprising or secret\u201d but that some of it had been \u201cadmitted under duress by ministers\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, tweeted: Labour\u2019s shadow secretary of state for Brexit, Keir Starmer, has tweeted about a leaked report showing Johnson is \u2018misleading people\u2019 about his Brexit deal. Watch footage of broadcaster Andrew Neil calling for Boris Johnson to be interviewed by him. Corbyn claimed the document \u201cdrives a coach and horses through the Prime Minister\u2019s claim that there will be, in his words, no border in the Irish Sea\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true,\u201d the Labour leader said. \u201cJohnson\u2019s deal will be disastrous for businesses and jobs all across the UK, and the Government\u2019s confidential report confirms this.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has produced a leaked report on Northern Ireland and customs checks, saying it is \u201ccold hard evidence\u201d that Boris Johnson had been \u201cmisleading\u201d people about his Brexit deal. The confidential document, entitled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market, was revealed at a press conference in central London. The Labour leader said it was proof there would be customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit. \u201cWhat we have here is a confidential report by Johnson\u2019s own government, marked official, sensitive, that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal would have on large parts of our country.\u201d Corbyn said Johnson claims there will be \u201cno border in the Irish Sea\u201d but that \u201cis simply not true\u201d. He brings forward a report, marked \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d and says it shows that Johnson\u2019s deal will be \u201chighly disruptive\u201d for Northern Ireland. \u201cHigh street goods are likely to increase in price, which is likely to affect business profitability. If that is how Johnson defines a good deal for Northern Ireland, what has he got in store for rest of us?\u201d The Labour leader highlighted page 9 of the report, which says Johnson\u2019s \u201cdamaging deal may have a significant effect on the economies of Scotland and Wales\u201d. He said that the government was hiding this information and described the document as \u201cominous\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cWhat we have here is a confidential report by Johnson\u2019s own government \u2013 marked official sensitive \u2013 that exposes falsehoods Boris Johnson put forward. It is cold, hard evidence that shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal will have on large parts of our country.\u201d A senior Conservative source has claimed the public are \u201cfed up\u201d with TV interviews that are \u201call about the interviewer\u201d. It comes after veteran broadcaster Andrew Neil called on Boris Johnson to face him in an interview. The Tory candidate for prime minister has refused to do an interview on Neil\u2019s BBC show. \u201cThe public are fed up with interviews that are all about the interviewer and endless interruptions,\u201d said the source. \u201cThe format is broken and needs to change if it is to start engaging and informing the public again. \u201cThe PM will focus on talking to voters about people\u2019s priorities including investing in our NHS and helping with the cost of living.\u201d Labour Party politician, David Lammy, tweeted: The Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA), which represents 540 station staff, condemned a Tory candidate for undermining RMT\u2019s South Western Railway strike \u201cfor his own political benefit\u201d. Chris Loder, who is standing in Oliver Letwin\u2019s West Dorset seat, boasted on his website that he was volunteering as a guard to keep the trains running. But he said nothing about his role as head of new trains with South Western Railways, responsible for driving through the new driver only trains at the heart of the dispute. TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said \u201cThe truth is there was a deal on the table that was acceptable to the RMT but it was pulled by South Western Railway at the last minute \u2013 most likely to give Loder the chance to further his political career while causing misery to passengers. \u201cThis is nothing more than a callous, cynical and disingenuous stunt by a former union member who\u2019s turned strike breaker to further his political career. \u201cIf Loder genuinely cared about passengers, he would support the RMT\u2019s efforts to protect safety. Instead this Tory candidate is now involved in undermining the strike for his own political benefit. A decade of \u201csavage\u201d austerity cuts to local authorities has led to the closure of vital public services, a new study suggests. Children\u2019s centres, libraries, bus routes and toilets are among areas affected, according to research that showed the impact of huge reductions in council funding. A series of Freedom of Information (FoI) requests by the union across England, Scotland and Wales examined the changes in local services between 2010 and 2019 for several council services. The report said cuts have led to a 17% fall in council spending on local services in England since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Today\u2019s front pages: The Guardian Today, we report on the rising toll of measles with nearly 10m cases and 142 deaths. Veteran broadcaster Neil\u2019s call for Johnson to be interviews also appears on the front page, which can be viewed here. Daily Mail The paper leads on Brexit party MEPs resigning to back Johnson and The Jewish Labour Movement\u2019s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission about antisemitism in the Labour party. View the front page here. Daily Mirror On the front is a story about Andrew Neil blasting Johnson for refusing to face him in an interview. The headline reads: How can anyone trust him? See it here. Financial Times The front looks at how Saudi Aramco $25.6B breaks initial public offering (IPO) record. Here is a link to it. i The focus on the frons is that it is \u201ccrunch time\u201d for Corbyn as it is reported that he makes last-ditch appeal to voters. A selection of more front pages The BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg has tweeted: She added: \u201cNot sure the very healthy viewing figures for the interviews quite back that up\u201d. A YouGov poll for the Times, published overnight, suggests that the Scottish National Party (SNP) will continue to dominate the Scottish political landscape after the election, with support for the nationalists up at 44% \u2013 higher than it has been at any point during the election campaign and up seven points on the 2017 general election result. Support for the Scottish Conservatives has increased eight points from August to 28%, a revival of their fortunes after the slump that followed Johnson\u2019s election to party leader but not enough to save five MPs. Seat projections from the poll see the SNP up from 35 to 46, Tories down from 13 to 8, the Lib Dems sticking at 4 and Labour losing all but one of their 7 Mps. While these findings could have a significant impact on the prospect of a Corbyn minority government, it\u2019s worth remembering just how marginal many of the seats in Scotland are, with a week of campaigning left. Analysing the results, polling guru John Curtice noted that while the SNP have managed to cross the Brexit divide and largely keep their Leave voters, they have also won Remain supporters from opponents. \u201cSouth of the border Labour has been able to advance during the campaign by winning back Remain voters from the Liberal Democrats. However, in Scotland the SNP dominates the Remain vote \u2014 more than half (54 per cent) of Remainers support the party, a figure that shows no sign of diminishing. Labour, on 16 per cent, is simply left to share the crumbs with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.\u201d A Conservative candidate has said disabled people should be paid less as \u201cthey don\u2019t understand money\u201d. Sally-Ann Hart, the candidate for Hastings and Rye, was met with hostility from an audience and she defended sharing an article that suggested paying disabled people less. On EU citizens being able to vote in a potential future Brexit referendum, Long-Bailey added: \u201cI think it\u2019s right.\u201d She said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to ensure that those people have the opportunity to vote over their future, because essentially this isn\u2019t just about the future of people who were born here, it\u2019s about the future of people who contribute to our economy and have done for a very, very long time.\u201d The Economist has endorsed the Liberal Democrats in its final edition before the election. Rebecca-Long Bailey also discussed the Jewish Labour Movement\u2019s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), saying that some of the comments in it were \u201cshocking\u201d. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Long-Bailey said: \u201cI haven\u2019t looked at it, no. I\u2019ve certainly seen media reports. \u201cAnd what I\u2019d say is, I mean some of the comments that I\u2019ve seen in the press have been absolutely shocking and the Labour party would never under any circumstances condone any antisemitic behaviour in the way that\u2019s been outlined in that report.\u201d She added that the Labour party \u201cdid not deal with the problem quickly enough when it was first presented\u201d but that now they have \u201csped up our processes\u201d and have a \u201cmore robust regime\u201d in place. Long-Bailey continued: \u201cSome of the comments that I\u2019ve certainly read about the way members have been treated, it\u2019s absolutely horrifying, and if they\u2019ve been treated that way by members of the Labour party then people who were in the Labour party certainly shouldn\u2019t be members of the Labour party \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d She added: \u201cBut there\u2019s still further to go, and as a party who\u2019s been proud to stand up against racism and antisemitism and all forms of discrimination, we want to have the gold standard. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to listen and look at the report and the comments that have been made and to very, very carefully consider and act upon any recommendations that the EHRC make.\u201d Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, spoke on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. She said: \u201cMany businesses need support ... before they have made their profits and don\u2019t feel they receive that support.\u201d Long-Bailey said Labour had released a 20-point plan to reform the business rates system to make it \u201cfairer for smaller businesses to operate.\u201d She added: \u201cWe will scrap quarterly reporting for companies with a turnover under \u00a385,000.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Jim Waterson explores the reality of how smartphones turned election news into chaos. Groundbreaking research gives snapshot of a world in which politics coverage is warped by social media algorithms and friendship groups. At least four ministers have gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates facing allegations of Islamophobia since the claims against them came to light, the Guardian has learned. Read the full article here. Michael Gove has said allowing EU citizens to vote in another Brexit referendum would go against the principle of democratic fairness. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: There\u2019s a basic principle of democratic fairness. It is the case that EU nationals don\u2019t vote, have never voted, in general elections, and therefore don\u2019t vote, have never voted in referendums like the Brexit referendum \u2013 and, therefore, we just think it would be unfair. It\u2019s a bit like a rugby league final, 13 players on either side. If one team suddenly said we\u2019re going to play rugby union instead and bring two extra players on to the field, that simply wouldn\u2019t be fair. He added that he understands Labour\u2019s argument but that it is \u201cfundamentally an assault on the basic democratic principle\u201d. What makes it worse, I think, to fair-minded observers is the idea that the referendum next time round, if the Labour party were to come into power, would be run according to different rules, and rules that every objective observer says would be more likely to favour remain. Nick Robinson, who will lead a head-to-head TV debate between Corbyn and Johnson, said on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cDebates can be frustrating, interviews are limiting \u2026 Let\u2019s hope [politicians] do more interviews next week.\u201d He said head-to-heads such as this \u201clet us see the two men most likely to be in Downing Street \u2026 properly debate\u201d. A lot of the newspapers today lead on a dossier on antisemitism in the Labour party. The Jewish Labour Movement\u2019s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission \u2013 which is investigating the party \u2013 was leaked. Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, gave up his place on the BBC Question Time panel last night after it was pointed out that it would be an all-male panel. Anneliese Dodds took up the position instead. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has said four politicians who quit to back the Conservatives had been plotting against him ever since Johnson took over as leader. He pointed out that Annunziata Rees-Mogg was related to cabinet minister Jacob, and claimed another of the defectors was a \u201cpersonal friend\u201d of the prime minister. The broadcaster Andrew Neil laid out a challenge for Boris Johnson to commit to an interview with him. He said: \u201cIt is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s front pages: On Friday evening, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will face the Conservative leader, Boris Johnson, for the last time before election night. The pair will go head to head in an hour-long BBC debate in Kent. With only one week to go before voters go to the polls, it\u2019s seen as a last attempt for both candidates to secure votes and sway those yet undecided on who to back. The debate will be chaired by the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Nick Robinson. It begins at 8.30pm, wth Corbyn giving the first 60-second opening statement. Questions will come from the audience. Suggestions have also submitted through the BBC website. Robinson has vowed to \u201climit the time [the candidates] spend delivering \u2018oven ready\u2019 soundbites\u201d. Former Labour and Conservative prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major are expected to appear via video link to headline a \u201cFinal Say\u201d rally on Friday. The event has been set up to stop Boris Johnson getting into power and will feature the former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, the journalist Ayesha Hazarika, and radio presenter James O\u2019Brien. Data analytics firm YouGov is conducting a snap poll and will declare the winner at 9.30pm live on Sky News. Corbyn has invited journalists to a press conference on Friday morning in central London, commencing at 9.30am. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will visit a playgroup in Hampshire to promote the party\u2019s plans to increase childcare funding for disadvantaged children aged three and four. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, will launch the party\u2019s small business manifesto in Bolton at 9.30am. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s politics live blog. We will be running down the main political events of the day. Stay tuned for more updates.",

      "body": "<h2>Corbyn fails to land knockout blow \u2026 but does have best moment</h2> <p>The conventional wisdom among the punditocracy has been that this was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last chance to change the dynamics of this contest, and if that was the case he didn\u2019t manage it, even though in parts he had the best of the debate. The YouGov poll suggests Boris Johnson narrowly came out on top when viewers were asked who won, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1203072894563213314\">on another measure Corbyn did better.</a></p> <p>Johnson\u2019s message about Labour not offering certainty on Brexit is a powerful one, and if anything the PM made it even more effectively on Friday night than he did in the ITV debate two and a half weeks ago.</p> <p>That said, Corbyn had the best moment, when he came back at Johnson over \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d and said what was a failure of leadership was using racist language. It was a powerful blow, and perhaps the best moment of the debate. After a question about Islamophobia and antisemitism, when Corbyn condemned racism in general terms, but declined to say that Johnson was personally culpable in this regard, Johnson switched the topic back to leadership. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that, you know, Mr Corbyn, I\u2019m sure is very well intentioned. But I think in his handling of this particular issue, his unwillingness to take a stand, to stand up for Jewish people in the Labour party. His unwillingness to protect them, to put an arm round them, is in my view a failure of leadership. You cannot be neutral on questions like this, any more, in my view, than you can try to lead this country and be neutral on the issue of Brexit. It is a failure to take a stand, to have a point of view, that in the end will cost this country gravely and deeply.</p> </blockquote> <p>At this point Corbyn hit back:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A failure of leadership is when you use racist remarks to describe people in different countries or in our society. I will never do that and my party will never do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the first debate between the two leaders Johnson\u2019s track record of using racist language in his journalism did not come up at all, and this moment left one wondering if Corbyn should have gone on the offensive on this issue much earlier in the campaign. It was an effective retort, but it did not silence Johnson and he recovered very well by pivoting back to Brexit, and asking of Corbyn\u2019s solution to Brexit: Where is it?</p> <p>This has been Johnson\u2019s most powerful message throughout the campaign and on Friday, although much of what he said was familiar, he was probably sharper and more incisive on this point than he has been before. He joked about how Corbyn\u2019s Brexit deal would be a \u201cmystery deal\u201d, because it was not clear what would be in it, and how he could not identify who would negotiate it in the shadow cabinet because most of Corbyn\u2019s team back remain. Johnson also claimed that, if he were able to get the UK out of the EU by the end of January next year, investment worth \u00a3150bn would come flooding into the country (an assertion that is unlikely to survive factchecking). For Corbyn, Brexit was defensive territory, but at least the audience was not as sceptical when he was explaining Labour\u2019s policy as it was in the ITV debate and he may have made an impression with his argument that Johnson\u2019s trade deal with the US might take seven years to negotiate - a point he made repeatedly.</p> <p>Corbyn was better on domestic policy. Although he may have overdone the tendency to reference the 1940s, he was calm and persuasive when arguing that Labour\u2019s plans to increase the level of state spending would only take the UK up towards an EU average and on crime and the London Bridge terror attacks his points about the impact of prison cuts were at least as potent as anything Johnson said about sentencing.</p> <p>Much of what was said replicated what was said at the ITV debate, and that probably explains why the YouGov snap polling has recorded almost exactly the same verdict as it did last month. The most interesting question of the night came when Nick Robinson asked them which had done most to raise living standards: socialism or capitalism. Because it was a quick fire round, we just got stock answers. But a one-hour debate between Johnson and Corbyn exploring this topic alone in more detail would have made excellent TV, and would probably have ended up being more illuminating.</p> <h2>Meanwhile</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/06/channel-4-apologises-over-subtitle-error-on-viral-boris-johnson-clip\">Channel 4 News has apologised</a> after a subtitling error wrongly claimed Boris Johnson had discussed whether \u201cpeople of colour\u201d should be allowed into the UK, prompting the Conservatives to accuse staff at the channel of being campaigners rather than journalists.

Although he may have overdone the tendency to reference the 1940s, he was calm and persuasive when arguing that Labour\u2019s plans to increase the level of state spending would only take the UK up towards an EU average and on crime and the London Bridge terror attacks his points about the impact of prison cuts were at least as potent as anything Johnson said about sentencing. Much of what was said replicated what was said at the ITV debate, and that probably explains why the YouGov snap polling has recorded almost exactly the same verdict as it did last month. The most interesting question of the night came when Nick Robinson asked them which had done most to raise living standards: socialism or capitalism. Because it was a quick fire round, we just got stock answers. But a one-hour debate between Johnson and Corbyn exploring this topic alone in more detail would have made excellent TV, and would probably have ended up being more illuminating. Meanwhile \u2022 Channel 4 News has apologised after a subtitling error wrongly claimed Boris Johnson had discussed whether \u201cpeople of colour\u201d should be allowed into the UK, prompting the Conservatives to accuse staff at the channel of being campaigners rather than journalists. In reality, Johnson said he was in favour of having \u201cpeople of talent\u201d come to the UK, and did not discuss race. \u2022 At least four ministers have gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates facing allegations of Islamophobia since the claims against them came to light, the Guardian has learned. \u2022 Conservatives have dismissed Andrew Neil\u2019s demands for Johnson interview. \u2022 Michael Gove has said allowing EU citizens to vote in another Brexit referendum would represent \u201can assault\u201d on democracy.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party has pledged to electrify England\u2019s entire bus fleet by 2030, promising to bring services \u201cinto the future\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn said \u201cthe Westminster bubble\u201d didn\u2019t care about buses, despite the fact that so many people rely on them. He said the Conservatives had overseen the cancellation or reduction of 3,000 routes across the country leaving people \u201cisolated and stuck at home\u201d. His party plans to electrify all of England\u2019s 35,000 buses by 2030, reducing their emissions by 72%, and fund a reverse in the cuts to services as well as creating new ones. Labour has pledged to give local authorities the power to regulate bus services and create council-owned bus companies, allowing them to bring down the cost of tickets. In areas where bus services are brought into public control, bus travel would be free to under-25s. \u201cThe Westminster bubble doesn\u2019t care about buses but cuts to bus routes leave so many people isolated, stuck at home and unable to make vital trips out,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cAway from London, many people have approached me in this election to talk about their local bus route closing down. \u201cThis policy will bring our bus services into the future and help to revitalise our high streets and rebuild local communities. We want people to be proud of their local bus service.\u201d Approximately 700 of the 35,000 buses in England are currently electric, most of which are in London. Labour calculates that the cost of electrifying the rest of the fleet over a 10-year period would be under \u00a34bn, and would be funded through their \u00a3250bn Green Transformation Fund. The party said its costing was based on analysis of the price difference between electric and conventional buses, and included estimates for reimbursing owners of conventional buses for retiring the vehicles early. Based on the 2018 average electricity grid mix, electric buses create 72% less greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel buses. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, accused the Conservative party of not caring about \u201cbuses nor the people and communities who rely on them\u201d. \u201cThe Tories\u2019 manifesto didn\u2019t pledge a penny to reverse a decade of cuts to local bus services,\u201d he said. \u201cBuses are by far the most used and most important form of public transport but huge budget cuts have caused bus use to plummet to an all time low.\u201d The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, hit back, saying: \u201cLabour\u2019s war on the motorist continues apace.\u201d \u201cLabour won\u2019t be able to deliver a modern bus network because they would raid the roads\u2019 budget and scrap vital new roads and upgrades to fund their fantasy giveaways,\u201d he said. \u201cCorbyn\u2019s Labour would bring gridlock to our roads and gridlock to parliament with their plans for another two chaotic referendums next year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson of having made \u201cracist remarks\u201d as the pair clashed over Islamophobia and antisemitism in their parties in a crucial head-to-head debate less than a week before polling day. Corbyn made the allegation during the BBC One leaders\u2019 debate on Friday as he defended himself against Johnson\u2019s charge that his handling of antisemitism complaints within Labour was a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d. After setting out what his party has done to address antisemitism, Corbyn implied Johnson had failed to tackle Islamophobia in the Conservatives and had used racist language himself. \u201cThere are problems of Islamophobia within our society also and there are problems of language that is used. I do not ever use racist language in any form to describe anybody in this world or in our society,\u201d he said. Johnson said any Tories guilty of Islamophobia or racism were \u201cout first bounce\u201d even though some remain candidates after apologising. He then went on the attack, saying: \u201cI think that Mr Corbyn\u2019s handling of this particular issue, his unwillingness to take a stand and stand up for Jewish people in the Labour party and put an arm round them is a failure of leadership.\u201d Corbyn was then more explicit in his attack on Johnson, who has been criticised in the past for articles describing black people as \u201cpicaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and comparing Muslim women wearing the full face veil to \u201cbank robbers\u201d and \u201cletterboxes\u201d. The Labour leader said: \u201cA failure of leadership is when you use racist remarks to describe people from different countries or in our society. I will never do that \u2026 I hope that the prime minister understands the hurt that people feel when they hear remarks and articles he has written. \u201cI hope he will regret those and understand the importance of using respectful language towards people of all faiths and religions and languages in what is a multicultural society.\u201d The exchanges were the most dramatic altercation during the hour-long televised debate on Friday evening, continuing a row that has raged all campaign about both parties tolerating racism within their ranks and picking candidates who have made racist remarks. Labour has been fighting allegations that it has failed to deal with a deluge of complaints about antisemitism, with the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, warning that Jews feel \u201canxious\u201d about the prospect of a Corbyn-led government. At the same time, the Tories have been dogged by accusations that they have failed to deal with Islamophobia, with Johnson himself under fire over his comments. After the leaders clashed over racism, Corbyn went on to suggest Johnson was guilty of political lies in the election and referendum, saying: \u201cThere has to be a test on the statements made. If people paint slogans on the side of a bus that are totally unsustainable, perhaps it\u2019s time that we did have independent monitoring.\u201d Johnson gave a jovial answer about politicians who lie, saying \u201cthey should be made to go on their knees through the chamber of the House of Commons scourging themselves with copies of their offending documents\u201d. A snap poll from YouGov found 52% of Britons asked after watching the debate believed Johnson won and 48% Corbyn. The pollster said it fell within the margin of error and so could be considered another draw. Those surveyed said Corbyn was more trustworthy than Johnson by 48% to 38% but Johnson was considered more prime ministerial by 54% to 30%. Earlier in the debate, the two men clashed over whether the future of Britain should be capitalist or socialist and their plans for the NHS. They set out vastly different visions for the UK, with Johnson promoting free market capitalism in a post-Brexit Britain and Corbyn arguing for Scandinavian-style democratic socialism in the UK to tackle inequality Corbyn said: \u201cSocialism carried out in a democratic way in this country, in Scandinavia and other places, has raised the living standards of the very poorest. It was the postwar Labour government that raised up the very poorest. Our Labour government will do the same again.\u201d Johnson argued that a free market economy was the way forward and criticised John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, for saying he wants to \u201cfoment the overthrow of capitalism\u201d. Corbyn hit back that \u201cinequality has got worse\u201d under the Conservatives and highlighted \u201c150 billionaires in Britain, more people poor than ever\u201d. The leaders also jousted over the NHS, which has become a huge issue during the campaign, with Corbyn accusing Johnson of putting it at risk through a planned trade deal with Donald Trump. Johnson said the claim from Corbyn was \u201cpure Bermuda Triangle stuff\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard it time and time again from the Labour party during this election campaign. We\u2019ll be hearing about \u2018little green men\u2019 next,\u201d he said. Johnson also went on the offensive over the NHS, saying: \u201cWhat I think is totally incomprehensible is to have a system where you try to get more nurses and more staff into the NHS and simultaneously ask the whole of the public sector to work a four-day week.\u201d Corbyn said there was \u201cno plan to bring in a four-day week in the NHS\u201d, even though McDonnell has previously said all sectors including the NHS would eventually be covered by the aim to reduce working hours. After the debate, a spokesperson for Corbyn, who toured the spin room, said Johnson\u2019s claims that Labour would put up corporation tax to the highest level in Europe were a \u201cbarefaced lie\u201d which showed \u201ceither a worrying level of ignorance of how other major economies are run or again this deliberate misleading [of] the public which seems to be his special number\u201d. He added: \u201cHe\u2019s completely wrong on corporation tax \u2013 26% is lower than France, lower than Italy, Germany. Lower than we were in 2010.\u201d But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, doubled down on Johnson\u2019s incorrect claim that Britons would pay the highest taxes in Europe under Labour.

      "bodyText": "Labour has accused Boris Johnson of misrepresenting the impact of his Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, as Jeremy Corbyn revealed a leaked Treasury document that suggested prices will rise and businesses will struggle to bear the costs of border checks. The Labour leader said the document revealed the \u201ccold, hard facts\u201d about the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. The document, entitled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market, warns that \u201cthe withdrawal agreement has the potential to separate Northern Ireland in practice from whole swathes of the UK\u2019s internal market\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cThis drives a coach and horses through Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that there will be no border in the Irish Sea.\u201d The document suggests that for trade going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, the government cannot rule out several different checks, including on regulations and animal health. \u201cAt minimum, exit summary declarations will be required when goods are exported from Northern Ireland to Great Britain in order to meet EU obligations,\u201d it says. And for trade going the other way \u2013 from Great Britain to Northern Ireland \u2013 there could potentially be tariffs, the document suggests. A section headed \u201ceconomic impact on Northern Ireland\u201d suggests high street goods are \u201clikely to increase in price\u201d, and many exporters could struggle with the costs of border checks, which will be \u201chighly disruptive\u201d. The prime minister has repeatedly insisted the Brexit deal he struck in November will not require border checks. He even told one business in Northern Ireland that if they were asked to fill in a form, they should ring him, and \u201cI will direct them to throw that form in the bin\u201d. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, appearing alongside Corbyn at the press conference in London, said: \u201cThe issue of whether there are going to be checks is absolutely blown out of the water by this document, as is the suggestion that it won\u2019t be bad for business. \u201cThis exposes the untruth of Johnson and the evidence is coming from his own Treasury.\u201d The document appeared to have been drawn up to set out the economic and political implications of the government\u2019s promise to maintain \u201cunfettered access\u201d to the British market for business in Northern Ireland. That promise is made in the Northern Ireland protocol that replaced the backstop in Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. At the event in central London, Corbyn also appeared to acknowledge that with less than a week to go until polling day, he was a divisive figure. Asked whether he believed another leader could be more successful among working-class voters, he said: \u201cI think Marmite\u2019s really good for you; some people like it, some people don\u2019t.\u201d Starmer, who has made few frontline media appearances during the campaign, confirmed that he would support remain in a second Brexit referendum, which Corbyn has promised to hold within six months. \u201cI voted for remain last time and I\u2019d do it again,\u201d he said. At a Conservative campaign event near Maidstone in Kent, the prime minister was asked about the documents. He said he hadn\u2019t read them but that Labour\u2019s claims were \u201cnonsense\u201d. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that with the deal that we have, we can come out as one whole UK \u2013 England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together. We can do free-trade deals together, we can take back control of our borders and our own immigration system. \u201cIf you look at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposed deal, under no circumstances are he or his colleagues going to take back control of immigration.\u201d He added: \u201cThey should believe exactly what I say, which is that there will be no checks on goods going between GB to NI, or NI to GB, because we are going to come out of the EU whole and entire.\u201d Conservative sources also sought to insist that the documents were not complete.

      "bodyText": "Amid ongoing concern from Labour strategists about whether the party can hold on to the support of leave voters in marginal seats, focus groups conducted for the Guardian this week suggested Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cget Brexit done\u201d strategy was cutting through. In Rainham in Essex, a group of leave voters, some of whom had voted Labour in the past, spoke warmly about the prime minister. And if his endlessly repeated mantra was familiar, warnings about his character appeared to have made less of an impact. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with everything he says, but he cheers me up,\u201d said Sarah (participants agreed to be referred to by their first names). \u201cHe\u2019s like a puppy: you can\u2019t kick a puppy,\u201d said Norman . \u201cHe reminds me of a bog brush: I like him!\u201d said Lisa. Labour strategists are particularly concerned about the party\u2019s appeal among its traditional supporters in Brexit-voting areas, who may be susceptible to Johnson\u2019s signature pledge. There was a sense among the leave group that the prime minister was capable of getting things done \u2013 an alluring characteristic to voters deeply frustrated by three and a half years of Brexit stasis. \u201cYou don\u2019t want someone indecisive,\u201d said Michael. Asked to describe the Tories in one word or phrase, he said they were \u201cbullish\u201d. Asked what he meant by that, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s good but it\u2019s also bad.

Rather than blaming Boris Johnson and the Tory governments that preceded his, several of the Brexiters pointed the finger at Cruddas for failing to secure improvements for his constituents. Cruddas held the seat in 2017 with a majority of less than 5,000; but the perception was that he doesn\u2019t have to fight hard for it. \u201cEvery election time he\u2019s probably sitting back in his seat, having a spa, thinking: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve got this in the bag,\u2019\u201d said Michael, to general laughter. The leavers also raised questions about the slew of giveaways in Labour\u2019s manifesto, from free broadband to restoring the pensions of Waspi women. \u201cWhere is all this money, this funding, these people coming from?\u201d said Elaine. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep taxing working people.\u201d Asked to come up with a single word or phrase that represents each of the two main parties, Labour was \u201cbroken promises\u201d or \u201ceverything promised\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Let us start with the crowds, for they are at the heart of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s story. They queued around the block in 2015 to see him claim the Labour leadership; weeks after he last ran to be prime minister they gathered in a field in Glastonbury and sang his name.</p> \n<p>And in 2019 he can still pull a crowd. They\u2019ll come miles, pack out halls, end up so far back that they can\u2019t hear, let alone see him. All for a politician not known for his soaring oratory; whose CV boasts not one single day in government.</p> \n<p>But they come anyway \u2013 to hear a contender for power promise a more generous public sector, a government that cares, a different politics and language than they\u2019ve known for decades. An era that could begin next week.</p> \n<p>A Saturday afternoon at the community hall in the West Yorkshire village of Mytholmroyd is typical. Tickets for the Labour leader\u2019s pitstop went on offer one evening at teatime; they\u2019d all gone before breakfast next morning. Now there\u2019s about 300 people in their mud-caked walking boots and waterproofs.</p> \n<p>Calder Valley is the sort of seat Corbyn must win to get into No 10 and, as he reminds activists on the penultimate weekend of the campaign, it\u2019s there for the taking. Tory MP Craig Whittaker holds it by a tiny majority of just 609 and the Greens, who racked up 631 votes in 2017, are sitting this one out.</p> \n<p>Party staffers call this event a \u201cMe-Mo\u201d, a member mobilisation, yet Corbyn avoids any hard sell. No one is asked to do anything for him. Rhetorically, he stands in for the audience, while they stand in for the country. No \u201cI\u201d, no \u201dyou\u201d, just \u201dwe\u201d: \u201cWhen we win, the nurse wins, the teacher wins, the doctor wins.\u201d No sooner does he end then there\u2019s a surge of people wanting a word, a handshake, a selfie. His exit from the hall can be measured in quarter-inches.</p> \n<p>A boy shouts, \u201cChange the world!\u201d and the 70-year-old beckons him over, so the suited entourage halts again. Brown-haired and beaming, Solomon is 12, \u201cbut my teachers say I\u2019m going on 40\u201d. His number one issue is the threat of climate breakdown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2aaf21d609e54cc54de89c32505180577b7d46f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2aaf21d609e54cc54de89c32505180577b7d46f/0_259_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn talks to supporters at Mytholmroyd Community Centre.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf Boris gets in, I don\u2019t know what my future or the planet\u2019s future even looks like.\u201d This is a family day out, with his parents driving up from Holmfirth. They\u2019ve been canvassing for Labour and dad Moses admits some of the conversations on the doorstep are tough, especially once the subject is Corbyn. He\u2019s heard it all: weak leadership, Brexit, but most of all anti-semitism. \u201cIt\u2019s the media, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, and shoots me the kind of look Solomon\u2019s teachers save for the naughty boys.</p> \n<p>Local Labour councillor, Steve Sweeney, breaks into a grin as wide as the River Calder as he remembers organising a meeting for the Labour leader at Hebden Bridge in May 2017. Over a thousand came to that one rally, so impossibly many that Corbyn had to go outside to deliver his speech a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackkJazz/status/864264019091357698?s=20\">second time</a>. Some latecomers wanted in so badly they stood in the river. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine they caught a word.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cPerhaps no historical phenomenon has been so thoroughly neglected by historians as the crowd,\u201d wrote French scholar George Rude in his classic The Crowd In History. Whether at Bastille in 1789 or Peterloo in 1819, the \u201cfaces in the crowd\u201d were considered not as a \u201cliving and many-sided phenomenon\u201d but \u201can abstract formula\u201d. The activists who thronged in driving rain at Sheffield last month to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/question-time-leaders-special-who-won-johnson-corbyn-swinson-sturgeon\">cheer Corbyn as he went on Question Time: Leaders Special</a> were not doing anything half so dramatic, but they and others have been deluged in condescension.</p> \n<p>To much of the press, they are little more than \u201cCorbynistas\u201d, bovine hordes lowing against the ideologically impure. Yet those grassroots supporters have called the past half-decade better than most in the Westminster village. As insiders laughed at his leadership chances, it was the growing crowds that showed he was a serious contender. When Labour MPs demanded Corbyn quit, his biggest support came from the crowds mobilising outside parliament.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/06/labour-divided-family-together-brexitland-remainia\">Can Labour bring its divided family together? | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Against press onslaught, Corbyn\u2019s supporters have been his defence. When the polls look poor, his crowds have served as a reminder that anything is possible. For Corbyn himself, they show that he heads a \u201csocial movement\u201d. Over the last few hours of this historic election, their role will be vital. And if Labour lose badly on Thursday night, then one big question on Friday morning will be who and what Corbyn\u2019s crowds will accept.</p> \n<p>One thing is clear: they are not to be taken for granted. The crowds this campaign would delight any other politician but by Corbyn\u2019s standard they are typically smaller and older. Cold, wet evenings are no friend to the outdoor epic meeting, and the Labour leader is no longer the promising up-and-comer he appeared to be at Glastonbury two years ago. Yet senior advisers still puzzle over why his dire personal ratings have not enjoyed anything like the boost they got in 2017.</p> \n<p>And for much of this year, some Corbyn-supporting MPs have been privately worrying about something else: dimming enthusiasm among the base, disappointed over his wavering on Brexit and the leadership\u2019s foot-dragging over its anti-semitism crisis, which has been allowed to fester and grow into one of the defining issues of this election.</p> \n<p>The Guardian\u2019s own evidence backs this up. For this piece, analysts from our data and insight team studied website traffic since the start of 2017, and found that readership for Corbyn-related headlines had tailed off since this spring, sliding below that of all pieces on UK politics. On one of the leading liberal-left news sites in the English-speaking world, the British politician who draws most readers is Tory Boris Johnson. His novelty as prime minister, as well as his wrangling over Brexit are surely two big reasons why, but it also looks as if the thrill is not gone, but may be going.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f78a7cad8724849e02c4f814039b6d66e4d48162\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f78a7cad8724849e02c4f814039b6d66e4d48162/0_199_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn prepares for an interview with Sky News at the community hall in Mytholmroyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corbyn prepares for an interview with Sky News at the community hall in Mytholmroyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In Mytholmroyd, Labour councillor Roisin Cavanagh has spotted something else to worry her leader. After a decade of austerity, the hard-up voters she canvasses \u201chave lost the ability to believe that things can be different\u201d. She recently met a woman who had lost her home thanks to the bedroom tax and now lived in a small flat. With no room to put up her daughter, she complained of feeling isolated. Asked what she made of the bedroom tax, the woman said simply: \u201cIt\u2019s the system, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what it does to people like me.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the other side of the same community hall, Sky News are setting up to interview the Labour leader. Armed with three cameras, the crew strive to make a room normally used for the Stay and Play toddler group into a setting fit for a would-be prime minister. The interview with Sophy Ridge goes out next morning, two days after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/29/london-bridge-police-shoot-stabbing-suspect-after-five-injured\">London Bridge terrorist murders</a> and just before Corbyn gives his key foreign policy speech of the campaign.</p> \n<p>While the presenter pores over her notes, a set of drawers is rolled out of shot and swapped for a Christmas tree. The camera operators stare down their viewfinders with no sign of festive cheer. They inch the tree back and forth, before glumly agreeing to stick with the drawers. In five minutes, navy-suited Corbyn, his wife Laura Alvarez, his chief strategist Seumas Milne and other members of his entourage will enter and the cameras will roll.</p> \n<p>This is what election campaigns demand of party leaders: to sweep from one artfully-composed room to another, precision-delivering messages as they go. Except Corbyn doesn\u2019t do slick.</p> \n<p>Faced with an audience, the Labour leader can be engaging, but on the typical studio ping-pong he is prone to sulk. This trip to Yorkshire follows easily his worst week of the campaign: a front page attack from the chief rabbi for allowing \u201ca new poison\u201d of anti-Jewish racism to enter the party, followed by such a spectacular mauling from the BBC\u2019s in-house pit bull Andrew Neil that Johnson will not be dragged in front of him. A major controversy in this election is whether, as Labour allege, the national broadcaster is failing to hold his opponents to account.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt hurts because he is my husband and I don\u2019t like seeing him treated this way,\u201d says Alvarez, in rust cardigan and red scarf. \u201cBut really we should all be asking: What is happening to our democracy?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a6211aa73112b8889ab3df677ac09fd5a718feb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a6211aa73112b8889ab3df677ac09fd5a718feb/0_150_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn speaks to supporters before taking part in the Channel 4 climate debate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn speaks to supporters before taking part in the Channel 4 climate debate.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A few days beforehand, I went to Channel 4 in London to watch Corbyn debate other leaders on climate change. It could have been a good night. Johnson had ducked out again, to be replaced with a giant ice sculpture, while the other leaders all had weak-spots. Yet the youngish activists watching in the Channel 4 spin room went from receptive to restive.</p> \n<p>When Corbyn showed his commitment to forestry by waving his own hard-copy dead-tree report, some moaned. To underline his green credentials, he boasted how rarely he stuck on the central heating, adding, \u201cI\u2019m quite miserable, actually\u201d, prompting well-wisher Matthew Butcher to mutter: \u201cOh, mate \u2013 I did climate comms and the first thing they teach you is never say it\u2019s miserable.\u201d</p> \n<p>The biggest bafflement was summed up by another Labour-supporting environmentalist: \u201cHe was stood next to a giant fucking melting ice cube \u2013 how could he not once turn to it and say, \u2018What does Boris Johnson think?

As the evening breaks up and he prepares for tomorrow\u2019s speeches, he asks if we enjoyed the rally: \u201cLovely atmosphere, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Let us start with the crowds, for they are at the heart of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s story. They queued around the block in 2015 to see him claim the Labour leadership; weeks after he last ran to be prime minister they gathered in a field in Glastonbury and sang his name. And in 2019 he can still pull a crowd. They\u2019ll come miles, pack out halls, end up so far back that they can\u2019t hear, let alone see him. All for a politician not known for his soaring oratory; whose CV boasts not one single day in government. But they come anyway \u2013 to hear a contender for power promise a more generous public sector, a government that cares, a different politics and language than they\u2019ve known for decades. An era that could begin next week. A Saturday afternoon at the community hall in the West Yorkshire village of Mytholmroyd is typical. Tickets for the Labour leader\u2019s pitstop went on offer one evening at teatime; they\u2019d all gone before breakfast next morning. Now there\u2019s about 300 people in their mud-caked walking boots and waterproofs. Calder Valley is the sort of seat Corbyn must win to get into No 10 and, as he reminds activists on the penultimate weekend of the campaign, it\u2019s there for the taking. Tory MP Craig Whittaker holds it by a tiny majority of just 609 and the Greens, who racked up 631 votes in 2017, are sitting this one out. Party staffers call this event a \u201cMe-Mo\u201d, a member mobilisation, yet Corbyn avoids any hard sell. No one is asked to do anything for him. Rhetorically, he stands in for the audience, while they stand in for the country. No \u201cI\u201d, no \u201dyou\u201d, just \u201dwe\u201d: \u201cWhen we win, the nurse wins, the teacher wins, the doctor wins.\u201d No sooner does he end then there\u2019s a surge of people wanting a word, a handshake, a selfie. His exit from the hall can be measured in quarter-inches. A boy shouts, \u201cChange the world!\u201d and the 70-year-old beckons him over, so the suited entourage halts again. Brown-haired and beaming, Solomon is 12, \u201cbut my teachers say I\u2019m going on 40\u201d. His number one issue is the threat of climate breakdown. \u201cIf Boris gets in, I don\u2019t know what my future or the planet\u2019s future even looks like.\u201d This is a family day out, with his parents driving up from Holmfirth. They\u2019ve been canvassing for Labour and dad Moses admits some of the conversations on the doorstep are tough, especially once the subject is Corbyn. He\u2019s heard it all: weak leadership, Brexit, but most of all anti-semitism. \u201cIt\u2019s the media, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, and shoots me the kind of look Solomon\u2019s teachers save for the naughty boys. Local Labour councillor, Steve Sweeney, breaks into a grin as wide as the River Calder as he remembers organising a meeting for the Labour leader at Hebden Bridge in May 2017. Over a thousand came to that one rally, so impossibly many that Corbyn had to go outside to deliver his speech a second time. Some latecomers wanted in so badly they stood in the river. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine they caught a word.\u201d \u201cPerhaps no historical phenomenon has been so thoroughly neglected by historians as the crowd,\u201d wrote French scholar George Rude in his classic The Crowd In History. Whether at Bastille in 1789 or Peterloo in 1819, the \u201cfaces in the crowd\u201d were considered not as a \u201cliving and many-sided phenomenon\u201d but \u201can abstract formula\u201d. The activists who thronged in driving rain at Sheffield last month to cheer Corbyn as he went on Question Time: Leaders Special were not doing anything half so dramatic, but they and others have been deluged in condescension. To much of the press, they are little more than \u201cCorbynistas\u201d, bovine hordes lowing against the ideologically impure. Yet those grassroots supporters have called the past half-decade better than most in the Westminster village. As insiders laughed at his leadership chances, it was the growing crowds that showed he was a serious contender. When Labour MPs demanded Corbyn quit, his biggest support came from the crowds mobilising outside parliament. Against press onslaught, Corbyn\u2019s supporters have been his defence. When the polls look poor, his crowds have served as a reminder that anything is possible. For Corbyn himself, they show that he heads a \u201csocial movement\u201d. Over the last few hours of this historic election, their role will be vital. And if Labour lose badly on Thursday night, then one big question on Friday morning will be who and what Corbyn\u2019s crowds will accept. One thing is clear: they are not to be taken for granted. The crowds this campaign would delight any other politician but by Corbyn\u2019s standard they are typically smaller and older. Cold, wet evenings are no friend to the outdoor epic meeting, and the Labour leader is no longer the promising up-and-comer he appeared to be at Glastonbury two years ago. Yet senior advisers still puzzle over why his dire personal ratings have not enjoyed anything like the boost they got in 2017. And for much of this year, some Corbyn-supporting MPs have been privately worrying about something else: dimming enthusiasm among the base, disappointed over his wavering on Brexit and the leadership\u2019s foot-dragging over its anti-semitism crisis, which has been allowed to fester and grow into one of the defining issues of this election. The Guardian\u2019s own evidence backs this up. For this piece, analysts from our data and insight team studied website traffic since the start of 2017, and found that readership for Corbyn-related headlines had tailed off since this spring, sliding below that of all pieces on UK politics. On one of the leading liberal-left news sites in the English-speaking world, the British politician who draws most readers is Tory Boris Johnson. His novelty as prime minister, as well as his wrangling over Brexit are surely two big reasons why, but it also looks as if the thrill is not gone, but may be going. In Mytholmroyd, Labour councillor Roisin Cavanagh has spotted something else to worry her leader. After a decade of austerity, the hard-up voters she canvasses \u201chave lost the ability to believe that things can be different\u201d. She recently met a woman who had lost her home thanks to the bedroom tax and now lived in a small flat. With no room to put up her daughter, she complained of feeling isolated. Asked what she made of the bedroom tax, the woman said simply: \u201cIt\u2019s the system, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what it does to people like me.\u201d On the other side of the same community hall, Sky News are setting up to interview the Labour leader. Armed with three cameras, the crew strive to make a room normally used for the Stay and Play toddler group into a setting fit for a would-be prime minister. The interview with Sophy Ridge goes out next morning, two days after the London Bridge terrorist murders and just before Corbyn gives his key foreign policy speech of the campaign. While the presenter pores over her notes, a set of drawers is rolled out of shot and swapped for a Christmas tree. The camera operators stare down their viewfinders with no sign of festive cheer. They inch the tree back and forth, before glumly agreeing to stick with the drawers. In five minutes, navy-suited Corbyn, his wife Laura Alvarez, his chief strategist Seumas Milne and other members of his entourage will enter and the cameras will roll. This is what election campaigns demand of party leaders: to sweep from one artfully-composed room to another, precision-delivering messages as they go. Except Corbyn doesn\u2019t do slick. Faced with an audience, the Labour leader can be engaging, but on the typical studio ping-pong he is prone to sulk. This trip to Yorkshire follows easily his worst week of the campaign: a front page attack from the chief rabbi for allowing \u201ca new poison\u201d of anti-Jewish racism to enter the party, followed by such a spectacular mauling from the BBC\u2019s in-house pit bull Andrew Neil that Johnson will not be dragged in front of him. A major controversy in this election is whether, as Labour allege, the national broadcaster is failing to hold his opponents to account. \u201cIt hurts because he is my husband and I don\u2019t like seeing him treated this way,\u201d says Alvarez, in rust cardigan and red scarf. \u201cBut really we should all be asking: What is happening to our democracy?\u201d A few days beforehand, I went to Channel 4 in London to watch Corbyn debate other leaders on climate change. It could have been a good night. Johnson had ducked out again, to be replaced with a giant ice sculpture, while the other leaders all had weak-spots. Yet the youngish activists watching in the Channel 4 spin room went from receptive to restive. When Corbyn showed his commitment to forestry by waving his own hard-copy dead-tree report, some moaned. To underline his green credentials, he boasted how rarely he stuck on the central heating, adding, \u201cI\u2019m quite miserable, actually\u201d, prompting well-wisher Matthew Butcher to mutter: \u201cOh, mate \u2013 I did climate comms and the first thing they teach you is never say it\u2019s miserable.\u201d The biggest bafflement was summed up by another Labour-supporting environmentalist: \u201cHe was stood next to a giant fucking melting ice cube \u2013 how could he not once turn to it and say, \u2018What does Boris Johnson think? Let\u2019s ask him.\u2019 An easy goal but he didn\u2019t tap it in.\u201d That lack of attack runs through Labour\u2019s election, from its mushy slogan of \u201cReal change is coming\u201d to whether it is about the NHS or a \u201ctransformative government\u201d, to the confusion over who calls the shots. Some say John McDonnell, formally Labour campaign chair, runs things; others swear it is Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff Karie Murphy, officially election campaign chief. This Thursday, Labour\u2019s John Healey appeared on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme to pledge an end to rough sleeping \u2013 a \u201cmoral mission\u201d that deserved big billing yet was overshadowed by a commitment from his colleague Angela Rayner to give free breakfasts to all primary pupils. On some mornings, it has felt less a campaign to form the next government and more like an advent calendar. \u201cIt really is \u2018vote Labour and get a free microwave\u2019\u201d, says one frontbencher and Corbyn loyalist, recalling the fat raspberry blown by an adviser to Barack Obama at Ed Miliband\u2019s 2015 campaign. One of New Labour\u2019s signal moments was Gordon Brown\u2019s decision in 2002 to raise National Insurance by a penny and invest in the NHS. Paving the way for that one policy took No 11 well over a year of work. It lured a starch-shirted banker, the now-late Derek Wanless, to chair an independent report that as if by magic reached exactly the conclusion the chancellor desired. In today\u2019s money that programme cost \u00a364bn. By comparison, a fortnight ago shadow chancellor McDonnell said he would spend nearly \u00a360bn to compensate women \u201crobbed\u201d of their pensions. Whatever the merits of that policy, Labour made no attempt beforehand to lay the ground for it and gave little reassurance afterwards on how it could be afforded. In a country that prints its own currency and with borrowing rates near zero, it is affordable; but it is also as if such electoral niceties are beneath them. Two forces are at play here. The first is what Corbyn\u2019s policy chief Andrew Fisher dubbed in his resignation letter this September a \u201clack of professionalism\u201d.

Corbyn\u2019s critics often conflate these distinct forces; the difficulty of his supporters is to avoid the first. \u201cCommon sense is not something rigid and stationary,\u201d wrote the communist Antonio Gramsci, even as his native Italy collapsed into fascism. \u201c[It] creates the folklore of the future, a relatively rigidified phase of popular knowledge in a given time and place.\u201d The struggle, he believed, was to replace it with \u201cgood sense\u201d.

He recalls how the NHS was described by its creator Nye Bevan as \u201ca piece of real socialism\u201d and goes on to argue that the new universalist pledges in the manifesto \u2013 for broadband, for housing, for rail \u2013 are straight out of Labour tradition. \u201cWhen people ask how you can afford it,\u201d he bellows, addressing one big question on the doorstep, \u201cask them how amid the rubble and carnage of the second world war did we build an NHS?\u201d The evening ends with the crowd chanting the anthem of Labour in 2019 \u2013 not the Red Flag but \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. The evening charges up not just the members but the frontbenchers, judging by their buzz in an Italian restaurant afterwards. Alvarez shows pictures of the household cat, El Gato, and frets that for all his slimline good looks he is a Tory, \u201ca selfish individualist\u201d. In her spotted brothel-creepers, Rayner, the self-described \u201ccouncil estate kid\u201d, ribs Milne endlessly about his moneyed background. Over risotto, Corbyn takes a break from worrying about how to get Islington council to bring more services back in-house, to show quite detailed knowledge of how car thieves used to jam a lock, expertise gleaned from when some local youths helped him break into his own car. As the evening breaks up and he prepares for tomorrow\u2019s speeches, he asks if we enjoyed the rally: \u201cLovely atmosphere, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Claim There will be no border in the Irish Sea as a result of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Background The prime minister has repeatedly claimed that his withdrawal agreement with the EU does not create friction in trading between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He has said businesses in Northern Ireland will not face checks or fees when exporting goods to Great Britain. The Conservative party\u2019s manifesto states: \u201cWe will ensure that Northern Ireland\u2019s businesses and producers enjoy unfettered access to the rest of the UK and that in the implementation of our Brexit deal, we maintain and strengthen the integrity and smooth operation of our internal market.\u201d Reality Presentation slides which appear to have come from the Treasury raise all of the problems that would be caused by an attempt to give Northern Irish exporters unfettered access to the UK market. The document, presented by Labour at a press conference, suggests there are many potential barriers to unfettered access, and risks associated with such an arrangement. The slides, entitled NI Protocol: Unfettered access to the UKIM [UK internal market], say that kind of access is \u201cconstrained by the international obligations applying to NI by application of EU law\u201d. It continues: \u201cAt minimum, this means that exit summary declarations will be required when goods are exported from NI to GB.\u201d This will involve extra paperwork for exporters, 98% of which are small or medium-sized businesses. This wording mirrors comments made to a Lords committee in October by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary. From the slides, it appears that the exact meaning of \u201cunfettered access\u201d could be interpreted in different ways. A list of interpretations reads: Lack of restrictions on goods being placed on the market? Regulatory alignment? Administrative costs/burdens? Physical inspections and/or related delays? Also, the amount of friction in trade moving both ways across the Irish Sea is not wholly in the government\u2019s control, but will depend on negotiations with the EU. Friction on the trade route from Northern Ireland will also depend on WTO rules as well as measures introduced by the UK government. The slides list the compliance risks created by unfettered access, including the risk that Northern Ireland could become a backdoor into Great Britain that would be used by other exporters to avoid import duties and/or regulatory standards. The impact on Wales and Scotland, and how their governments will respond, is also explored. \u201cUnfettered access has the potential to undermine the coherence of the UKIM and embed a fundamental asymmetry in its functioning,\u201d the presentation says. The slides make it clear that Northern Ireland has more to lose than Great Britain from any changes, as it relies much more heavily on this trade route. It suggests prices will rise in Northern Ireland, and there could be \u201ctariff equivalents\u201d on 30% of purchases there. Verdict The Conservatives said the presentation was a \u201cflash analysis\u201d carried out after the deal, and not a \u201cdefinitive\u201d statement of the situation. But it suggests that there is still a lot of work to be done before it is established how trade can and will operate between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Negotiations with the EU and Welsh and Scottish governments are needed to determine what checks and processes will be needed. Although the Conservatives may aspire to a frictionless border, it appears impossible to guarantee one at this stage.",

It is the latest development in the six-week row that has engulfed the group campaigning for a second EU referendum and could lead to an official investigation covering donations made around the time of the European elections in June. If the commission finds the rules were broken, it has the power to levy a fine and ask the police to make a further inquiry, as the body did when it accused Vote Leave of breaching spending limits in the final stages of the 2016 referendum campaign. Former staff, however, say no rules were broken. People\u2019s Vote has been mired in crisis since the beginning of the general election campaign, after a boardroom coup led by the financial PR chief Roland Rudd resulted in the firing of the campaign director, James McGrory, who was a former aide to Nick Clegg, and the communications director, Tom Baldwin, who has previously advised Ed Miliband. Staff immediately walked out with the backing of high-profile supporters, including Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson, and the dispute has not been resolved, leaving the organisation collapsing in on itself while the election campaign continues. Rudd was forced to quit as chairman, but the interim management of People\u2019s Vote initiated a compliance review last month, which uncovered the potential discrepancies.

We immediately made the commission aware of this.\u201d The commission said it was aware of the request and was examining the evidence, although it had not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation. A spokesperson for the former staff of the People\u2019s Vote campaign said they were confident they had always complied with Electoral Commission requirements, and that donations made during the European elections were small, online donations. \u201cIt is deeply disappointing that Roland Rudd is once again seeking to damage the People\u2019s Vote by smearing the team who built it in a desperate attempt to avoid taking responsibility for the shambles he has turned this once great campaign into,\u201d the spokesperson said. One of the donations is a six-figure sum given by the businessman Julian Dunkerton, and most are thought to be substantial amounts from wealthy individuals. The money is believed to have been already spent on campaigning, but because campaign groups are covered by finance rules during an election, they should have been declared to the commission. Both sides of the People\u2019s Vote row are continuing to campaign for a second referendum, but they have struggled for national attention.

EU ambassadors preparing the document have serious doubts about the 11-month timetable and opposed sending this positive signal to Johnson.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said it would be possible to negotiate a basic free-trade deal with the UK in 11 months. Others are more sceptical, with one senior diplomat saying he could not imagine it in his wildest dreams.</p> <p>Some diplomats are counting on Johnson to abandon his principles, encouraged by earlier U-turns, such as his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/24/dup-prepared-to-bring-down-government-may-brexit-deal\">broken promise</a> to the Democratic Unionist party not to have a border in the Irish Sea, as well as his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the EU on 31 October.</p> <p>\u201cOf course Boris said he would rather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/boris-johnson-rather-be-dead-in-ditch-than-agree-brexit-extension\">die in a ditch</a>; he didn\u2019t die in a ditch, but he accepted to go beyond 31 October,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat. \u201cIt is not unlikely that there could be an extension of the transition period.\u201d</p> <p>The diplomat added that Johnson had proved \u201cmore pragmatic than anyone expected\u201d.</p> <p>The UK can extend the Brexit transition period once for one or two years, but must agree this extension with the EU before 1 July 2020.</p> <p>The latest EU text also has a reference to \u201cthe level playing field\u201d, meaning the UK must respect core EU standards on workers\u2019 rights, state aid, and environmental and consumer protection, to reach a deal ensuring zero tariffs and zero quotas on British goods.</p> <p>The document, which may change again, is to be adopted by EU leaders at the summit in Brussels on 13 December.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s default scenario is a Johnson victory, but officials have also discussed how to respond to Jeremy Corbyn in No 10, which is seen as less likely.</p> <p>The Labour leader has pledged to \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d by negotiating a new deal with the EU in three months and organising a referendum within six. While EU sources see the Corbyn renegotiation timetable as doable, one former government adviser has said it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaoulRuparel/status/1189851725026484224\">\u201cseems almost impossible\u201d</a> to organise a referendum in six months.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/jeremy-corbyn-defends-his-pledge-to-stay-neutral-in-second-referendum\">remain neutral</a> in any referendum on his revised deal \u201cdoes not do much for his credibility\u201d, the diplomat said. Nonetheless, sources say the EU would engage with a potential prime minister Corbyn, once his government filed a request to delay Brexit and revealed details of its renegotiation plan.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat MEP Luisa Porritt said: \u201cThis leak shows that, under Boris Johnson, Brexit negotiations are set to drag on and on. The chances of a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 are increasing dramatically.</p> <p>\u201cUnlike Boris Johnson, other European leaders are being honest about how long a free-trade negotiation takes.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "EU member states have signalled a refusal to be bounced into Boris Johnson\u2019s fast-track timetable to strike a post-Brexit trade deal. If he wins a majority, the prime minister has vowed to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January and agree on a trade deal with the bloc within 11 months, an unprecedentedly short time for such a complex negotiation. Johnson, who has built his election campaign around the misleading slogan \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, has promised not to extend the 11-month transition period, seen by many as far too short to agree a future relationship with the EU. EU leaders will promise to move \u201cswiftly\u201d to the next phase of UK negotiations, according to a leaked version of their communique to be adopted at a summit next Friday \u2013 the day after the general election. But a reference to \u201cmaking the best possible use of the limited time available\u201d that was contained in an earlier version of the text has been dropped. EU ambassadors preparing the document have serious doubts about the 11-month timetable and opposed sending this positive signal to Johnson. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said it would be possible to negotiate a basic free-trade deal with the UK in 11 months. Others are more sceptical, with one senior diplomat saying he could not imagine it in his wildest dreams. Some diplomats are counting on Johnson to abandon his principles, encouraged by earlier U-turns, such as his broken promise to the Democratic Unionist party not to have a border in the Irish Sea, as well as his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the EU on 31 October. \u201cOf course Boris said he would rather die in a ditch; he didn\u2019t die in a ditch, but he accepted to go beyond 31 October,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat. \u201cIt is not unlikely that there could be an extension of the transition period.\u201d The diplomat added that Johnson had proved \u201cmore pragmatic than anyone expected\u201d. The UK can extend the Brexit transition period once for one or two years, but must agree this extension with the EU before 1 July 2020. The latest EU text also has a reference to \u201cthe level playing field\u201d, meaning the UK must respect core EU standards on workers\u2019 rights, state aid, and environmental and consumer protection, to reach a deal ensuring zero tariffs and zero quotas on British goods. The document, which may change again, is to be adopted by EU leaders at the summit in Brussels on 13 December. The EU\u2019s default scenario is a Johnson victory, but officials have also discussed how to respond to Jeremy Corbyn in No 10, which is seen as less likely. The Labour leader has pledged to \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d by negotiating a new deal with the EU in three months and organising a referendum within six. While EU sources see the Corbyn renegotiation timetable as doable, one former government adviser has said it \u201cseems almost impossible\u201d to organise a referendum in six months. Corbyn\u2019s pledge to remain neutral in any referendum on his revised deal \u201cdoes not do much for his credibility\u201d, the diplomat said. Nonetheless, sources say the EU would engage with a potential prime minister Corbyn, once his government filed a request to delay Brexit and revealed details of its renegotiation plan. The Liberal Democrat MEP Luisa Porritt said: \u201cThis leak shows that, under Boris Johnson, Brexit negotiations are set to drag on and on. The chances of a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 are increasing dramatically. \u201cUnlike Boris Johnson, other European leaders are being honest about how long a free-trade negotiation takes.\u201d",

The final submissions on behalf of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) to the inquiry, which were leaked to the media on Thursday, include 70 sworn testimonies from current and former staffers, and concludes that \u201cthe Labour party is no longer a safe space for Jewish people\u201d. \u201cIt is plain that the party does not consider the race and religion of Judaism to be a characteristic worthy of protection,\u201d it says. \u201cThis is a very dangerous place to be.\u201d In the overarching submission from the JLM, there are detailed allegations of antisemitic abuse at party meetings and by members online, including: One respondent who listed 22 examples of antisemitic abuse at party meetings where he was called \u201cchild killer\u201d, \u201cZio scum\u201d, and \u201cTory Jew\u201d as well as being told \u201cHitler was right\u201d and that he was \u201cgood with money\u201d. Another who witnessed a comment at a ward meeting that \u201cthe only reason we have prostitutes in Seven Sisters is because of the Jews\u201d. One member reported that other members defended an individual when they said it was \u201cover-representation of Jews in the capitalist ruling class that gives the Israel-Zionist lobby its power\u201d. A parliamentary candidate who described a councillor being told by a fellow member to go home and count their money after being deselected. A speaker at a fringe event at the 2017 Labour conference asserting the right to discuss whether the Holocaust happened. One respondent reported that the membership secretary in South Tottenham, north London, objected to 25 applications for membership from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, and required home visits to these prospective members\u2019 houses. The submission also alleges political interference in the disciplinary process by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office, despite Labour\u2019s insistence that the leadership has not got involved. In particular, it claims that any separation between the leader\u2019s office and the party\u2019s complaints unit broke down in August 2018 and a staffer was instructed via WhatsApp to upload complaints on to USB sticks for leader\u2019s office employees to examine and make recommendations for future action. The submission says it was a \u201cfrequent occurrence\u201d for leader\u2019s office staff to ask to be copied in on complaints and make recommendations on sanctions. It also claims that a former employee from Corbyn\u2019s office said a narrative had taken hold among staffers that complaints about antisemitism were part of a \u201cJewish conspiracy\u201d against the leadership. A Labour party spokeswoman strongly disputed the allegations. She said: \u201cAny former staff would not know how our procedures currently work, after significant reforms, and former MPs\u2019 staff or others who have not worked on disciplinary procedures would not have knowledge of those procedures or the numbers of cases. \u201cThis document includes baseless assumptions about current staff\u2019s workload and the untrue allegations about outstanding cases. The Labour party is not institutionally antisemitic and complaints relate to a small minority of our members. \u201cWe have significantly reformed our procedures over the past year, including recently adopting a proposal by Jeremy Corbyn for rapid expulsions, which allows individuals to be expelled within a matter of weeks in open and shut cases.\u201d The party stressed that antisemitism was an \u201cevil\u201d that it was committed to rooting out, and said it was fully cooperating with the EHRC. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Thursday, James Libson, a lawyer representing the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) and a partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, said interference in cases had become institutional. \u201cInstitutional in the sense that people affiliated with the leader\u2019s office \u2013 and now in the actual unit that are investigating \u2013 and that at a more basic level, information is passing between the leader\u2019s office and investigating unit,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cPassed by USB sticks, by WhatsApp groups, secret WhatsApp groups.\u201d When asked whether Corbyn\u2019s assertion that every case of antisemitism had been dealt with was incorrect, Libson replied: \u201cVery much so.\u201d He said: \u201cThere are many, many outstanding complaints, many examples of interference and many examples of double standards in the way in which complaints are processed.\u201d Labour denies there is a backlog of antisemitism complaints, but it has not released an updated figure for how many are ongoing. Its case to the EHRC will be that no allegations amount to unlawful acts by the Labour party and there is therefore no basis for the claim that there could be a finding of institutional racism. Speaking at a press conference organised to respond to the leak of the document, Sam Matthews, Labour\u2019s former head of complaints, said there had first been an influx of reports of antisemitism in the party during Corbyn\u2019s second leadership campaign. Referring to the account of Jewish people\u2019s membership applications being questioned in South Tottenham, he said: \u201cRevelations about how Jeremy\u2019s closest aides act are not surprising to me because I witnessed it first-hand for years, but the thing that stuck out to me and made me quite upset is the way in which that culture that we are talking about is empowering people across the country at a local level to think that that is OK inside the Labour party.\u201d He added: \u201cThere will inevitably be a concerted campaign to try and dismiss this as a politically motivated smear against Jeremy or against the current leadership or against a certain type pf politics, and I would implore anybody reading this document to come at it with fresh eyes and to engage with it with their conscience plugged in as they think about how they\u2019re voting next week.\u201d The JLM source said the organisation did not know where the leak had come from and that a wide group of people had seen the document last week after it was submitted. \u201cIt could have come from EHRC, members of JLM or from the lawyers,\u201d they said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know who.\u201d On Tuesday, Corbyn apologised for antisemitic incidents that involved Labour members and said he was dealing with the issue. \u201cObviously I\u2019m very sorry for what has happened,\u201d he said after being asked to apologise directly in an interview on ITV\u2019s This Morning programme. On Thursday, the shadow housing secretary, John Healey, insisted Labour had \u201ctoughened up\u201d its approach to tackling antisemitism. He told Today: \u201cHaving been too slow and too weak at the start, the action being taken now has been toughened up. An in-house lawyer, special appeal panels to deal with complaints, new fast-track expulsion powers that are being used.

But the degree to which people\u2019s votes are guided by party leaders can be overestimated. Manifestos matter, so do age-old affinities. Lived experience can trump it all. In 2017, canvassers in Harrow West said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/18/harrow-west-corbyn-people-are-more-likely-to-raise-fly-tipping\" title=\"\">fly-tipping came up</a> more often than Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>With a week to go before the election, the central issue seems to come down to trust. For the Conservatives it is about whether people trust what they say; for Labour, it is about whether voters trust that it can do what it says. The challenge for the Tories goes all the way to the top. Their leader is a liar. This is not a partisan point. It is a fact. When the issue of trust or truth comes up in televised debates, audiences laugh at Boris Johnson. With good reason. He was fired from the Times for making up quotes, and from his first post as shadow minister for lying about an affair. He lies to the public about the number of police, hospitals and nurses there will be if he wins. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/absolutely-not-true-i-misled-queen-says-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">lied to the Queen</a> about proroguing parliament. Then he lied about proroguing parliament. He lies about his enemies \u2013 claiming Jeremy Corbyn wants to disband the army or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/01/how-accurate-were-boris-johnsons-assertions-on-andrew-marr\" title=\"\">ban MI5</a>. He lies to his allies too, including the Democratic Unionist party on whom the Tories relied for a majority.</p> <p>Those who know him best appear to trust him least. His former employer at the Daily Telegraph, Max Hastings, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\" title=\"\">Johnson \u201cwould not recognise truth,</a> whether about his private or political life, if confronted with it in an identity parade\u201d. When he was foreign secretary, prime minister Theresa May denied him access to top secret intelligence briefings because she did not trust him. In May, he tweeted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/03/boris-johnson-claims-voted-not-election-area\" title=\"\">he had just voted</a>, even though there were no elections where he lives or in the constituency he represents.

Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans - despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents</strong></a><strong>.</strong> He was confronted on the issue by reporters because overnight the Conservative party released a briefing saying that, if it won the election, a budget in February would \u201ccut taxes for hard-working families\u201d. When reporters put it to him that the overall tax burden is set to rise in the first Tory budget, according to CCHQ\u2019s own figures (mostly because a corporation tax cut has been abandoned, and that counts as a tax rise), Johnson claimed not to be aware of this. For example, he told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It would have been reasonable to say there is a difference between personal taxes going down and the overall taxes going up. But he didn\u2019t, and instead he just implied the journalists were wrong. Later, the Conservative party had to issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/05/general-election-johnson-outlines-plan-for-first-100-days-as-campaign-enters-final-week-live?page=with:block-5de9312f8f08bacaf000ac7f#block-5de9312f8f08bacaf000ac7f\">what amounted to a clarification</a> \u2013 always a sign that a media appearance has not gone smoothly.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil.</strong> Asked about this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/05/general-election-johnson-outlines-plan-for-first-100-days-as-campaign-enters-final-week-live?page=with:block-5de92b3a8f08eef22867e0db#block-5de92b3a8f08eef22867e0db\">at his Q&amp;A,</a> he did not say he would refuse to do the interview, but he gave the strong impression that it is never going to happen.

Last month Farage said he would not put up candidates in 317 Tory-won seats because he was worried about a minority Labour government eventually cancelling Brexit, and the rebel \u201cgang of four\u201d argued that backing the Tories everywhere was the logical extension. Farage has rejected this, claiming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/05/general-election-johnson-outlines-plan-for-first-100-days-as-campaign-enters-final-week-live?page=with:block-5de8d3528f08e7796de8d102#block-5de8d3528f08e7796de8d102\">there are seats where the Brexit party is actually helping the Tories by standing</a>.

Ever keen to oblige, here are some more quotes.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Khan criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the London Bridge terror attack, saying it was not the Tories\u2019 finest hour.</strong> There were two possible explanations for the Conservative response, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One is, is just shameless politicking?</p> \n   <p>But two is, Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are going on the offensive because of some of the things they\u2019ve done in last nine years? Let me give you just a couple of examples. One, it was a Conservative government that removed the powers that judges had, for example, when there\u2019s a violent and serious offender, to give them an indeterminate sentence to protect the public. The government did this to reduce prison numbers, to save money. Secondly, it is the case that there is far less rehabilitation in prisons and far less supervision because of massive cuts made by a Conservative government. </p> \n   <p>So, you can understand why a Tory standing to be the prime minister again wants to turn a defensive posture to an offensive one. </p> \n   <p>But just pause and reflect how [the victims\u2019 families] are feeling.

Overall, the cuts and the increases for 2020-21 effectively balance out, but the tax increase total (\u00a33,320m) is bigger than the tax cut total (\u00a33,195m), making a net increase in the tax burden of \u00a35m.</p> \n  <p>This is perfectly defensible. You can argue that the personal tax burden is not the same as the overall tax burden. You could also argue that a tax cut forgone is not the same as a tax rise (although economists will tell you that it is).</p> \n  <p>But Johnson did not do either of these things. Instead, when asked about these figures, he claimed not to know what they were, and refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise. </p> \n  <p>The BBC\u2019s political editor, <strong>Laura Kuenssberg</strong>, first raised this point. She put it to Johnson that he was saying he would cut taxes in February, when overall his manifesto said taxes would go up. Johnson did not accept this. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know what you are talking about ... We\u2019re cutting taxes on business rates, we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country, everybody paying NICs.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When Kuenssberg pushed him on this again, saying that overall taxes would go up, he claimed not to recognise the data. He told her:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Later <strong>Liz Bates</strong> from Channel 4 News made the same point, and asked Johnson why he was not willing to admit that taxes would go up when it said so in black and white in his manifesto. He replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because it\u2019s absolutely not right. We have got a manifesto that commits us to cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the chart from <a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5ddaa257967a3b50273283c4_Conservative%202019%20Costings.pdf\">the Tory manifesto costing document (pdf)</a> showing the party\u2019s proposed tax cuts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52de714eed3eb36bb62af44aee9533cca1121a7d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52de714eed3eb36bb62af44aee9533cca1121a7d/0_0_753_421/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tory manifesto tax cuts\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory manifesto tax cuts</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CCHQ</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And here is the chart from the same documents showing the proposed tax increases.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd507a2d3d0d653ba90ca348700c0ab0c15f639f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd507a2d3d0d653ba90ca348700c0ab0c15f639f/0_0_754_351/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tory tax rises\" width=\"500\" height=\"233\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory tax rises</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CCHQ</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10477306/boris-johnson-gruelling-camping-trail/\">an article with the Sun</a> about his daily routine during the campaign Johnson joked that, when he needed to relax at night, he resorted to \u201ca few quadratic equations\u201d.

With Jeremy Corbyn, it\u2019s for antisemitism. With Jo Swinson, it\u2019s for her record in coalition. And with <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> - well, there is quite a choice, but racist, homophobic or otherwise offensive comments made by him in newspaper columns tend to come at the top of the list. </p> \n  <p>(Note to younger readers: election campaigns didn\u2019t always used to be like this.)</p> \n  <p>Johnson was on ITV\u2019s This Morning a few minutes ago. Two days ago the presenter Phillip Schofield managed to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2019/dec/03/jeremy-corbyn-on-antisemitism-in-labour-obviously-im-very-sorry-video\">an apology out of Corbyn</a>. Today he managed the same with Johnson.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson apologised for describing women wearing burqas as looking like letterboxes. </strong>Unlike many of the other comments in previous newspaper articles for which he is being criticised, Johnson wrote this relatively recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/06/boris-johnsons-burqa-remarks-fan-flames-of-islamophobia-says-mp\">in the summer last year.</a> Asked whether he would say sorry for the offence caused, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have already said sorry for any offence that I\u2019ve caused, and I say it again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson has not always been willing to apologise for these comments. When Fiona Bruce asked him to apologise for these comments in the BBC Question Time leaders\u2019 special two weeks ago,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/22/general-election-2019-corbyn-tells-voters-to-make-sure-their-voice-is-heard-live-news?page=with:block-5dd85c2e8f080fd59fb15acc#block-5dd85c2e8f080fd59fb15acc\"> he refused</a>. But on Friday last week, in a phone-in on LBC, Johnson did issued a generalised apology. Asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I apologise ... Many people who will point out I have said things that have caused offence. Well, I\u2019m deeply sorry for the offence that I caused.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said claims that the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US was as implausible as stories about UFOs. </strong>When it was put to him that there was a dossier showing the NHS had been discussed in talks, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And there are photographs that purport to prove there are UFOs. But it is complete nonsense.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked to give a \u201crock-solid guarantee\u201d that no part of the NHS would be sold off, Johnson said he could, repeating the words \u201crock-solid guarantee\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said he could promise that Brexit would happen on 31 January if he won a majority.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1603a51f580bc05ff3df0993291babb7705f5a38\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1603a51f580bc05ff3df0993291babb7705f5a38/0_145_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson posing for a selfie with the presenters of ITV\u2019s This Morning programme, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson posing for a selfie with the presenters of ITV\u2019s This Morning programme, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T11:37:07.789Z\">at 11.37am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de8de948f08bacaf000a816\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T10:46:51.953Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On ITV\u2019s This Morning <strong>Holly Willoughby</strong> asks about crime and safety.

One of them is <strong>John Longworth</strong>, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce and former Leave Means Leave chairman who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de7cabc8f08c347d7ee972a#block-5de7cabc8f08c347d7ee972a\">yesterday had the whip removed</a> because he had publicly criticised the election strategy being pursued by Nigel Farage, the party leader.</p> \n  <p>In his report, which Brexit party sources are not denying, Wooding says Longworth and his colleagues fear that the Farage strategy could be putting Brexit at risk. He writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Longworth was unavailable for comment last night but an insider said: \u2018We can\u2019t support a party that jeopardises Brexit.</p> \n   <p>\u2018Too many people are concerned about their own egos rather than the cause we have all been campaigning for: to leave the EU.</p> \n   <p>\u2018It has become increasingly clear that unless the Tories win next week, Brexit is doomed. But some of our team are so wrapped up in their own self-interest they can\u2019t see that.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wooding says the split follows weeks of infighting among the Brexit party\u2019s MEPs.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The walkout follows weeks of vicious infighting among the Brexit party group in the European parliament.</p> \n   <p>It was described by one as \u2018a toxic battle between the old Ukippers and the old Tories\u2019.</p> \n   <p>Tempers became even more frayed in October when the party hierarchy decided to oppose Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 within minutes of it being announced.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Brexit party, which was only properly launched this year, won 29 seats in the European election, making it the biggest single party represented in the European parliament. It triumphed because Theresa May\u2019s failure to pass a Brexit deal, and her decision to accept a Brexit extension, made it hard for Brexiters to vote for the Tories. But at this election the Brexit vote has swung back to the Conservatives, a process that has been encourage by Farage effectively endorsing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and refusing to stand candidates in Tory-held seats.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f210a34c617f211bd8dde417600095cc1b4dbcc\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f210a34c617f211bd8dde417600095cc1b4dbcc/0_157_3599_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Longworth, who was a Brexit party MEP until he had the whip removed yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Longworth, who was a Brexit party MEP until he had the whip removed yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T10:44:32.116Z\">at 10.44am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de8cb7f8f08bacaf000a791\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T09:20:42.532Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans - despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents. Andrew Neil has urged Boris Johnson to commit to a BBC interview with him to face questions on why people have \u201cdeemed him to be untrustworthy\u201d. At the end of an interview with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, Neil \u2013 who was Johnson\u2019s former boss at the Spectator \u2013 said: \u201cIt is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say. Johnson has also shunned a sit-down interview with ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham. Four Brexit party MEPs have held a news conference to explain why they are leaving the party and urging people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year - but refused to give a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. In an interview this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was \u201cextremely remote\u201d. Johnson has apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into the issue. Labour\u2019s Jon Ashworth pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel. John McDonnell has disclosed that Labour will not negotiate with smaller parties in the event of a hung parliament next week. The shadow chancellor told The Financial Times: \u201cWe will implement our manifesto...no negotiation, no deal, no coalitions. \u201cWe\u2019ll roll out our programme and let\u2019s see if the Lib Dems vote against the real living wage at 10 an hour, let\u2019s see if the SNP vote against the proposals we brought forward for ending austerity.\u201d Business leaders are calling for a number of commitments from the next government to help firms deal with Brexit. The Institute of Directors said details on international trade must be a priority in the coming months. The group said companies should be given an \u201cadjustment period\u201d before any new relationship with the EU comes into effect. Meanwhile, analysis suggests that none of the main political parties have a properly evidence-based strategy to meet their ambitions on education policy. The Education Policy Institute (EPI), funded by the Nuffield Foundation, carried out an analysis of the manifesto education plans of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and the Brexit Party, assessing how their policies would affect England. Researchers found that although all parties have made bold pledges about reducing opportunity gaps and raising educational attainment, the policies in their manifestos are unlikely to deliver on these aspirations.

More than 100 pro-EU groups have sent a letter to Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson asking her to back Labour in the Prime Minister\u2019s constituency. The letter promises that if the Lib Dems step back in Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in London, the grass roots groups will pile pressure on Labour to pull back in Esher and Walton in Surrey where Lib Dem candidate Monica Harding is up against Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. The 134 groups that have signed the \u201cBoot Out Boris\u201d letter \u201cwant to change the dynamics of the election\u201d. The letter to Swinson says: \u201cWe know we are asking you a lot to help Labour without any reason to think Jeremy Corbyn will return the favour. But if Johnson wins a majority, he\u2019ll drag us out of the EU. So we implore you to look to the national interest. \u201cWe also know you are already only running a paper candidate in Uxbridge. But we want you to go further and support Labour there. \u201cA similar letter is being sent to Corbyn asking Labour to support the Lib Dems in Esher and Walton, where you can bring down Dominic Raab. \u201cBut to be clear, we don\u2019t want you to wait for him to say yes. Time is terribly short, so we want you to take unilateral action.\u201d Boris Johnson has written to Jeremy Corbyn accusing him of a \u201csly\u201d plan to \u201cfiddle\u201d a second Brexit referendum. The prime minister has urged the Labour leader to reconsider his Brexit policy and his plan to give full voting rights to all UK residents with Johnson saying it would give two million EU nationals the vote in another referendum. Johnson said Corbyn\u2019s approach has \u201calready done serious harm to trust\u201d in politics, adding that cancelling the result of the 2016 referendum before it has been implemented would do more damage. Labour has said it will \u201cgive the people the final say\u201d on Brexit, that within three months of coming to power a Labour government would secure a \u201csensible deal\u201d, and within six months they will put that deal to a public vote alongside the option to remain. Cat Smith, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for voter engagement, said: \u201cThe Labour Party believes in democracy. We welcome securing a new and better Brexit deal, and putting it back to the people to have the final say. \u201cIf Boris Johnson had any confidence in his own deal, he would have let it be scrutinised by Parliament, and then put it back before the people for their verdict.\u201d Friday\u2019s Financial Times front page Nationalising UK energy companies would delay the UK\u2019s move towards a zero carbon future, according to the chief executive of Scottish Power. Keith Anderson said investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy fall over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from preventing a climate emergency. A Labour spokesman told the BBC Anderson\u2019s comments are \u201chardly surprising\u201d as they represent \u201cvested interests\u201d. A Labour government would set up a network of advisers based in Post Offices to support small businesses if the party wins the General Election. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the new Business Development Agency would act as a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d offering advice, finance and large-scale government contracts, and is part of a \u201c20-point plan\u201d to support small businesses. Another Labour policy is to set up a Post Office bank, and a network of business advisers would operate out of larger Post Bank branches to give advice and guidance for local businesses on how to access support and finance. Labour is also planning a 250 billion UK national investment bank, and network of regional and national development banks, to give small businesses and the industries of the future the funding they need. The party also wants to give free full-fibre broadband to every business premises, scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with a turnover of under 85,000, and reform business rates. On the Labour proposals to support small businesses, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: \u201cDespite what they claim, Labour are not on the side of small businesses. \u201cTheir plans to raise corporation tax and introduce a four-day week will hit businesses hard. \u201cSMEs don\u2019t need a new quango, they need certainty. All Corbyn\u2019s Labour will bring is higher taxes and uncertainty with no plan for Brexit and the chaos of two more referendums next year. \u201cOnly a majority Conservative government can provide the certainty businesses need, get Brexit done and bring costs down for SMEs by cutting business rates so that they can realise their potential.\u201d Liberal Democrat business spokesman Sam Gyimah said: \u201cSMEs up and down the country have made it abundantly clear that any form of Brexit - be it red or blue - will harm their ability to hire staff, make it more difficult to export to our closest partners and ratchet up the cost of doing business. \u201cSo while Labour wants to claim that it is on the side of small businesses, its support for Brexit means that ultimately these plans ring hollow. The simple fact is that you cannot be both pro-Brexit and pro-business. \u201cIt is only the Liberal Democrats who will stop Brexit and bring forward a bold vision to support small businesses in the UK, including by scrapping the outdated business rates regime.\u201d The Liberal Democrats have pledged funding for disadvantaged pre-school children will be tripled if they triumph in the General Election. The party said funding would be boosted for children aged three and four attending nurseries and other childcare providers. Introduced by the Lib Dems in 2015, the Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP) gives childcare providers up to 302 extra a year for all disadvantaged children aged three and four they look after, the party said, adding that around 99,000 children a year benefitted from the extra funding. The Lib Dems said they would triple the EYPP to 1,000 per child, costing between 65 million and 70 million in 2024/25. It has also pledged to support families on low incomes by investing one billion a year in children\u2019s centres, improving the quality of staff in early years settings by requiring all providers to have a staff training programme, and providing 35 hours of free childcare from the day parents go back to work to the day their child starts school. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said: \u201cThe achievement gap between richer and poorer children can best be closed in the early years. \u201cBut under the Conservatives, it\u2019s widening. We cannot allow disadvantaged children to be left behind before they have even started school. \u201cLiberal Democrats will transform the lives of families with a massive expansion of free, high-quality childcare. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019ll give nurseries more money dedicated to supporting children from the poorest families and children in care. \u201cBy investing in the early years, we can give every child a great start in life.\u201d Friday\u2019s Metro front page focusing on Andrew Neil\u2019s challenge to the prime minister Tomorrow\u2019s Telegraph splash Friday\u2019s Times front page focusing on the Brexit party Labour has complained to the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, accusing the broadcaster of \u201cslanted and biased\u201d election coverage. The party claims to have examples of where Labour\u2019s leadership and policies have faced \u201cmore negative treatment\u201d and \u201charsher scrutiny\u201d by the BBC compared to those of the Conservative Party. Labour\u2019s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne also raised concern about Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to be interviewed by BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\u201d Here is the letter in full from Gwynne: \u201cI am writing to raise the Labour Party\u2019s serious concerns over the BBC\u2019s coverage of the General Election campaign, which we believe has repeatedly shown bias in its reporting of the Labour Party and its leadership, and demonstrated a worrying failure to meet the BBC\u2019s obligations to fairness and impartiality. \u201cThat bias has been reflected in the framing, content and balance of BBC reporting during the campaign. We have recorded numerous examples of more negative treatment, harsher scrutiny and slanted editorial comment about Labour\u2019s leadership, policies and record, as compared with those of the Conservative Party, and submitted them to the BBC. \u201cUp to this point, there has been no substantive response, even though the time to address the evidence of bias is fast running out. \u201cIn terms of balance and fairness, we have particular concerns over the Andrew Neil interviews. \u201cIt now appears that the BBC has accepted the Conservative breach of the debates programmes package, agreed with both parties, and allowed the Conservative leader to choose an alternative interviewer. \u201cDespite our concerns about Andrew Neil\u2019s well-known conservative political leanings, we agreed to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s participation on the clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms: namely, a four-programme debates package, including a Neil interview, designed with legal oversight to ensure fairness, balance and impartiality across the campaign period. \u201cInstead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability. \u201cThis clearly broke the agreement the Labour Party made with the BBC in good faith. \u201cBut despite raising this repeatedly with BBC editorial management, no proposal has been made to redress the imbalance that has been created. \u201cThis imbalance is compounded almost daily by the fact that a significant amount of BBC content, on TV, radio and online, including bulletins, commentary and newspaper reviews, draws on the content and political agenda of the Conservative Party-supporting press. \u201cThe BBC does not have a role as a protagonist in the General Election. \u201cIf the Conservatives are allowed to \u2018play\u2019 or manipulate the BBC, and this behaviour goes unchecked, then the corporation will have effectively been complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage. \u201cI would therefore urge you to ensure that this unfairness is urgently corrected, and that the Labour Party is treated fairly and even-handedly, in relation to the governing Conservative Party in particular, in what is left of this campaign. \u201cI attach our previous letter to your colleague Fran Unsworth, and an updated set of examples of your slanted and biased coverage of the campaign.\u201d Friday\u2019s Guardian front page Addressing a rally of party faithful in Birmingham about Labour\u2019s manifesto pledges, Jeremy Corbyn appeared to mimic a line of questioning he received on Andrew Neil\u2019s BBC show. Speaking to a room of 800-1,000 people, the Labour leader said: \u201cSo when people say to me, \u2018how are you going to pay for all this, Mr Corbyn?\u2019 \u201c\u2019How are you going to pay for it, Mr Corbyn? Come on, answer it, answer it, answer it!\u2019 he added, drawing laughs from the crowd. \u201c\u2019You\u2019ve got no answer for it, have you?\u201d\u2019 He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got our grey book and every single line of our manifesto has been read through, carefully, and fully costed.\u201d Corbyn also insisted there was \u201cno place whatsoever\u201d for anti-Semitism within Labour. He said: \u201cI remember when Enoch Powell was in the West Midlands, I remember the viciousness of that whole period. \u201cI simply say this: in our society, in our moment, there is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or racism. \u201cSo in the last weeks of this election campaign, when everything will be thrown at us by those that are rich and powerful, we\u2019re going to be out there on every street, every town, every city, with our message. \u201cA message of hope, a message of inclusion, a message of a society that is based on the needs of all of us and of social justice for all.\u201d Donald Tusk, the former European Council president, told The Guardian the Brexit campaign is an example of \u201cthe unprecedented readiness to lie\u201d in modern politics. He said Brexit has been \u201cone of the most spectacular mistakes\u201d in the history of the EU and \u201cthe most painful and saddest experience\u201d of his time in office. Labour has complained to the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, accusing the broadcaster of \u201cslanted and biased\u201d election coverage. The party claims to have examples of where Labour\u2019s leadership and policies have faced \u201cmore negative treatment\u201d and \u201charsher scrutiny\u201d by the BBC compared to those of the Conservative Party. Labour\u2019s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne also raised concern about Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to be interviewed by BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. Gwynne said the party agreed to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview with Neil based on the \u201cclear understanding\u201d that Johnson had agreed the same terms. \u201cInstead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability,\u201d Gwynne said in the letter. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\u201d At The Custard Factory, Jeremy Corbyn said he is \u201cinspired\u201d by the ambitions of the children he\u2019s met - but also saddened by the difficulties they and their \u201cstressed-out\u201d teachers have faced as they struggle with a \u201clack of funds\u201d. \u201cNone of this is necessary, none of this is right,\u201d he added. All of this is part of Labour\u2019s promotion of education proposals which include capping class sizes by recruiting 20,000 extra teachers. Nigel Farage has criticised the three MEPs who abandoned his Brexit party today seven days before polling day in an interview with Andrew Neil. Annunziata Rees-Mogg \u2013 sister of the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 Lance Forman and Lucy Harris all resigned the whip to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Ahead of Jeremy Corbyn taking the stage at the Labour rally in Birmingham, the singer Jamelia spoke about how her daughter almost died as a newborn but because of the NHS, she is alive. The television presenter said her daughter is nearly two and \u201call she wants for her birthday is a Labour government\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is due to speak shortly at The Custard Factory in Birmingham. Andrew Neil said the prime minister tells us he has always been an opponent of austerity but we would ask him for evidence of that. In the final part of his monologue, he said: \u201cAnd we would want to know why an opponent of austerity would bake so much of it into their future spending plans. \u201cWe would ask why, as with the proposed increase in police numbers, so many of his promises only take us back to the future, back to where we were before austerity began. \u201cSocial care is an issue of growing concern. On the steps of Downing Street in July he said he\u2019d prepared a plan for social care. We\u2019d ask him why that plan is not in his manifesto. \u201cQuestions of trust. Questions we\u2019d like to put to Mr Johnson so you can hear his replies. But we can\u2019t, because he won\u2019t sit down with us. \u201cThere is no law, no supreme court ruling, that can force Mr Johnson to participate in a BBC leaders\u2019 interview. But the prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China. \u201cSo it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.\u201d More from Andrew Neil on his intervention which came after his interview with Nigel Farage. He said: \u201cCan he be believed when he claims another 34 [hospitals] will be built in the five years after that? \u201cCan he be trusted to fund the NHS properly, when he used a cash figure of an extra \u00a334bn? \u201cAfter inflation, the additional money promised amounts to \u00a320bn. \u201cHe vows that the NHS will not be on the table with any trade talks with America. But he vowed to the DUP, his unionist allies in Northern Ireland, that there would never be a border down the Irish Sea. \u201cThat is as important to the DUP as the NHS is to the rest of us. It is a vow his Brexit deal would seem to break.\u201d Here is the full transcript of Andrew Neil\u2019s challenge to Boris Johnson to commit to an interview with him with just one week before polling day. Talking about his leader interviews, the veteran broadcaster said: \u201cThere is of course still one to be done - Boris Johnson, the prime minister. \u201cWe have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, a time, a venue. As of now, none has been forthcoming. \u201cNo broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed. But leaders\u2019 interviews have been a key part of the BBC\u2019s prime-time election coverage for decades. \u201cWe do them on your behalf to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy.\u201d Neil added: \u201cWe\u2019ve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have. All of them. Until this one. \u201cIt is not too late. We have interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say. \u201cThe theme running through our questions is trust, and why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. \u201cIt is of course relevant to what he is promising us all now. \u201cCan he be trusted to deliver 50,000 more nurses? When almost 20,000 in his numbers are already working for the NHS. \u201cHe promises 40 new hospitals. But only six are scheduled to be built by 2025.\u201d Reaction to Andrew Neil issuing a direct challenge to Boris Johnson to face him one-on-one, and the prime minister yet to agree a date for the BBC interview. Jeremy Corbyn did not directly respond to the question over whether he would resign if Labour does not win next week\u2019s election. It comes after Lord Falconer called for him to resign if Labour are unsuccessful while Len McCluskey, from the Unite union, said Corbyn should remain. Corbyn told ITV: \u201cI am leading the party to win the election, I am utterly determined to win the election.\u201d At a Liberal Democrat campaign rally in Edinburgh, which featured a \u201ctopple Boris\u201d coconut shy, a \u201cSwinzone\u201d selfie area and rather unseasonal free ice cream, Jo Swinson told activists she was glad to be back in Scotland and attacked the government still sitting just down the road at the Holyrood parliament. \u201cThe SNP try to pretend that if you\u2019re against independence, you\u2019re somehow against Scotland. They are wrong,\u201d she told the audience, before taking the SNP government to task for their record on health, education and policing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough week for the SNP headline-wise, with the ongoing infections crisis at Glasgow\u2019s flagship hospital, poor results in the Pisa schools study, and the resignation of the chair of the Scottish Police Authority, Susan Deacon, as she criticised police accountability and governance as \u2018fundamentally flawed\u2019.\u201d To laughter, she added: \u201cBoris Johnson says he is committed to our family of nations. But we all know that he\u2019s never been much of a family man.\u201d Corbyn was asked by ITV what his stance on Brexit was. He responded: \u201cA credible leave option maintains credible trading relations with Europe, the sale and manufacture of goods, a customs agreement that protects the Good Friday agreement. \u201cWe would support either remain or leave with the economic relationship with Europe intact.\u201d The Labour leader added he would not support Scotland having a second referendum on independence. Corbyn has reiterated his apology over the antisemitism allegations that have engulfed his party. He told ITV: \u201cAntisemitism is a vile evil. I have spent my life campaigning against racism. \u201cWhere there has been a delay in processing [cases], I apologise to the people who suffered as a result of it.\u201d On safety and security following the London Bridge attack last week, Jeremy Corbyn told ITV \u201cwhat concerns me is automatic release\u201d for people convicted of serious offences. He added his priority is a \u201cproperly funded prison service and probation service\u201d which is able to intervene. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Tonight programme, Jeremy Corbyn responded to his standing in the opinion polls. He said: \u201cI never comment on opinion polls. \u201cI behave as leader of the party. Yes, I have had a lot of attacks from the media. \u201cI don\u2019t indulge in personal abuse.\u201d Andrew Neil has urged Boris Johnson to commit to a BBC interview with him to face questions on why people have \u201cdeemed him to be untrustworthy\u201d. At the end of an interview with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, Neil \u2013 who was Johnson\u2019s former boss at the Spectator \u2013 said: \u201cIt is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say.\u201d Neil said Johnson was the only party leader who had not agreed to be interviewed, adding: \u201cWe have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, time ... as of now none have been forthcoming. \u201cNo broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed but leaders\u2019 interviews have been a key part of the BBC\u2019s primetime election coverage for decades \u2026 to hold to account, on your behalf, those who would govern us. That is democracy. \u201cWe\u2019ve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate and in every election they have - until this one.\u201d Talks between trade unions and the Department of Health to prevent industrial action have ended without agreement. Health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking part in action over pay and staffing levels. There has been strike action as well as work-to-rule across the week, causing thousands of operations and appointments to be cancelled. Negotiators from four trade unions which represent health workers and nurses held a three-hour meeting with the Department of Health in Belfast on Thursday. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, who met the unions before their talks with the department, welcomed its fresh offer. But speaking on behalf of the unions, Anne Speed from Unison said it was \u201cinsufficient\u201d. \u201cDespite the tweet from the secretary of state earlier this evening in the middle of discussions before the meeting concluded, our position is as follows: The department has presented a new position, trade unions have jointly agreed this remains insufficient and falls short of our members\u2019 requirements and mandate that they have given us,\u201d she said. \u201cIndustrial action continues and joint planned trade union action remains in place for December 18.\u201d Nigel Farage has criticised the MEPs who left the party today to campaign for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Farage said Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister to the Commons leader, Jacob, and one of those to walk out, was \u201cwrong\u201d to suggest the Brexit party could put Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union \u201cat risk\u201d by contesting Labour-held seats. He countered by arguing it was the Tories that were guilty of potentially splitting the leave vote, by contesting constituencies such as Doncaster, Barnsley and Hartlepool where voters were \u201cunlikely\u201d to go blue. Lance Forman and Lucy Harris also left the party while John Longworth lost the whip on Wednesday for criticising the party\u2019s election strategy. One of the big developments of the day has been three MEPs leaving the Brexit party and urging voters to back the Conservatives . One of them, Lucy Harris, said her decision was based on her belief that only Labour and the Tories could win next week\u2019s election. She told the BBC that Labour\u2019s policy to deliver a second EU referendum would mean making a decision between a \u201cbotched-up Brexit deal\u201d and remaining in the EU and that it was therefore \u201ctoo risky\u201d to do anything other than vote for Boris Johnson. Earlier, the Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, pointed to links between the three MEPs and the Conservatives. Boris Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans - despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents. He was confronted on the issue by reporters because overnight the Conservative party released a briefing saying that, if it won the election, a budget in February would \u201ccut taxes for hard-working families\u201d. When reporters put it to him that the overall tax burden is set to rise in the first Tory budget, according to CCHQ\u2019s own figures (mostly because a corporation tax cut has been abandoned, and that counts as a tax rise), Johnson claimed not to be aware of this. For example, he told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. It would have been reasonable to say there is a difference between personal taxes going down and the overall taxes going up. But he didn\u2019t, and instead he just implied the journalists were wrong. Later, the Conservative party had to issue what amounted to a clarification \u2013 always a sign that a media appearance has not gone smoothly. Johnson has refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Asked about this at his Q&amp;A, he did not say he would refuse to do the interview, but he gave the strong impression that it is never going to happen. This evening it has emerged that he definitely won\u2019t be doing a sit-down interview with ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham either. Jeremy Corbyn has given interviews to both Neil and Etchingham \u2013 although both generated multiple negative headlines, which of course explains why Johnson is evading this level of scrutiny. Four Brexit party MEPs have held a news conference to explain why they are leaving the party and urging people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. They worry that by continuing to stand in Tory target seats, Nigel Farage\u2019s party could be helping Labour. Last month Farage said he would not put up candidates in 317 Tory-won seats because he was worried about a minority Labour government eventually cancelling Brexit, and the rebel \u201cgang of four\u201d argued that backing the Tories everywhere was the logical extension. Farage has rejected this, claiming there are seats where the Brexit party is actually helping the Tories by standing. Students of Farage\u2019s career will recall that the last party he led, Ukip, also ended up riven by splits. Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year - but refused to give a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. In an interview this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was \u201cextremely remote\u201d. Johnson has apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into the issue. Labour\u2019s Jon Ashworth has pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel. That\u2019s all from me this evening. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is in charge of the blog now. There is a Jeremy Corbyn rally at 7pm. The Andrew Neil interview with Nigel Farage is going out at 7pm too. And Julie Etchingham\u2019s interview with Jeremy Corbyn is being broadcast at 7.30pm. My colleague Hilary Osborne has written a Factcheck piece on who is responsible for the increase in homelessness, following comments made by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. On Boris Johnson not appearing on the Tonight programme, a spokesman for ITV said: \u201cThe ITV News team making the Boris Johnson Tonight film made the original bid for the prime minister when the election was called. \u201cThey have contacted his press team on repeated occasions with times and dates offered to film an interview. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s team have today confirmed he will not be taking part. \u201cThe programme will instead feature a profile of the prime minister using fresh interviews with other contributors and archive footage.\u201d My colleague Jim Waterson\u2019s reaction to the news that Boris Johnson will not be following suit and taking part in an interview with ITV News. ITV said: \u201cEvery other leader of Great Britain\u2019s main political parties that has been approached has done an interview for Tonight.\u201d The prime minister has faced mounting criticism of his refusal to be interviewed by Andrew Neil on the BBC. Nicola Sturgeon has said she believes tactical voting could be key to stopping Boris Johnson getting a majority and that \u201cpeople are thinking very carefully\u201d about how to vote. Scotland\u2019s first minister said she felt there may be more tactical voting at this general election than ever before as she urged voters to oust Conservative MPs in Scotland by voting for the Scottish National party. She said: \u201cThe way to escape that mess and to focus on building a better Scotland is to make sure that the Tories and Boris Johnson don\u2019t get that majority they\u2019re looking for. \u201cIn this election people are thinking very carefully, I think there will be potentially more tactical voting than we\u2019ve seen in previous general elections, and in Scotland if you want to vote tactically to stop the Tories, then the way to do that is to vote SNP - we\u2019re the challenger in all the Tory-held seats.\u201d More on the controversy over Boris Johnson taking a selfie with This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby using a Huawei smartphone, despite security concerns around the Chinese company. Schofield has waded in on Twitter in response to criticism. Responding to fans who asked whether he had challenged Johnson over comments which some claim are Islamophobic, the host replied: \u201cYES!!\u201d Ofcom said it had received 31 complaints about the interview as of this afternoon. Earlier in the comments bagillt was asking for some more detail of what Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said in his LBC phone-in this morning. Ever keen to oblige, here are some more quotes. Khan criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the London Bridge terror attack, saying it was not the Tories\u2019 finest hour. There were two possible explanations for the Conservative response, he said: One is, is just shameless politicking? But two is, Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are going on the offensive because of some of the things they\u2019ve done in last nine years? Let me give you just a couple of examples. One, it was a Conservative government that removed the powers that judges had, for example, when there\u2019s a violent and serious offender, to give them an indeterminate sentence to protect the public. The government did this to reduce prison numbers, to save money. Secondly, it is the case that there is far less rehabilitation in prisons and far less supervision because of massive cuts made by a Conservative government. So, you can understand why a Tory standing to be the prime minister again wants to turn a defensive posture to an offensive one. But just pause and reflect how [the victims\u2019 families] are feeling. Just pause and reflect how the three people so seriously injured last week are feeling, to see people in positions of power and influence trying to seek political advantage out of this. On reflection, Boris Johnson and his team will think it wasn\u2019t their finest hour. He said Labour should have the \u201chumility\u201d to accept that Jewish people felt there was a genuine problem with antisemitism in the party. He said: I\u2019m meeting friends who are Jewish Londoners on a daily basis who feel we are a racist party and we\u2019ve got to accept that. We can\u2019t project an anti-Jeremy Corbyn or an anti-London animus towards somebody who feels we\u2019re antisemitic. They feel we\u2019re antisemitic and I accept that and I think we\u2019ve got to have the humility to realise that a small community in London \u2013 and the Jewish community is relatively small \u2013 feels really upset, feels really scared and feels really anxious. I think it\u2019s really important that we address that. He said Jeremy Corbyn had campaigned against racism all his life and had never been racist in the way Boris Johnson had. He said: I can point to things on the record that Boris Johnson has said about people of colour and people with different faiths: on the record, overtly, proudly, being paid for it. [Can] you point to examples where Jeremy Corbyn has said things on the record, in articles, in speeches, for a cheap joke, about people of colour or people of different faiths? The Conservatives received donations of more than \u00a33m in the third week of the general election campaign - far outstripping the other parties, PA Media reports. The Electoral Commission said the Tories reported donations of more than \u00a37,500 totalling \u00a33.59m in the week from 20-26 November. In contrast, Labour received \u00a3521,909, the Liberal Democrats \u00a3509,998 and the Brexit party received no donations over 7,500 at all. The Green party reported donations of \u00a3100,000, and the Alliance party of Northern Ireland \u00a315,000. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has criticised Boris Johnson for \u201cevading scrutiny\u201d in the general election campaign. At an event in South Queensferry she said: Boris Johnson has ducked and dived, evading scrutiny throughout this whole campaign and no wonder because everybody knows that if he gets his way he drags Scotland out of the EU against our will, out of the single market and the customs union, plunging us into the next round of Brexit chaos that could cost every person in our country \u00a31,600 and a process that could end with a no-deal Brexit later next year. She has also unveiled the Scottish National party battlebus. Given that \u201cStop Brexit\u201d is also a Lib Dem slogan, this is probably the design the Lib Dems should have chosen for their battlebus. (Instead the Lib Dems opted for an enormous picture of Jo Swinson, which was probably a mistake because she has turned out to be less of an asset than the party expected.) The Conservative party has put out a statement clarifying its position on taxes - ie, saying what Boris Johnson would have said in his Q&amp;A earlier if he had been more honest about the party\u2019s plans. (See 3.57pm.) A spokesman said: Our manifesto does not propose increasing taxes on UK resident companies and would not put up personal taxes for hard-working Brits. We have been very clear that we are pausing future corporation tax cuts, and will invest this money into our NHS. We will also introduce a surcharge on those buying UK property from abroad, increase the immigration health surcharge so everyone contributes to our NHS and put up taxes on plastic bags to help our environment. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A in Matlock. Johnson refused to accept that the Conservative party\u2019s own costings show the overall tax burden will increase under their plans. (See 3.57pm.) He rejected claims that his pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 January was misleading because 2020 would be consumed by Brexit negotiations with the EU. This point was put to Johnson twice, but he refused to accept it. He said the situation would be different after January because the \u201cparliamentary wrangling and bitterness and feuding\u201d would be over. For a good explanation of why Johnson may be wrong, and why 2020 could end up being dominated again by news about a possible no-deal Brexit, do read this Twitter thread from the Economist\u2019s John Peet. It starts here. Johnson insisted he would get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year, but refused to say he was giving a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. Asked if he would \u201cabsolutely promise\u201d to get a trade deal with the EU by the end of the transition period, Johnson said he thought he could. We already have a deal. And we can come out on January 31 in a state of perfect equilibrium and grace with the rest of the EU because we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota position now, and I\u2019ve absolutely no doubt at all that we\u2019ll be able to make sure that the EU protects its own interests and has a deal with us that ensures that continues for the future. If you say, \u2018can I absolutely guarantee that we\u2019ll get a deal\u2019, I think I can and I\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 look at what we achieved ... in three months with the new deal that I did. We did it and it\u2019s a great deal and it will take this country forward and I\u2019m very proud of it. But when he was asked if that was a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d, Johnson said: \u201cThe possibility you allude to simply will not happen.\u201d Johnson refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil for the BBC. Asked about this, he said: I\u2019m the first prime minister to have done two, or about to do two one-on-one leadership debates, several hours\u2019 worth of phone-ins, endless press conferences and interviews with all sorts of BBC people called Andrew. And I will continue to submit to the interrogation of the media. He also said that his communications director, Lee Cain, was the person to speak to for details of his media appearances, but the tone of his answer implied that he did not want, or expect, to do the Neil interview. Johnson defended plans in the Conservative manifesto to pass a law restricting strikes on public transport. He said: I do think it\u2019s absurd that critical transport mass-transit systems should be capable of being put out of actions by strikes, and other countries around the world have minimum service requirements for public transport - and that\u2019s what I want to see. He said people would be \u201coutraged\u201d if Labour were to allow EU nationals to vote in a second Brexit referendum. He said: I think the whole proposal from the Labour party is bizarre. I think people will be outraged by the whole thing and ... to think that it is going to be rigged in some way by getting in millions more voters who\u2019d be very likely to vote one way rather than another, I think that would cause a great deal of public disquiet and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way forward. Earlier I posted some Press Association copy about Boris Johnson taking a selfie with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby after his appearance on ITV\u2019s This Morning. (See 1.56pm.) The Press Association has subsequently filed this addition. A Conservative spokesman subsequently denied the phone was the prime minister\u2019s. But on the show Willoughby said Johnson reappeared after his interview and \u201che whipped his phone out and he took a selfie\u201d to which Schofield replied: \u201cBut he didn\u2019t know he had to press the button \u2026\u201d The most awkward questions for Boris Johnson today came on the subject of tax. Overnight, the Conservatives briefed out a story about how they would hold a budget in February \u201cwhich will cut taxes for hard-working families\u201d and this morning the Daily Telegraph and the Times both splashed on stories about the Tories offering tax cuts. But the Tories have already published details of their tax plans, and they show that, although personal taxes would go down in their first budget, the overall tax burden would rise because they have cancelled a planned cut in corporation tax. (In budget terms, that counts as a tax rise.) Overall, the cuts and the increases for 2020-21 effectively balance out, but the tax increase total (\u00a33,320m) is bigger than the tax cut total (\u00a33,195m), making a net increase in the tax burden of \u00a35m. This is perfectly defensible. You can argue that the personal tax burden is not the same as the overall tax burden. You could also argue that a tax cut forgone is not the same as a tax rise (although economists will tell you that it is). But Johnson did not do either of these things. Instead, when asked about these figures, he claimed not to know what they were, and refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise. The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, first raised this point. She put it to Johnson that he was saying he would cut taxes in February, when overall his manifesto said taxes would go up. Johnson did not accept this. He said: I don\u2019t know what you are talking about ... We\u2019re cutting taxes on business rates, we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country, everybody paying NICs. When Kuenssberg pushed him on this again, saying that overall taxes would go up, he claimed not to recognise the data. He told her: We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. Later Liz Bates from Channel 4 News made the same point, and asked Johnson why he was not willing to admit that taxes would go up when it said so in black and white in his manifesto. He replied: Because it\u2019s absolutely not right. We have got a manifesto that commits us to cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country. Here is the chart from the Tory manifesto costing document (pdf) showing the party\u2019s proposed tax cuts. And here is the chart from the same documents showing the proposed tax increases. In an article with the Sun about his daily routine during the campaign Johnson joked that, when he needed to relax at night, he resorted to \u201ca few quadratic equations\u201d. But you don\u2019t need to be able to do quadratic equations to know that \u00a33,320m is more than \u00a33,195m. Q: What will you say to a voter next year who says, \u2018You said Brexit would be over, but I keep hearing about it on the news.\u2019 Johnson says he does not accept that will happen. Q: Why won\u2019t you admit that taxes will go up under your plans? Johnson says his priority in his first budget will be cutting taxes, not raising them. That\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: If there were a second referendum next year, would it be right to give EU nationals the vote? Johnson says the Labour plan is bizarre. He says Jeremy Corbyn cannot find anyone in his shadow cabinet who would vote for the deal he will negotiate. And he says that trying to rig the referendum would be wrong. Q: Will you do an interview with Andrew Neil? Johnson says he would be \u201cvery happy do interviews with all manner of people\u201d. He says he has submitted himself to lots of interviews. He says he is the first PM to do two one-on-one debates. As for questions about the Neil interview, he says the questioner should ask his communications director, Lee Cain. Johnson refuses to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Q: We have not heard anything from Jacob Rees-Mogg during the campaign. Will he be in your cabinet? Johnson says questions like that come under the category of measuring up the curtains. He wants to focus on winning the election. Q: Do you want to ban strikes on public transport and the tube? Johnson says it is absurd that critical, mass transport systems can be put out of action by strikes. He wants to have minimum standards for them. That happens in other countries, he says. He says that idea is in the Tory manifesto. Q: Did the previous Tory governments cut too much? Johnson says he was running London at the time. He says the Tory government had a mess to sort out. He wants to invest. Q: So did it cut too much? Johnson says that is idle speculation. He says Labour would start with an economic crisis, not end with one. Q: Can you give a cast-iron guarantee that you will negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year? Johnson says the prospect of not having a deal won\u2019t arise, but he refuses to give a cast-iron guarantee. Q: You say today that you will present a budget in February that will cut tax. But overall your plans will raise tax. And you say you will get Brexit done. But the talks will still go on. How can people trust what you say? Johnson says he does not understand the first point. He is going to cut taxes, he says. And he says taking the UK out of the EU on 31 January will end the parliamentary wrangling. When pressed on the point about taxes, Johnson says he does not know what Laura Kuenssberg, who asked the question, was referring to. Johnson obviously missed these tweets from the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, Chris Giles. Johnson gets presented with a scarf saying get Brexit done. Q: Can you guarantee that the NHS will not be vulnerable to other countries or outside bodies? Yes, says Johnson. He says his charge often comes up. But the NHS is a fantastic thing. He says he is building 40 new hospitals. They will be there in 10 years\u2019 time, as a result of the decisions he is taking. And he wants to have 50,000 more GP appointments. A healthier population will make for a happier, richer country, he says. Johnson is now taking questions, from workers first. He says he will take media questions later. A woman says she sent Johnson an email some time ago. She lives at the top of Matlock, where people want to build 400 homes on a flood plain. There have been floods there, she says. Why is this going ahead? Johnson says he has met a huge amount of people who suffered during the recent floods. \u201cWe have got to stop building on flood plains,\u201d she says. The government is investing in brownfield sites, he says. He says he will pass this on to Sarah Dines, the Tory candidate for Derbyshire Dales, so she can take this up with the planners. Q: When Brexit is over, are you going to pull the country back together? Yes, says Johnson. He says the wrangling in the country has got worse. But in the Conservative party people are coming together. If Brexit is delivered, people will come together, he says. He now tells an anecdote from his visit to the Red Bull Racing centre yesterday. He says he was told they had managed to reduce the engine size from 2.6 litres to something smaller. But the engines were more powerful. That leads him on to claiming that this parliament has been holding Britain back like a punctured tyre. Johnson is now doing his familiar riff about how remarkable exports are. But there is a new, or newish, joke. Britain is the only country to export music to the United States, he says. That\u2019s why they call it One Direction, he says. Boris Johnson says he is at the John Smedley factory. He says he has some John Smedley garments himself. He starts by explaining why he is having an election. Parliament is \u201cbroken down, jacknifed\u201d, he says. It is the standard stump speech ... Boris Johnson is holding a campaign event in Derbyshire. He is at a factory where he is due to take questions from workers. The former chancellor George Osborne and his former opposite number Ed Balls will reunite for ITV\u2019s election night coverage, the Press Association reports. Since leaving frontline politics Osborne is, among other things, now the editor of the London Evening Standard, while Balls transformed his public image as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016. ITV has confirmed that the pair will join the former Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson, as well as the former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson. Andrew Neil has already recorded his interview with Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader. It will be shown on BBC One tonight. In a clip released in advance, Farage said the three MEPs who announced they were quitting today were all linked to the Tories. He said: One of them is a sister of a cabinet minister, another one has a boyfriend working for that cabinet minister \u2013 fact, and another one is a personal friend of Boris Johnson\u2019s. Farage was referring to Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lucy Harris and Lance Forman respectively. Farage also claimed that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was unacceptable. He said: And I\u2019ll tell you something, Boris Johnson\u2019s deal unamended is unacceptable and I certainly stand by that. That is not what Farage implied when he announced last month that he would not be standing candidates in Tory-held seats. In its submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party (see 7.35am and 9.20am) the Jewish Labour Movement claims Jeremy Corbyn has made the party \u201ca welcoming refuge for antisemites\u201d. Corbyn was asked about this claim on a campaign visit to Peterborough earlier. He rejected it firmly. Asked about the allegation, he replied: I completely reject that. When I became leader of the party there were no processes in place to deal with antisemitism. We introduced an appeals procedure to deal with it and we introduced an education process, so that party members understood the hurt that can be caused by antisemitic remarks or antisemitic behaviour. I think we\u2019ve got processes in place that have improved it a great deal. I\u2019ve posted it already, but I will post it again because it is the most arresting picture of the day, and you could write an entire treatise about celebrity culture, daytime TV and the impartiality of the media on the basis of its implications: Boris Johnson posing for a selfie with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby after his appearance on their programme, ITV\u2019s This Morning. But there is another issue thrown up by the picture too; Johnson is using a Huawei phone. This is from the Press Association. Boris Johnson has appeared on television using a Huawei smartphone, despite ongoing security concerns around the Chinese company. Following an interview on ITV\u2019s This Morning, the prime minister used what appeared to be a Huawei P20 \u2013 understood to be his own \u2013 to take a selfie with presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. Willoughby said Johnson reappeared after his interview on the programme and \u201che whipped his phone out\u201d in order to take the picture. The incident comes in the midst of a heated debate around the company and allegations of its close links to the Chinese state - critics have argued that Huawei\u2019s telecoms equipment could be used to spy on people in the west - something the company has always denied. It insists it abides by the laws of each country in which it operates. The US, which has placed trade restrictions on the firm, has previously suggested that future co-operation with other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partnership \u2013 the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 could be jeopardised if the Chinese company was given a role in the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. On Wednesday, Johnson said he would not compromise Britain\u2019s national security over whether to give the telecoms firm a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network. The Conservative party refused to comment on the incident. Boris Johnson is due to hold a campaign event shortly. But, as the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports, there\u2019s been a problem. The academic Simon Usherwood has an interesting Twitter thread on the Brexit party resignations. It starts here. And here are some of his posts. Q: What would you say to Nigel Farage if he were here? Forman says he would invite Farage to join them, and to stand down his candidates. Q: In all but about 20 seats? Forman suggests it would be better to stand down everywhere. Sometimes you have to swallow your pride, he says. He says Farage could be seen as a great statesman if he were to do that. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Do you feel Brexit party supporters are now lions led by donkeys? Longworth says he hates personal attacks. For him, this is all about Brexit. He says it is wrong that the Brexit party is now putting the party ahead of Brexit. Q: Do you think Nigel Farage\u2019s tactical decisions have jeopardised Brexit? Rees-Mogg says all four MEPs on the panel have raised concerns about Farage\u2019s strategy. She thinks he wants an independent UK. But she thinks he is going about it the wrong way, and risking the election of a remainer government. Q: The Brexit party response to your move has been vicious. (See 10.06am.) Have they always had their suspicions about the four of you? Longworth says he does not think so. He says the problem only started when Nigel Farage decided the party would oppose Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. It would have been better to work with Johnson on improving it, he says. He says he does not think a formal alliance with the Tories would have worked. But at this point he says he thinks, if you support Brexit, backing the Tories is the only option. Q: Will you stand down as MEPs? And will you work together as a group? Harris says they won\u2019t stand down. She says they want to be in the European parliament to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. The Brexit party will vote against it, she says. Q: [To Longworth] Did the Brexit party strip you of the whip yesterday because they knew you were going to do this? Longworth says he does not know. He says the Brexit party refused to tell him directly why the whip was being withdrawn. But he says he was in Brussels yesterday for an internal committee vote. He said he was not allowed to tell the Brexit party about what happened, and he thinks that may have been why he was disciplined. Q: You said you have not discussed this with the Tories. But have the Tories discussed this with you in the past? Longworth says he has never had any approach from the Conservative party. He says Nigel Farage keeps alleging this, but it is not true. Annunziata Rees-Mogg says she has had no offers from the Conservative party at all. She says she gets annoyed when people suggest she is acting on behalf of her brother. She isn\u2019t. I have had no approaches from the Conservative party in any description and I am, frankly, finding it really quite disturbingly old-fashioned that people are suggesting that my brother gets to tell me what to do with my political views \u2013 he doesn\u2019t. We have completely independent views from each other and I am only concerned about Brexit. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone about it - they wouldn\u2019t be able to bribe me. This is purely, purely about Brexit. Harris and Lance Forman both say they have never had offers from the Tories either. The panel are now taking questions. Q: Have any of you been offered jobs or honours by the Tories? John Longworth says they have not even discussed this move with the Tories. Q: Are you planning to join the Conservatives? Lucy Harris says this is what they are saying for the moment. But, if invited to campaign for a Conservative candidate, she would. Annunziata Rees-Mogg MEP is speaking now. (This is one Rees-Mogg that CCHQ will be happy to see on the news. Her brother, Jacob, the leader of the Commons, has been invisible during the campaign since he suggested that the Grenfell Tower residents lacked the common sense to ignore the advice to stay put.) Rees-Mogg says she joined the Brexit party earlier this year, when it looked as if Theresa May was going to deny the country a proper Brexit. But the party\u2019s success ensured a Brexiter became Tory leader. When Boris Johnson unveiled his Brexit plan, the Brexit party immediately decided it was unacceptable. Rees-Mogg says that was a mistake. And she says the fact that the party is standing now in Tory target seats means it could split the Brexit vote, and let in Labour candidates. The Brexit party are now \u201cthe very party risking Brexit\u201d, she claims. John Longworth MEP is speaking at the press conference now. He says he was always a Eurosceptic. He recalls sitting on a government taskforce on deregulation when Margaret Thatcher was PM, and realising how resistant some government departments were to deregulation. He says he publicly came out in favour of Brexit during the referendum campaign. At the time he was the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. He says he was infuriated by the scaremongering coming from the remain campaign about the consequences of Brexit. He says he joined the Brexit party to ensure Brexit happened. He says if the Brexit party had not been formed, and won seats in the European elections, Theresa May and Philip Hammond would have pushed through a watered-down version of Brexit. He says, since then, the Brexit party has morphed into something else. It has non-Brexit goals. But Longworth says he is only interested in Brexit. He says Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has \u201cthe potential to be a great deal\u201d. I would say it equates to being a little bit better than the Norway deal - but it has the potential to be a great deal. It is also \u201cthe only game in town\u201d, he says. All the alternatives would lead to article 50 being revoked. That is why he thinks people should vote Conservative in the election, even if they have to \u201chold their nose\u201d. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, was on LBC this morning. As LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood reports, Khan said that Boris Johnson\u2019s record on racism was far worse than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s on antisemitism - not least because Johnson has been paid for what he had said in his journalism. Lance Forman, the London MEP, is speaking at the press conference. He says, if it is acceptable for the Brexit party to stand down in 317 Tory-held seats, it makes sense for the Brexit party to back the Conservative party everywhere. He says his decision is not prompted by opposition to Nigel Farage. He pays tribute to Farage, saying he has achieved a huge amount. He also says he is worried about antisemitism in the Labour party. The four Brexit party MEPs who have left to back the Conservatives are now holding a press conference in Westminster. There is a live feed here. And this is from the Brexit party MEP Michael Heaver. These are from the Brexit party MEP Alexandra Phillips on the four defectors. Here is the video message from the Brexit party\u2019s \u201cgang of four\u201d explaining why they are now backing the Conservatives. This is from Lucy Harris, one of the four Brexit party MEPs who has left the party to support the Conservatives. One measure of the dismal state of our politics is the way political interviewing at this election seems to consist mostly of demanding apologies. With Jeremy Corbyn, it\u2019s for antisemitism. With Jo Swinson, it\u2019s for her record in coalition. And with Boris Johnson - well, there is quite a choice, but racist, homophobic or otherwise offensive comments made by him in newspaper columns tend to come at the top of the list. (Note to younger readers: election campaigns didn\u2019t always used to be like this.) Johnson was on ITV\u2019s This Morning a few minutes ago. Two days ago the presenter Phillip Schofield managed to get an apology out of Corbyn. Today he managed the same with Johnson. Here are the main points. Johnson apologised for describing women wearing burqas as looking like letterboxes. Unlike many of the other comments in previous newspaper articles for which he is being criticised, Johnson wrote this relatively recently, in the summer last year. Asked whether he would say sorry for the offence caused, he replied: I have already said sorry for any offence that I\u2019ve caused, and I say it again. Johnson has not always been willing to apologise for these comments. When Fiona Bruce asked him to apologise for these comments in the BBC Question Time leaders\u2019 special two weeks ago, he refused. But on Friday last week, in a phone-in on LBC, Johnson did issued a generalised apology. Asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, he said: I apologise ... Many people who will point out I have said things that have caused offence. Well, I\u2019m deeply sorry for the offence that I caused. Johnson said claims that the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US was as implausible as stories about UFOs. When it was put to him that there was a dossier showing the NHS had been discussed in talks, he replied: And there are photographs that purport to prove there are UFOs. But it is complete nonsense. Asked to give a \u201crock-solid guarantee\u201d that no part of the NHS would be sold off, Johnson said he could, repeating the words \u201crock-solid guarantee\u201d. Johnson said he could promise that Brexit would happen on 31 January if he won a majority. On ITV\u2019s This Morning Holly Willoughby asks about crime and safety. A lot of people feel unsafe, she says. Boris Johnson says he massively reduced crime when he was mayor of London. He says that Usman Khan, the London Bridge attacker, had to be released. It is always worth trying to rehabilitate people, he says. But there are some people incapable of changing, and Khan was probably one of them, he says. Q: Does it help for a PM to use terms like bank robber and letterbox to describe women who wear the burqa? Johnson says he has already said sorry for any offence caused, and he says it again. Johnson apologises for any offence caused by his article comparing women wearing burqas to letterboxes. He says it is worth looking at what the article using those words said. He is proud of his Muslim ancestry, he says. He says he will have an inquiry into prejudice and xenophobia of all kinds. Q: You also branded single mothers as irresponsible, and working-class men as feckless, in an article in 1995? Johnson says this is not the time to talk about any offence given by an article written a long time ago. Boris Johnson is giving an interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. He says he loves the NHS. He can give an absolute guarantee that no part of the NHS will be sold off, he says. Phillip Schofield puts it to him that companies part-owned by Americans already play a big role in providing NHS services. Johnson says this was a process that happened under Labour, when contracts were outsourced. According to the Press Association, the other two Brexit MEPs who are resigning are Lance Forman and Lucy Harris. Forman is an MEP for London and runs a smoked salmon business. And Harris is an MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, and an opera singer. And Press Association also quotes the MEP Annunziata Rees-Mogg explaining her decision to leave the Brexit party. She said: We need a strong leave-supporting government to deliver the Brexit 17.4m voted for. The Conservatives are the only option for Brexit supporters and democrats alike. The defection of four Brexit party MEPs (see 9.47am) still has not been formally announced, but the Brexit party itself has issued a response. It says three of its MEPs are resigning the whip. It says John Longworth already had the whip removed yesterday. In a statement Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said: Whilst we are disappointed that four of our MEPs don\u2019t seem to understand that we both saved the Conservative party from large-scale losses to the Liberal Democrats in the south and south-west of England but we are also hammering the Labour leave vote in its traditional heartlands, making it much easier for the Conservatives to win many of those seats. The only vote on the leave side that is currently being split is in areas such as Barnsley, the South Wales Valleys, Doncaster and Hartlepool, where there is a risk that the Tories will split our vote. As proof of his claim that the Brexit party will make it easier for the Tories to win Labour seats in leave-voting areas, Farage cited the Survation poll for the Economist two weeks ago, which shows the Tories on course to win the previously safe Labour seat of Great Grimsby ostensibly because the Labour vote has collapsed by 18 points, which is almost exactly what the Brexit party is polling in the constituency. In the statement, a Brexit party spokesman added: We also note that one of the MEPs is the sister of a cabinet minister, another has a partner who works in the office of the same cabinet minister and yet another is a personal friend of both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. In the case of John Longworth, who was for years the firmest advocate of WTO withdrawal that we have ever met, he underwent a metamorphosis into being a supporter of the new EU treaty following two days of meetings in London. We hope that Mr Longworth is well rewarded for his actions. That means Annunziata Rees-Mogg is expected to defect; her brother Jacob is the leader of the Commons. According to a report by David Wooding for the Sun, four Brexit party MEPs will today announce that they are quitting their party and urging people to vote Conservative instead. One of them is John Longworth, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce and former Leave Means Leave chairman who yesterday had the whip removed because he had publicly criticised the election strategy being pursued by Nigel Farage, the party leader. In his report, which Brexit party sources are not denying, Wooding says Longworth and his colleagues fear that the Farage strategy could be putting Brexit at risk. He writes: Mr Longworth was unavailable for comment last night but an insider said: \u2018We can\u2019t support a party that jeopardises Brexit. \u2018Too many people are concerned about their own egos rather than the cause we have all been campaigning for: to leave the EU. \u2018It has become increasingly clear that unless the Tories win next week, Brexit is doomed. But some of our team are so wrapped up in their own self-interest they can\u2019t see that.\u2019 Wooding says the split follows weeks of infighting among the Brexit party\u2019s MEPs. The walkout follows weeks of vicious infighting among the Brexit party group in the European parliament. It was described by one as \u2018a toxic battle between the old Ukippers and the old Tories\u2019. Tempers became even more frayed in October when the party hierarchy decided to oppose Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 within minutes of it being announced. The Brexit party, which was only properly launched this year, won 29 seats in the European election, making it the biggest single party represented in the European parliament. It triumphed because Theresa May\u2019s failure to pass a Brexit deal, and her decision to accept a Brexit extension, made it hard for Brexiters to vote for the Tories. But at this election the Brexit vote has swung back to the Conservatives, a process that has been encourage by Farage effectively endorsing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and refusing to stand candidates in Tory-held seats. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Here is a link to the Jewish Labour Movement submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party mentioned earlier. (See 7.35am.) A member of the Scottish National party\u2019s conduct committee, who was due to rule on antisemitism allegations against its former candidate in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, has herself resigned from the party after being challenged over alleged antisemitism. Denise Findlay, an SNP activist who tweets as @GraceBrodie, said she had resigned yesterday after SNP officials confronted her over her stance on Israel, shortly before a Channel 4 News report on her tweets. In a tweet saying she had resigned, she said: \u201cThere are tweets where I\u2019m arguing that Israel=Nazi should not be part of the definition of anti-semitism.\u201d That tweet no longer appears in her timeline but she later confirmed on Twitter that was the topic. Findlay was a prominent supporter of Neale Hanvey, a former leader of the SNP group on Fife council who was sacked as the party\u2019s candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath late last month after two allegedly antisemitic posts came to light. Hanvey\u2019s membership was also suspended; Findlay had been elected to join the conduct committee which would rule on his membership in October. Hanvey is still contesting the seat, running as an independent, with many local members ignoring Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s demand that they campaign for the SNP in other seats. Findlay has been backing his decision to continue campaigning, and donated to his election crowdfunding appeal. The controversy, which has divided the party in Fife, increases the chances of Labour retaining the seat. It is being defended by Lesley Laird, a Corbyn ally who is Labour\u2019s shadow Scottish secretary. Labour is averaging 18% in the polls in Scotland and, until this split, Hanvey was widely tipped to win the seat. In a statement on Wednesday night, the SNP said: There is no place for antisemitism in Scotland or in the SNP. All political parties have a duty to show leadership, and we will always take tough action in order to reassure the Jewish community that these matters are taken seriously. When challenged on her actions, Denise Findlay resigned from the SNP. The views she expressed are entirely at odds with the ethos of this party. Findlay apologised in a statement to the Courier newspaper in Dundee: When I tweeted about Israel and compared them to Nazis, I did not know that was antisemitic. I am profusely sorry and I now fully understand that what I said was hurtful to the Jewish community. I still believe you should be able to criticise the Israeli government for their actions in Palestine. I am not a politician and was not aware of the IHRA definition. I do know now and realise I made a mistake. I am really sorry. Here\u2019s some reaction to Javid\u2019s remarks on the prospects of a free trade deal by the end of next year. The chancellor has also refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. Javid was repeatedly asked on the Today programme whether there was a chance of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at the end of 2020. He said the chances of the that were \u201cextremely remote\u201d but dodged several opportunities to rule it out. He claimed that outline of a free trade agreement had already been worked out. He said: By the end of 2020, we will have agreed and finalised the trade deal, a very ambitious, deep, comprehensive free trade agreement. And we will get that done also by the end of 2020. In the time that we\u2019ve been negotiating over the last 100 days or so, it wasn\u2019t just the exit agreement ... we are also negotiated and worked and agreed the outline of the ambitious free trade agreement. There is no a single doubt in my mind that it can be agreed within months, and we can get it through parliament by 2020. Asked what tariffs the car industry would pay under such a deal, Javid said: Because it\u2019s a deep, comprehensive free trade agreement, it\u2019s zero tariffs, zero quotas, not just for the car industry, an agreement on services, having equivalents on financial services. We\u2019ve set all this out. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, claims that Boris Johnson could still do that interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. Speaking in a round of broadcast interviews on his 50th birthday, Javid told Sky News that \u201cnegotiations are still ongoing\u201d. Neil\u2019s head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn created days of negative headlines for Labour over antisemitism and funding for Labour\u2019s spending plans. Corbyn\u2019s team are furious that Johnson appears to be trying to avoid being put under similar scrutiny, insisting they were assured the prime minister had signed up for a similar interview before agreeing to put up their candidate. A lawyer representing the Jewish Labour Movement has accused Labour of not fully investigating all cases of antisemitism within the party. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, James Libson, a partner at the Mishcon de Reya law firm, said he had prepared 70 sworn testimonies from Labour party staffers past and present as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into allegations of antisemitism in the party. Libson, when asked whether the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s assertion that every case of antisemitism had been dealt with was incorrect, said: \u201cVery much so.\u201d He added: There are many, many outstanding complaints, many examples of interference and many examples of double-standards in the way in which complaints are processed. Asked whether there was evidence that the Labour leader\u2019s office was \u201cinterfering\u201d in the investigations process, Libson said: There has been interference and that interference has unfortunately become institutional. Institutional in the sense that people affiliated with the leader\u2019s office \u2013 and now in the actual unit that are investigating \u2013 and that at a more basic level, information is passing between the leader\u2019s office and investigating unit. He added: \u201cPassed by USB sticks, by WhatsApp groups, secret WhatsApp groups.\u201d The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said Labour had \u201ctoughened up\u201d its approach to tackling antisemitism. He told Today: Having been too slow and too weak at the start, the action being taken now has been toughened up. An in-house lawyer, special appeal panels to deal with complaints, new fast-track expulsion powers that are being used. I\u2019m confident that cases coming in are being dealt with and if they are coming in they will be dealt with.\u201d Healey apologised to the Jewish community who he said \u201cfeel let down\u201d by the way Labour has handled cases of antisemitism in the party. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has tried to get Jeremy Corbyn out of a hole with royalists, by suggesting he may watch the Queen\u2019s speech on catchup. Corbyn appeared to be caught out by ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham when asked whether he watched the Queen\u2019s Christmas broadcast. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s on in the morning, usually we have it on some of the time.\u201d The speech is broadcast at 3pm. Challenged about the apparent gaffe, which made the front page of the Daily Express (see below), Rayner told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean to say he watches it on Christmas Day. He said he watched it in the morning. He said he also visits a homeless shelter.\u201d Asked whether Corbyn meant he watched the speech on Boxing Day, Rayner said: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not with Jeremy Corbyn on Christmas Day. What I\u2019m saying is from my own experience sometimes I watch programmes on catchup, sometimes on the time it\u2019s at. Most kids, including my kids, watch [programmes] on YouTube. So it can be confusing about which times people watch something. You don\u2019t have to watch it at the time that is specified in the TV guide. Asked whether she would be watching the Queen\u2019s speech, Rayner said: \u201cI always do. My kids are named after kings and so I\u2019ve got James and Charles.\u201d What the papers said Joe Biden\u2019s team clearly loved the footage that appeared to show world leaders laughing at Trump. The day ahead Boris Johnson will head to the Midlands, where he will have a tour of a mill shop and inspect some knitwear. Jeremy Corbyn will also be in the Midlands, where he will visit several schools before hosting a rally in the evening. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will visit a care home in Edinburgh before appearing at a rally alongside colleagues from the Scottish section of the party. It\u2019s Nigel Farage\u2019s turn to face off against Andrew Neil. The interview will be broadcast at 7.30pm. Good morning everyone, it\u2019s a week until election day. After the brief but amusing distraction that was Nato, all attention is back on to the vote and Boris Johnson will resume campaigning today. Johnson survived the summit relatively unscathed. There had been concerns in the Conservative camp that Johnson\u2019s proximity to the US president might be damaging, stoking voter fears that the NHS might be on the table in US-UK trade deals. But the prime minister managed to avoid almost any public meetings with Trump, though he was caught on camera apparently joking about Trump with other world leaders, something Johnson astonishingly has no memory of. After the video of the interaction did the rounds, Trump called Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and then announced he was leaving early and would not be giving a press conference. Don\u2019t miss Marina Hyde\u2019s or John Crace\u2019s take on yesterday\u2019s events. Now that all the Nato shenanigans are out of the way, normal programming can resume. Johnson has launched his plans for the first 100 days after he takes office if he wins on 12 December. He says his main focus would be passing the withdrawal agreement to ensure Brexit happens on 31 January. Other priorities include bringing in legislation to end the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders at the halfway point of their sentence \u2013 which the family of murdered student Jack Merritt have condemned as a kneejerk politicisation of the London Bridge terror attack \u2013 and increasing the amount that new immigrants pay to use the NHS. Labour will be talking about education today as Jeremy Corbyn visits schools, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, will pledge to recruit 20,000 more teachers, cap secondary class sizes at 30, and spend \u00a37bn on repairs and upgrades to England\u2019s crumbling school buildings. They will also promise free, healthy breakfasts for all primary-age children as part of a multibillion pound plan to \u201cpoverty-proof\u201d England\u2019s schools. OK, thanks for reading along, we\u2019ll be with you all day, so keep hitting that refresh button.",
