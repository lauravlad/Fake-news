In a Westminster Hall debate last month, he lauded the work of the Foreign Office in seeking to protect the rights of female activists across the world and detailed some of the many means used to silence them. When the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations were bringing parts of London to a standstill this year, Field similarly stood up for the right to protest peacefully. When it came to the actual demonstrations taking place, however, Field was more conflicted and went as far as to write to the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, demanding that she \u201ctake a much firmer grip\u201d on those \u201cprotesting in this anti-social way\u201d.

Whatever the police investigation concludes, it is hard to think of a more toxic image of Conservatism than an angry-looking man in black tie manhandling a woman away from a fancy banquet. Brute male force versus plucky female resistance; cosy privileged club versus outsider somewhere she wasn\u2019t invited. No wonder we can\u2019t stop watching and re-watching it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/mark-field-video-male-violence-minister-female-protester\">The Mark Field video is chillingly familiar to anyone who recognises male violence | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It arguably says something about Field that of all the diners she passes, he is the only one to shove back his chair. But the public reaction to what he did speaks volumes, too. To pick a side in this argument is to place yourself quite clearly on a spectrum running from those who are naturally at ease with conventional authority, through to those with good reason to fear it.</p> <p>So many women will watch that footage of Barker being shoved against a wall, and instinctively wince. You don\u2019t need to have felt the sharp edge of a man\u2019s temper to be afraid of it, and there is something viscerally disturbing about the sight of a hand closing in on a vulnerable neck. If he really thought she was so dangerous, why not wrestle her to the ground? And if he just wanted to get her out before she caused trouble, why not steer her by the elbow? As it is, the whole thing looks horribly reminiscent of a controlling husband, hustling away a wife who has had a few drinks at a party and is now in danger of making a scene, while everyone else stares uncomfortably at their shoes.</p> <p>But not everyone will see it that way. All over the country this morning, there will have been millions of Tory voters harrumphing that frankly she got what was coming to her; that it was her fault for bursting into a private dinner, wilfully causing a security scare when she must have known everyone was on edge. What happened split the room, never mind the country, with some guests reportedly horrified at what they saw as an overreaction while others broke into applause after she was removed.</p> <p>Field\u2019s fellow diners have been criticised in some quarters for failing to step in and calm things down, but in the heat of the moment it isn\u2019t always that simple. Theresa May\u2019s cabinet were mocked for sitting around helplessly when a man (who thankfully turned out merely to be a comedian pulling off a stunt) suddenly lunged towards the podium <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/oct/04/man-interrupts-theresa-mays-speech-to-hand-her-p45-video\" title=\"\">during her 2017 party conference speech</a>. But all I can say, having been there at the time, is that it takes longer than you think for the brain to catch up with the evidence right in front of your eyes. Most bystanders\u2019 natural response is to freeze in profoundly unheroic confusion, because they can\u2019t quite believe what they\u2019re seeing; surely this can\u2019t be real?</p> <p>But watching the Mansion House film back in the cold light of day, it is simply impossible not to form a view. </p> <p>We know which side May is on, at least: she rightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/mark-field-suspended-as-minister-after-grabbing-climate-protester-by-neck\" title=\"\">suspended Field</a>, with Downing Street confirming that she found the footage \u201cvery concerning\u201d. Jeremy Hunt, whose leadership bid Field was supporting, chose to emphasise his colleague\u2019s apology while adding that \u201che recognises that what happened was an overreaction\u201d. But the biggest test of character here is perhaps for Boris Johnson, since those who instinctively sympathise with Field are now his natural constituency.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s path to the leadership in the current climate lies through the sort of Tory members grumbling that a man can\u2019t even act like a man any more without being vilified for it, plus those sick of being preached at by what they see as sanctimonious lefties chipping away at the lifestyles they lead. Many of them regard Hunt as suspiciously wet, warming instead to Johnson\u2019s incorrigible political incorrectness. But are these really the followers he wants? His reaction over the coming days is a fascinating test of what kind of leader he wants to be.</p> <p>At a debate hosted by the Policy Exchange thinktank last week, the strategist Lynton Crosby, widely expected to run Johnson\u2019s first general election campaign if he becomes leader, sketched out <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/lynton-crosby-says-next-tory-leader-must-offer-more-than-phoney-hope/ar-AAD3TZi\" title=\"\">how he thought the Tories might win</a> again. The model is Scott Morrison, the Australian politician who confounded pollsters, bookies and pundits by winning a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/22/scott-morrison-won-the-unwinnable-election-now-the-hard-part-begins\" title=\"\">surprise re-election victory</a> shortly after assuming the leadership of the governing Liberal party. Morrison had, Crosby explained, pitched himself as the man for \u201cquiet Australians\u201d \u2013 people who don\u2019t follow politics closely, aren\u2019t active on social media, and just want to be left to get on with life \u2013 and won by aligning himself with their gut values. The next Tory leader should also pitch themselves as being on the side of what the Australian prime minister Robert Menzies famously called the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.liberals.net/theforgottenpeople.htm\" title=\"\">forgotten people</a>\u201d, better known here as John Major\u2019s \u201csilent majority\u201d, Tony Blair\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/sep/27/labourconference.speeches\" title=\"\">hardworking families</a>\u201d, and David Cameron\u2019s middle income \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/07/conservative-conference-squeezed-middle-strivers\" title=\"\">strivers</a>\u201d. It may seem an oddly retro approach for the unpredictable times we\u2019re living through, but Crosby clearly still believes elections all come down in the end to telling a story of shared, broadly socially conservative values.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why the Mansion House incident matters; it\u2019s a perfect litmus test of where people stand on those values. Deep down, are you socially liberal pink or socially conservative blue? If the latter, do you believe a true gentleman never lifts a hand to a woman, or that women can\u2019t go around demanding equality and then expecting special treatment? Are you more afraid of cosy consensus forming behind closed doors, or of the chaos unleashed by someone breaking through them? All of us know, in our guts, how we\u2019d answer even if we might avoid saying so publicly. Do not trust the politician who seeks election without having the courage to spell it out.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Whatever the police investigation concludes, it is hard to think of a more toxic image of Conservatism than an angry-looking man in black tie manhandling a woman away from a fancy banquet. Brute male force versus plucky female resistance; cosy privileged club versus outsider somewhere she wasn\u2019t invited. No wonder we can\u2019t stop watching and re-watching it. It arguably says something about Field that of all the diners she passes, he is the only one to shove back his chair. But the public reaction to what he did speaks volumes, too. To pick a side in this argument is to place yourself quite clearly on a spectrum running from those who are naturally at ease with conventional authority, through to those with good reason to fear it. So many women will watch that footage of Barker being shoved against a wall, and instinctively wince. You don\u2019t need to have felt the sharp edge of a man\u2019s temper to be afraid of it, and there is something viscerally disturbing about the sight of a hand closing in on a vulnerable neck. If he really thought she was so dangerous, why not wrestle her to the ground? And if he just wanted to get her out before she caused trouble, why not steer her by the elbow? As it is, the whole thing looks horribly reminiscent of a controlling husband, hustling away a wife who has had a few drinks at a party and is now in danger of making a scene, while everyone else stares uncomfortably at their shoes. But not everyone will see it that way. All over the country this morning, there will have been millions of Tory voters harrumphing that frankly she got what was coming to her; that it was her fault for bursting into a private dinner, wilfully causing a security scare when she must have known everyone was on edge. What happened split the room, never mind the country, with some guests reportedly horrified at what they saw as an overreaction while others broke into applause after she was removed. Field\u2019s fellow diners have been criticised in some quarters for failing to step in and calm things down, but in the heat of the moment it isn\u2019t always that simple. Theresa May\u2019s cabinet were mocked for sitting around helplessly when a man (who thankfully turned out merely to be a comedian pulling off a stunt) suddenly lunged towards the podium during her 2017 party conference speech. But all I can say, having been there at the time, is that it takes longer than you think for the brain to catch up with the evidence right in front of your eyes. Most bystanders\u2019 natural response is to freeze in profoundly unheroic confusion, because they can\u2019t quite believe what they\u2019re seeing; surely this can\u2019t be real? But watching the Mansion House film back in the cold light of day, it is simply impossible not to form a view. We know which side May is on, at least: she rightly suspended Field, with Downing Street confirming that she found the footage \u201cvery concerning\u201d. Jeremy Hunt, whose leadership bid Field was supporting, chose to emphasise his colleague\u2019s apology while adding that \u201che recognises that what happened was an overreaction\u201d. But the biggest test of character here is perhaps for Boris Johnson, since those who instinctively sympathise with Field are now his natural constituency. Johnson\u2019s path to the leadership in the current climate lies through the sort of Tory members grumbling that a man can\u2019t even act like a man any more without being vilified for it, plus those sick of being preached at by what they see as sanctimonious lefties chipping away at the lifestyles they lead. Many of them regard Hunt as suspiciously wet, warming instead to Johnson\u2019s incorrigible political incorrectness. But are these really the followers he wants? His reaction over the coming days is a fascinating test of what kind of leader he wants to be. At a debate hosted by the Policy Exchange thinktank last week, the strategist Lynton Crosby, widely expected to run Johnson\u2019s first general election campaign if he becomes leader, sketched out how he thought the Tories might win again. The model is Scott Morrison, the Australian politician who confounded pollsters, bookies and pundits by winning a surprise re-election victory shortly after assuming the leadership of the governing Liberal party. Morrison had, Crosby explained, pitched himself as the man for \u201cquiet Australians\u201d \u2013 people who don\u2019t follow politics closely, aren\u2019t active on social media, and just want to be left to get on with life \u2013 and won by aligning himself with their gut values. The next Tory leader should also pitch themselves as being on the side of what the Australian prime minister Robert Menzies famously called the \u201cforgotten people\u201d, better known here as John Major\u2019s \u201csilent majority\u201d, Tony Blair\u2019s \u201chardworking families\u201d, and David Cameron\u2019s middle income \u201cstrivers\u201d. It may seem an oddly retro approach for the unpredictable times we\u2019re living through, but Crosby clearly still believes elections all come down in the end to telling a story of shared, broadly socially conservative values. And that\u2019s why the Mansion House incident matters; it\u2019s a perfect litmus test of where people stand on those values. Deep down, are you socially liberal pink or socially conservative blue? If the latter, do you believe a true gentleman never lifts a hand to a woman, or that women can\u2019t go around demanding equality and then expecting special treatment? Are you more afraid of cosy consensus forming behind closed doors, or of the chaos unleashed by someone breaking through them? All of us know, in our guts, how we\u2019d answer even if we might avoid saying so publicly. Do not trust the politician who seeks election without having the courage to spell it out. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

Eventually, of course, Johnson himself will come for us all. He\u2019s really the Tories\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2F4ZWTjwTU\" title=\"\">Papa Lazarou</a>, with his grotesque circus, his free-form gibberish, his expanding collection of wedding rings.

Hey \u2013 it\u2019s a living. But is it a life?</p> <p>Maybe this is what you get into politics for. On the other hand, is there a less self-respecting role in public life than being the guy who goes on the radio to flounder about some other guy\u2019s inability to wear a condom? This is effectively the situation in which hopelessly out-of-his-depth Plymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer found himself on Monday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc5live/status/1140569207517528066\" title=\"\">repeatedly pressed by Emma Barnett</a> on whether it wasn\u2019t a bit weird that we didn\u2019t know how many children the likely next prime minister would own up to having. Great chance to shine, and let\u2019s hope Johnny gets Johnson\u2019s equivalent of a DSO for it. Number two at defence?</p> <p>Or perhaps you have more admiration for fellow Johnson proxy Kwasi Kwarteng, who <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/kwasi-kwarteng-on-boris-johnson-to-say-he-is-racist-is-scurrilous-offensive-and-completely-wrong\" title=\"\">appeared on Channel 4 news</a> to fume: \u201cThe idea he is racist is completely ridiculous. To say he is racist is scurrilous, offensive and completely wrong.\u201d I wonder if proxying for Boris feels a bit less unspeakably awful every time they go out and do it. Maybe the proxies get endless free vodka to get them through the horror, like the guys shooting dogs in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Even so, you\u2019ve got to think a lot of this work is going to stay with you for the rest of your life.</p> <p>Asked if he would buy a used car from Johnson, Nadhim Zahawi trilled: \u201cI would buy anything from Boris Johnson!\u201d In that case, I have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/17/absurd-vanity-project-for-our-age-boris-johnson-garden-bridge\" title=\"\">garden bridge</a> to sell you. Also some water cannon, and a line about NHS funding.</p> <p>Or how about Matt Hancock? Eleven days ago, Matt launched his own leadership campaign as \u201cthe candidate of the future\u201d, declaring that choosing between Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove would be like \u201casking me to choose between my children\u201d. But it was bad news for the Hancock kiddies, in the end, as Daddy decided to back Boris Johnson instead. Yup, here comes Cuck Rogers, back from the future to delude himself that Johnson has made the same assurances to him as he has to Steve Baker.</p> <p>We must assume the Westminster proxies are all being run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/05/gavin-williamson-accuses-no-10-of-anonymous-smears\" title=\"\">Gavin Williamson</a>, contrary to a welter of reports about 10 minutes ago that Gavin was completely finished in politics.</p> <p>But in the media, Johnson backers such as <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/george-osbornes-change-of-heart/\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a> have only themselves to blame. Meanwhile, there is a very particular type of chap who goes in to bat for the Old Etonian Johnson with the somewhat tragic deference of a man who knows his own public school was one of the minor ones. This peculiar type of longing underpins much of the writing of Quentin Letts (Haileybury), with his <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9342187/boris-johnson-breaks-the-rules-elites-hate-him/\" title=\"\">most recent Sun column</a> a case in point. Here he is on Johnson: \u201cAt an age when some blokes find their virility drooping, he still plainly has some lead in his pencil, with a new and much younger girlfriend \u2026 He has swanned through life breaking the rules, laughing and bonking. That INFURIATES [the elite]!\u201d Always a pleasure to take lectures on \u201cthe establishment\u201d and \u201cthe elite\u201d and \u201cthe ruling class\u201d from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s highest-paid columnist.</p> <p>And with that, I fear we can avoid the columnist question no longer. I had an instructive online exchange with the aforementioned Johnny Mercer this week, during which he broke the habit of a lunchtime and mentioned his military service, adding in parenthesis \u201c(you were probably writing columns)\u201d. Probably. And I naturally share Johnny\u2019s disdain for newspaper columnists, most especially myself. However, only one of us wants a newspaper columnist to become prime minister.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/boris-johnson-prime-minister-party\">Johnson\u2019s campaign will probably succeed \u2013 but he\u2019ll alienate people he needs | Katy Balls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end, little encapsulates the stage-four clusterfuck the UK is facing as totally as the fact that it is about to be run by a journalist. And, incredibly, by the worse of the two journalists in the final three.</p> <p>Why are we getting journalists to run anything? What\u2019s the rationale \u2013 that now they\u2019ve torched their own industry, they should be allowed a go on the country?

      "bodyText": "Who is the worst minor character in the Borisverse? We have to ask, what with the big man himself only allowed out on an electronic tag for around six minutes\u2019 talking time on the BBC Tory leadership debate. Collectors of vignettes displaying Johnson\u2019s contempt for the public will have enjoyed the spectacle of a takeaway being delivered to his house while the other candidates debated on Channel 4. Encouraging to see him building on his friend David Cameron\u2019s legacy: trotters up even before you\u2019ve screwed the country, instead of only after. The only other sightings of Johnson saw him accompanied by various childminders to vote for himself in a series of progressively apocalypse-beckoning votes in Westminster this week. Eventually, of course, Johnson himself will come for us all. He\u2019s really the Tories\u2019 Papa Lazarou, with his grotesque circus, his free-form gibberish, his expanding collection of wedding rings. And the rest. AND THE REST. For now, though, he is represented by a praetorian guard of beta proxies, who make the rounds of the news programmes for him, interpreting what they think their overlord stands for on questions such as Brexit practicalities, and why you wouldn\u2019t play a meaningful part in your own child\u2019s upbringing. Hey \u2013 it\u2019s a living. But is it a life? Maybe this is what you get into politics for. On the other hand, is there a less self-respecting role in public life than being the guy who goes on the radio to flounder about some other guy\u2019s inability to wear a condom? This is effectively the situation in which hopelessly out-of-his-depth Plymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer found himself on Monday, repeatedly pressed by Emma Barnett on whether it wasn\u2019t a bit weird that we didn\u2019t know how many children the likely next prime minister would own up to having. Great chance to shine, and let\u2019s hope Johnny gets Johnson\u2019s equivalent of a DSO for it. Number two at defence? Or perhaps you have more admiration for fellow Johnson proxy Kwasi Kwarteng, who appeared on Channel 4 news to fume: \u201cThe idea he is racist is completely ridiculous. To say he is racist is scurrilous, offensive and completely wrong.\u201d I wonder if proxying for Boris feels a bit less unspeakably awful every time they go out and do it. Maybe the proxies get endless free vodka to get them through the horror, like the guys shooting dogs in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Even so, you\u2019ve got to think a lot of this work is going to stay with you for the rest of your life. Asked if he would buy a used car from Johnson, Nadhim Zahawi trilled: \u201cI would buy anything from Boris Johnson!\u201d In that case, I have a garden bridge to sell you. Also some water cannon, and a line about NHS funding. Or how about Matt Hancock? Eleven days ago, Matt launched his own leadership campaign as \u201cthe candidate of the future\u201d, declaring that choosing between Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove would be like \u201casking me to choose between my children\u201d. But it was bad news for the Hancock kiddies, in the end, as Daddy decided to back Boris Johnson instead. Yup, here comes Cuck Rogers, back from the future to delude himself that Johnson has made the same assurances to him as he has to Steve Baker. We must assume the Westminster proxies are all being run by Gavin Williamson, contrary to a welter of reports about 10 minutes ago that Gavin was completely finished in politics. But in the media, Johnson backers such as George Osborne have only themselves to blame. Meanwhile, there is a very particular type of chap who goes in to bat for the Old Etonian Johnson with the somewhat tragic deference of a man who knows his own public school was one of the minor ones. This peculiar type of longing underpins much of the writing of Quentin Letts (Haileybury), with his most recent Sun column a case in point. Here he is on Johnson: \u201cAt an age when some blokes find their virility drooping, he still plainly has some lead in his pencil, with a new and much younger girlfriend \u2026 He has swanned through life breaking the rules, laughing and bonking. That INFURIATES [the elite]!\u201d Always a pleasure to take lectures on \u201cthe establishment\u201d and \u201cthe elite\u201d and \u201cthe ruling class\u201d from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s highest-paid columnist. And with that, I fear we can avoid the columnist question no longer. I had an instructive online exchange with the aforementioned Johnny Mercer this week, during which he broke the habit of a lunchtime and mentioned his military service, adding in parenthesis \u201c(you were probably writing columns)\u201d. Probably. And I naturally share Johnny\u2019s disdain for newspaper columnists, most especially myself. However, only one of us wants a newspaper columnist to become prime minister. In the end, little encapsulates the stage-four clusterfuck the UK is facing as totally as the fact that it is about to be run by a journalist. And, incredibly, by the worse of the two journalists in the final three. Why are we getting journalists to run anything? What\u2019s the rationale \u2013 that now they\u2019ve torched their own industry, they should be allowed a go on the country? If the past couple of decades have shown us anything, it\u2019s that journalists shouldn\u2019t really have been in charge of even the journalism business. It is far from a coincidence that two of the leading architects of Brexit \u2013 Michael Gove and Johnson \u2013 were both journalists. Is it in any way surprising to find that the UK is very drunk and has already missed two deadlines? As for all Johnson\u2019s proxies and the backers who should know so much better: every one of them must carry the mark of Cain when it goes tits up, as it assuredly will.

      "bodyText": "What is more shocking? That during the chancellor of the exchequer\u2019s Mansion House speech in London, at the heart of Britain\u2019s establishment, Mark Field, a middle-aged male Tory minister, slammed a young, female Greenpeace protester against a pillar then forcefully propelled her out, clutching her neck? That no one at this gilded dinner, full of other middle-aged, besuited, bow-tie-wearing members of the British elite, did anything? That some even reportedly applauded when he returned? That multiple rightwing commentators have not only defended this minister but called for him to be awarded a medal? That social media abounds with predominantly men cheering the minister on, offering a disturbing and all too revealing insight into what male behaviour towards women they judge to be acceptable? Field\u2019s defence should be treated with derision and contempt. He claims that \u201cmany guests understandably felt threatened and when one protester rushed past me towards the top table I instinctively reacted\u201d, and that \u201cthere was no security present and I was for a split-second genuinely worried she might have been armed\u201d. The term \u201cgaslighting\u201d \u2013 used to describe psychological abuse in which the victim is made to doubt their recollection of events and even sanity \u2013 is often abused in political debate, but here surely is a prima facie case. Mr Field, we can see the video. No one appears threatened by a young Greenpeace activist in a red dress, and a friend of the ITV journalist Robert Peston \u2013 who was in attendance \u2013 vouches that they did not feel so. She does not \u201crush\u201d, but calmly strides. She doesn\u2019t even acknowledge Field until the moment he pushes her against a pillar. Anyone who believes a climate protester would be armed needs an urgent appointment with reality. Anyone watching the video can see not fear, let alone panic, in Field\u2019s eyes, but rather rage: unsurprising for a man who just two months ago wrote a letter demanding the Metropolitan police adopt \u201ca much firmer grip\u201d on climate protesters. I can speak from personal experience. I have been repeatedly harassed in the street by far-right protesters, screaming abuse, including overt homophobia, spitting in my face and attempting to punch me. There is no comparison between those fighting the existential threat of the climate emergency and the far-right menace: the latter is a threat to minorities, women and to democracy itself, and its foot soldiers have a long history of using violence. Yet in none of these examples did I lose my temper; instead I ridiculed my aggressors, even when I was surrounded by several of them. I wasn\u2019t at a dinner surrounded by dozens of sympathisers being approached by a peaceful, female climate protester. Sometimes, incidents should not be seen in isolation, as one-offs, but rather as flares, lighting up the ugliest features of society. First, misogyny: here is a man using physical force to coerce and intimidate a woman. Second, class privilege: here was a closed elite circle invaded by protesters \u2013 in the proud tradition of peaceful direct action that helped win many of our rights and freedoms \u2013 attempting to hold our rulers and their powerful friends to account about an existential threat facing our species. Witness the rightwing hysteria over the milkshaking of Nigel Farage \u2013 with a man convicted and sentenced to 150 hours of community service. And then imagine if a working-class black man had been filmed behaving like this. Would social media and the airwaves be full of rightwing commentators and Tory MPs defending him? Third, an increasingly authoritarian, Trumpian approach to dissent, in which critics and opponents of the Tories are routinely disparaged as \u201ctraitors\u201d, \u201csaboteurs\u201d and, indeed, \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. Field may have been suspended, but his career is unlikely to end here. A petition demanding his sacking from the government has already attracted thousands of signatures. At the last election, his majority collapsed from 9,961 votes to 3,148: here, surely, is a priority for a righteous unseating.
