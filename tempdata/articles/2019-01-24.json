Media Watch itself returns on 4 February.</p> <h2>Tabloid critic dances into spotlight</h2> <p>One of the more curious moves by people who have suffered the glare of the media spotlight, and been outspoken about how ugly it is, is to turn around and join a reality show. It was revealed this week that Cassandra Thorburn, ex-wife of Karl Stefanovic, whose marriage breakdown was dissected by tabloids, has strapped on her dancing shoes to compete in Ten\u2019s revamped Dancing with the Stars.</p> <p>The end of the high-profile marriage created so much negative press it led to the December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/19/karl-stefanovic-dumped-as-today-show-co-host-by-channel-nine\">sacking of Stefanovic</a> as co-host of the Today show. Putting to one side the question of whether she qualifies as a star, the former journalist has complained about press intrusion and how she has been hunted by the women\u2019s magazines and \u201cconstantly harassed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAfter two-and-a-half years, I\u2019m not a news story,\u201d Thorburn said last year. \u201cI\u2019m just a mother who\u2019s divorced from my ex-husband, and I\u2019m trying to find my place back in the world.

But Nine says the presence of the print journos is nothing to do with the merger.

She spoke of the virtues of \u201crespecting\u201d the other person\u2019s point of view, as parliament remains deeply divided over the issue of Britain leaving the EU. The Queen, who as head of state constitutionally remains publicly politically neutral, reflected in her speech on a year of change, during which it was clear the qualities of the WI endure, she said. She added: \u201cThe continued emphasis on patience, friendship, a strong community-focus and considering the needs of others are as important today as they were when the group was founded all those years ago. \u201cOf course, every generation faces fresh challenges and opportunities. As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture. To me, these approaches are timeless, and I commend them to everyone.\u201d It echoed her Christmas address when she touched on the same theme, telling the nation: \u201cEven with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding.\u201d The Queen attends a meeting of the her local WI once a year at West Newton village hall as part of her winter stay on her Norfolk estate. It is not the first time the Queen\u2019s words have been interpreted politically with reference to a referendum. She made a rare intervention on the political stage when she expressed the hope that voters will \u201cthink very carefully about the future\u201d before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 while meeting a member of the public outside Crathie church near Balmoral. She was also dragged into the EU referendum campaign in 2016 when the Sun reported she told former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg she believed the EU was heading in the wrong direction. Her speech on Thursday was made as she joined members of her local WI in a live game of Pointless, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, and was on the winning team. Armstrong, host of the BBC games show, who was this year\u2019s guest speaker, described her as \u201cour most distinguished viewer\u201d. The Queen\u2019s team was victorious in a best-of-five match which finished three-one, he said, during which the Queen gave some answers herself and had \u201csome deft, silky Pointless skills\u201d. The Queen joined the Sandringham branch of the WI in 1943 when she was aged 17 and still Princess Elizabeth.",

Our gardens didn\u2019t have water features or hedging, and no one competed for what estate agents like to dub \u201ckerb appeal\u201d. Our home was also full of life and people. There were dinner parties I wasn\u2019t allowed to attend because I was too young, so I fell asleep against my door trying to make out what adult conversation sounded like. My family lived next door to a vacant block of land, virtually unheard of now in Sydney, where the local kids from the street would play in the long grass. My best friend lived across the road and every weekend we migrated between each other\u2019s houses, careful not to get in the adults\u2019 way, hiding out in the overgrown back gardens, the big blocks and bush landscapes that seemed directly lifted out of our childhood books. There were pockets of trees where we could get truly lost, where no one would find us because our crudely constructed forts were impervious to adult invaders, and no one was looking for us anyway. As an adult, I have tried to recreate that feeling of boundless exploration and imagination and potential in every house I have moved to. But it\u2019s not something you can manufacture, any more than a cushion can make a statement or a new rug can transform a space. Books help though. And so does art. Which is why I fear the daggy and well-worn properties of my generation\u2019s childhood have given way to something much more conventionally attractive, but ultimately sterile and soulless. And also boring. Because when you start trying to turn your home into a magazine spread or commence a renovation you become easily convinced that you are the first person who has ever done this, and then you never stop talking about it. So here is to leaving the kitchen unrenovated for another 10 years. Of cushions that don\u2019t quite match and furniture that looks out of place but you don\u2019t care because it was your grandmother\u2019s and it means more to you than anything you could buy brand new. In other words: the imperfect, loved home that is an expression of what you care about and whom you love. As a postscript, I recently searched online for one of my favourite homes in the street I grew up in, and discovered it had sold recently. The pictures showed a transformed home, with landscaping, hedging, staged furniture and an updated kitchen. It was billed as move-in ready and sold for well over $1.5m, which is the going price nowadays for a property in Frenchs Forest. The messy back garden where I had cemented childhood alliances and formed tree club committees and kissed my brother\u2019s best friend had been cleared and replaced with a freshly oiled deck that shone in the twilight and, beyond that, metres and metres of perfectly manicured grass. \u2022 Johanna Leggatt is a Melbourne journalist",

It comes with a prize of \u00a340,000, the largest visual art prize in Britain.</p> <p>The Thai artist is best known as a feature film maker, winning the top prize at the Cannes film festival in 2010 for his mysterious, contemplative film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/18/uncle-boonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives-review\">Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</a>.</p> <p>Weerasethakul\u2019s work often explores the contradictions in Thailand between the country\u2019s welcoming capitalist modernity and the often brutal, repressive military regime.</p> <p>His work is often described as oblique and that is arguably the case with his <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/en/artists/apichatpong-weerasethakul\">12-minute film, Invisibility</a>, on display at the <a href=\"https://museum.wales/cardiff/\">National Museum Cardiff</a> as part of the <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/exhibitions-prizes/artes-mundi-8\">Artes Mundi prize exhibition</a>. It has darkness and snatches of shadowy film and text that Weerasethakul hopes people will see as dream-like. At one point the text reads \u201cThis film is called Invisibility. A proposal for camouflage.\u201d</p> <p>The judges praised Weerasethakul\u2019s gallery work for its vigorous interrogation \u201cof filmmaking, storytelling and the political and social position of the artist\u201d. They added: \u201cWhen times are tough it is sometimes not safe to talk about politics explicitly and Apichatpong Weerasethakul provides us with some subtle tools of resistance: the methodology of camouflage demonstrated in Invisibility is a powerful weapon in these turbulent times.\u201d</p> <p>Artes Mundi was founded in 2002 to recognise and support contemporary artists who \u201cengage with the human condition, social reality and lived experience\u201d.</p> <p>Previous winners include the British artist John Akomfrah, American Theaster Gates and in 2012 the Mexican artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/29/teresa-margolles-artes-mundi-prize\">Teresa Margolles whose work shone light on Mexico\u2019s horrific drug-related violence</a>.</p> <p>Weerasethakul was named winner from a shortlist that also included Anna Boghiguian (Canada/Egypt), Bouchra Khalili (Morocco/France), Otobong Nkanga (Nigeria/Belgium) and Trevor Paglen (USA).</p> <p>The Artes Mundi prize exhibition continues until 24 February.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Palme d\u2019Or winning film director and artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul has won one of the UK\u2019s most important and lucrative contemporary art prizes. On Thursday evening, Weerasethakul was named winner of the eighth edition of the Artes Mundi prize, a biennial competition rewarding political art from across the world. It comes with a prize of \u00a340,000, the largest visual art prize in Britain. The Thai artist is best known as a feature film maker, winning the top prize at the Cannes film festival in 2010 for his mysterious, contemplative film Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. Weerasethakul\u2019s work often explores the contradictions in Thailand between the country\u2019s welcoming capitalist modernity and the often brutal, repressive military regime. His work is often described as oblique and that is arguably the case with his 12-minute film, Invisibility, on display at the National Museum Cardiff as part of the Artes Mundi prize exhibition. It has darkness and snatches of shadowy film and text that Weerasethakul hopes people will see as dream-like. At one point the text reads \u201cThis film is called Invisibility. A proposal for camouflage.\u201d The judges praised Weerasethakul\u2019s gallery work for its vigorous interrogation \u201cof filmmaking, storytelling and the political and social position of the artist\u201d. They added: \u201cWhen times are tough it is sometimes not safe to talk about politics explicitly and Apichatpong Weerasethakul provides us with some subtle tools of resistance: the methodology of camouflage demonstrated in Invisibility is a powerful weapon in these turbulent times.\u201d Artes Mundi was founded in 2002 to recognise and support contemporary artists who \u201cengage with the human condition, social reality and lived experience\u201d. Previous winners include the British artist John Akomfrah, American Theaster Gates and in 2012 the Mexican artist Teresa Margolles whose work shone light on Mexico\u2019s horrific drug-related violence. Weerasethakul was named winner from a shortlist that also included Anna Boghiguian (Canada/Egypt), Bouchra Khalili (Morocco/France), Otobong Nkanga (Nigeria/Belgium) and Trevor Paglen (USA). The Artes Mundi prize exhibition continues until 24 February.",

      "bodyText": "Unai Emery believes Manchester United\u2019s decision to sack Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in December was completely justified given their low points tally and lack of competitive edge. According to the Arsenal manager, anyone who falls below expected standards has to accept they are in the firing line. \u201cThis is normal,\u201d Emery said. \u201cI was not surprised because this team has big players and can think about winning the Premier League. They lost a lot of points.\u201d At the sharp end of management there was not much room for sympathy. Arsenal face a United side who have won seven games in succession since Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r replaced Mourinho. United have made up a lot of ground in the Premier League and the two clubs are now locked on 44 points, with Arsenal narrowly ahead on goal difference in the outsiders\u2019 chase for a top-four finish. Emery is wary of how a revitalised United pose a big threat in the FA Cup tie at the Emirates. \u201cThey are very dangerous and in a good moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to find the best first XI, because against Manchester United, we will need the best performance and quality.\u201d There will be at least one forced change with H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn joining the long-term injury list after suffering a cruciate injury against Chelsea last weekend. Petr Cech will be hoping for a return to the team in goal. The Mesut \u00d6zil question rumbles on. The potential for a rendezvous with Alexis S\u00e1nchez adds spice. The striker has been backed by Solskj\u00e6r to respond in a positive way if given a feisty welcome on his first return to the Emirates since leaving Arsenal for United last January. Despite a largely underwhelming year at Old Trafford, Emery is an admirer of S\u00e1nchez, having attempted to sign him while in charge of Paris Saint-Germain. \u201cHe is a very good player and when I was at PSG, we thought he could help us,\u201d Emery said. \u201cWe spoke about a lot of players, about a lot of important players, and one was the possibility of Alexis. But it was not possible because of circumstances at the time.\u201d Even if the home crowd will not be too pleased to clap eyes on S\u00e1nchez, Emery is thinking only about how to quell the varied attacking threats United carry. \u201cI respect him.

United have looked liberated under Solskj\u00e6r, with Marcus Rashford in confident form leading the lineand Paul Pogba eager to prompt the attack whenever he can.

We had a great team and they had a very good one. It was a special rivalry and I\u2019m not sure the Premier League has seen anything like it since, although perhaps Manchester City and Liverpool at the moment are close.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/psgs-neymar-taken-to-hospital-after-injury-as-barcelona-lose-to-sevilla\">PSG\u2019s Neymar a doubt for Manchester United tie after metatarsal injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how long that lasts, because we are hoping to get up to that level again soon. Twenty years ago it was just us and Arsenal for a long time, going at each other, going for the title. It was just between the two of us until Jos\u00e9 came along with Chelsea, I can\u2019t remember any other challengers. Maybe one year Liverpool were half close but that was it.\u201d</p> <p>So intense was the rivalry that Solskj\u00e6r was astonished to see Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira make a television programme together a few years ago, when in their playing days they were more famous for being at each other\u2019s throats. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used to be fighting all the time. There was a nice little fight in the tunnel in that 4-2 game where John O\u2019Shea scored the winning goal [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/feb/02/match.sport\" title=\"\">February 2005</a>], but whenever we played Arsenal in those days there were fights in the tunnels and on the pitch. It was just everything I loved about football, that passion is part of the game. I\u2019m sure the fans could feel it as well, that\u2019s what makes it so interesting. I hope the next game is as good as some of the ones we have had in the past.\u201d</p> <p>In terms of FA Cup meetings the one everyone remembers most vividly is the semi-final in 1999, with its replay, Peter Schmeichel penalty save and Ryan Giggs\u2019s stunning winner. Solskj\u00e6r played in both, though had been substituted by the time Giggs went on his slaloming run in extra-time at Villa Park. \u201cI watched that goal from the sidelines, but the two sides were so evenly matched we all knew it was such an important game,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI firmly believe that Peter saving that penalty from Dennis Bergkamp gave us the impetus to go on and win the treble. If Bergkamp had scored I think Arsenal would have won the double. That\u2019s how small the margins were, and that is why it is still a standout memory for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc67657abcb63219d5da710f35b7b1d6af8f87b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc67657abcb63219d5da710f35b7b1d6af8f87b0/153_276_3122_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrates Manchester United\u2019s seventh consecutive win, against Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Solskj\u00e6r would go on to make his own indelible contribution to the treble and Manchester United history with his stoppage-time winner against Bayern Munich in Barcelona, a slightly less celebrated fact is that he did the same thing against Liverpool in a fourth\u2011round tie at Old Trafford almost exactly 20 years ago this weekend.</p> <p>United had trailed to a Michael Owen goal for most of the game, but two goals in the last three minutes from Dwight Yorke and Solskj\u00e6r saw them through. Newspapers at the time produced the same \u201csmash and grab\u201d headlines they would later use for the jaw-dropping conclusion to the Champions League final, and when Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s winner went in there were even pictures of Liverpool players dropping to the ground as if poleaxed in exactly the manner made famous by Sammy Kuffour and his fellow defenders in the Camp Nou.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/paul-scholes-class-of-92-manchester-united-ole-gunnar-solskjaer\">Paul Scholes says Class of 92 should have greater role at Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s interventions from the substitutes\u2019 bench deservedly earned him renown; a month after the Liverpool game he came on in a league match at Nottingham Forest and scored four goals in 12 minutes, but without his lesser known last\u2011gasp winner the dreams of a treble might have been stifled at an early stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Solskj\u00e6r is presently making a name for himself all over again in a different capacity at Old Trafford.

Already proving an inspired managerial solution if the object of the exercise is to provide an antidote to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s suspicion and sarcasm, Solskj\u00e6r gives the impression of positively relishing the challenge. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure it\u2019s a good game of football,\u201d he said, after confirming Alexis S\u00e1nchez will come in to play against his old club.</p> <p>Is he not worried about the Chilean being mocked by the Arsenal crowd on account of his stuttering form in Manchester? \u201cI think he\u2019ll love it,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cAs a player, pride kicks in if the crowd turns against you. You think: \u2018I\u2019ll show all of you.\u2019 I have no worries at all about Alexis being involved.

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has always loved the FA Cup \u2013 he rates walking out at Wembley in 1999 as highly as all the other memories from that year because the Cup final on television was always an event when growing up in Norway \u2013 and he is equally happy to be renewing a rivalry with Arsenal that is just as fondly remembered. \u201cThe games against Arsenal were the fiercest battles we had during my time in England,\u201d Manchester United\u2019s caretaker manager said. \u201cThey won the double, we won the treble and the games were just fantastic because they were the two top teams. We had a great team and they had a very good one. It was a special rivalry and I\u2019m not sure the Premier League has seen anything like it since, although perhaps Manchester City and Liverpool at the moment are close. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how long that lasts, because we are hoping to get up to that level again soon. Twenty years ago it was just us and Arsenal for a long time, going at each other, going for the title. It was just between the two of us until Jos\u00e9 came along with Chelsea, I can\u2019t remember any other challengers. Maybe one year Liverpool were half close but that was it.\u201d So intense was the rivalry that Solskj\u00e6r was astonished to see Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira make a television programme together a few years ago, when in their playing days they were more famous for being at each other\u2019s throats. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used to be fighting all the time. There was a nice little fight in the tunnel in that 4-2 game where John O\u2019Shea scored the winning goal [February 2005], but whenever we played Arsenal in those days there were fights in the tunnels and on the pitch. It was just everything I loved about football, that passion is part of the game. I\u2019m sure the fans could feel it as well, that\u2019s what makes it so interesting. I hope the next game is as good as some of the ones we have had in the past.\u201d In terms of FA Cup meetings the one everyone remembers most vividly is the semi-final in 1999, with its replay, Peter Schmeichel penalty save and Ryan Giggs\u2019s stunning winner. Solskj\u00e6r played in both, though had been substituted by the time Giggs went on his slaloming run in extra-time at Villa Park. \u201cI watched that goal from the sidelines, but the two sides were so evenly matched we all knew it was such an important game,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI firmly believe that Peter saving that penalty from Dennis Bergkamp gave us the impetus to go on and win the treble. If Bergkamp had scored I think Arsenal would have won the double. That\u2019s how small the margins were, and that is why it is still a standout memory for me.\u201d While Solskj\u00e6r would go on to make his own indelible contribution to the treble and Manchester United history with his stoppage-time winner against Bayern Munich in Barcelona, a slightly less celebrated fact is that he did the same thing against Liverpool in a fourth\u2011round tie at Old Trafford almost exactly 20 years ago this weekend. United had trailed to a Michael Owen goal for most of the game, but two goals in the last three minutes from Dwight Yorke and Solskj\u00e6r saw them through. Newspapers at the time produced the same \u201csmash and grab\u201d headlines they would later use for the jaw-dropping conclusion to the Champions League final, and when Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s winner went in there were even pictures of Liverpool players dropping to the ground as if poleaxed in exactly the manner made famous by Sammy Kuffour and his fellow defenders in the Camp Nou. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s interventions from the substitutes\u2019 bench deservedly earned him renown; a month after the Liverpool game he came on in a league match at Nottingham Forest and scored four goals in 12 minutes, but without his lesser known last\u2011gasp winner the dreams of a treble might have been stifled at an early stage. Solskj\u00e6r is presently making a name for himself all over again in a different capacity at Old Trafford. Seven wins in succession is impressive whatever the calibre of opposition, and after beating Tottenham at Wembley this month there is no reason for United and their engaging young manager to fear a trip to the Emirates Stadium. Already proving an inspired managerial solution if the object of the exercise is to provide an antidote to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s suspicion and sarcasm, Solskj\u00e6r gives the impression of positively relishing the challenge. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure it\u2019s a good game of football,\u201d he said, after confirming Alexis S\u00e1nchez will come in to play against his old club. Is he not worried about the Chilean being mocked by the Arsenal crowd on account of his stuttering form in Manchester? \u201cI think he\u2019ll love it,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cAs a player, pride kicks in if the crowd turns against you. You think: \u2018I\u2019ll show all of you.\u2019 I have no worries at all about Alexis being involved. He\u2019s been fantastic in training, his attitude has been spot on, so hopefully he\u2019ll enjoy the game.\u201d",

Spurs, weakened by injuries fought back well in the second half after being dominated in the first, but Chelsea deserved to advance.

Suddenly the sun is shining again at Stamford Bridge, and Spurs can only curse the absence of Son, Kane and Alli. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

      "bodyText": "\u201cI was very happy with the performance. We reacted very well. We played with a very good level of determination so I was really very happy. I think that in 180 minutes across the two matches, we deserved to go to the final.\u201d \u201cI think we deserved to win 3-1 or 4-1 [today] but the opponents were able to put us in trouble at the beginning of the second half. But we were very dangerous and had a lot of opportunities.\u201d About Higuain he says: \u201cHe was lucky tonight because if he saw us in the last match he would have been a little bit worried I think! Regarding his criticism of his team\u2019s attitude during the week, he says: \u201cI didn\u2019t attack my players. I said only that we had a problem. The problem was the motivation, with continuity. In this match we reacted very well and now we have to show continuity.\u201d \u201cWhen you have a chance to go to the penalty on final, you know you have to be clinical and have a bit of luck ... we played so well in the second half, we dominated and we had chances, but that\u2019s football.\u201d They didn\u2019t dominate. \u201cIn the first half we played very well before we conceded the first goal, we had control.\u201d They didn\u2019t have control. \u201cI feel so proud. The team was so good. I am so happy with the performance, with the way we fought and the way we arrived in the semi-final, after playing Watford, Arsenal and two great games against Chelsea.\u201d Chelsea will play Manchester City in next month\u2019s final. Spurs, weakened by injuries fought back well in the second half after being dominated in the first, but Chelsea deserved to advance. Hazard revelled in his favourite position on the left, where he combined well with Emerson. And Sarri got the reaction he had demanded. Suddenly the sun is shining again at Stamford Bridge, and Spurs can only curse the absence of Son, Kane and Alli. David Luiz blasts it low into the corner to win it for Chelsea! Chelsea 4-2 Spurs Moura\u2019s shot is saved by Arrizabalaga Chelsea 3-2 Spurs Jorginho does his usual skip before rolling the ball past the befuddled keeper Chelsea 3-2 Spurs Dier Waddles it over the bar! Chelsea 2-2 Spurs Azpilicueta scores, high into the corner Chelsea 2-2 Spurs Lamela fires low into the corner Chelsea 1-2 Spurs Willian sends the keeper the wrong way and scores Chelsea 1-1 Spurs Eriksen shoots low into the net Chelsea 0-1 Spurs Spurs will go first. Pochettino is looking very animated as he gives his players a team-talk. Presumably he\u2019s reminding them that all they have to do now is slot the ball into the net from 12 yards, past the world\u2019s most expensive goalkeeper .... Penalty shootout to follow ... 90+4 min: Giroud does very well to hold the ball up on half-way despite pressure. Then he brings Emerson into the play and turns and runs towards the box in anticipation of a cross. Emerson hares down the left and duly delivers the cross ... but Giroud heads wide from 10 yards! This doesn\u2019t augur well for his role in the shootout ... 90+2 min: Emerson flies down the left and digs out a splendid cross. Giroud has a chance to claim the winner from six yards .... but he misses the ball completely! It was on his left foot, six yards out. It was a sitter! 90 min: If no one scores a decisive goal in the next four minutes, we\u2019ll have ourselves a shootout. It\u2019d be a pity to be denied that treat now. 90 min: Aurier\u2019s hurt after a heavy fall caused by crashing into Emerson after a mighty leap to win a header. 88 min: Rose again does superbly, outmuscling and then outskilling Willian to turn a Chelsea attack into a Tottenham break. 86 min: Giroud peels away and finds space at the left-hand side of the box, but his first touch his slightly too hefty, allowing Alderweireld to rush across and prevent him from getting off a shot. 85 min: After two fine defensive challenges - first by Rose, then by Dier - Chelsea keep on the pressure and win a corner. Hazard curls it in to the near post, where Azpilicueta helps it on, but it slightly beyond David Luiz towards the back. 83 min: Lamela beats Willian to a bouncing ball after Azplicueta tries to head clear. Then Azplicicueta comes over to try to win it back. Lamela turns his back to his opponent and tries to hold him off, his elbow hitting the nose of the defender, who goes down and gets a freekick. 82 min: Willian\u2019s delivers a mean corner that Vertonghen has to head behind for another. Willian wastes the next one. Chelsea substitution: Kovacic on, Barkley off. 80 min: We may be only 10+ minutes away from a shootout ... Spurs substitution: Sanchez on, Sissoko off. 79 min: Chelsea play on despite Sissoko being on the ground hurt following a collision with his teammate Aurier. It\u2019s not a head injury so Chelsea feel within their rights, although Spurs are miffed and make that clear after clearing the ball for a corner. 76 min: Kant\u00e9 finds space to cross from the right, but Aurier heads his delivery away. Chelsea substitution: Willian on, Pedro off. 74 min: Hazard receives a pass from R\u00fcdiger with his back to goal, about 25 yards out. He spins and darts fowards before unloading a low fizzer from the edge of the box. It whistles past Gazzaniga ... and inches past the far post! 73 min: Sissoko booked for catching Jorginho with a mistimed challenge in central midfield. 71 min: Rose, who has been very good since his introduction, flies down the left again, but this time his cross goes straight to the keeper. 70 min: Gazzaniga bypasses the Chelsea defence with a superb long kick from his hands and right into the path of Moura. The Brazilian runs on to it and tries to smash the bouncing ball goalward from the edge of the area. He finds the sidenetting. Spurs substitution: Moura on, Llorente off. 67 min: Azpilicueta booked for halting a counter-attack illegally. 66 min: Lovely play by Hazard! Such deft touches and nimble footwork! He plays a dinky one-two at the edge of the box and then sidesteps one challenge in the area before being crowded out. Amid much panic in the Spurs box, Pedro eventually gets off a shot. Gazzaniga saves. 65 min: Now here\u2019s a good reason to mention Eriksen: he glides a super pass from the right over to you Llorente, who\u2019ll have a clear shot at goal from 16 yards if only he can take it down .... but he stretches out his leg and misses it! 64 min: Hazard collects the ball in his favourite sphere of influence, the left-hand channel. He helps it on to Giroud, who tires a shot from an acute angle. He gets a corner. It\u2019s delivered to R\u00fcdiger on the far side of the box and, after he takes it down on his chest, his shot is charged down. 62 min: Eriksen. Just wanted to say his name. There hasn\u2019t yet been any other reason to mention him today. 60 min: For the many of you asking: NO, away goals do not count double here. 58 min: Kant\u00e9 punces on a breaking ball in midfield and immediately releases Hazard. Can he put Chelsea back in front on aggregate? No, he fires low and wide of the near post from the edge of the area! What a chance that was! But you get the feeling there\u2019ll be many more for both teams in what is becoming a belting encounter... 56 min: Rose is down again, shouting in pan as he goes after being caught by Kant\u00e9. It all happened right in front of the dugouts, so representatives of both clubs leap to their feet to gesticulate helpfully. The ref, meanwhile, shows Kant\u00e9 a yellow. This is getting pleasingly feisty, though not quite reaching the heights of their adorable clash here in the 2015-16 season. 55 min: A dangerous cross from the left by Emerson is headed well clear by Vertonghen. 54 min: Spurs have new fizz! And Jorginho is booked for chopping down Rose after a lovely burst down the left by the defender. And then Sarri gets booked for complaining. 52 min: Kant\u00e9 skitters through the middle and slides in Giroud, who doesn\u2019t catch his shot well. Still, Gazzaniga had to get down quickly to make an awkward save from the striker\u2019s 16-yard shot. From out of nowhere, Spurs hit back! Rose delivers a beautiful cross from the left and Llorente does brilliantly to stoop past David Luiz and guide a difficult downward header into the net from seven yards! 51 min: Chelsea catch Spurs trying to play their way out from the back, with Hazard pinching the ball off Aurier before flipping it inside to Kant\u00e9. The Frenchman tries to twirl past Alderweireld and nearly succeeds, but Spurs eventually scramble the ball away. 49 min: Eriksen takes a short corner to Rose, who whips it into the area. When it\u2019s cleared to the edge of the box, Alderweireld tries to smash a volley into the net, but blasts high and wide. 47 min: Gazzaniga punches away a Chelsea corner. Jorginho returns it wide a sidefooted volley from 20 yards, but the keeper makes a comfortable save. 46 min: No substitutions during the break. Spurs, of course, were forced to make one earlier when Rose replaced the injured Davies. Lucas Moura should be on soon, mind, either for Lamela or even Llorente, both of whom have been ineffective. The evidence so far suggests that the best way to motivate Chelsea is to announce that they are difficult to motivate. Maurizio Sarri, Jedi master. \u201cPedro is absolutely owning this tie,\u201d bugles Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cHe\u2019s never the first or even the third name you think of when it comes to Chelsea, but my goodness, I have never seen him have a bad match. Such an intelligent, quick player.\u201d You\u2019re right, Hubert, except that his touch has let him down a couple of times today, otherwise he might have been on the score sheet already. Chelsea bossed that half and deserve their lead, given to them by goals from Kant\u00e9 and Hazard, who has been in especially good form cutting in from the left. It\u2019s been something of a non-performance by Spurs, who have been impotent up front - understandable, to an extent, given their absentees - but also uncharacteristically ragged at the back and often bypassed in midfield. Unless they improve, or their hosts deteriorated, Chelsea are heading for the final. 45+2 min: Alderweireld\u2019s woes go on, as he gets himself in a mess trying to dribble between Giroud and Hazard near half-way. Hazard robs the ball off him and scurries towards the Tottenham box. Alderweireld chases after him and then brings him down with a tackle from behind. The crowd howl for a penalty but the ref waves play on, seemingly believing the defender got the ball and did no harm to the man. It looked a foul to me, just outside the box. 45 min: There will be at least three more minutes before Pochettino gets another chance to hypnotise Llorente, Lamela and Sissoko into thinking they are Kane, Alli and Son. 44 min: Excellent work by Hazard, who wins the ball deep in his own half and then spanks a wonderful pass 40 yards forward to Pedro. But the move goes downhill from there. 42 min: A lucky break for Spurs, as Pedro miscontrols after being released down the right on a counter. 40 min: Spurs are getting frustrated, with Lamela complaining about a freekick awarded to Hazard for a robust tackle by Sissoko. In truth, Spurs are probably most frustrated by their own limitations: they can\u2019t keep the ball in the attacking end, let alone threaten a breakthrough. And they look vulnerable every time Chelsea zoom forward, especially with Hazard increasingly mischievous. It\u2019s been coming. Spurs were sluggish as Barkley took a quick freekick in midfield. Then Pedro slipped in the overlapping Azpilicueta down the right and the Spaniard fed a low cross into Hazard, who swatted it into the net from eight yards. 36 min: hazard is getting into the groove. He dances past Sissoko down the let and fires in a low ball to the near post. Giroud\u2019s attempt to turn it into the net is hampered by Alderweireld, who does just enough. But Spurs are creaking, no doubt about that. 34 min: Emerson skins two down the left before sticking in a reasonable cross, except that it\u2019s too close to the keeper, who claims it under no pressure. Spurs substitution: Rose on, Davies off. 32 min: Danny Rose has been ordered to warm up because Davies is down with some sort of injury, possibly a groin strain. Poor Pochettino, born in a town called Murphy, finding out all about what Murphy\u2019s Law means in these parts. 30 min: Spurs bout of the jitters at the back has not relented. Now Vertonghen concedes an easily avoidable corner. This time there\u2019s no punishment. \u201cYou asked what Gonzalo Higuain said to the crowd before the match,\u201d recalls Peter Oh. \u201cGiven the fiery reputation of the current AC Milan manager, it\u2019s possible that he said \u201cAm I glad to be here? Oh boy am I ever! Here in London I\u2019m safe from Rino Gattuso. Uh, anyway lads, it\u2019s always been a dream of mine to play for Ars...[checks badge] Chelsea, and no, it was never about the money\u2019.\u201d Alderweireld sloppily concedes a corner. The delivery is headed away at the near post by Llorente. But Kant\u00e9 runs on it and smashes a low shot between three sets of legs and into the net, with Gazzaniga too perplexed to adjust his own feet quickly enough to make a stop! Chelsea rush into the net to retrieve the ball and go for goal No2. 27 min: Llorente makes a long pass to him stick, but then botches his attempt to feed Lamela, rolling the ball behind his teammate to neutralise a counter-attack. 25 min: After a nice moe down the right by Chelsea, Winks hurries across to block a delivery by Azpilicueta, at the expense of a corner. Chelsea take it short and eventually send a cross into the area. But now David Luiz is offside. 23 min: R\u00fcdiger overhits a long pass aimed at Giroud, who hasn\u2019t been as involved as he would have liked so far. That\u2019s because Spurs have defended well and Chelsea have lacked precision. 21 min: Spurs exert a bit of pressure. After his first corner comes to nought, Lamela attempts another out-swinger from the left. That, too, yields nothing. \u201cI realise that I should be concentrating on this important and fascinating game, but I\u2019ve spent the first fifteen minutes of the match trying to think of football managers with other versions of the name Maurice,\u201d admits Kari Tulinius. \u201cSo far, I haven\u2019t thought of a single Mauritz, Moritz or Morris. However, I would like to see Mauricio and Maurizio manage a contest between Mauritania, the intimidatingly nicknamed Lions of Chinguetti, and Mauritius, the less intimidatingly nicknamed Dodos.\u201d Maurice Setters wants a word with you. 18 min: Spurs are struggling to plot a way out of their half. Chelsea are buzzing around them whenever they enter opposing territory and Spurs can\u2019t find the precision and strength to hold on to the ball. They\u2019re missing their star trio, no doubt. 15 min: Hazard attacks from the left again. This time he plays a short one-two with Barkley before knocking it back to Emmerson, whose attempt to switch the action to the far side brings a ballboy into play 13 min: Hazard gets a chance to skedaddle down the left for the first time. And he gets tripped by Alderweireld. He gets up to take the freekick, clipping it over to the far side of the box. Giroud tries a spectacular scissors kick but doesn\u2019t direct it towards goal, sending it instead across the six-yard box. Barkley attempts to turn it towards the target but can\u2019t get over the bouncing ball to make a sure connection. Spurs escape. 11 min: Hazard curls a freekick from the right into the area. But before anyone can try to meet it, Rudiger is penalised for a foul. 8 min: After a dainty interception by David Luiz, the Brazilian gets caught in midfield by Dier. It was not a dirty tackle - in fact, the contact was made by David Luiz after Dier jumped in front of him to try to make a block - but David Luiz seems to have suffered an injury. He hobbles off for treatment. 6 min: Emerson gallops down the left for the first time but then overhits a simple pass intended for Barkley. 4 min: Jorginho pounced on a loose ball in midfield and quickly fed Pedro, who scampered down the left into the space left by Davies. The Spaniard dashes into the box and turns on to his left foot ... but his shot from 16 yards is well blocked by Alderweireld. 2 min: Pochettino demanded an aggressive start and that\u2019s what he got, with Spurs pressing high from the start. But Chelsea are up for this too, so neither side has had any meaningful time on the ball so far. 1 min: The Carabao Cup semi-final second leg is go! Pyrotechnics accompany the arrival of the players on to the pitch, and the crowd clap along to Liquidator. It\u2019s a fun atmosphere on a freezing London night. Apparently Gonzalo Higuian has been presented to Chelsea fans on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. I\u2019m told he even said a few words to them in English. But I don\u2019t know what those words were. Anyone like to guess? \u201cWith the absences in Spurs\u2019 lineup for this match, the DESK attacking formation has become SELL,\u201d notes Rob Smith. \u201cOr maybe SWELL if Winks is included. Is that a good thing?\u201d I\u2019m not sure, Rob. But if Moura comes on as a substitute for Winks, that would really stink. He\u2019s not making any excuses about the absences of Kane, Son or Alli: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fantastic to win and go through to the final but we are going to have a very difficult game. It\u2019s going to be a massive battle ... how we start the game is going to be so important. We need to be aggressive and try to dominate.\u201d The manager says he has been encouraged by his players\u2019 attitude in training in the last few days but wants them to produce in a proper match now: \u201cWe need to react on the pitch. I saw something interesting in the last two or three trainings but only on the pitch is it important. So I want to be see something good in this match.\u201d He also says that he intended to play Christensen at centreback but the Dane had a groin problem in training so David Luiz starts instead. As for the inclusion of Giroud, he says: \u201cI didn\u2019t like how we attacked the opposing box in the last match so tonight we need a true nine.\u201d \u201cThat sign in the photo says all you need to know about Sarri\u2019s faith in his strikers\u2019 ability to find the net,\u201d chortles Justin Kavanagh. \u201cNo doubt they will respond with a No Smoking Please sign of their own in the dressing room.\u201d It\u2019ll most likely be a V-sign for Sarri after this game, one way or the other. It looks the like that clear-the-air meeting between Sarri and the players has led to the manaegr seeing the light! He\u2019s made significant changes here: Emerson comes in at left-back in place of the under-performing Alonso; Giroud starts as at centre-forward so that Hazard can frolic as he pleases; an let\u2019s see what role will be given to Ngolo Kant\u00e9 - the one at which he\u2019s a world leader, or the one at which he\u2019s so-so? Meanwhile, some rare good news for Spurs on the injury front, as Sissoko returns. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, R\u00fcdiger, Emerson; Kant\u00e9, Jorginho, Barkley; Pedro, Giroud, Hazard Subs: Cabellero, Ampadu, Alonso, Kovacic, Hudson-Odoi, Willian, Piazon Spurs: Gazzaniga; Aurier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Davies; Dier, Winks, Sissoko, Eriksen, Lamela; Llorente Subs: Lloris, Rose, Sanchez, Walker-Peters, Skipp, Nkoudou, Moura Referee: M Atkinson In the first instalment of this semi-final, Spurs beat Chelsea 1-0 thanks to a hotly-debated penalty by Harry Kane. But since then Kane and most of the rest of Spurs\u2019 strike force been rendered unavailable, jeopardising the north Londoners\u2019 hopes for the season at a critical point. Holding on to their first leg lead today, or even increasing it, would do them a power of good, even if the final, against Manchester City, would mean that a team that is being stretched close to breaking point would have another fixture to contend with. Chelsea also have problems. They failed to sign Gonzalo Higuain in time for this match so Maurizio Sarri will have to rely on strikers that he evidently does not believe to be adequate, or else deploy Eden Hazard in a role that the Belgian does not particularly enjoy. Chelsea have failed to score in three of their last five matches.

How will they respond today? One of these teams will feel much better about themselves after this clash, and one will feel worse. And one of these managers will leave Stamford Bridge today knowing that he\u2019ll be taking his team to a cup final against Manchester City next month, and what a thrill that would be for Mauricio Pochettino, whose trophy cabinet is bare, or Sarri, whose career honours so far consist of an Employee of the Week rosette from the Banca Monte deli Paschi di Siena.",

      "bodyText": "On a bewildering second day there was a stampede of batsmen returning to the Garfield Sobers pavilion shaking their heads in exasperation. In all, 18 wickets fell and amid the carnage England will be left with a huge victory target in the context of this match. The tourists\u2019 batsmen came and went more rapidly than those from West Indies. On a deceptively serene afternoon England were bowled out for 77, a deficit of 212 runs after the completion of two innings. The hordes of travelling fans looked on in a state of silent shock. After all, this was the 21st century and such a procession of disconsolate England players against West Indies pacemen was no longer meant to be around every corner. Then the home batsmen were infected as they lost five wickets for nine runs in the final session against the combination of Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali. But powered by the irrepressible Shimron Hetmyer with spirited assistance from Shane Dowrich in a 59-run partnership, once again West Indies held a mighty lead of 339, though Hetmyer fell to Sam Curran late in the day. Seventy-seven was not the lowest score cobbled together by an England team touring the Caribbean yet this capitulation was certainly more shocking than the 46 all out in Trinidad in 1994, an experience that may not have been forgotten by England\u2019s batting coach, Mark Ramprakash. Then the predictable tormentors were Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. In 2009 at Sabina Park England were dispatched for 51 at the hands of Jerome Taylor and Sulieman Benn, a less likely source of humiliation. Here Kemar Roach, in a devastating spell after lunch of five for 13 from eight overs, was the architect of England\u2019s hapless downfall. Jason Holder supported him brilliantly, yielding nothing and picking up two vital wickets. Then at the end of the innings West Indies\u2019 two fastest bowlers, Alzarri Joseph and Shannon Gabriel, chipped in with three scalps just to ensure their confidence is high when they start bowling again. To no one\u2019s surprise West Indies declined to enforce the follow-on, not a decision that would have been taxing Holder overnight even though his side had been in the field for only 30.2 overs.

      "bodyText": "Thursday morning in Caracas dawned much like any other day in the slow decline of Venezuela\u2019s Bolivarian revolution: sparsely stocked shops were open, commuters boarded decaying metro trains and clapped-out buses to get to work. Schools were half-empty, buses were harder to find, but apart from that, the capital was mostly calm, and there was little indication of the previous day\u2019s extraordinary events \u2013 or that two men now claim to be the country\u2019s rightful ruler. To roars of approval from thousands of supporters \u2013 and the enthusiastic support of the Trump administration \u2013 Juan Guaid\u00f3, the former head of the national assembly, declared himself interim president on Wednesday. It was the most brazen challenge so far to the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who immediately dismissed the move as a coup attempt orchestrated by an alliance of the \u201cfascist right\u201d and \u201cthe coup-mongering, interventionist gringo empire\u201d. Overnight, security forces clashed with protesters in the working-class neighborhood of Petare in eastern Caracas, and isolated incidents of looting occurred. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s bold gamble set the scene for a political standoff: neither side seems willing to budge, and each leader can count on international support. What that means for Venezuelans remains far from clear, said Alejandro Rond\u00f3n a 24-year-old management student who joined a pro-Maduro rally on Wednesday. \u201cWhat Mr Guaid\u00f3 did seems irresponsible to me: he is deceiving people \u2013 and he\u2019s leading us into a constitutional labyrinth it will be hard for us to get out of.\u201d Rond\u00f3n allowed that there were frustrations with the government but he was confident that the people would stick with Maduro \u2013 if only out of loyalty to his late mentor and predecessor. \u201cIn moments like this we close ranks because of our respect for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d And despite growing uncertainty over the country\u2019s future, life continued more or less as normal for Venezuelans on both sides of the political divide. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t get to work,\u201d said Simara Romero a 35-year-old waitress, who crosses Caracas twice a day for her job at a coffee shop in the east of the city. \u201cIt took me an hour to find a bus that would bring me to work.

Across the country, Venezuelans turned to the strategies they have relied on in previous outbreaks of political drama. \u201cI\u2019ve stocked up on food \u2013 although there is hardly anything to buy in the shops,\u201d said Victoria Daboin, 26, from the Andean city of M\u00e9rida in the west. \u201cThis [unrest] is typical, it always happens in the country when there\u2019s uncertainty.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said that many Venezuelan families have come up with methods to get through periods of turmoil: \u201cYou stock up on food a couple of days when you see it coming. You keep kids home. You obsessively check Twitter and WhatsApp \u2013 but you no longer forward every post because most videos of burning cities or wounded people are fake or from Nicaragua,\u201d she said. But this week\u2019s developments have added a new element of uncertainty to familiar rituals: since Guaid\u00f3 took his oath of office, neither he nor Maduro have made any significant public appearance or official indication of their plans. Internationally, supporters of the two men have lined up on familiar geopolitical lines: Russia, China, Cuba, Turkey and Nicaragua have backed Maduro; the US, the UK and most of Venezuela\u2019s Latin American neighbours have backed Guaid\u00f3. But how that support plays out on the ground remains unclear. When Donald Trump official recognized Guaid\u00f3 as president, Maduro responded quickly by giving all US diplomatic staff 72 hours to leave the country. However, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said that US diplomats would remain in Venezuela because Maduro \u2013 who he described as an \u201cex-president\u201d \u2013 lacks the legal authority to break off diplomatic relations\u201d. An email sent by the US embassy to its citizens in Venezuela emphasised they \u201care keeping regular hours\u201d and on Thursday morning the street outside the embassy was quiet, with no sign that Venezuelan security forces were preparing to enforce Maduro\u2019s deadline.

Both men call this ground home, of course, and know how crosswinds complement their differing styles. For Holder, coping with the expectation those legendary forebears created has been a way of life. There is a case to say that, even with such broad shoulders, the captaincy came too soon in his career, aged 23, and it hindered his development. Four years on and this has been overcome. He may never be an express \u2013 a bend, rather than brace, of the knee on delivery makes this so \u2013 but the steepling bounce he generates, as well as the proudly upright seam that accounted for Jennings and Root, makes him a rising force. To pinch another line from Rudder, this impressive young captain could well come to represent the sunbeam cutting through a clouded recent past.",

      "bodyText": "Q: Two years ago you were very critical of Trump, but now you\u2019re giving him advice. So you see him as less of a threat, asks AP. George Soros replies that it\u2019s important to distinguish between the Trump administration and Trump himself. It\u2019s certainly true, though, that president Xi was in Soros\u2019s crosshairs through this speech while Trump got off lightly. Q: Whose side are Facebook on in the privacy war? Facebook are on the side of their own profits, Soros replies, to a small smattering of applause. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch now has the microphone, as Soros retakes his seat after delivering a long blast - mainly at China. He agrees that Xi is a danger, saying he presents himself as a strong man but is actually terrified of the Chinese people. If you\u2019re a dictator, the Chinese model looks great, Roth says. Roth is outlining how facial recognition and AI is already harming some Muslims in China. This shows how open societies should take the lead and develop ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence. That doesn\u2019t mean that China will follow, but..... Not having ethics for AI means for sure that China wont do any better. Last year, George Soros was putting the boot into Donald Trump. This year, he\u2019s offering him advice, saying: Instead of waging a trade war with the entire world, US should focus on China. Soros says it would be a mistake to let Chinese mobile operators ZTE and Huawei \u201coff lightly\u201d [referring to concerns that they could allow Beijing access to Western networks]. Soros says: If they dominated the 5G market, they would represent an unacceptable security risk to the rest of the world If Xi and Trump were no longer in power, it could create an opportunity for cooperations between the two cyber superpowers, Soros concludes. \u201cA global shutdown, err slowdown is the last thing anyone wants to see\u201d, says Soros, as he touches on the 90-day trade truce agreed between Washington and Beijing. Shutdowns and slowdowns are both bad news for the economy, of course. And one often leads to the other... Soros reminds his audience (who\u2019ve now polished off the main course and are looking for a passing wine waiter) that the US has declared China a strategic rival in the last year. This is too simplistic, says Soros, adding China is an important global actor. An effective policy towards China can\u2019t be reduced to a slogan. You needs an US economic response to the belt and road initiative, he says. Soros\u2019s Davos speeches usually have one or two villians - this year, president Xi is in the spotlight. Soros is explaining how Xi\u2019s Belt and Road initiative is hitting potholes, with countries such as Malaysia pushing back against the surge of China-backed infrastructure project. The situation in Pakistan is less clear, Soros adds, explaining that China intends to use the Belt and Road initiative for military means as well as economic ones. Soros admits that the number of leaders who support his open society philosophy have thinned out of late -- the EU and US used to be big backers, but domestic changes have undermined that. Some of the events in the last year have surprised me, says 88-year old Soros. He says he president Xi Jinping came into trouble this year when -- the rumours say -- he was taken down a few pegs by senior officials in Beijing. Rumour had it that the communication disapproved of the cult of personality that Xi had built around himself, and his changes to presidential term limits, says Soros. However, he doesn\u2019t expect change at the top adding: Xi remains supreme leader, possibly for his lifetime. Citing his Jewish heritage, George Soros is now explaining how he fled to London to escape the Nazis, ending up working in the financial markets. He then turns to his transformation into a campaigner for open societies through his foundation. I became a successful hedge-fund manager, says Soros, adding that all the money led to \u201ca kind of midlife crisis\u201d which led him to supporting open societies - trying to tackle South Africa\u2019s apartheid system, then Soviet oppression. Soros grins that: I got hooked on what I like to call political philanthropy I did rather well in the Soviet empire, Soros adds. Everyone who prefers to live in an open society should be concerned about the rise of instruments of control, says Soros (to the accompaniment of listeners scoffing their chicken and potatoes). George Soros, the billionaire investor/philantropist, is giving a speech in Davos, at a private dinner. And he\u2019s kicked off with by warning that machine-learning and artificial intelligence are posing an \u201cunprecedented threat\u201d to open societies. Soros says these technologies are now in the hands to totalitarian leaders and oppressive regimes, singling our China\u2019s president Xi. Soros declares: Xi Jinping wants a one-party state to rein supreme.... He is the most dangerous opponent to those who believe in open societies. Soros is singling out China\u2019s social credit system; saying it will use algorithms to see if an individual \u201cposes a threat to the one-party state\u201d The IMF\u2019s David Lipton now warns that America\u2019s central bank might not be able to take extraordinary measures in the next crisis, because the political environment has changed so much since a decade ago. People have been hurt in the last crisis, Lipton says, and they don\u2019t appreciate that we came along and cleaned up afterwards. He fears there will be public anger if the next downturn is worse than a \u201cgarden variety\u201d recession, and the Federal Reserve may be unable or unwilling to underpin the global economy. Ten years ago, the Fed offered huge quantities of dollars to fellow central banks around the world, big and small. Would they be so generous again? Lipton isn\u2019t sure, saying: I wonder if they\u2019ll be politically able, and comfortable, extending swap lines as widely as they did last time. We should be aware that the politics may contribute to the limitation of responsiveness, Lipton says. From a policy standpoint, we need to be more careful to have sustained growth, not make errors, not let squabbles lead to problems, and make sure the next recession is only a garden one. One lesson from the last financial crisis is to impose more responsibility on the sector, Carney says. Going back to \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019, he cited the importance that bond-holders pay the price when a bank falls,not taxpayers. Lots of work done, but it\u2019s not there yet. Second, there was individual responsibility. One of the big issues in the UK was the perception, and the reality, that there were limited consequences for the senior-most people at these banks, says Carney. Now the UK has a senior managers\u2019 regime where it\u2019s clear who is responsible for what in terms of risk management and oversight. Ignorance is not a defence. it will have consequences. If you have people doing the wrong thing and they aren\u2019t being overseen, haven\u2019t been trained, you don\u2019t take remedial action, it will have consequences for your remuneration and your position at the firm. Q: But what about fears that bankers won\u2019t want to be bankers if they could go to jail? It\u2019s a total bluff, Carney shoots back. Most of the risk to bad bankers come from deferred compensation rules that hold back bonuses for seven years, This is...absolutely necessary for the social licence of the industry, and so far there hasn\u2019t been a deterioration in the quality of the bankers. The discussion turns to China, and Mark Carney singles out concerns about the shadow banking sector. He flags up wealth management trusts, which have invested trillions of dollars into bonds and other assets. Chinese authorities are well aware of this, says Carney, and have been taking measures and addressing it. These are substantial proportions of GDP in terms of assets, that don\u2019t have the rock-solid guarantee in terms of the liabilities, that do have exposure...and have some echoes to some of the structures that grew up in the UK and the United States prior to the financial crisis. The question of what goes back on the bank balance sheet, where there are losses. Last summer Beijing stepped up the regulation of these wealth management businesses, fearing that they could undermine financial stability. David Lipton says there is a danger of \u2018fighting the last war\u2019, rather than recognising how risk has moved in the last decade. Mark Carney weighs in with a timely warning about complacency -- warning his audience that financial stability Memories are short in finance, financial lobbies are powerful and success is an orphan in financial stability. The more successful you are, the more people forget, so complacency is an issue. Carney insists that the system is a lot stronger than before the last financial crisis.But he also singles out two concerns: 1) The Too Big To Fail rules brought in after 2008 have not been tested at scale yet. Carney cites new types of bonds that provide capital when a bank hits trouble - giving bondholders \u201cskin in the game\u201d, which are meant to keep people disciplined. (These CoCo bonds haven\u2019t been tested in a banking crisis yet). 2) Carney also cites the operational risk from cybercrime. Again, much work has been done, but there\u2019s still a risk. At some point, some core service or institution might be down for a while. What is the system going to do about it? Cecilia Skingsley warns Davos that the best way to avoid a new financial crisis is to protect the measures brought in since the last one. The Riksbank\u2019s deputy governor says there have been many important reforms -- banks have more capital and bigger liquidity buffers, and special regulations about \u2019too big to fail\u2019. Skingsley: We should be very careful to maintain what we have achieved in these areas. There is already a lot of creativity and energy going in in different ways, to dilute these reforms. She says that these voices will get a lot noisier when the next downturn strikes (because banks will want leeway on these issues) They best way to avoid the next crisis is remember the last one, and protect what we have achieved. Heads-up: We\u2019re about to hear more from Mark Carney. He\u2019s on a heavyweight panel session titled \u2018resetting financial governance\u2019. Not the most exciting title - but\u2019s all about fixing political frameworks to prevent the next financial crisis (or to cope when it happens) Sat with Carney on the panel is David Lipton of the IMF, Adam Tooze of Columbia University, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda, and Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor of Sweden\u2019s Riksbank. Outside the Congress Hall, protesters have been demonstrating against Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. The protest is organised by Juso Schweiz, Switzerland\u2019s Young Socialist Party. They\u2019re alarmed by Bolsonaro\u2019s plans to allow more economic development in the Amazon rain forest.. The introduction of GDPR privacy regulations last year caused some pain for companies...but Microsoft\u2019s chief is a big fan. Speaking earlier today, Satya Nadella argued that US citizens deserved the same protection for data misuse as Europeans. Nadella argued: \u201cMy own point of view is that it\u2019s a fantastic start in treating privacy as a human right. I hope that in the United States we do something similar, and that the world converges on a common standard.\u201d Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish climate change activist, is bringing her school strike campaign to Davos. Thunberg will join local school children for a walkout on Friday, to highlight the need to urgently rein in global emissions and stick to the Paris Agreement. Riding down Davos\u2019s funicular railway, she tells me \u201cWe need to hold the older generations accountable for the mess they have created, and expect us to live with. It is not fair that we have to pay for what they have caused.\u201d Thunberg\u2019s solo protest outside Sweden\u2019s parliament last summer began when she skipped school for three weeks, later cutting back to just every Friday. The move is now gathering support, with students walking out in other countries, and plans for a UK version on February 15. Thunberg said she would like more students to join her strike. \u201cThat would have a huge impact, but I\u2019m not going to force anyone to do this.\u201d She believes parents should be supportive if their children tell them they\u2019re striking on Friday. \u201cEveryone keeps saying that the young people should be more active, and they\u2019re so lazy, but once we do something we get criticised.\u201d She\u2019s also spoken to some big Davos names at a private lunch: The latest US jobs data published earlier showed no sign of a slowdown. Weekly jobless claims fell by 13,000 in the week to 19 January, to 199,000 which was the lowest since mid-November 1969 according to the Labor Department. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting 220,000 claims. AM David Solomon, chief executive of Goldman Sachs is in Davos and has been speaking to Bloomberg TV. He economists at the US investment bank believe there is a 50% chance of a US recession in 2020: I think the US economy is in good shape. There is a possibility that as we get to the end of 2020 we see a slowdown, but it\u2019s just as possible that growth will continue. When you think about recessions ... there\u2019s nothing obvious that stands out as, \u2018hey that\u2019s a big problem\u2019, right now. But we\u2019re always looking out for imbalances and we\u2019ll see how things progress. AM More from the CBI\u2019s annual lunch in Davos, where the UK chancellor Philip Hammond said Britain was strongly supporting the OECD\u2019s attempt to find an internationally-agreed way of taxing digital companies. Matt Brittin, head of European operations for Google said: We have called for international tax reform because although we pay our tax everywhere there are now countries that want to see tax paid locally rather than the majority paid in the US as current rules dictate. The UK\u2019s push for international reform would help us and other international businesses to be seen to be paying our way. Mario Draghi is holding a press conference following the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision. He says the risks to eurozone growth are now to the downside, largely because of the rise in protectionist policies and financial market volatility. AM European shares have been given a bit of a boost after reassurance from the European Central Bank that it is not planning to hike interest rates any time soon. Most key markets had already reversed earlier losses but the gains have strengthened. The FTSE 100 is the exception, currently down 23 points. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 6,819 Germany\u2019s DAX:+0.4% at 11,118 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 4,875 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 19,551 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 9,185 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 356 AM Philip Hammond has come out strongly against a second referendum. Speaking at the CBI\u2019s annual lunch in Davos the chancellor says it is important for trust in the political system for the 2016 vote to be respected. Even from the narrowest interpretation of business interests it would be a Pyrrhic victory to meet the needs of the economy but by shattering the broad economic consensus behind our country\u2019s political and economic system. Switching briefly to Frankfurt, the European Central Bank has just published its latest policy decision and has left rates unchanged, as expected. Policymakers on the governing council reiterated the message that a hike was unlikely unless until at least after the summer. At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Read the ECB\u2019s statement in full here. AM A spokeswoman for the Treasury says the chancellor Philip Hammond pulled out of the Davos panel on Europe because his schedule is so packed after Theresa May decided not to make the trip to focus on Brexit. After stepping in for the Prime Minister at Davos, the chancellor has committed to more than 20 meetings in 48 hours with a wide range of stakeholders. He has accommodated as many speaking requests as possible in the short time available. AM Carney was asked whether firms are ready for a hard Brexit: Meanwhile Kalyeena Makortoff, the Guardian\u2019s banking correspondent, has been attending a Davos session featuring Bank of England governor Mark Carney and the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde. The subject was \u2018shaping the future of finance\u2019 but they seem to have veered off-topic: So Philip Hammond, UK chancellor, pulled out of the panel session on Europe this morning but it\u2019s not entirely clear why... It did mean however that the rest of the panel could focus on the future of the EU, without discussing Brexit once. Q: What should be the next concrete steps to recreate the necessary trust in Europe? Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar: Over the next 5-10 years we need to move it from being just an economic power and trading bloc into a group of nations that is politically influential. The US is moving away from that role, China is getting bigger. Europe needs to have a common foreign policy and act as a force for good in the world on a number of key issues. Cecilia Malmstrom, EU trade commissioner: Europe is so many things. We see a rise of populist movements as the European parliamentary elections approach. It\u2019s a great time to show the pro-European leadership we need. Mark Rutte, Dutch PM: You have to stick to the rules and keep to your promises. If we do we could make much faster progress (he\u2019s really got it in for Italy today.) And with that, the panel ends. AM Back at the Arctic Basecamp, Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish climate change activist, tells delegates she spent last night in a tent at minus 18 degrees celsius. Greta explains that she couldn\u2019t turn down the invitation to Davos - for one thing, it\u2019s an adventure. Most people came here in private jets, and stay in hotels, but I came on a 20-hour train journey and slept in a tent, she says. But it\u2019s also a valuable opportunity to push her campaign, which began when she went on strike from school because Sweden\u2019s government wasn\u2019t doing enough on climate change. Her message for Davos leaders: I want to tell them that if we do not care about the climate crisis then no other issue will matter in the future. This is what shapes the future. Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar says the best way to address tax loopholes is through the OECD. He says the best way to address the digital tax is to tax where the value - and not turnover - is created. Mark Rutte of the Netherlands returns to the subject of Italy and it\u2019s spending plans. He says the Netherlands now has a budget surplus because the economy is growing and because it is the correct thing to do, even if larger European economies are not playing by the rules. Ana Botin, chair of Santander, says Spain has had by far the biggest flow of immigrants than any other country. (That comment is directed at Dutch PM Mark Rutte who spoke earlier about a north/south divide in the EU.) She says Europe needs to \u201cpunch its weight\u201d when it comes to trade, amid a China/US trade war. \u201cScale matters,\u201d she says, urging leaders to focus on a single market for services. We desperately need a European banking union, Botin says. 90% of financing come from banks in Europe, in the US it\u2019s 50%. On regulatory reform and a banking union: We are famously known in the world for being slow in Europe. But we\u2019re also trying to do the right thing. Let\u2019s prove everybody wrong and do the right thing, but a little bit faster. China, the US and the EU are all major contributors to global emissions.... and Professor Gail Whiteman of Lancaster University points out that companies also have responsibility. Look at the holdings of asset manager BlackRock, she says. Its passive holdings are melting sea ice the size of Shanghai each year she adds. Up in the mountains of Davos, a group of climate change scientists are updating delegates. Dr Jeremy Wilkinson of the British Antarctic Survey, warns that the world is losing polar ice at a We have lost half the sea ice since the 1970s, and we know that by the middle of the century we\u2019ll lose the sea ice in the Arctic in the summer, he says, unless countries stick to the Paris Agreement on global temperatures. Cecilia Malmstrom, EU trade commissioner, says that on her travels the key issue that young people raise is no longer migration but climate change. The Polish PM Morawiecki says a key focus has been addressing inequality, and that it\u2019s heading in the right direction in Poland. Eliminating all tax havens from the EU would help bring about a level playing field. Q: What reforms are necessary? Dutch PM Mark Rutte: Trump is an opportunity.. to make use of his criticism of multilateralism and reform areas that need it. There is an east/west divide in the EU on the refugee crisis. This needs to be addressed. And north and south divides too. The commission not acting on Italy and it\u2019s budget plans has notified the northern countries that while we\u2019re playing by the rules, others are not. If Italy is getting away with it, why should we get our own house in order, I\u2019m asked. It is creating a divide and mistrust. Klaus Schwab asks: what would you tell young people today about the value of European identity? Dutch PM Mark Rutte: Three words: prosperity, collective safety and values. Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar: Europe works and as a result we\u2019ve had 70 years of peace and prosperity. We need to stick together. EU commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom: The one word is \u201ctogether\u201d. We can only save the planet and make things better if we work together. Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland\u2019s PM says it\u2019s all about diversity. We can build on this in the decades to come. \u201cAnother one would be empowerment of people.\u201d AM Klaus Schwab is introducing the panel... Coming up shortly is a panel on \u201cthe new impetus for Europe\u201d. Philip Hammond was showing on the list of speakers this morning, but has since vanished... The panel includes: Cecilia Malmstrom, EU trade commissioner Ana Botin, chair of Santander Klaus Schwab, WEF founder and chair Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach of Ireland Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mateusz Morawiecki, Prime Minister of Poland AM Angel Gurria, head of the the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, says he is confident that by next year a way will have been found to ensure the world\u2019s tech giants pay more tax. Countries can no longer politically afford to have these huge companies making billions in profits and paying next to nothing in tax. Speaking to the Guardian, Gurria said that finding a way to tax the digital economy was the final stage in the OECD\u2019s programme for tackling evasion and avoidance. By 2020 there would be a \u201croad map\u201d and an implementation plan for countries to adopt. Gurria said a world in which big multi-national tech companies paid only a tiny amount of tax was no longer feasible. Countries need the money and it has become politically unacceptable following the financial crisis. Even the tech companies understand that the time has come when they have to be part of the solution because otherwise countries will have to slam their face on the table and take non-negotiated decisions. The OECD secretary general said there were a number of possible ways forward but the eventual plan would mean that companies would \u201cbe caught no matter what\u201d. Companies, he said, were able to exploit a lack of rules to avoid paying tax. \u201cCountries have made it legal for companies to do tax gymnastics. What they are doing would be illegal for individuals. What we are aiming for is a system that ensures there is no further abuse of what is legal but perhaps not right. Sticking with Brexit for a moment, Airbus boss Tom Enders has launched a stinging attack on the UK government\u2019s handling of the process, declaring it a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. The European aerospace group is one of the biggest manufacturers in the UK, where it employs more than 14,000 people at 25 sites. A further 110,000 supply chain jobs depend on its operations. The wings for all Airbus\u2019 commercial aircraft are currently made in Broughton in north Wales, where 6,000 people work. In a video message published this morning, Enders says: Please don\u2019t listen to the Brexiteers\u2019 madness which asserts that because have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong. Of course it\u2019s not possible to pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately. However, aerospace is a long-term business and we could be forced to redirect future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit and make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft. Read our full story here: The former UK prime minister Tony Blair is in Davos and says the only way to resolve the current Brexit impasse is to go back to the British people with a second referendum. It\u2019s obviously a complete mess. There\u2019s gridlock in parliament, we\u2019ve had 30 months of negotiation. It\u2019s still not clear really what the future relationship between Britain and Europe would be under what\u2019s been agreed so far, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a majority in parliament right now for any proposition. I hope as people go through the different options they will finally realise there is only one way of resolving this and that\u2019s to put it back to the people for a final decision. AM Away from Davos briefly to the markets, which are pretty subdued across Europe this morning. Wall Street closed higher on Wednesday after some upbeat corporate results in the US, but traders on the other side of the Atlantic today are in cautious mood as they await the latest policy decision from the European Central Bank, due at lunch time. The scores in Europe so far: FTSE 100: -0.3% at 6,821 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 11,054 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 4,834 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 19,505 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 9,157 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.03% at 355 Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, sums up the mood on global markets: Upbeat quarterly results from big names on Wall Street saw all three major US indices close higher. However, gains were capped by continued concerns over slowing global growth and the still unresolved trade issues. The mixed sentiment resulted in a subdued session in Asia. Europe is also pointing to a lacklustre start to trading as investors look ahead to the ECB rate announcement and a possible end to the US government shutdown. AM Hancock says the second area of focus, after prevention, will be innovation. He says there has been a major lack of development of new antibiotics in recent years. No new innovation in the basic bedrock of every health service in the world which is shocking and deeply troubling. He says the focus has been on expensive new cancer and heart drugs for instance, limiting the time and money spent on new antibiotics. Thirdly, the government will focus on collaboration. As well as working with doctors and vets, Hancock said the pharmaceutical industry will also be expected to take more responsibility for antibiotic resistance. NICE and NHS England will explore a new payment model that pays pharmaceutical companies based on how valuable their medicines are to the NHS, rather than on the quantity of antibiotics sold. AM The health secretary says the UK will be looking for advice from the livestock industry, which has successfully reduced the use of antibiotics. Chicken farmers, for example, have reduced use of antibiotics by 71%, while increasing productivity by 11% at the same time. Doctors, vets farmers and patients will all be included in the discussions. Matt Hancock says he couldn\u2019t look his children in the eye unless he was doing all he could to act on mounting resistance to antibiotics. Britian\u2019s health secretary is speaking in Davos to launch a five year plan of action. \u201cThe urgency is now,\u201d he says. The focus will be on three areas: prevention, innovation and collaboration. Prevention: The aim is to reduce resistant infections by 10%, and to cut the use of antibiotics by 15% - taking them only when absolutely necessary. Everyone can play a part by only using antibiotics when they are really needed. AM Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, broke the news in Davos... AM Up in the mountains around Davos, climate change scientists at the Arctic basecamp will today urge world leaders to do more to rein in carbon emissions. They\u2019re holding a session with musician and environmental campaigner Ellie Goulding, along with former executive secretary of the UNFCCC and Mission 2020 convenor Christiana Figueres, and 16-year old climate activist Greta Thunberg. They say: Despite significant progress in the low carbon economy, scientific evidence in 2018 showed that emissions are again rising, and the sustainable target is 1.5C, not 2C as previously thought. Furthermore, disappointing outcomes from the COP24 in Katowice did not raise ambitions to a level that will save the planet. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the third day of the World Economic Forum. \u201cBrexit is like Groundhog Day without the happy ending,\u201d bemoaned one senior UK economist last night, as anxiety over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU continue to rattle Davos. Chancellor Philip Hammond is in town, and understood to be breakfasting with around 30 business leaders this morning. He\u2019s then speaking at the CBI\u2019s traditional lunch, where he can expect a rough ride from chief executives who are watching the clock tick down to 29 March with growing exasperation and alarm. So what\u2019s UK PLC\u2019s message to Hammond? \u201cJust sort it\u201d, says one City figure, who fears a six month extension would just mean six months more uncertainty and deadlock. It\u2019s not all work, of course - top bankers such as UBS\u2019s Axel Weber rubbed shoulders with trade secretary Liam Fox and former Brexit secretary David Davis at a whisky tasting last night, organised by Aberdeen Standard. But as a bagpiper played a dirge outside, City figures said they\u2019re no more reassured about Brexit than at the start of the week. They\u2019re looking to Hammond to push back against cabinet ministers who lean towards a no-deal Brexit. Hammond is also due to appear on a panel at WEF this morning, to discuss Europe. He\u2019ll be accompanied by EC trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, Santander chair Ana Bot\u00edn, Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach of Ireland, Dutch PM Mark Rutte, and Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Poland. Health minister Matt Hancock is announcing a new programme to fight antimicrobial resistance. Last night, he told me that the issue was crucial: \u201cAntimicrobial resistance, if we don\u2019t get ahead of it, will mean that antibiotics can\u2019t work, and the consequences would be devastating for the world. If these antibiotics cease to work - as they\u2019re starting to cease to work - we won\u2019t be able to live modern life as we know it.\u201d Bank of England governor Mark Carney is also making an appearance, to discuss whether the global financial architecture needs to change. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on the agenda 8.10am GMT / 9.10am Davos time: UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock launches a five-year plan to tackle the global threat of antimicrobial resistance 8.30am GMT / 9:30am Davos time: A session with Sir Martin Sorrell, Executive Chairman of S4 Capital plc 9.45am GMT / 10.45am Davos time: Panel session on \u201cthe new impetus for Europe\u201d, with Philip Hammond, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, Ana Bot\u00edn, Leo Varadkar, Mark Rutte, and Mateusz Morawiecki 10am GMT / 11am Davos Time: Panel on \u2018shaping the future of finance\u2019 with Mark Carney and Christine Lagarde 10.30am GMT / 11.30am Davos time: Special Address by Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations Lunchtime: Hammond speaks at the CBI\u2019s annual lunch 2.30pm GMT / 3.30pm Davos time: Creating a fair and balanced tax system, with OECD chief Angel Gurria and Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe. Finally, tonight, billionaire George Soros will be holding a dinner, and holding forth on the state of the world.",

The defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, accused the Venezuelan opposition led by Juan Guaid\u00f3, the United States and regional allies such as Brazil of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/enezuela-trump-president-juan-guaido-maduro-recognition-news-latest\">launching an attempted coup against Maduro</a> that risked bringing \u201cchaos and anarchy\u201d to the country. Donald Trump has warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d for a US response if the Maduro government seeks to hold on to power by force. Guardian commentator Simon Tisdall warns that Trump\u2019s threats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/24/donald-trump-venezuela-nicolas-maduro\">could spark a disastrous conflict</a>.</p> <p><strong>Parts of Australia face another day of searing heat</strong>, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/24/australia-heatwave-adelaide-breaks-its-all-time-heat-record-hitting-466c\">South Australia broke a succession of temperature records on Thursday</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 25 January. Top stories Key allies of Venezuela\u2019s embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, led by Russia and China, have warned the US not to intervene in support of the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s attempt to lead the country. The defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, accused the Venezuelan opposition led by Juan Guaid\u00f3, the United States and regional allies such as Brazil of launching an attempted coup against Maduro that risked bringing \u201cchaos and anarchy\u201d to the country. Donald Trump has warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d for a US response if the Maduro government seeks to hold on to power by force. Guardian commentator Simon Tisdall warns that Trump\u2019s threats could spark a disastrous conflict. Parts of Australia face another day of searing heat, after South Australia broke a succession of temperature records on Thursday. Attention will move to Victoria on Friday, where temperatures of up to 44C are expected in Melbourne, and 46C in Mildura, Swan Hill and Echuca, again testing long-standing records. In Tasmania, Hobart was expecting 37C as emergency services warned that firefighters tackling numerous bushfires around the capital faced unprecedented conditions. Fifa has urged Thailand\u2019s government to immediately release Hakeem al-Araibi, the Bahraini footballer who is an Australian permanent resident and who has been held in a Bangkok prison for nearly two months amid fears he will be tortured and possibly killed if he is sent back to his home country. In a letter to Prayut Chan-o-cha, the prime minister of Thailand, Fifa warned that Araibi was \u201cat serious risk of mistreatment in his home country\u201d and urged his return to Australia. Speaking to the Guardian earlier this week Hakeem said he was \u201cterrified\u201d and losing hope. World The European court of human rights has ordered Italy to pay damages to Amanda Knox for police failures to provide her access to a lawyer and a translator during questioning over the 2007 killing of her British flatmate Meredith Kercher. The ruling opens the way for Knox\u2019s lawyers to challenge her last remaining conviction, for malicious accusation, in the Italian courts. Alex Salmond, Scotland\u2019s former first minister, has been charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and two of attempted rape. The 64-year-old has denied all 14 charges. The Food and Drug Administration is sacrificing American lives by continuing to approve new high-strength opioid painkillers, and manipulating the process in favour of big pharma, according to the chair of the agency\u2019s own opioid advisory committee. Dr Raeford Brown told the Guardian there is \u201ca war\u201d within the FDA as officials in charge of opioid policy have \u201cfailed to learn the lessons\u201d of the epidemic that claims 150 American lives every day. The climate crisis is intensifying a new military buildup in the Arctic, as regional powers attempt to secure northern borders that were until recently reinforced by ice. That so-called unpaid sentry is now melting away, opening up shipping lanes and geo-security challenges, delegates said at this week\u2019s Arctic Frontiers conference. A plague of white rats has descended on an Italian village, prompting authorities to set up a special taskforce to eradicate the invasion. Locals have nicknamed the newcomers \u201ccrazy white rats\u201d because of their strange behaviour. They have reportedly been jumping in front of cars and killing one another. Opinion and analysis The campaign to change the date of Australia Day has been mounting, but the demand for a new date when a \u201cunited\u201d Australia could be celebrated is as misguided as Scott Morrison\u2019s insistence that 26 January does just that, writes Paul Daley. The date cannot be changed until Australia deals with the unfinished business of Aboriginal sovereignty. Until then there will be no appropriate date to celebrate a supposedly unified nation. \u201cI\u2019m confident that 26 January will be junked as Australia Day, but I\u2019m less assured, and sadly so, that I\u2019ll witness that reckoning.\u201d Earlier this week an opinion piece in the Guardian asked where \u201cGeorge Clooney and co\u201d were in confronting a new and brutal crisis unfolding in Sudan.

Nadal brutally ended the 20-year-old\u2019s run with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 victory and will play Novak Djokovic or Lucas Pouille in the final. Australia are already halfway to eclipsing Sri Lanka\u2019s first-innings score, after the hosts\u2019 bowlers produced their best start to a Test in almost two years at the Gabba. Debutant Jhye Richardson tore through Sri Lanka\u2019s top order and Pat Cummins took four wickets to roll the visitors for 144 before Marcus Harris (40 not out) helped Australia to stumps at 72-2.

In addition to using more natural gas, the US could eventually stop making gains in phasing out coal. Declines in coal use could stabilize, leaving the most competitive plants online and able to run more. The amount of coal mined in America is also likely to decrease through 2035 and then hold steady. Industry energy use and emissions are projected to surge, while transportation\u2019s carbon footprint could decline. Colette Honorable, a former member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and senior fellow with the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the numbers tell a positive story. \u201cWe are absolutely moving in the right direction,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe absolutely have more work to do\u201d. The growth in oil and gas drilling is not necessarily a result of Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to open up new areas to production, according to the report. Government analysts said they still see most of the increase happening in the Permian Basin, which is in west Texas and south-eastern New Mexico. They don\u2019t yet expect major changes from bids to open up drilling offshore on the east coast or in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. EIA only includes finalized policies in its assessments, meaning it did not consider a range of Trump proposals meant to bolster oil and gas and coal.",

Biden noted that he must have attended 30 or more US Conferences of Mayors and name-checked some of the mayors he spotted in the audience. He reminisced about his two terms working with \u201cBarack\u201d and said: \u201cWe were like brothers.\u201d</p> \n<p>And there is a significant issue where Biden may be in tune with young voters. Climate change, which barely figured in the 2016 election, is likely to loom much larger next time. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and progressive groups are pushing hard for a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to combat it. Biden did not delve into such policy specifics but devoted a big chunk of his half-hour speech to the crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe threat posed by climate change is existential. You know, the first meeting we had in what we called \u2018the tank\u2019 over in the Pentagon, Barack and I, as new president and vice-president getting briefed, you know what the military said our greatest security threat is? Global warming. The military. The military! Simple reason: sea levels rise a half a foot or a foot, you have tens of millions of people migrating. That\u2019s how wars start. That\u2019s how Darfur started. It matters.\u201d</p> \n<p>He condemned the White House for withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. \u201cThe administration has walked away but there is no reason we can\u2019t pull us back on the path,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that help is on the way. This position cannot be sustained, but you are the key to keeping it from sliding back.\u201d</p> \n<p>But his biggest asset, and biggest liability in this hyperpartisan era, is likely to be his history of working across the aisle. The late Republican senator John McCain, for example, was a close friend. Biden said: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve divided the country into pieces. How can we be one America if we continue down this road?

Jim Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Indiana, said: \u201cHe strikes a balance of practicality and hope. He\u2019s a middle-of-the-road guy. That\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p> \n<p>But middle of the road may prove at odds with an election predicted to be about which side can turn out its \u201cbase\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/us/politics/biden-speech-fred-upton.html\">The New York Times reported this week</a> that Biden was paid $200,000 to give a speech in which he praised Republican congressman Fred Upton of Michigan as \u201cone of the finest guys I\u2019ve ever worked with\u201d. The paper added: \u201cThe local Democratic party pleaded with Mr Biden to repair what it saw as a damaging error, to no avail.\u201d</p> \n<p>Should he run and win, Biden would break Trump\u2019s record as the oldest person ever elected US president. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/14/politics/cnn-poll-2020-democrats-beto-orourke-rising/index.html\">Last month a CNN poll</a> put him at the top of the list when the potential Democratic electorate is asked who they would be most likely to support for the nomination, with 30% saying they would back him. Critics say such polls merely reflect name recognition that is likely to crumble as other candidates gain prominence.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jan/18/is-there-a-democrat-who-can-oust-donald-trump-today-in-focus-podcast\">Is there a Democrat who can oust Donald Trump?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many have already been working to distance themselves from past positions and statements now out of step with the party. Biden, who entered the Senate in 1973, has more than most. He sought to address a key weakness earlier this week by expressing regret about his support for a 1994 crime bill that contributed to the mass incarceration of African Americans. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/18/18143882/joe-biden-2020-economic-policy\">He has also moved left</a> on issues such as university access and the minimum wage.</p> \n<p>But for now, as candidates declare almost daily, Biden remains in a holding pattern. His allies have reportedly been sending supporters a memo making the case for a campaign. The memo hails Biden\u2019s long track record in politics and argues that at a time of \u201cunprecedented political chaos\u201d during Trump\u2019s administration, he would offer \u201ctrustworthy, compassionate leadership\u201d.</p> \n<p>At Thursday\u2019s conference, when asked if he got the impression he had just been watching someone who intends to run for president, Brainard replied simply: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>",

Biden did not delve into such policy specifics but devoted a big chunk of his half-hour speech to the crisis. \u201cThe threat posed by climate change is existential. You know, the first meeting we had in what we called \u2018the tank\u2019 over in the Pentagon, Barack and I, as new president and vice-president getting briefed, you know what the military said our greatest security threat is? Global warming. The military. The military! Simple reason: sea levels rise a half a foot or a foot, you have tens of millions of people migrating. That\u2019s how wars start. That\u2019s how Darfur started. It matters.\u201d He condemned the White House for withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. \u201cThe administration has walked away but there is no reason we can\u2019t pull us back on the path,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that help is on the way. This position cannot be sustained, but you are the key to keeping it from sliding back.\u201d But his biggest asset, and biggest liability in this hyperpartisan era, is likely to be his history of working across the aisle. The late Republican senator John McCain, for example, was a close friend. Biden said: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve divided the country into pieces. How can we be one America if we continue down this road? I don\u2019t care what your party affiliation is.\u201d The speech received a standing ovation from Democratic and Republican mayors alike. Jim Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Indiana, said: \u201cHe strikes a balance of practicality and hope. He\u2019s a middle-of-the-road guy. That\u2019s what we need.\u201d But middle of the road may prove at odds with an election predicted to be about which side can turn out its \u201cbase\u201d. The New York Times reported this week that Biden was paid $200,000 to give a speech in which he praised Republican congressman Fred Upton of Michigan as \u201cone of the finest guys I\u2019ve ever worked with\u201d. The paper added: \u201cThe local Democratic party pleaded with Mr Biden to repair what it saw as a damaging error, to no avail.\u201d Should he run and win, Biden would break Trump\u2019s record as the oldest person ever elected US president. Last month a CNN poll put him at the top of the list when the potential Democratic electorate is asked who they would be most likely to support for the nomination, with 30% saying they would back him. Critics say such polls merely reflect name recognition that is likely to crumble as other candidates gain prominence. Many have already been working to distance themselves from past positions and statements now out of step with the party. Biden, who entered the Senate in 1973, has more than most. He sought to address a key weakness earlier this week by expressing regret about his support for a 1994 crime bill that contributed to the mass incarceration of African Americans. He has also moved left on issues such as university access and the minimum wage. But for now, as candidates declare almost daily, Biden remains in a holding pattern. His allies have reportedly been sending supporters a memo making the case for a campaign. The memo hails Biden\u2019s long track record in politics and argues that at a time of \u201cunprecedented political chaos\u201d during Trump\u2019s administration, he would offer \u201ctrustworthy, compassionate leadership\u201d. At Thursday\u2019s conference, when asked if he got the impression he had just been watching someone who intends to run for president, Brainard replied simply: \u201cYes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "New parents returning to work could receive greater protection from redundancy under government proposals. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) will launch a consultation on Friday which will look at extending the legal protection against redundancy for pregnant and new mothers so it continues for up to six months after they return to work. It will also consult on affording the same protections to parents returning from adoption leave or shared parental leave. The Equality Act of 2010 currently sets out a \u201cprotected period\u201d during which women who are pregnant or have recently given birth are explicitly protected from discrimination. The period runs from the start of a pregnancy until the woman returns to work after maternity leave, or two weeks after the end of the pregnancy if she is not entitled to maternity leave. There are currently no such protections for parents adopting children, or those taking shared parental leave. Research commissioned by BEIS in collaboration with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in 2016 found that one in nine women had been fired or made redundant when they returned to work after having a child, or were treated so badly they felt forced out of their job. Theresa May said: \u201cPeople in this country already benefit from some of the most rigorous workplace standards in the world, including parental leave and pay entitlements, but we are determined to do even more as we leave the EU.\u201d The prime minister added: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that too many parents still encounter difficulties when returning to work.

Joeli Brearley, founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, which works against maternity or pregnancy discrimination, described the proposals as \u201cjust papering over the cracks\u201d. She said that having a \u201cprotected period\u201d seemed to have little effect and pointed to the EHRC research which showed that 1% of women were made redundant while pregnant, 3% while on maternity leave and 2% on their return from maternity leave. \u201cMore mothers are made redundant when the enhanced protections exist than when they don\u2019t \u2013 proving that the enhanced protections which are already in place are not working, so what is the point of extending them?\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the law \u2013 the law is very clear.

      "bodyText": "Key allies of Venezuela\u2019s embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, led by Russia and China, have warned the US not to intervene in support of the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s attempt to lead the country. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with Maduro and offered him strong support in a political crisis he said had been \u201cprovoked from abroad\u201d, a Kremlin statement said. \u201cDestructive interference from abroad blatantly violates basic norms of international law,\u201d Putin was quoted as saying. The Kremlin press release did not mention the US by name but matched earlier rhetoric by other senior Russian officials targeted at Washington. Russia\u2019s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, described the US support for Guaid\u00f3 as a \u201cquasi-coup\u201d and accused the US of hypocrisy, asking rhetorically how Americans would react if the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, declared herself president. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said a US military intervention in Venezuela would be catastrophic. Russia is an important source of financial support to the Venezuelan government, providing billions of dollars in loans, some as pre-payment for future deliveries of oil. Last month Russia dispatched two nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to the country in a further show of support. Russia has said it is ready to facilitate talks among political forces in Venezuela. \u201cWe will stand, if you\u2019d like, together with this country in defence of sovereignty, in defence of the inadmissibility of encroaching on the principle of nonintervention in internal affairs,\u201d Ryabkov said. Franz Klintsevich, a Russian senator and retired colonel, said Moscow could wind up its military cooperation with Venezuela if Maduro, who he said was the legitimately elected president, was ousted. Other MPs criticised US actions. \u201cThe US is trying to carry out an operation to organise the next \u2018colour revolution\u2019 in Venezuela,\u201d said Andrei Klimov, the deputy chair of the foreign affairs committee of the upper house of parliament, using a term for the popular uprisings that unseated leaders in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. China said it supported the Venezuelan government\u2019s efforts in preserving the country\u2019s sovereignty, independence and stability. \u201cI want to emphasise that outside sanctions or interference usually make the situation more complicated and are not helpful to resolving the actual problems,\u201d a foreign affairs spokeswoman said. Venezuela has been one of Beijing\u2019s closest allies in Latin America, and the largest recipient of Chinese financing, taking as much as \u00a338bn in loans by 2017. China is Venezuela\u2019s largest creditor, prompting concerns that as Venezuela\u2019s economy spirals, state assets could fall into Chinese hands, as was the case with Sri Lanka\u2019s Hambantota port. It is in Beijing\u2019s interest to support Maduro, given that a new government could refuse to honour Venezuela\u2019s debt obligations to China. Maduro met China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, last year and toured Mao Zedong\u2019s mausoleum in Beijing, and the countries agreed on \u00a33.8bn in loans and more than 20 bilateral agreements. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, phoned Maduro to offer his support on Thursday, later telling a press conference he was shocked that the US had backed Guaid\u00f3. \u201cYou will respect the results of elections. Trump\u2019s remarks shocked me, as someone who believes in democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cI called Maduro on the way back from Russia. I told [him] very clearly: \u2018Never allow anti-democratic developments. Stand tall,\u2019\u201d he said. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister issued a warning about Guaid\u00f3\u2019s declaration. \u201cThere is an elected president and another person declares himself president, and some countries recognise this. This may cause chaos,\u201d Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu told the A Haber news channel. \u201cWe are against the isolation of countries. I hope the situation will be solved peacefully.\u201d Mexico, part of the 14-member Lima Group, departed from the regional bloc\u2019s call for democratic transition and said it would stick to its \u201cconstitutional principles of non-intervention\u201d. It joined Uruguay, the only other prominent Latin American country still recognising Maduro, in calling for additional talks between the government and opposition to find a peaceful solution. Previous talks brokered by the Vatican on the Venezuelan situation broke down. Mexico had previously criticised Venezuela but its new president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has returned the country to its traditional foreign policy of not weighing in on the internal affairs of other countries and expecting the same silence in return. Iran denounced events in Venezuela, saying the opposition\u2019s claim there that it held the presidency was a \u201ccoup\u201d and an attempt to take power unlawfully. The foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said: \u201cIslamic Republic of Iran supports the government and people of Venezuela against any sort of foreign intervention and any illegitimate and illegal action such as attempt to make a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d Cuba expressed its support for Maduro, with the state newspaper Granma saying that by recognising Guaid\u00f3 as interim president, Donald Trump was \u201cdirecting a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d. Cuba is hugely dependent on Venezuelan petroleum paid for with doctors. The UK broke European ranks on Thursday and sided with the US. \u201cThis regime has done untold damage to the people of Venezuela, 10% of the population have left Venezuela such is the misery they are suffering,\u201d the foreign secretary Jeremy Huny said in a statement issued in Washington. \u201cSo the United Kingdom believes Juan Guaid\u00f3 is the right person to take Venezuela forward. We are supporting the US, Canada, Brazil and Argentina to make that happen.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said talks in Venezuela were needed to avoid the political crisis spiralling out of control. \u201cWhat we hope is that dialogue can be possible, and that we avoid an escalation that would lead to the kind of conflict that would be a disaster for the people of Venezuela and for the region,\u201d he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cSovereign governments have the possibility to decide whatever they want. What we are worried [about] with the situation in Venezuela is the suffering of the people of Venezuela.\u201d Maduro has presided over a deepening economic crisis that has left millions of people in poverty as the oil-rich country faces shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicine. An estimated 2.3 million people have fled the country since 2015, according to the UN, and the International Monetary Fund says inflation will hit 10 million per cent this year.",

In the autumn of 2014, James\u2019s treatment changed. He was taken off lithium because of concerns that it was harming his kidneys, and his mental health worsened. On 30 January 2015, James was involved in a minor car accident and the police were called. It was clear he was unwell and he was detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act, which allows police to remove a person from a public area.

Asked if it was more likely than not that the manner and/or position of restraint caused or more than minimally contributed to his death, the jury answered: \u201cYes.\u201d It added: \u201cDue to excessive length of time in the prone position and Mr James\u2019s size, this resulted in his death.\u201d The jury was also asked: \u201cIs it more likely than not that the failure to carry out a mental health assessment caused or more than minimally contributed to Meirion\u2019s death?\u201d It replied: \u201cYes.\u201d Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, said: \u201cThere were many missed opportunities to safeguard the life of a man in mental health crisis. All the police officers knew about the risks of restraint and positional asphyxia and yet they continued to restrain Meirion in the prone position for an excessive length of time, resulting in his death. \u201cThis case calls into question either the quality of the training or the officers\u2019 adherence to it. That a man can die in this way despite repeated recommendations arising from previous deaths is utterly shameful.\u201d The Independent Office for Police Conduct looked at the case and concluded that two officers had a case to answer for misconduct. They were given \u201cmanagement action\u201d by the force. Vicki Evans, assistant chief constable of Dyfed-Powys police, said: \u201cMr James died in tragic circumstances and I cannot begin to comprehend the distress and grief this has caused for his family. \u201cEnsuring the public are safe is a priority for our officers and staff and we deeply regret it when anyone comes to harm during or following police contact. \u201cImmediately after the incident, we referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, now the IOPC. We fully cooperated with their investigation and their recommendations have been actioned. \u201cImprovements have been made in the four years since Mr James\u2019s death, both in Dyfed-Powys police and nationally, in the way that police support people who are suffering from a mental health illness.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, has insisted he was \u201cgenuinely hurt and distressed\u201d by an article in the Sun that claimed a heavy metal band he performed with used Nazi imagery, as part of his continuing libel case against the newspaper. Burgon gave evidence for a second day at the high court, arguing that the piece entitled \u201cReich and Roll: Labour\u2019s justice boss ridiculed after he joins a heavy metal band that delights in Nazi symbols\u201d was \u201chighly defamatory, false and unfair\u201d. He had previously told the court that an image tweeted by the Leeds heavy metal band Dream Tr\u00f6ll, which the Sun alleges used the \u201cS\u201d from the logo of the Nazi paramilitary organisation the SS, was in reality a spoof of Black Sabbath\u2019s 1975 album We Sold Our Soul For Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll. Burgon repeatedly insisted that he would not appear on a stage that featured Nazi iconography. The Sun\u2019s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, argued that the image was \u201cstrongly reminiscent of Nazi iconography\u201d and that Burgon \u201cdemonstrated terrible misjudgment and exposed himself to ridicule\u201d by appearing with the Leeds group, especially in the light of claims of antisemitism within the Labour party. Continuing his evidence at the high court in London on Thursday, Burgon said he was \u201cvery distressed\u201d about the publication of the article, which his lawyers said involved a \u201cdeliberate misrepresentation\u201d for political reasons. Adam Wolanski QC, acting for the newspaper, asked: \u201cIs it fair to say you don\u2019t like the Sun very much?\u201d Burgon responded: \u201cI probably like them as much as they like me.\u201d The MP, who would become lord chancellor and be in charge of the UK legal system if Labour came to power, denied wanting to shut down the Sun and insisted he was \u201cnot a litigious person\u201d. He said this was \u201cthe first time I have brought a case against any newspaper\u201d, adding: \u201cThe reason I have brought it is because I am genuinely hurt and distressed by the link with the word and concept of Nazi and delighting in Nazi imagery. It is the most serious and grave of accusations.\u201d At one point questioning turned to a discussion of classic album artwork, with Burgon telling the court he did not remember Andy Warhol\u2019s \u201cbanana\u201d artwork on the debut release by the Velvet Underground and Nico. In his witness statement to the court, Newton Dunn, who is a joint defendant alongside his newspaper, said he was aware of the use of German typography by heavy metal bands but insisted the Leeds East MP should be held to a higher standard than Black Sabbath: \u201cI remain firmly of the opinion that it is completely inappropriate for [Burgon] to maintain associations with imagery, iconography and cultural references which are offensive, provocative and potentially upsetting to a number of everyday British citizens.\u201d He added: \u201cAssociating yourself with the use of Nazi imagery, with its connotations of criminality, violence and extremism, is not appropriate for someone who aspires to lead the justice system and preside over law and order.\u201d The court will hear final statements on Friday, with the judge expected to reserve judgment.",

      "body": "<p>Venezuela\u2019s people deserve better than president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro or reckless US-led intervention. The country is in the grip of a spiralling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/enezuela-trump-president-juan-guaido-maduro-recognition-news-latest\" title=\"\">political, economic and humanitarian crisis</a>. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets. As many as three million citizens \u2013 a 10th of its population \u2013 have fled. Almost 90% of those who remain live in poverty. The economy is shrinking fast, while the IMF predicts that hyperinflation could hit 10,000,000% this year. With food and medicine shortages widespread, there has been a surge in levels of malnutrition and the re-emergence of diseases such as malaria and diphtheria. The murder rate is sky-high.</p> <p>Mr Maduro and his allies have overseen this collapse, yet maintained a tight grip on power. When the opposition triumphed in elections for the national assembly in 2015, he stripped the body of its powers and set up the National Constituent Assembly instead through dubious elections. Last year he won an equally dodgy presidential vote boycotted by the opposition. Opposition leaders are jailed or have fled into exile; protesters have been arbitrarily <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/americas/venezuela\" title=\"\">detained and tortured</a>. While some still believe Mr Maduro continues the work of his charismatic predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, even many Chavistas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/on-the-road-venezuela-20-years-after-hugo-chavez-rise\" title=\"\">have turned against him</a>. An unpopular president relies on control of the judiciary and military support.</p> <p>These desperate times have united the splintered opposition, for now at least, around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\" title=\"\">Juan Guaid\u00f3</a>, the youthful and barely known figure who heads the national assembly and has just declared himself acting president.

      "bodyText": "Venezuela\u2019s people deserve better than president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro or reckless US-led intervention. The country is in the grip of a spiralling political, economic and humanitarian crisis. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets. As many as three million citizens \u2013 a 10th of its population \u2013 have fled. Almost 90% of those who remain live in poverty. The economy is shrinking fast, while the IMF predicts that hyperinflation could hit 10,000,000% this year. With food and medicine shortages widespread, there has been a surge in levels of malnutrition and the re-emergence of diseases such as malaria and diphtheria. The murder rate is sky-high. Mr Maduro and his allies have overseen this collapse, yet maintained a tight grip on power. When the opposition triumphed in elections for the national assembly in 2015, he stripped the body of its powers and set up the National Constituent Assembly instead through dubious elections. Last year he won an equally dodgy presidential vote boycotted by the opposition. Opposition leaders are jailed or have fled into exile; protesters have been arbitrarily detained and tortured. While some still believe Mr Maduro continues the work of his charismatic predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, even many Chavistas have turned against him. An unpopular president relies on control of the judiciary and military support. These desperate times have united the splintered opposition, for now at least, around Juan Guaid\u00f3, the youthful and barely known figure who heads the national assembly and has just declared himself acting president. He is backed by Donald Trump, usually so enamoured of authoritarian leaders and careless of human rights, who has taken an uncharacteristic stand in a country which happens to have the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves. Canada and most members of the Lima group regional bloc have also recognised Mr Guaid\u00f3, reflecting the broader risks posed by Venezuela\u2019s unravelling, and the inability to find another way forward, as well as the rightward shift in the region.

      "body": "<p>Heidi Allen and Frank Field make an odd partnership at first glance. Allen, 44, the Conservative MP for one of Britain\u2019s richest constituencies, and Field, 76, a Labour MP for 39 years until he resigned over antisemitism in the party, have bonded across the Commons over a shared outrage at poverty. Now they have embarked on a nationwide tour in search of the \u201cother England\u201d shaped by the austerity policies pioneered by Allen\u2019s party. It is proving emotional.</p> <p>Visits to the poorest corners of Newcastle, Glasgow, Morecambe and Cornwall beckon, but they have started in London and Leicester, where on Thursday they heard stories of an illiterate man sanctioned so often under universal credit that he lives on \u00a35 a week; a man so poor he sold all but the clothes he was wearing; and someone being told to walk 44 miles to attend a job interview, despite having had a stroke, to save the state the cost of a \u00a315 bus ticket.</p> <p>Time and again Allen, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, with its biotech start ups and affluent villages, was on the brink of tears as they visited two of the 15 food banks now helping sustain people in the east Midlands city and listened to people from charities, playgroups and community organisations. Away from Westminster\u2019s attempt to solve the \u201cmad riddle\u201d of Brexit, Allen admitted that her patience with her party\u2019s acquiescence over the welfare cuts, which started under George Osborne and the universal credit system, now being rolled out by Theresa May, had reached breaking point.</p> <p>\u201cI have absolutely had enough,\u201d Allen said, eyes reddening, in front of a group who spelled out how the reforms were turning the screw on some of the country\u2019s poorest people. \u201cSo I asked Frank if he would join me on a tour of the UK to show the government this exists. Unless we blow the lid off it, my lot are not going to listen.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Kennedy did something similar in the US in 1968 and gave a famous speech describing \u201canother America\u201d where he found children in Mississippi \u201ccrippled from hunger\u201d, people in the \u201cblack ghetto\u201d warding off rats, and native Americans living with 80% unemployment. In a similar vein, Allen and Field want to know \u201chow the soft underbelly of our society \u2013 \u2013 \u2018the other England\u2019 \u2013 can be strengthened so that none of our fellow citizens are pushed into destitution\u201d, Field said.</p> <p>\u201cThis denotes a new offensive and shows that parliament is aware there is something not wholesome out there in the nation and the nation sees it,\u201d said Field. It follows the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/16/key-points-un-envoy-philip-alston-report-poverty-britain-uk\"> tour by the United Nation\u2019s rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston</a>, who last autumn concluded that the government had inflicted \u201cgreat misery\u201d on its people with \u201cpunitive, mean-spirited, and often callous\u201d austerity policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41e5e18bd2789d3216032beba0f7bc9d252763d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41e5e18bd2789d3216032beba0f7bc9d252763d7/0_298_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Field and Heidi Allen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Field and Heidi Allen visit Action Homeless Food Bank in Leicester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio de Paola/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was at E2, a community centre and food bank in the deprived Beaumont Leys estate in the north-west of Leicester, where Allen\u2019s tears first welled. Council workers explained they had seen a surge in referrals to food banks since the introduction of universal credit. In June, when universal credit was first rolled out in Leicester, just 5% of people referred to food banks in the estate were on the benefit, but that has since risen to 29%.</p> <p>The problems poured forth from people waiting to pick up free food. Kate, 68, revealed how her son, who had suffered a stroke, had been sanctioned 15 times.</p> <p>\u201cThe system needs more caring people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are like little Hitlers.\u201d</p> <p>The woman beside her, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said the bailiffs were set to take back her two-bed council house because she was in arrears, including on bedroom tax. She uses the second bedroom for her granddaughter five nights a week, so her son can work, but that doesn\u2019t count because it is not her child. Without much heating she wraps up in a dressing gown, coat and bobble hat.</p> <p>The bureaucratic struggle simply to claim benefits is a big problem. Sixty-five percent of the most vulnerable people who come to the council for help don\u2019t have access to a computer, smart phone or an email address, which are needed to fill out forms.</p> <p>\u201cYou must just feel like the world is spiralling around you,\u201d said Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s two steps forward and one and a half back.\u201d</p> <p>After housing costs, 41% of children in Leicester \u2013 more than 34,000 \u2013 are living in poverty. The Leicester South parliamentary constituency was in the poorest 2% of constituencies in the UK in 2018, which represented a slide down the rankings since 2015.</p> <p>Over the last two summer holidays, in the most deprived parts of the city, over 15,000 meals were served to almost 1,650 children, using government funds, according to Feeding Britain, a charity set up by Field and which now includes Allen among its trustees.</p> <p>\u201cIf the demand keeps increasing, food banks aren\u2019t going to be sustainable,\u201d Tim Adkin, crisis food manager for Action Homeless, told the MPs at a food bank in a retail unit in the city centre market dressed up to look like a shop, in part to reduce users\u2019 sense of shame. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep up with the demand.\u201d</p> <p>It has seen a 20% increase in year-on-year demand. More and more families with children \u2013 now 25% of users \u2013 and single women are coming in.</p> <p>Adkin is among those giving up on central government to change things.</p> <p>\u201cWe are almost in a parallel universe,\u201d Adkin told the MPs. \u201cWe are creating our own supply chain for energy and food.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you go into the job centre, there\u2019s a barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you come in here, we are not the enemy.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Heidi Allen and Frank Field make an odd partnership at first glance. Allen, 44, the Conservative MP for one of Britain\u2019s richest constituencies, and Field, 76, a Labour MP for 39 years until he resigned over antisemitism in the party, have bonded across the Commons over a shared outrage at poverty. Now they have embarked on a nationwide tour in search of the \u201cother England\u201d shaped by the austerity policies pioneered by Allen\u2019s party. It is proving emotional. Visits to the poorest corners of Newcastle, Glasgow, Morecambe and Cornwall beckon, but they have started in London and Leicester, where on Thursday they heard stories of an illiterate man sanctioned so often under universal credit that he lives on \u00a35 a week; a man so poor he sold all but the clothes he was wearing; and someone being told to walk 44 miles to attend a job interview, despite having had a stroke, to save the state the cost of a \u00a315 bus ticket. Time and again Allen, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, with its biotech start ups and affluent villages, was on the brink of tears as they visited two of the 15 food banks now helping sustain people in the east Midlands city and listened to people from charities, playgroups and community organisations. Away from Westminster\u2019s attempt to solve the \u201cmad riddle\u201d of Brexit, Allen admitted that her patience with her party\u2019s acquiescence over the welfare cuts, which started under George Osborne and the universal credit system, now being rolled out by Theresa May, had reached breaking point. \u201cI have absolutely had enough,\u201d Allen said, eyes reddening, in front of a group who spelled out how the reforms were turning the screw on some of the country\u2019s poorest people. \u201cSo I asked Frank if he would join me on a tour of the UK to show the government this exists. Unless we blow the lid off it, my lot are not going to listen.\u201d Robert Kennedy did something similar in the US in 1968 and gave a famous speech describing \u201canother America\u201d where he found children in Mississippi \u201ccrippled from hunger\u201d, people in the \u201cblack ghetto\u201d warding off rats, and native Americans living with 80% unemployment. In a similar vein, Allen and Field want to know \u201chow the soft underbelly of our society \u2013 \u2013 \u2018the other England\u2019 \u2013 can be strengthened so that none of our fellow citizens are pushed into destitution\u201d, Field said. \u201cThis denotes a new offensive and shows that parliament is aware there is something not wholesome out there in the nation and the nation sees it,\u201d said Field. It follows the tour by the United Nation\u2019s rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, who last autumn concluded that the government had inflicted \u201cgreat misery\u201d on its people with \u201cpunitive, mean-spirited, and often callous\u201d austerity policies. It was at E2, a community centre and food bank in the deprived Beaumont Leys estate in the north-west of Leicester, where Allen\u2019s tears first welled. Council workers explained they had seen a surge in referrals to food banks since the introduction of universal credit. In June, when universal credit was first rolled out in Leicester, just 5% of people referred to food banks in the estate were on the benefit, but that has since risen to 29%. The problems poured forth from people waiting to pick up free food. Kate, 68, revealed how her son, who had suffered a stroke, had been sanctioned 15 times. \u201cThe system needs more caring people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are like little Hitlers.\u201d The woman beside her, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said the bailiffs were set to take back her two-bed council house because she was in arrears, including on bedroom tax. She uses the second bedroom for her granddaughter five nights a week, so her son can work, but that doesn\u2019t count because it is not her child. Without much heating she wraps up in a dressing gown, coat and bobble hat. The bureaucratic struggle simply to claim benefits is a big problem. Sixty-five percent of the most vulnerable people who come to the council for help don\u2019t have access to a computer, smart phone or an email address, which are needed to fill out forms. \u201cYou must just feel like the world is spiralling around you,\u201d said Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s two steps forward and one and a half back.\u201d After housing costs, 41% of children in Leicester \u2013 more than 34,000 \u2013 are living in poverty. The Leicester South parliamentary constituency was in the poorest 2% of constituencies in the UK in 2018, which represented a slide down the rankings since 2015. Over the last two summer holidays, in the most deprived parts of the city, over 15,000 meals were served to almost 1,650 children, using government funds, according to Feeding Britain, a charity set up by Field and which now includes Allen among its trustees. \u201cIf the demand keeps increasing, food banks aren\u2019t going to be sustainable,\u201d Tim Adkin, crisis food manager for Action Homeless, told the MPs at a food bank in a retail unit in the city centre market dressed up to look like a shop, in part to reduce users\u2019 sense of shame. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep up with the demand.\u201d It has seen a 20% increase in year-on-year demand. More and more families with children \u2013 now 25% of users \u2013 and single women are coming in. Adkin is among those giving up on central government to change things. \u201cWe are almost in a parallel universe,\u201d Adkin told the MPs. \u201cWe are creating our own supply chain for energy and food.\u201d \u201cIf you go into the job centre, there\u2019s a barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you come in here, we are not the enemy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The gunman who killed five people at a bank in Sebring, Florida, has been charged with five counts of first degree murder in what authorities said appears to be a \u201crandom act\u201d. The 21-year-old suspect, Zephen Xaver, is accused of walking into a SunTrust Bank branch with a gun on Wednesday and shooting dead everyone inside. There were no signs of a robbery, nor did the shooter appear to know any of his victims, authorities said Thursday. \u201cWe believe that it is a random act. We do not believe anybody was specifically targeted,\u201d Sebring police chief Karl Hoglund said at a press conference. All five victims were women; four were bank employees and one was a customer, officials said. They identified two of the victims: Cynthia Watson, who was a customer in the bank, and Marisol Lopez, an employee. The other names were withheld at the request of the victims\u2019 families, the police chief said. \u201cHe overtook the bank by force. He then shot everyone in the bank,\u201d Hoglund said. \u201cAfter shooting them, he called 911\u201d and \u201ctold dispatchers that he\u2019d killed everyone in the bank\u201d. All the victims were found in the bank\u2019s lobby, according to an affidavit. Shell casings from Xaver\u2019s 9mm handgun were scattered on the floor. \u201cYesterday our community suffered a tremendous loss at the hands of a heinous criminal,\u201d Hoglund said. Xaver was ordered held without bond after a brief court appearance Thursday morning, where he wore a black-and-white striped prison uniform. The suspect, who moved from Indiana to the small Florida town in the fall with his mother, had shown a fascination with the idea of killing people, his ex-girlfriend told a television station. He \u201cfor some reason always hated people and wanted everybody to die\u201d, Alex Gerlach told WSBT-TV in South Bend, Indiana. \u201cHe got kicked out of school for having a dream that he killed everybody in his class, and he\u2019s been threatening this for so long, and he\u2019s been having dreams about it and everything.\u201d \u201cEvery single person I\u2019ve told has not taken it seriously, and it\u2019s very unfortunate that it had to come to this,\u201d Gerlach said. Xaver said he bought a gun last week and \u201cno one thought anything of it\u201d because he had always liked guns, Gerlach told the Washington Post. Florida department of corrections records show that Xaver was hired as a trainee prison guard at Avon Park Correctional Institution on 2 November and resigned on 9 January. He lived about four miles from the bank. Authorities said they would seek the highest possible sentence against Xaver. \u201cYesterday our world was rocked by something that we couldn\u2019t even fathom here,\u201d said John Shoop, the mayor of the town of about 10,000 people. \u201cWe have a wonderful community here, and this kind of senseless cowardice act is just something that\u2019s not even in our vocabulary.\u201d",

The two sites would help create an online media boom, as investors rushed to buy stakes in the belief such outlets were more nimble and more in tune with the desires of readers who grew up on the internet rather than with traditional newspapers and broadcasters. On Wednesday, HuffPost\u2019s parent company, Verizon Media Group, and BuzzFeed both announced plans to lay off hundreds of staff. The news signalled a collision between the dream of an online media boom and the accountants\u2019 harsher reality: questions over the long-term profitability of digital media companies, and, as a result, concerns over the future of online journalism itself. \u201cWhat if there is literally no profitable model for digital news? Or none that actually scales and endures without, say, the established readership base and brand of the New York Times?\u201d asked the MSNBC presenter Chris Hayes, summarising a growing fear among media executives that the current model of paying for journalism on the internet is broken. The same news executives are coming to terms with the fact that, in the modern world of mobile consumption, most sites are just another form of distraction. Their competition is not just rival scoops \u2013 but a vast online ecosystem of entertaining, shareable and social content. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we have a digital content bubble,\u201d said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, the director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re going to see more cuts, both in legacy media and digital-born ones.\u201d He said part of the issue was the investors who backed online media startups thought they were investing in fast-growing tech businesses, rather than something resembling a traditional news outlet. \u201cIn some ways, for journalism to succeed as a business it needs patient investors who are content with incremental growth and modest returns on investment.\u201d This attitude fed into the financial culture of the companies, which often hired staff at breakneck speed. Online site Mic rented glitzy offices in the World Trade Center in New York, shortly before the company collapsed after last year\u2019s changes to Facebook\u2019s algorithm, which hit many online publishers\u2019 traffic hard. BuzzFeed placed an emphasis on retaining employees by providing generous working conditions such as free lunches, featuring sushi and rock oysters. Vice was famed for the decadence of its parties under its former chief executive Shane Smith, who was in charge when the company was hit with accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct. Major online media companies, which are often referred to as startups \u2013 despite, in many cases, being more than a decade old \u2013 are now having to control costs. At the same time, they are being asked questions by investors who are wondering about the true value of their stake. Disney, which once held talks about buying BuzzFeed, invested $400m (\u00a3310m) in Vice in 2014 but has now written the value of its stake down by 40%. Sites such as Mashable were offloaded in fire sales, following substantial cutbacks. BuzzFeed\u2019s email announcing layoffs made it clear the company would not be seeking to raise any more funds, and the business appears to have abandoned its once-proposed plan to float on the stock exchange. This is despite the fact the company is hoping to record income of $300m in 2018 following doubt-digit revenue growth, while its UK edition is close to profitability \u2013 a performance that would delight many traditional outlets but is not enough for investors. Even as online media companies have fought off a slew of low-rent competitors mimicking their distribution methods, they have also had to contend with more established outlets learning from their skills in experimentation. In BuzzFeed\u2019s early days, the company mastered the art of gaming Facebook\u2019s algorithm by building lists and posts based around identity and entertainment issues, which would appeal to readers and encourage them to share. Suddenly, an established online brand could be matched by the use of an organic distribution network: readers themselves. The result was a run of posts which would reach millions of views, aided by carefully-studied insights \u2013 such as the fact that adding the word \u201cactually\u201d to a quiz headline could supercharge its traffic. Those insights helped to maximise viral reach, with an attention to detail and deep analysis of what prompted humans to share that sometimes belied their apparently frivolous content and headlines. Gradually, ongoing changes to Facebook\u2019s algorithm eroded some of the competitive advantage in the field. BuzzFeed looked to develop its presence on other platforms and invest in the serious news journalism which saw it publish the Trump dossier and be shortlisted for a Pulitzer prize. At BuzzFeed, Peretti constantly suggested Facebook would be forced to pay for content, an outcome that has yet to materialise, before seeking to create TV-style programming for other companies.

Some outlets are relying on contributions from readers, a model which has helped the Guardian\u2019s parent company edge towards breaking even after years of heavy financial losses. Others prefer to rely on wealthy individuals: the Atlantic is benefiting from an investment by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple\u2019s founder, Steve Jobs, while MEL Magazine has won plaudits for its coverage of online culture, despite being the corporate branding project of a razor manufacturer. \u201cThe challenges that the establishment players and new players face are very similar,\u201d said Nielsen, who urged competitors not to gloat at the pain experienced by new rivals, with many journalists set to lose their jobs. \u201cWe live in a world with intense competition for attention, for advertising, and for people\u2019s money. There may be schadenfreude \u2013 these people were the future once \u2013 but this is not in any way good news for traditional players.\u201d How the online media cuts are affecting online publishers: Vice Employees: 3,000 Valuation: $5.7bn in 2017 Revenue: $600m Job cuts: Aims to reduce headcount by 15% through attrition and a hiring freeze. What\u2019s happening: The company was valued at $5.7bn under its former chief executive Shane Smith but has since seen Disney write down the value of its stake by 40%, suggesting its current value is much lower. Smith quit last year, to be replaced by TV executive Nancy Dubuc. The company is increasingly focused on its in-house ad agency Virtue and the nightly TV news show it produces for HBO. Verizon Media Group Employees: 11,000 Valuation: $5.2bn in 2018 Revenue: $600m Job cuts: 800 What\u2019s happening: The parent company of HuffPost, AOL, Yahoo, and Tumblr was founded in a bid to take on Google and Facebook by creating a new media giant but has struggled to gain market share. After a brief stint under the name Oath, it has been rebranded after its parent company last year took a $4.6bn writedown on its value before announcing substantial job cuts. Employees found out they were due to be sacked via a calendar invite from HR, according to HuffPost\u2019s own reporting. BuzzFeed Employees: 1,400 Valuation: $1.6bn in 2016 Revenue: $300m Job cuts: 200 What\u2019s happening: Founder Jonah Peretti is looking to grow revenues away from advertising on the company\u2019s main website, with a greater emphasis on licensing deals with third parties and online shopping in a profitability push. The company\u2019s news division has continued to attract attention, most recently with its disputed story that Donald Trump directed his personal lawyer to lie to Congress. Mic Employees: 0 Valuation: $5m Revenue: Unknown What\u2019s happening: The publisher was known for snappy Facebook videos and boomed while the social network prioritised video but struggled when Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company changed its algorithm. Mic employed more than 100 people but almost all of them lost their jobs when the company collapsed at the end of last year after burning through tens of millions of dollars in funding. Its assets were sold to Bustle Group at a knockdown price of about $5m. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 January 2019. Peretti was 31, not 29, when he helped to found BuzzFeed.",

At Southwell, I like 9-2 <strong>Handsome Bob (1.15)</strong> in the opener, Keith Dalgleish\u2019s charge having produced a career best on his first start here last month. Later, 11-4 is fine about <strong>Temur Khan (2.55)</strong>, who also benefited for the switch to Fibresand when landing a maiden here three weeks ago. The four-year-old looks nicely treated on that evidence as he makes his second start in a handicap.</p> \n<p><strong>Colwood (7.25)</strong> is the sensible pick at Chelmsford tonight, this ex-French 4-1 shot having got off the mark on his second start for Robert Eddery before Christmas. The slightly mad pick, in the opening hands and heels race, is <strong>Mystical Moon (4.25)</strong> at 50-1. She hasn\u2019t achieved much but she led to the furlong pole in a Wolves novice last time and hasn\u2019t had many chances in handicaps. She comes from an in-form yard, will be ridden by a jockey with a fair strike-rate and could outrun her odds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2d1ad759-4722-4728-a5cb-e55be7eb4c78\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Wetherby</b>&nbsp;Cancelled (frozen ground)</p>\n    <p><b>Fakenham</b>&nbsp;Cancelled (frozen ground)&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Southwell</b>&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p><b>1.15</b> Handsome Bob <b>1.45</b> Hanati <b>2.20 </b>Foolaad <br><b>2.55</b> Temur Khan <b>3.30</b> Whenapoet <b>4.05</b> Gabrials Centurion</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford</b>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>4.25 </b>Mystical Moon <b>4.55</b> Pacificadora <b>5.25 </b>Glenn Coco <b>5.55</b> How Far <br><b>6.25</b> Distant Applause <b>6.55</b> Dahawi <b>7.25</b> Colwood <b>7.55 </b>Elenora Delight&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"479d95c4-20d2-406d-b41d-64acd0a9ae5d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Doncaster&nbsp;</b><b>12.50</b> Pique Rock <b>1.25 </b>Storm Goddess <b>1.55</b> Beau Bay <b>2.30&nbsp;</b>Lady Cylla <b>3.05</b> Groveman<b> 3.35</b> Maroc&nbsp;<b>4.05</b> His Dream (nap)&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Huntingdon</b>&nbsp;<b>1.00</b> Monsieur D\u2019Arque<b> 1.35 </b>Duc Kauto <b>2.05</b> Arthur\u2019s Reuben <b>2.40 </b>Magic Of Light <b>3.15</b> Potters Hedger (nb) <b>3.45 </b>Ardera Cross <b>4.20 </b>The Cruix&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield</b>&nbsp;<b>1.15 </b>Herm <b>1.45 </b>Ignatius<b> 2.20</b> Axel Jacklin&nbsp;<b>2.55</b> Brockey Rise <b>3.25 </b>Boutonniere <b>3.55 </b>Attain&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle&nbsp;</b><b>4.15</b> Sparkle In His Eye<b> 4.45</b> Amliba<b> 5.15</b> Deeds Not Words <b>5.45</b> Olympic Spirit<b> 6.15</b> Alkaamel <b>6.45 </b>False ID <b>7.15</b> Encoded<b> 7.45&nbsp;</b>Hanakotoba</p>\n    <p><i>Tips by Chris Cook</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

In 1953 he married Margaret Williams, sister of a college friend, and they raised four children in Whalley Range.</p> <p>In 1969 Owen was appointed lecturer in New Testament studies at the University of Wales, Bangor, and the family relocated to Anglesey.

In 1946 he decided to train for full-time ministry and began his studies at Wesley College, Leeds. Ordained in 1951, he worked as a Methodist minister for two years before being appointed New Testament tutor at Hartley Victoria College, a ministerial training establishment in Manchester. In 1953 he married Margaret Williams, sister of a college friend, and they raised four children in Whalley Range. In 1969 Owen was appointed lecturer in New Testament studies at the University of Wales, Bangor, and the family relocated to Anglesey. He remained at Bangor for the rest of his career. After retirement in 1988, Owen continued his scholarly work, painstakingly completing the concordance for the Bible, while continuing to preach and support the local Wesleyan Methodist Church circuit into his late 80s. By way of relaxation, Owen loved Welsh literature and culture, choral singing, football (especially Manchester City FC), cryptic crosswords and being with his family. Margaret died in 2017. Owen is survived by his children, Angharad, Bronwen, Dewi and me, and by four grandchildren and a great-grandson.",

      "bodyText": "The struggling clothing retailer New Look may be forced to put itself up for sale in order to complete a rescue refinance. New Look, which has 500 stores, will hand bondholders up to 92% of the company in return for reducing its \u00a31.35bn debt pile to about \u00a3500m. The company closed 85 stores last year through an insolvency procedure after an annual loss of nearly \u00a3235m, which its chairman blamed on its product range becoming too young and edgy and on an ill-starred international venture. It launched the financial restructure after sales at established stores fell 5.7% in December. In the first phase of the financial restructure, bondholders this week approved an \u00a380m short-term injection of cash, which the company will begin to have access to next week. More than 90% of senior bondholders also backed the refinancing proposal, which involves raising \u00a3150m in further long-term debt as part of the debt-for-equity swap. But in a note to bondholders seen by the Guardian, New Look said in order to finalise the restructure, it \u201cmay be required to launch a sale process for the group in which other interested parties could participate\u201d. Experts said New Look may need to demonstrate there was no better alternative to the restructure in order to avoid any legal challenge from creditors, particularly from those holding \u00a3176m in unsecured bonds. These \u201cjunior\u201d bondholders will be almost wiped out, with just 2% of the equity being offered after the restructure. Alistair McGeorge, the executive chairman of New Look who returned to run the company towards the end of 2017, said the backing of its main lenders was \u201ca vote of confidence in our strategy, the strength of our brand and management\u2019s ability to deliver the wider turnaround plans already being implemented\u201d. He added: \u201cWe look forward to continuing working with our key stakeholders to finalise and implement our planned restructuring to secure the future and long-term profitability of the company.\u201d New Look said the remaining steps mainly involved issuing legal documentation and it expected to finalise its restructure by April. Last week, the ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded New Look\u2019s credit rating on \u00a31bn of debt to C, its lowest possible junk bond status. Another ratings agency, S&amp;P, also downgraded New Look\u2019s debt on Thursday before the restructuring announcement, saying the retailer would face a liquidity crisis if the move were not approved next week. New Look\u2019s owner, Brait, will own at least 18% of the group\u2019s equity, down from 90%, on completion of the restructure. Management will own 5%. Brait, a private equity company whose biggest shareholder is the South African tycoon Christo Wiese, paid \u00a3780m for a majority stake in New Look in 2015. The company is now the group\u2019s largest bondholder after buying up debt on the open market.",

It is not clear what the fee would be at this stage.

      "body": "<p>One of the many things we have learned from Netflix\u2019s Fyre festival documentary is just how much money influencers can make from a single Instagram post. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81035279\" title=\"\">If you haven\u2019t seen it</a> \u2013 and you simply must, it\u2019s a set text for a course in Men That Can\u2019t Get Away With It, alongside that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/12/hindsight-and-all-the-things-i-cant-see-in-front-of-me-wha-what-will-the-justin-timberlake-autobiography-be-like\" title=\"\">new Justin Timberlake autobiography</a> that is just photos of him \u2013 it shows that a host of celebrity influencers were paid to post a single burnt orange tile on their Instagram with a link to the Fyre festival website, meaning a festival that didn\u2019t exist immediately sold out.</p> <p>According to the film, Kendall Jenner was allegedly paid $250,000 (\u00a3190,000) for her post, but even smaller influencers were bunged tens of thousands of dollars. Overall, millions were spent on a supposedly \u201cviral\u201d campaign. Yet, this week, another unlikely brand managed to sign up an equally impressive list of influencers, all without spending a penny. I\u2019m talking of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/aug/16/uk-watchdog-investigate-payments-social-media-influencers\" title=\"\">Competition and Markets Authority</a> (CMA), the grey government quango responsible for investigating business mergers. It managed to bag Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora, Zoella and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for its new campaign, as well as a host of reality stars and vloggers. Darling, how have they managed it? By <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-youtube-stars-investigated-by-uk-competition-and-markets-authority-paid-promotion-disclosures-uk-2018-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">threatening them all with jail time</a>, of course!</p> <p>In a press release on the Gov.uk website \u2013 and, really, who needs the sidebar of shame when you have civil service pdfs? \u2013 the CMA announced that it had gathered a group of 16 celebrities who had all promised to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/celebrities-pledge-to-clean-up-their-act-on-social-media\" title=\"\">clean up their act</a>\u201d on social media. We\u2019d love to say that the celebrities have done this because they are all just nutty about strong regulatory frameworks in direct-to-consumer marketing. But one does detect in the CMA\u2019s tone \u2013 similar to that of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/11/keep-the-tape-running-how-interrogations-became-top-draw-tv\" title=\"\">Jed Mercurio copper</a> breathing down the neck of a low-level criminal who might be holding back on some information \u2013 that they were left with little choice.</p> <p>\u201cThe enforcement action taken by the CMA has seen a number of social media stars pledge to be more transparent when posting online,\u201d it said, adding that if the celebrities do not stick to the commitments they made, \u201cwe will not hesitate to take them to court\u201d, where they could be \u201cfined indefinitely\u201d or \u201csent to prison for up to two years\u201d. Two years? That\u2019s, like, 60 detox juice cleanses.</p> <p>What could the government possibly be so upset about? Well, let\u2019s take a scroll through the Instagram account of one of the \u201cwilling participants\u201d in the CMA\u2019s press push \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/binkyfelstead/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Made in Chelsea\u2019s Alexandra \u201cBinky\u201d Felstead</a>.</p> <p>Over the past six months, Binkles has posted about her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkfR32-Bdq1/\" title=\"\">\u201ckidchella\u201d private child\u2019s festival experience</a>, in which \u201c@elari_events outdid themselves with the most amazing attention to detail\u201d and she stayed in a country house \u201cfound through @uniquehomestays \u2026 will 100% be using them again to find gems like this place\u201d.

      "bodyText": "One of the many things we have learned from Netflix\u2019s Fyre festival documentary is just how much money influencers can make from a single Instagram post. If you haven\u2019t seen it \u2013 and you simply must, it\u2019s a set text for a course in Men That Can\u2019t Get Away With It, alongside that new Justin Timberlake autobiography that is just photos of him \u2013 it shows that a host of celebrity influencers were paid to post a single burnt orange tile on their Instagram with a link to the Fyre festival website, meaning a festival that didn\u2019t exist immediately sold out. According to the film, Kendall Jenner was allegedly paid $250,000 (\u00a3190,000) for her post, but even smaller influencers were bunged tens of thousands of dollars. Overall, millions were spent on a supposedly \u201cviral\u201d campaign. Yet, this week, another unlikely brand managed to sign up an equally impressive list of influencers, all without spending a penny. I\u2019m talking of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the grey government quango responsible for investigating business mergers. It managed to bag Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora, Zoella and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for its new campaign, as well as a host of reality stars and vloggers. Darling, how have they managed it? By threatening them all with jail time, of course! In a press release on the Gov.uk website \u2013 and, really, who needs the sidebar of shame when you have civil service pdfs? \u2013 the CMA announced that it had gathered a group of 16 celebrities who had all promised to \u201cclean up their act\u201d on social media. We\u2019d love to say that the celebrities have done this because they are all just nutty about strong regulatory frameworks in direct-to-consumer marketing. But one does detect in the CMA\u2019s tone \u2013 similar to that of a Jed Mercurio copper breathing down the neck of a low-level criminal who might be holding back on some information \u2013 that they were left with little choice. \u201cThe enforcement action taken by the CMA has seen a number of social media stars pledge to be more transparent when posting online,\u201d it said, adding that if the celebrities do not stick to the commitments they made, \u201cwe will not hesitate to take them to court\u201d, where they could be \u201cfined indefinitely\u201d or \u201csent to prison for up to two years\u201d. Two years? That\u2019s, like, 60 detox juice cleanses. What could the government possibly be so upset about? Well, let\u2019s take a scroll through the Instagram account of one of the \u201cwilling participants\u201d in the CMA\u2019s press push \u2013 Made in Chelsea\u2019s Alexandra \u201cBinky\u201d Felstead. Over the past six months, Binkles has posted about her \u201ckidchella\u201d private child\u2019s festival experience, in which \u201c@elari_events outdid themselves with the most amazing attention to detail\u201d and she stayed in a country house \u201cfound through @uniquehomestays \u2026 will 100% be using them again to find gems like this place\u201d. In fact, that was such a good weekend that she did a follow-up post a week later, just to thank all those involved once again, but certainly not to fulfil any previous agreements. She also had a gym workout, where she just so happened to be \u201cwearing @sweatybetty\u201d and also just so happened to use their official hashtag \u201c#youbetyourass\u201d. None of these posts were apparently an ad. But her account is not all about her personal unpaid passion for saying thank you to brands, there is the odd clearly labelled paid partnership there too, such as the one for the pram chair Cybex Global. In it she acknowledges she has been paid to call it \u201clight and compact\u201d, but just a few weeks later, she posted about the pram again. This time, saying, \u201cthis is not an #ad \u2026 it really is just super easy &amp; amazing\u201d. What are the chances? The CMA has also created explicit new guidelines about what counts as payment: a gift, loan or freebie, \u201cwhether you originally asked for it or got sent it out of the blue\u201d \u2013 each now counts, meaning the nods and winks system is under attack. The reason regulators are clamping down is essential because they are worried about a repeat of the Fyre festival scenario \u2013 where influencers are paid a truckload of money to endorse a thing they know nothing about. In the Netflix documentary, you see Billy McFarland, a man whose permanent facial expression is of a 14-year-old boy who has just been told \u201cthere will be girls there\u201d, pay 10 of the world\u2019s top models to film a commercial on a remote island for a festival that didn\u2019t exist. Once the festival sells out, he scrambles to try to deliver on his promises. Big Billy Bullshit is like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen before \u2013 at no point in his downfall, even when he has been charged with a host of federal crimes, does he ever stop talking himself up. He makes Chris Moyles sound like he suffers from low self-esteem, Shane Smith look like Vince Cable \u2013 it\u2019s a thing to behold. In perhaps the most shocking scene of the doc, Andy, one of the festival organisers, recounts how Billy told him that all their bottled Evian had been seized by Bahamian customs, that they were out of money, and the only way to get them back would be to go to the customs official and \u201csuck his dick\u201d. It\u2019s a dramatic descent, from something that started with a few mislabelled Instagram posts. Clearly, the CMA is taking preventive measure to stop a disaster like that happening in Britain. But it\u2019s not clear that those involved in Fyre festival have learned any lessons. Most of the models who flew to the island continue to post constantly about brands and experiences, labelling only some of their posts as advertisements. Ja Rule \u2013 the rapper who helped Billy pull the con off \u2013 claimed this week on Twitter that he too was \u201cbamboozled, hood winked, lead astray\u201d, even though he is seen in the doc appearing to repeatedly withold crucial, potentially life-saving information from attendees. The only surprising thing is that some social media manager at Evian hasn\u2019t themselves tried to turn this into some kind of influencer campaign. Imagine a couple of makeup vloggers, a Jonas brother and that egg that has the most Instagram likes, all staring moodily into the camera clutching a bottle of the clear stuff with the hashtag #idsuckdickforevian. It would certainly be one way to steal the limelight back from the Fiji Water Girl. McFarland is now serving a six-year sentence in federal prison. The CMA says it is now sending letters to other influencers to warn them about their behaviour. And so balance can slowly be restored, because if you are flogging Bahamian islands to Boohoo bikinis, the only thing more influential than an influencer is a good lawyer.

In this deadlock-breaking scenario, parliament calls on leavers from all parties to form a Brexit council tasked with defining the terms and conditions of exiting the EU. The council runs rough drafts past Michel Barnier along the way to ensure feasibility, and it emerges after a set number of days (article 50 already having been extended) with a single, definitive, cross-party, leave-representing preference which is one of two options put to a people\u2019s vote, viz \u201cDo you want to leave the EU under the terms of the Brexit council\u2019s plan or do you want to stay in?\u201d</p> <p>At a stroke Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and all other parliamentarians are freed up to attend to other work; leavers are listened to, and indeed lead the debate, so \u201csocial cohesion\u201d is maintained and a second referendum becomes much less controversial; pie-in-the-sky Brexit options are chucked out by Brexiters themselves; and we, the people, can not only (finally) talk about something else but also vote to reject Brexit altogether if it seems after all to be the best thing to do.<br><strong>Archie Lauchlan</strong><br><em>Hastings, East Sussex</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

It may be too late to improve the Brexit debate but we urgently need to talk about the UK\u2019s drugs policy and housing for starters. Sue Roebuck London \u2022 There is a way to gain cross-party agreement on a Brexit deal, and that\u2019s to hand the whole thing over to leave-voting MPs. In this deadlock-breaking scenario, parliament calls on leavers from all parties to form a Brexit council tasked with defining the terms and conditions of exiting the EU. The council runs rough drafts past Michel Barnier along the way to ensure feasibility, and it emerges after a set number of days (article 50 already having been extended) with a single, definitive, cross-party, leave-representing preference which is one of two options put to a people\u2019s vote, viz \u201cDo you want to leave the EU under the terms of the Brexit council\u2019s plan or do you want to stay in?\u201d At a stroke Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and all other parliamentarians are freed up to attend to other work; leavers are listened to, and indeed lead the debate, so \u201csocial cohesion\u201d is maintained and a second referendum becomes much less controversial; pie-in-the-sky Brexit options are chucked out by Brexiters themselves; and we, the people, can not only (finally) talk about something else but also vote to reject Brexit altogether if it seems after all to be the best thing to do.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the 2016 referendum a promise was made to the majority who voted for Brexit \u2013 that they were voting for a more prosperous future.</p> <p>Not leaving would be seen as a betrayal of that referendum decision.</p> <p>But leaving without a deal would undermine our future prosperity, and would equally represent a betrayal of the promises that were made.</p> <p>And that is why I, having campaigned vigorously to remain, in the referendum have come to believe that the only credible and sustainable solution is for us to leave the European Union.</p> <p>To honour the referendum decision but to do so in a way that protects our economy in order to allow us to deliver that future prosperity that those voters were promised when they voted to leave the EU.</p> <p>The only sustainable solution is a negotiated settlement with the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>John McDonnell,</strong> the shadow chancellor, says, given Theresa May\u2019s refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit, Hammond should resign. In a statement he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor must now surely consider his position in the government. Philip Hammond\u2019s comments today demonstrate he has acknowledged the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to our economy, jobs and living standards.</p> <p>If the prime minister fails to listen to his warnings and continues to refuse to take no deal off the table there is no other option, he must resign.</p> </blockquote> <p>May, like Hammond, has repeatedly said she does not want a no-deal Brexit, but she has refused to explicitly rule it out. She is worried that, if she were to do that, MPs would no longer feel under pressure to back her deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c865bb4a1ea52b179f48de4bfe4f95d8803643ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c865bb4a1ea52b179f48de4bfe4f95d8803643ee/0_37_1128_677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond, the chancellor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hammond, the chancellor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-24T17:16:48.947Z\">at 5.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c49c0b8e4b024f0efead983\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-24T16:45:35.354Z\">4.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Can a no-deal Brexit be stopped?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the question all Westminster, and half the EU, would like answered.

May won't budge from my deal or no deal, Corbyn ain't budging from GE and full CU membership and SNP can only shout at windmills in the twilight.</p> <p>In your considered opinion, at this stage, is there anyway a no deal can be stopped?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Yes, it can - but I think you are right to put the question in these terms. A lot of Westminster commentary is framed around the proposition that a no-deal Brexit would be so unthinkable that it is unthinkable - or at least, very unlikely. There is an assumption that rational actors will always act rationally. But (leaving aside the issue of whether all players in the Brexit drama do qualify as rational actors), history shows us that that is not always the case. World War One would be a classic example, Vietnam another. (That prompted<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_and_the_Brightest\"> a wonderful book</a> about how some of the cleverest people ever to run a US administration could end up responsible for one of the biggest foreign policy disasters of all time.) That\u2019s why I agree with<strong> Sir Ivan Rogers</strong>, the most astute of all the Brexit commentators, who said in <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/european-institute/sites/european-institute/files/sir_ivan_rogers_lecture_ucl_22012019.pdf\">a lecture (pdf) </a>on Tuesday that \u201cwe have reached an impasse and ... the risks are appreciably higher than either the markets or the commentariat believe.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ve got a good summary of the various intractables that make it hard to see how a no-deal Brexit can be avoided before 29 March. So how can it be stopped? In one sense it is quite simple; some of those involved who have put down red lines will have to abandon them. That happens all the time, and it explains why journalists are always on the alert for the slightest hint that a \u201cline\u201d is changing.</p> <p>But what makes this problematic is that several compromises might be necessary, and some of them are at the outer boundaries of probability.</p> <p>Here are various things that could happen that would led to a no-deal Brexit on 29 March being stopped, roughly in order of how likely they seem. (Some of them might occur in combination.)</p> <p><strong>1) May and the EU agree to extend article 50 just to buy more time.</strong> Both sides would be reluctant to do this, especially if there were no guarantee that delaying would help resolve the deadlock. But stopping the clock may seem preferable to going over the cliff. However, this does not necessarily avoid no deal. It might just postpone it.</p> <p><strong>2) Parliament forces May to apply for extra time. </strong>This is a variant of 1), but perhaps less likely because, even though MPs will probably vote for the Yvette Cooper amendment next week, it is a bit harder to see that leading to a bill successfully getting through both Houses of Parliament.</p> <p><strong>3) Mainstream Tories who voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal earlier this month swallow their doubts and support her - panicked by the prospect of a no deal, and perhaps encouraged by some modest concessions from the EU.</strong> But there aren\u2019t enough of them so you would also need ...</p> <p><strong>4) Some Labour MPs start to line up behind May, also horrified by the prospect of what a no-deal Brexit might mean for their constituents.</strong></p> <p><strong>5) The EU blinks, and agrees to the key Tory Brexiter demand to abandon the backstop - or at least largely abandon it, perhaps in the form of subjecting it to a time limit.</strong></p> <p>(By now we\u2019re into the highly improbable. From here, it gets even more fanciful.)</p> <p><strong>6) A fundamental Conservative party split leads to May losing a vote of confidence, and a general election being called.</strong> (May could also decide to trigger one herself, although given that many of her candidates would refuse to commit to voting for her deal, it is very, very hard to see why she would.) But this would not necessarily avoid no deal forever, because it could just take us back to a hung parliament.</p> <p><strong>7) A government - perhaps May\u2019s, or perhaps one that emerges from a confidence vote - agrees to pass legislation for a second referendum, as a means of resolving the impasse. </strong>(The chances of MPs voting for a second referendum are a bit higher, but without a government committed to implementing legislation - which would be complicated - a vote alone would count for little.)</p> <p><strong>8) May strikes a deal with Labour MPs (perhaps Jeremy Corbyn, perhaps leading backbenchers), and comes up with a plan for a softish Brexit acceptable to at least 326 centrist Tory and Labour MPs.</strong> A deal with Corbyn would be taking us into government of national unity territory.</p> <p>So, in short, a no-deal Brexit can be stopped. But it is far from inevitable that it will be ...</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-24T17:48:24.943Z\">at 5.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c49e756e4b051f53796770b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-24T16:31:23.400Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier <strong>Richard Harrington</strong>, the business minister, seemed to challenge Theresa May to sack him, by saying that he would continue to speak out against a no-deal Brexit even if it led to him losing his job.

He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s relatively simple to extend until the 1st of July because the European elections and incoming MEPs don\u2019t take up their functions until the 2nd of July and it is more difficult and legally complicated to do it for longer than that ...</p> <p>As to how long the extension should be, there\u2019s room for discussion and argument.

      "bodyText": "Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has defied Number 10 by calling for Tory MPs to be given a free vote on amendments next week intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Rudd also refused to rule out resigning herself so as to be free to vote for Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment on this topic. (See 5.26pm.) Philip Hammond has told business leaders they need to accept the result of Britain\u2019s EU referendum and warned that a failure to implement it would damage the country\u2019s political stability. Ford has predicted that a no-deal Brexit will result in costs of $800m (\u00a3612m) during 2019 alone, in the latest in a series of stark warnings over potential disruption to British manufacturing. Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, has been charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and two of attempted rape. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has renewed her call for MPs to have a free vote next week on the amendments intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Number 10 has signalled this will not happen. But in an interview for Newsnight, being broadcast tonight, she said: At the moment there is a lot of change going on. I have called for a free vote for the amendments on Tuesday, and we\u2019ll see what position the government takes. She also refused to rule out resigning if ordered to vote against the Yvette Cooper amendment intended to allow MPs to block a no-deal Brexit. (See 1.05pm.) Asked if she would be willing to quit the government to vote for the amendment, she replied: I\u2019m going to stick to trying to persuade the government to allow it to be a free vote. There is a lot taking place and there are a lot of new amendments. We\u2019ll have to wait and see. In a speech in Davos Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said a no-deal Brexit would amount to a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. He said: In the 2016 referendum a promise was made to the majority who voted for Brexit \u2013 that they were voting for a more prosperous future. Not leaving would be seen as a betrayal of that referendum decision. But leaving without a deal would undermine our future prosperity, and would equally represent a betrayal of the promises that were made. And that is why I, having campaigned vigorously to remain, in the referendum have come to believe that the only credible and sustainable solution is for us to leave the European Union. To honour the referendum decision but to do so in a way that protects our economy in order to allow us to deliver that future prosperity that those voters were promised when they voted to leave the EU. The only sustainable solution is a negotiated settlement with the EU. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says, given Theresa May\u2019s refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit, Hammond should resign. In a statement he said: The chancellor must now surely consider his position in the government. Philip Hammond\u2019s comments today demonstrate he has acknowledged the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to our economy, jobs and living standards. If the prime minister fails to listen to his warnings and continues to refuse to take no deal off the table there is no other option, he must resign. May, like Hammond, has repeatedly said she does not want a no-deal Brexit, but she has refused to explicitly rule it out. She is worried that, if she were to do that, MPs would no longer feel under pressure to back her deal. Here is the question all Westminster, and half the EU, would like answered. It is from Spartakboro BTL. Yes, it can - but I think you are right to put the question in these terms. A lot of Westminster commentary is framed around the proposition that a no-deal Brexit would be so unthinkable that it is unthinkable - or at least, very unlikely. There is an assumption that rational actors will always act rationally. But (leaving aside the issue of whether all players in the Brexit drama do qualify as rational actors), history shows us that that is not always the case. World War One would be a classic example, Vietnam another. (That prompted a wonderful book about how some of the cleverest people ever to run a US administration could end up responsible for one of the biggest foreign policy disasters of all time.) That\u2019s why I agree with Sir Ivan Rogers, the most astute of all the Brexit commentators, who said in a lecture (pdf) on Tuesday that \u201cwe have reached an impasse and ... the risks are appreciably higher than either the markets or the commentariat believe.\u201d You\u2019ve got a good summary of the various intractables that make it hard to see how a no-deal Brexit can be avoided before 29 March. So how can it be stopped? In one sense it is quite simple; some of those involved who have put down red lines will have to abandon them. That happens all the time, and it explains why journalists are always on the alert for the slightest hint that a \u201cline\u201d is changing. But what makes this problematic is that several compromises might be necessary, and some of them are at the outer boundaries of probability. Here are various things that could happen that would led to a no-deal Brexit on 29 March being stopped, roughly in order of how likely they seem. (Some of them might occur in combination.) 1) May and the EU agree to extend article 50 just to buy more time. Both sides would be reluctant to do this, especially if there were no guarantee that delaying would help resolve the deadlock. But stopping the clock may seem preferable to going over the cliff. However, this does not necessarily avoid no deal. It might just postpone it. 2) Parliament forces May to apply for extra time. This is a variant of 1), but perhaps less likely because, even though MPs will probably vote for the Yvette Cooper amendment next week, it is a bit harder to see that leading to a bill successfully getting through both Houses of Parliament. 3) Mainstream Tories who voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal earlier this month swallow their doubts and support her - panicked by the prospect of a no deal, and perhaps encouraged by some modest concessions from the EU. But there aren\u2019t enough of them so you would also need ... 4) Some Labour MPs start to line up behind May, also horrified by the prospect of what a no-deal Brexit might mean for their constituents. 5) The EU blinks, and agrees to the key Tory Brexiter demand to abandon the backstop - or at least largely abandon it, perhaps in the form of subjecting it to a time limit. (By now we\u2019re into the highly improbable. From here, it gets even more fanciful.) 6) A fundamental Conservative party split leads to May losing a vote of confidence, and a general election being called. (May could also decide to trigger one herself, although given that many of her candidates would refuse to commit to voting for her deal, it is very, very hard to see why she would.) But this would not necessarily avoid no deal forever, because it could just take us back to a hung parliament. 7) A government - perhaps May\u2019s, or perhaps one that emerges from a confidence vote - agrees to pass legislation for a second referendum, as a means of resolving the impasse. (The chances of MPs voting for a second referendum are a bit higher, but without a government committed to implementing legislation - which would be complicated - a vote alone would count for little.) 8) May strikes a deal with Labour MPs (perhaps Jeremy Corbyn, perhaps leading backbenchers), and comes up with a plan for a softish Brexit acceptable to at least 326 centrist Tory and Labour MPs. A deal with Corbyn would be taking us into government of national unity territory. So, in short, a no-deal Brexit can be stopped. But it is far from inevitable that it will be ... Earlier Richard Harrington, the business minister, seemed to challenge Theresa May to sack him, by saying that he would continue to speak out against a no-deal Brexit even if it led to him losing his job. (See 12.12pm.) Well, Theresa May has not taken the bait. At the afternoon lobby briefing, asked if May still had full confidence in Harrington, the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cYes.\u201d She added: The prime minister expects ministers to be focused on getting the government\u2019s deal through. And Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has also been at Davos. As RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly reports, Varadkar said, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Northern Ireland would have to remain in full regulatory and customs alignment with the EU anyway, to comply with the terms of the Good Friday agreement. In response, Nigel Dodds, the DUP deputy leader, has accused Varadkar of being wrong and unhelpful. In a statement Dodds said: We want the 2016 referendum result to be honoured and leave the European Union through a sensible deal which works for every part of the United Kingdom and also our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland. I reject Leo Varadkar\u2019s analysis. It is not a constructive contribution when we are focused on trying to reach a consensus. In any case, the Taoiseach\u2019s comments about the Belfast agreement actually ride a coach and horses through that agreement. Mr Varadkar is evidently and understandably concerned about the impact of a \u2018no deal\u2019 on the Republic of Ireland but this is a time to tone down the rhetoric and keep cool heads. Darren McCaffrey from Euronews has been monitoring what EU leaders at Davos have been saying about Brexit. Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian president, said the EU would agree to a short extension of article 50. But the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, said a no-deal Brexit would be better than a lengthy extension of article 50. The Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable has renewed his call for an extension of article 50. In a statement he said: The warning from Airbus is a stark reminder that the livelihoods of thousands of British workers are at risk from the UK leaving the EU with no deal. The longer the prime minister runs down the clock and fails to give businesses certainty to plan, the greater the risk to jobs. An extension of article 50 is now the only responsible course and the government should back a people\u2019s vote and give the public the final say with an option to remain in the EU. Brexit has replaced the NHS as the biggest concern for British voters, according to a review of polling trends. As the Press Association reports, EU withdrawal is cited as a major issue facing the country by 53% of people, according to the Ipsos MORI index review of 2018. The seven point rise in concern over Brexit pushed worries about the NHS into second place on 45% - a drop of 2% on the previous year. Concern about crime rose seven points over the year to stand at 19%, equal with immigration. The number of people citing immigration as a major issue dropped by seven points over the year, a trend that began after immigration was named as the biggest issue facing the country in 2015. The figures were compiled from data produced by Ipsos MORI in 12 waves during 2018. Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, was the fourth union leader to meet Theresa May to discuss Brexit. He saw her earlier this afternoon, and as he came out he issued this statement. He said: I\u2019m afraid to say the prime minister today failed to give us the guarantees we need over protecting jobs and rights at work. The concerns from members and their employers are mounting by the day as the clock runs down, and yet the prime minister is still refusing to take her threat of no deal off the table. We can\u2019t carry on like this. As this crisis worsens, pretending nothing has changed is simply not good enough. The current deal doesn\u2019t cut it. It pleases no one. We need a permanent customs union, legally binding commitments to workers\u2019 rights that can\u2019t be ignored or ripped up by a future Tory government and a policy agenda that tackles the reasons people voted to leave in the first place. I asked for an extension to article 50 but sadly the prime minister did not agree. The leaders of the UK\u2019s two largest unions have told Theresa May to delay Brexit by extending article 50. In separate meetings with the prime minister, Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey and Unison\u2019s Dave Prentis also told her that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic. Speaking afterwards, McCluskey said he did not think any British PM would take the UK out of the EU with no deal because the impact would be so disastrous. (See 1.41pm.) He said: I have also made it clear that, in my opinion, if she is serious about negotiating and seeing if there\u2019s a deal that has support in parliament, then there has to be an extension of article 50. And Prentis, after his meeting with the PM, said that \u201can extension of article 50 is essential to bring the country back from the brink and the calamity of a no deal\u201d. He explained: A no-deal Brexit must be avoided at all costs and the Prime Minister needs to rule this out immediately. Crashing out of Europe would be catastrophic for the economy, public services and everyone who works in our schools, hospitals, town halls and police forces. However people voted in June 2016, no-one - especially those who are just about managing - was choosing to be worse off. The country is desperate for politicians to find a solution to the deadlock paralysing the country. McCluskey has said that, although he favours extending article 50, the nine-month extension proposed in the Yvette Cooper bill would be too long. Instead a three-month extension would be better, he argued. (See 1.41pm.) Labour is expected to support the bill, but Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has hinted that this could be on the understanding that it would only be used to implement a three-month article 50 extension, not the nine-month one originally proposed in the bill. (See 1.05pm.) A cross-party amendment to push for a second EU referendum will not be tabled in the Commons as it would have little chance of being passed without formal support from Labour, the MPs organising it have announced. Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, has been arrested and charged by police. Airbus has branded the UK government\u2019s handling of Brexit a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and warned the aerospace firm could pull out of the UK if the country crashes out of the EU without a deal. Richard Harrington, the business minister, has effectively challenged May to sack him by publicly applauding the Airbus statement. (See 12.12pm.) The international trade minister George Hollingbery has admitted that the government has not yet signed any of the 40 trade deals needed to replicate the EU trade deals that benefit the UK after 29 March in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But, in response to a Commons urgent question, Hollingbery said \u201cthe majority\u201d of those deals would be in place by March. Labour\u2019s Chris Leslie said Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, was breaking a promise he made in 2017. Leslie said: I\u2019d like to ask the secretary of state if the UK will maintain all our existing free trade agreements one second after midnight on Brexit day. With just 64 days to go, will he confirm there is not only the well-known Brexit risk of a catastrophic disruption to 44% of our trade but that now, on top of that, a further 12% of our trade could be thrown into chaos because of the government\u2019s failure to roll over our 40 trade agreements with 70 countries in time for exit day. Does he recall the promise made by [Fox] at his party conference in October 2017 when he boasted \u2018I hear people saying we won\u2019t have any FTAs before we leave - well believe me we\u2019ll have up to 40 ready for one second after midnight in March 2019\u2019. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has restated his claim that MPs have to choose a Brexit option they want if they hope to avoid a no-deal Brexit in March. Speaking to DLF radio, he said: What we have now is a double majority against the deal on the one hand and against the no deal on the other. But we need something that is positively accepted as an agreement .. In order to avoid this difficulty of leaving without an agreement, this no-deal, it is not enough [for MPs] to vote against the no-deal. No, you have to vote for a contract, an agreement. If nothing moves, if no positive suggestions are put on the table, then we will be heading for a more or less bumpy or accidental no-deal on March 30. JCB paid Boris Johnson \u00a310,000 three days before he gave a speech at its headquarters last week in which he repeatedly praised the company\u2019s business acumen and innovation, it has emerged. Here are some more lines from what Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, told reporters after his meeting in Number 10 with Theresa May. McCluskey said he urged May to avoid a no-deal Brext at all costs. He also said he thought no British prime minister would adopting that policy. He said: I can\u2019t conceive any British prime minister taking us out of Europe with a no deal. It would be catastrophic. She\u2019s been told that from all parts. He also said May should agree to extend article 50. He said: I have also made it clear that, in my opinion, if she is serious about negotiating and seeing if there\u2019s a deal that has support in parliament, then there has to be an extension of article 50. He said that the thought the plan in the Yvette Cooper bill to extend article 50 for nine months (see 1.05pm) was \u201ca bit long\u201d. A three-month extension would be better, he said. He explained: We have to give a clear indication that the referendum result, that people are not trying to dismiss it by stealth. He said he told May that he hoped she was not just meeting him as a PR stunt. She said: What I was saying to the prime minister was, \u2018Is this just a PR stunt for the media, for you to say that you have consulted with trade unions? Or is this a genuine attempt to see if we can talk about issues that matter to us?\u2019 He said May\u2019s approach justified Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision not to meet her for Brexit talks. He said: I think Jeremy Corbyn did the correct thing. I think he was vindicated by not coming to the meetings. The SNP, the Liberal Democrats looked rather stupid by going in. In fact, it needed Nicola Sturgeon to step in and save face. Explaining what it right for him to meet May, but not for Corbyn to meet her, McCluskey said the issues were different; he headed a union, but Corbyn led a political party. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has released a statement supporting the decision by the MPs who support its call for a second referendum not to push the matter to a vote next week. Instead it urged MPs to support the various amendments intended to stop a no-deal Brexit. Explaining its position, the pro-European Conservative Guto Bebb said: None of these amendments would, in themselves, bring about a people\u2019s vote and all of them will gain votes from MPs who currently do not support our campaign. But they would give parliament the time and space it needs, without the threat of a deadline or no deal, to make an honest assessment of different versions of Brexit. It is surely right that these are given serious consideration and that they are subject to the same minimal standards of scrutiny that has led so many MPs already to conclude they could not support the government\u2019s plan. We believe there is no form of Brexit that can fulfil the promises made in 2016, represents a better deal than the one we\u2019ve got inside Europe or will prevent this crisis going on forever. When every route to Brexit has been examined and exhausted will it become clear the only way forward is to hand the final decision back to the British public through a people\u2019s vote. Nicola Sturgeon has spoken to reporters on leaving the Holyrood chamber after first minister\u2019s questions, and she said that the news of Alex Salmond\u2019s arrest would be \u201ca shock to many people\u201d. She urged the media and public to understand why she could not comment further on live criminal proceedings. She said: Obviously this news this morning will be a shock to many people but, as Police Scotland have made clear, these are now live criminal proceedings and that means, now more than ever, it would be completely inappropriate for me - or anyone else for that matter - to make any comment on the situation. And I hope both you as members of the media, and the wider public, will understand the reasons why I cannot comment any further at this stage. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has argued strongly against holding a second referendum, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. Speaking at the CBI\u2019s annual lunch in Davos, Hammond said it was important for trust in the political system for the 2016 vote to be respected.There is more on our Davos live blog. Labour has strongly hinted that it will back the Yvette Cooper amendment next week intended to block a no-deal Brexit if MPs cannot agree a Brexit deal, but Jeremy Corbyn said today the party will take a final decision nearer the time. During a visit to Wolverton, near Milton Keynes, he said: We will decide at the time whether we fully support it or not. I had a very good meeting, a very useful meeting, with Yvette Cooper yesterday. I understand what she is saying, there is a lot of merit in it. We, as a party, will make a decision. Under the bill, if MPs have not approved a deal by 26 February, the prime minister would be required to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of 2019. Some senior Labour figures want the bill to propose a three-month article 50 extension, not a nine-month one. This would reduce the chances of the party being accused of trying to halt Brexit. On ITV\u2019s Peston show last night Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, admitted there was a case for three months instead of nine months. He explained: It\u2019s relatively simple to extend until the 1st of July because the European elections and incoming MEPs don\u2019t take up their functions until the 2nd of July and it is more difficult and legally complicated to do it for longer than that ... As to how long the extension should be, there\u2019s room for discussion and argument. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s getting fixated by the date. What people are saying by the length of any extension, what people are saying is they recognise the difficulties if it were to be beyond the 1st of July. The House of Commons library has produced a briefing on the Cooper bill which you can read here (pdf). The Scottish parliament\u2019s presiding officer - the Holyrood equivalent of the Commons speaker - Ken Mackintosh noted the reports of the arrest of former first minister Alex Salmond and warned MSPs that proceedings are now active at the start of this week\u2019s first minister\u2019s questions. Instead Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, was challenged on the record of Glasgow\u2019s super-hospital, where it has emerged a 10-year-old boy died last month after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings, which was found to be a contributing factor in his death. Referring to her Brexit discussions with Theresa May yesterday afternoon, Sturgeon said that the prime minister \u201crefused to really listen to any of the concerns we brought\u201d, and reiterated her call for May to pause article 50 and hold a second referendum on EU membership. This is from Christina Rees, the shadow Welsh secretary, on the Airbus warning about a no-deal Brexit. (See 9.12am.) Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has just come out of Number 10 after his talks with Theresa May. He says she should have talked to the unions earlier, he says he would like to see article 50 extended for about three months, and he backs the Labour position as set down in the amendment it has tabled for next week\u2019s debate. He says May did not indicate that she was open to changing her mind, and he says that vindicates Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision not to meet her. He says his position is different; he runs a union, not a political party. He says most of the Airbus workers are Unite members. The Airbus warning this morning shows how disastrous a no-deal Brexit would be, he says. Richard Harrington, the business minister, said this morning he was \u201cdelighted\u201d when he read the boss of Airbus branding the UK government\u2019s handling of Brexit a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. Speaking to an audience of German industrialists, he said that no deal must be stopped and he was prepared to be sacked for saying so. This is a disaster for business and business needs to know where it is, and that doesn\u2019t mean, \u2018Oh great, two weeks before we are leaving, now we can rule out crashing out.\u2019 I really don\u2019t believe in this idea. I am very happy to be public about it and very happy if the prime minister decides I am not the right person to do the business industry job. [A no-deal Brexit] would be a total disaster for the economy, I was delighted to read Airbus\u2019s comments this morning because it is telling it like it is. Harrington, who has previously said that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201can absolute disaster\u201d and that he would resign if the government opted for one, was speaking at a gathering of German Industry UK at the German industry in London. He said Brexit was already threatening jobs in the car industry. I do believe time is of the essence here. If I could put myself in the head of Ralf Speth [chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover], they must be placing order for parts now; ordering eight to 10 weeks ahead. It is quite reasonable to expect if they know they can bring them in or not. This is not theory, this is real time. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said Theresa May should delay Brexit until at least July to allow time for further talks. Speaking to journalists after meeting May in Number 10 to discuss the issue, he said: It is in everyone\u2019s interest to extend article 50 until at least the summer. He also said he wanted May to \u201cmove away from appeasing the right wing of the Tory party\u201d and considering the interests of the \u201cjust about managing\u201d families she spoke about when she first became prime minister. He said: Most of our members are just about managing. They cannot afford for this country to fall off a cliff. Earlier I flagged up an Irish Independent story saying the Irish police had drawn up emergency plans to deploy hundreds of uniformed garda\u00ed at the border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (See 10.02pm.) It has now been denied. At business questions in the Commons Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, asked if the February half-term recess was still going ahead. There have been repeated reports saying it will be abandoned, because MPs will need more time to pass Brexit legislation. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said the half-term recess has not been cancelled - or, at least, not yet. She said the plan for the House to rise on Thursday 14 February and return on Monday 24 February \u201cis and does remain the position\u201d. But she said this would have to be confirmed by a Commons vote, meaning there is still time for the mini recess to be abandoned. Ireland will have 400 new customs officers in place by the end of March as it rushes to put no-deal measures in place to keep trade moving with Great Britain, according to an unpublished document from the Irish tax authority. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll has the story here. In the Commons the Labour MP Chris Leslie asked an urgent question about whether the government would replicate the trade deals that the UK benefits from as a member of the EU in time for Brexit on 29 March. Claiming the government was willing to allow \u201ccatastrophic disruption\u201d to UK trade, Leslie said: Will he face reality, slay those fantasy unicorn promises and admit that Brexit is not going well and presents a clear and present danger to the free trade agreements our economy so desperately relies on? In response, the international trade minister George Hollingbery said he could not reveal \u201cconfidential conversations\u201d of talks on trade agreements. But he insisted: I believe the majority of those will be in place by March 29th and I continue to believe that is the case. And here is the formal statement that the TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady issued after her Brexit meeting with Theresa May earlier. (See 11.03am.) O\u2019Grady said: The prime minister hasn\u2019t given us the guarantees we need on jobs or workers\u2019 rights. Tweaks aren\u2019t enough - we need substantial change to the whole deal. But even after a catastrophic defeat, her red lines haven\u2019t shifted, and the threat of no deal hasn\u2019t even been taken off the table. And if she won\u2019t change her position, how can we change ours? Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister who is opposed to Brexit and calling for a second referendum, has said that he thinks the chances of a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d being held are now higher than 50%. Speaking at Davos, when asked if he stood by a previous statement saying there was a \u201c50/50 chance\u201d of it happening, he replied: No, I would say it\u2019s probably somewhat increased, but I mean when I said 50% most people would have said that\u2019s ridiculously optimistic. Speaking to Reuters, Blair said if the country went ahead with Brexit, the choice was \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d. There were two options, he said: A Brexit that\u2019s pointless - staying close to Europe\u2019s rules, becoming a rule taker - or a Brexit that\u2019s painful, if you break out of the European system that we\u2019d been trading in for four and a half decades. The reason we\u2019ve got this problem in the British parliament is that the real options have dawned on the members of parliament and therefore there\u2019s not really a majority at the moment for any Brexit proposition. There\u2019s not yet a majority for a second referendum but I think it\u2019s possible there will be. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said she did not get the assurances she was hoping for on workers\u2019 rights in her meeting at Number 10 with Theresa May. Speaking to reporters as she left, she said: The prime minister should do the right thing and take a no-deal off the table so that genuine dialogue can take place. I was looking for guarantees on workers\u2019 rights now and into the future. We have a prime minister on a temporary contract- she cannot bind the hands of a future prime minister. People wanting her job are on record as saying Brexit is an opportunity to reduce workers\u2019 rights. The prime minister should stop listening to the bad boys at the back of the class. More time is needed for genuine talks. Although the MPs backing the People\u2019s Vote campaign are not going to table their second referendum amendment ahead of the Brexit vote next week, the Lib Dems have tabled an amendment calling for one. The Lib Dem amendment says: Line 1, leave out from \u201cHouse\u201d to end and add \u201cinstructs the government to take all necessary steps to rule out a no-deal scenario and prepare for a people\u2019s vote in which the public will have the option to remain in the European Union on the ballot paper. Commenting on his party\u2019s move, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: For over two years the Liberal Democrats have been leading the charge for a people\u2019s vote. We know people are increasing concerned about the national embarrassment Brexit has become, which is why we have tabled an amendment that would give people the final say on Brexit. There is still time to act in the national interest. Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership must stop dreaming up more and more creative excuses for refusing to support a people\u2019s vote, which their members and supporters want. The Lib Dems are hoping that other MPs who back a second referendum, particularly from Labour, will support their amendment. But so far the only MPs how have signed it are Lib Dem MPs. Although the Lib Dem amendment is on the order paper (pdf), there is no guarantee that it will be called. John Bercow, the speaker, takes into account the amount of support there is for amendments when deciding which ones to put to a vote and there are already 14 amendments on the order paper (far more than he will call), most of which have more support than the Lib Dem one. A second referendum backed by MPs supporting the People\u2019s Vote campaign would have had a much greater chance of being put to a vote because it would have been cross-party and would, even without the official backing of the Labour party, have received the backing of dozens of Labour MPs. Here is the full statement from Sarah Wollaston on the decision not to table the second referendum amendment. This is what the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said at the press briefing outside the Houses of Parliament by People\u2019s Vote suppoters. (See 10.14am.) She said: With great regret, we will not be laying [an amendment calling for a second referendum] because at this stage, and until we have the leader of the opposition\u2019s backing, it would would not pass. And this is what the Labour MP Luciana Berger said: As things stand, we have just 30 sittings days of parliament until we are due to exit the European Union. There is no consensus across the House of Commons, and there is an urgent need for leadership. We have seen the worst parliamentary defeat of any government. But the prime minister insists on pursing a dud deal that cannot command the majority support of MPs in the House of Commons ... Regrettably, the Labour leadership won\u2019t commit to an achievable policy. And yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal. At a time when Labour should be championing a people\u2019s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call. Because the Labour leadership will not back a people\u2019s vote, there will not be a vote on a cross-party people\u2019s vote amendment next week. This is not good enough. Labour should be clearly setting out a different course, not facilitating a job-destroying Brexit. The Unite union has said Brexiters should not ignore today\u2019s warning from Airbus. In a statement, its assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: No-deal Brexit fantasists should pay heed to this strongest warning yet from Airbus, a powerhouse of UK manufacturing and a central support to local and regional economies across the UK. The consequences of a no deal Brexit on the future of the UK\u2019s world leading aerospace sector, its integrated supply chain and wider manufacturing would be catastrophic. Tens of thousands of decent well paid skilled jobs that support families and represent the backbone of communities across the country, are caught in the crossfire of a no-deal face-off which could deny future generations the hope and opportunity of high quality, well paid, apprenticeships into skilled work. In an announcement outside the Houses of Parliament, leading supporters of the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum, the Tory Sarah Wollaston and the Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger, have announced that they will not be tabling an amendment to the Brexit motion being debated on Tuesday calling for a second referendum. They don\u2019t want to call a vote until they think they have the numbers to win. The Irish police (or Garda) are have drawn up emergency plans to deploy hundreds of uniformed garda\u00ed at the border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Irish Independent reports. It says: The Irish Independent understands that the plans were discussed yesterday at a high-level meeting between Garda commissioner Drew Harris and senior staff at Garda HQ in the Phoenix Park. Sources have revealed 600 garda\u00ed will be required to man the estimated 300 border crossings along the 500km frontier in the event the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal. UPDATE: The Garda have now issued a denial. David Campbell Bannerman (see 9.40am) is not the only Tory Brexiter to dismiss today\u2019s warning from Airbus about a no-deal Brexit. On the Today programme David Jones, the former Welsh secretary, said he did not think it was likely that the Airbus plant at Broughton in north Wales, that employs 6,000 people, could close. He explained: Tom Enders has made threats such as this for some time. But he knows that a large proportion of his very loyal workforce in Broughton actually voted to leave the European Union ... [Enders is] in an industry that is very fortunate in that there are no tariffs imposed on aircraft, and indeed on most aircraft components. So to that extent his industry does not have he problems of disruption that other industries might have. Certainly, there might be some issue over border checks. But that is something that can be overcome, just as it is overcome at the moment for all those components that Airbus import from other parts of the world than the European Union. In the Commons Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is taking questions, and he has just been asked by the Labour MP Jo Stevens to condemn this comment from David Campbell Bannerman, a Conservative MEP, about Airbus. Barclay said he did not agree with Campbell Bannerman. He took the views of Airbus seriously, he said. But he stressed that Airbus backed Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. There are two urgent questions in the Commons today. Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, has been arrested by police and will appear in court on Thursday afternoon, according to early reports. My colleague Severin Carrell has more here. Here is Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, commenting on the Airbus announcement. Airbus, which manufacturers aircraft wings in the UK and employs 14,000 people in the country, has said that it could close factories here in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Tom Enders, the company\u2019s chief executive, has spoken out about Brexit before, but this warning may be his starkest yet. In a video message he said: Please don\u2019t listen to the Brexiteers\u2019 madness which asserts that \u2018because we have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be here\u2019. They are wrong. Of course it is not possible to pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately. However, aerospace is a long-term business and we could be forced to redirect future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit. And, make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft. He also said it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that the government could not even say yet what was happening. In a global economy the UK no longer has the capability to go it alone. Major aerospace projects are multinational affairs. It is a disgrace that, more than two years after the result of the 2016 referendum, businesses are still unable to plan properly for the future. We, along with many of our peers, have repeatedly called for clarity, but we still have no idea what is really going on here. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the full story here. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Theresa May meets the TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady as part of her Brexit cross-party talks. Later May is meeting the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, the Unison general secretary Dave Prentis, and the GMB general secretary Tim Roache. 9.30am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, takes business questions in the Commons. Lunchtime: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, speaks at a CBI event at Davos. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering this on his Davos live blog. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Lagarde said she was \u201ca strong believer in incentive schemes, but added: \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing some incentive systems in some corners of the financial sector, yet again, moving in a direction that I find not exactly aligned with a sense of purpose that I hope banks actually have.\u201d The IMF managing director did not name any individual banks. Lagarde explained that the public now demands that banks have a greater purpose beyond the bottom line. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that loud and clear from civil society, from the millennials, from many, many corners around the planet and I think any sector, the financial sector alike, has to have that purpose. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be single-mindedly the pursuit of profit, it has to be multifaceted and it has to take into account multiple stakeholders.\u201d The IMF boss, who famously said that the banking collapse would have looked much differently if it had been \u201cLehman Sisters\u201d rather than Lehman Brothers dominating Wall Street, also took gender imbalance to task. \u201cThe numbers are just appalling \u2026 you have 20% of board members in the financial sector who are women, and you only have 2% of CEOs who are women.\u201d She said it was \u201cbusiness common sense\u2026 that diversity actually precipitates productivity and is good for all\u201d. She added: \u201cThere should be significant changes, we\u2019re not seeing much of that and I hope the financial sector takes that approach seriously.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Art critic, geologist, botanist, Alpinist, architectural theorist and social reformer \u2013 maybe even revolutionary \u2013 John Ruskin gazes with troubled intensity from a watercolour portrait that dates from when he was on the verge of losing his mind. Half his face is in shadow, the other in mountain sunlight. His blue-green eyes stare almost too intently. There\u2019s something wrong behind them. The following year, over Christmas 1876 in his beloved Venice, Ruskin would start to hallucinate. Breakdowns would follow and he eventually withdrew from the world, cared for at home on a healthy inheritance from his wine merchant father, until his death in 1900. Ruskin\u2019s manic portrait, attributed to Charles Fairfax Murray but quite possibly the critic\u2019s own work, fits well into the late-Victorian interior of Two Temple Place, laden with rich wooden carvings, panelling and stained glass. Or does it? It\u2019s safe to say its architect was influenced by Ruskin\u2019s gothic vision of architecture. Yet it\u2019s an equally safe guess that Ruskin would have loathed it, for this neo-Tudor fantasy was created for the American millionaire William Waldorf Astor. In his book The Stones of Venice, the bible of the gothic revival, Ruskin denounces the very opulence and selfishness this building represents. Medieval gothic, for him, is an art of communal togetherness, created by a morally superior age that respected honest work and condemned capitalist usury. And there, in a nutshell, is the reason for today\u2019s Ruskin revival. In the late 20th century, Ruskin was considered a bit of a joke.

Despite having made more than 50 appearances for his boyhood club, he was playing for Reading\u2019s reserve side when Harris watched him in an under-23s match against Everton.</p> <p>\u201cThe manager came to the game and he liked me. I knew Reading wanted to get me out on loan and I had a couple of choices but Millwall was always the one that stood out for me. I couldn\u2019t tell you how he found me, though. You\u2019d have to ask him!\u201d</p> <p>Millwall achieved promotion to League One via the play-offs in 2017 and Cooper was pictured riding home from Wembley wearing his medal on a Boris bike with teammate Byron Webster, who later revealed it was an attempt to beat London\u2019s notoriously bad traffic. A 17-match unbeaten run in the Championship culminated in the club falling just three points short of reaching the play-offs again last season and, having moved away from the bottom three in recent weeks, they appear to be finding form at just the right time. In-form Hull were dispatched in the previous round.</p> <p>\u201cWe went on a great run last year when we were fresh to the league when I don\u2019t think teams were used to coming to the Den and feeling the pressure we put on them,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cBut they\u2019ve worked us out a bit now and come up with ways of stopping us so we have had to think of a different plan sometimes.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was a hangover from last season \u2013 if you overachieve then it\u2019s always difficult to repeat that. Burnley have had the same problem this year in the Premier League. Teams clock on to what you are doing and realise that you\u2019re actually a top team rather than taking it a bit easier against us because we were new to the division. We have to show our character and combat teams when they are set up better to defend against us.\u201d</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/21/millwall-close-agreement-lewisham-council-stay-at-the-den\" title=\"\">the news this week</a> that Millwall are close to reaching an agreement with Lewisham council to secure their long-term future at the Den after fears they could be forced out by a compulsory purchase scheme, the timing of Everton\u2019s visit could not be better for the home supporters to celebrate. Cooper is relishing the prospect of playing in front of a packed house on Saturday and knows exactly how some of Marco Silva\u2019s players will feel when they run out of the tunnel.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on the bench as an away player and heard some of the abuse that you get. I can understand why it\u2019s so intimidating for other players and especially when the top teams come here. A sold-out Den is special for us as Millwall players and certainly makes it difficult for the other team. Playing against a top Premier League side at home is a great chance for us to show ourselves and see what we can do.\u201d</p>",

The loyalty that the club has shown to me since I came and the help they have given me here has been magnificent.\u201d Cooper, a perfect example of Millwall\u2019s smart recruitment under Harris, arrived initially on loan in January 2017 before moving permanently that summer. Despite having made more than 50 appearances for his boyhood club, he was playing for Reading\u2019s reserve side when Harris watched him in an under-23s match against Everton. \u201cThe manager came to the game and he liked me. I knew Reading wanted to get me out on loan and I had a couple of choices but Millwall was always the one that stood out for me. I couldn\u2019t tell you how he found me, though. You\u2019d have to ask him!\u201d Millwall achieved promotion to League One via the play-offs in 2017 and Cooper was pictured riding home from Wembley wearing his medal on a Boris bike with teammate Byron Webster, who later revealed it was an attempt to beat London\u2019s notoriously bad traffic. A 17-match unbeaten run in the Championship culminated in the club falling just three points short of reaching the play-offs again last season and, having moved away from the bottom three in recent weeks, they appear to be finding form at just the right time. In-form Hull were dispatched in the previous round. \u201cWe went on a great run last year when we were fresh to the league when I don\u2019t think teams were used to coming to the Den and feeling the pressure we put on them,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cBut they\u2019ve worked us out a bit now and come up with ways of stopping us so we have had to think of a different plan sometimes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was a hangover from last season \u2013 if you overachieve then it\u2019s always difficult to repeat that. Burnley have had the same problem this year in the Premier League. Teams clock on to what you are doing and realise that you\u2019re actually a top team rather than taking it a bit easier against us because we were new to the division. We have to show our character and combat teams when they are set up better to defend against us.\u201d After the news this week that Millwall are close to reaching an agreement with Lewisham council to secure their long-term future at the Den after fears they could be forced out by a compulsory purchase scheme, the timing of Everton\u2019s visit could not be better for the home supporters to celebrate. Cooper is relishing the prospect of playing in front of a packed house on Saturday and knows exactly how some of Marco Silva\u2019s players will feel when they run out of the tunnel. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the bench as an away player and heard some of the abuse that you get. I can understand why it\u2019s so intimidating for other players and especially when the top teams come here. A sold-out Den is special for us as Millwall players and certainly makes it difficult for the other team. Playing against a top Premier League side at home is a great chance for us to show ourselves and see what we can do.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Comedians like to trade stories about the bladder-squeezing agony of walking on to a stage to perform standup for the first time. For Liv Hill, the experience had extra layers of terror. First, she is not a comedian; she was acting the part in Jellyfish, a Ken Loach-ish drama from director James Gardner. Hill \u2013 who was 16 at the time \u2013 plays Sarah Taylor, a gobby, disadvantaged Margate teenager whose raw comedy talent is spotted by her drama teacher. Second, the film\u2019s tiny budget didn\u2019t stretch to extras, so the crew pulled in 50 people off the street to be the audience. Then, as if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, on the morning of the shoot, Hill woke up to five new pages of script. Gardner had rewritten her monologue overnight. \u201cWe started shooting at 12 noon. I was crapping myself.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, it was all right on the night. A joke or three landed, and there were some laughs in the crowd. \u201cBut I did get a real heckler,\u201d Hill says, giggling. \u201cI was in character, so I didn\u2019t feel crushed.

She added: \u201cThese are now live criminal proceedings and that means now more than ever it would be completely inappropriate for me or anyone else for that matter to make any comment on the situation.\u201d Salmond was charged on Wednesday night after voluntarily attending a police station with his solicitor, and he was released after agreeing to appear in court. Salmond, an MP and MSP for three decades, led the SNP into government in Edinburgh for the first time. He went on to win a landslide Holyrood election victory that led to a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014. The result of the 2014 referendum \u2013 a 55% to 45% vote to stay in the UK \u2013 led to him stepping down as first minister and SNP leader. He went on to serve as the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster before losing his seat there in 2017 after Theresa May\u2019s snap general election. Last year he faced an internal investigation by the Scottish government into complaints against him. He consistently denied any criminal misconduct. In early January, Salmond won a significant legal victory against the Scottish government after the civil service admitted its internal investigation into the complaints had been mishandled. It emerged that the senior personnel expert who led the formal investigation, Judith MacKinnon, deputy head of human resources with the Scottish government, had spoken to the complainants before they filed their official complaints. The Scottish government acknowledged this was in breach of its rules, was unlawful and had the appearance of bias. In his statement to the media outside court on Thursday, Salmond said: \u201cIn September, shortly after I became aware of a police investigation, my solicitors wrote on my instruction to Police Scotland indicating that I was happy to meet them. \u201cYesterday, by prior agreement and consistent with my previous offers, I voluntarily attended a police station with my solicitor. I cooperated fully with the police. I was released by the police after interview and agreed to attend court today. \u201cI have always maintained that I have never engaged in criminality and that remains my position. I said throughout the judicial review that it would be inappropriate to comment further until the conclusion of that case and I did not do so until I gave my full statement on the steps of the court of session two weeks ago. \u201cFaithful to that principle, and given that the case is live, I am obviously not able to say anything more at this stage other than to reiterate that I absolutely refute any allegations of criminality.\u201d",

Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, apologised \u201cprofoundly and unconditionally\u201d and said he took responsibility for the church\u2019s failures in relation to the Bell case. The climbdown came as an investigation by an ecclesiastical lawyer concluded that further allegations made a year ago about Bell, who died in 1958, were unfounded. The C of E\u2019s actions in relation to the original allegation of abuse caused a furious response from Bell\u2019s supporters, who said the church had condemned the former bishop of Chichester as a paedophile on flimsy evidence. Bell was regarded as a hero for his controversial criticism of the RAF bombing of German civilians in the second world war and his role in organising the Kindertransport rescue of Jewish children from the Nazis. An institute founded in his name in 1996 described Bell as \u201ca friend of the oppressed\u201d, and he was honoured with an Anglican holy day. But in 2015, the C of E apologised and paid compensation to a woman, \u201cCarol\u201d, who claimed she had been abused by Bell almost seven decades earlier when she was five. Two years later, an inquiry by Alex Carlile QC criticised the church for a \u201crush to judgment\u201d in its handling of Carol\u2019s allegation.

Our eyes \u2013 and cameras \u2013 are diverted by the horizon-to-horizon wild beauty of this remnant piece of natural Earth in northeast Tasmania.</p> <p>But this area is as geographically beautiful as it is historically tragic. For thousands of years this coastline at the top of Australia\u2019s island state was the pristine and peaceful home for a community of the Palawa people.</p> <p>Then in 1803 the British colony in Sydney sent 49 soldiers and convicts to set up a Tasmanian outlier at Hobart, 300 kilometres to the south of Wukalina. The colony expanded and within three decades all but 150 of the 15,000 Palawa had been shot or died from European diseases to which they had no resistance.<br><br>Word of the first British massacre at Hobart Town in 1803 would have reached the Wukalina coast within days.

Our eyes \u2013 and cameras \u2013 are diverted by the horizon-to-horizon wild beauty of this remnant piece of natural Earth in northeast Tasmania. But this area is as geographically beautiful as it is historically tragic. For thousands of years this coastline at the top of Australia\u2019s island state was the pristine and peaceful home for a community of the Palawa people. Then in 1803 the British colony in Sydney sent 49 soldiers and convicts to set up a Tasmanian outlier at Hobart, 300 kilometres to the south of Wukalina. The colony expanded and within three decades all but 150 of the 15,000 Palawa had been shot or died from European diseases to which they had no resistance. Word of the first British massacre at Hobart Town in 1803 would have reached the Wukalina coast within days. But what could the First Tasmanians do? Hurling their spears to fight the overwhelming power of guns (perhaps 200 of the invaders were killed), the Palawa died in their thousands. An 1830 visitor to the Wukalina region recorded that \u201c\u2026 at every boat harbour along the whole line of coast the bones of the murdered aborigines are strewed over the face of the earth and bleaching in the sun\u201d. Yet not all of them died. A few score women were taken by British and American sealers to the islands in Bass Strait that separate Tasmania from the Australian continent. Today there are 10,000 Palawa from this matrilineal ancestry and they are reclaiming their birthright, language, customs and lands. There is no better way to learn about this saga of clawback from the brink of oblivion than to take the three-night four-day Aboriginal-owned and operated Wukalina Walk. After morning tea at the Aboriginal Elders\u2019 Centre in Tasmania\u2019s second city, Launceston, and a two-hour drive to the end of the road, we walk east in constant warm rain which makes the xanthareas (grass trees) glow.

Jacob is tall, efficient and ever-cheerful, even when telling us of a previous tour group that derided Palawa customs and complained there was not enough red wine.

The many tens of thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their non-Indigenous supporters who march annually \u2013 in numbers at least as great as those Australians who\u2019d turn out to commemorate Anzac Day \u2013 are testimony to that.</p> <p>But in the media/political to-and-fro over another date, the real Australian malaise is all but forgotten. And that is: until Australia deals with the unfinished business of Aboriginal sovereignty and historical truth telling there will be no appropriate date upon which to celebrate a supposedly unified nation.</p> <p>Until Australia reaches a black/white settlement over sovereignty, through commonwealth and state treaties and a formal process of historical reckoning, it\u2019s pointless marking other dates on the calendar. I\u2019m confident that 26 January will be junked as Australia Day but I\u2019m less assured, and sadly so, that I\u2019ll witness that reckoning. And I\u2019m not planning on going anywhere soon.</p> <p>Reconciliation, like Australia Day, is a political construct grown from <a href=\"https://www.reconciliation.org.au/\">the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation</a>, established in 1991 to bring black and white together. It\u2019s a misnomer, albeit one that\u2019s embedded \u2013 to the detriment of integral Australian history \u2013 in political and media vernacular.</p> <p>The talk should be of \u201cconciliation\u201d, because there has not yet been a first step \u2013 nothing resembling a reckoning or a settlement. You can\u2019t reconcile without an initial conciliation.</p> <p>Henry Reynolds, the living Australian historian who has, perhaps, done more than any other to illuminate this nation\u2019s violent beginnings, wrote in <a href=\"https://www.newsouthbooks.com.au/books/black-arm-band/\">This Whispering in Our Hearts Revisited</a>, \u201cThe word itself was problematic.

A new front in the culture wars? I don\u2019t think so. Indigenous people of this land and their supporters have been protesting against 26 January as any sort of day of moment worthy of celebration for the country since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2017/jan/26/invasion-day-will-come-to-rival-anzac-day-in-years-to-come\">well before it was officially known as Australia Day</a>.</p> <p>In 1938 the sesquicentenary of British invasion and colonisation, the Aborigines Progressive Association held a Day of Mourning in Sydney while the white celebrations dominated the city. Remember?</p> <p>\u201cThe 26<sup>th</sup> of January, 1938, is not a day of rejoicing for Australia\u2019s Aborigines; <a href=\"https://aiatsis.gov.au/exhibitions/day-mourning-26th-january-1938\">it is a day of mourning</a>.

      "bodyText": "Another year passes and as Australia emerges from its summertime slumber so, too, does the now predictable \u201cdebate\u201d about 26 January, rearing its head like some perennial Jabberwocky to the elites of media and politics. If you don\u2019t like \u201cAustralia Day\u201d, journalists and shock-jocks \u2013 echoing conservative politicians \u2013 ask the dissenters: what\u2019s the best day on which to celebrate nationhood? What date would you nominate? The demand for another date and the ensuing argument about the calendar are as misguided as the assertion that this supposed debate is somehow a \u201cnew front in the so-called Australian culture wars\u201d or that a \u201cunited\u201d Australia might be celebrated on any other day. First fallacies first. 26 January will always, for the 3% of the Australian population (and growing) identifying as Indigenous and their progressive supporters, be Invasion Day \u2013 the moment the British First Fleet sailed from Botany Bay into Sydney Harbour to mark the start of the land grab and human annihilation upon which the white Australian federation of 1901 was built. Those who, like the prime minister, Scott Morrison, insist that the current \u201cAustralia Day is for all Australians\u201d stand in crude intellectual defiance of an obvious truth, that celebrating nationhood on 26 January has become a gratuitous act of hostility to Indigenous sensibility. The many tens of thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their non-Indigenous supporters who march annually \u2013 in numbers at least as great as those Australians who\u2019d turn out to commemorate Anzac Day \u2013 are testimony to that. But in the media/political to-and-fro over another date, the real Australian malaise is all but forgotten. And that is: until Australia deals with the unfinished business of Aboriginal sovereignty and historical truth telling there will be no appropriate date upon which to celebrate a supposedly unified nation. Until Australia reaches a black/white settlement over sovereignty, through commonwealth and state treaties and a formal process of historical reckoning, it\u2019s pointless marking other dates on the calendar. I\u2019m confident that 26 January will be junked as Australia Day but I\u2019m less assured, and sadly so, that I\u2019ll witness that reckoning. And I\u2019m not planning on going anywhere soon. Reconciliation, like Australia Day, is a political construct grown from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, established in 1991 to bring black and white together. It\u2019s a misnomer, albeit one that\u2019s embedded \u2013 to the detriment of integral Australian history \u2013 in political and media vernacular. The talk should be of \u201cconciliation\u201d, because there has not yet been a first step \u2013 nothing resembling a reckoning or a settlement. You can\u2019t reconcile without an initial conciliation. Henry Reynolds, the living Australian historian who has, perhaps, done more than any other to illuminate this nation\u2019s violent beginnings, wrote in This Whispering in Our Hearts Revisited, \u201cThe word itself was problematic. It is an old word derived from Latin meaning \u2018restoration\u2019, which usually referred to the restoration of previously good relations. It is difficult to see how this could possibly apply to Australian history.\u201d But fallacies perpetuate in the hyperbole around 26 January. A new front in the culture wars? I don\u2019t think so. Indigenous people of this land and their supporters have been protesting against 26 January as any sort of day of moment worthy of celebration for the country since well before it was officially known as Australia Day. In 1938 the sesquicentenary of British invasion and colonisation, the Aborigines Progressive Association held a Day of Mourning in Sydney while the white celebrations dominated the city. Remember? \u201cThe 26th of January, 1938, is not a day of rejoicing for Australia\u2019s Aborigines; it is a day of mourning. This festival of 150 years\u2019 so called \u2018progress\u2019 in Australia commemorates also 150 years of misery and degradation imposed upon the original native inhabitants by the white invaders of this country,\u201d the protesters declared. \u201cWe, representing the Aborigines, now ask you, the reader of this appeal, to pause in the midst of your sesqui-centenary rejoicings and ask yourself honestly whether your \u2018conscience\u2019 is clear in regard to the treatment of the Australian blacks by the Australian whites during the period of 150 years\u2019 history which you celebrate?\u201d Each time I walk down Elizabeth Street, Sydney, past the modest Victorian building Australian Hall, where the Indigenous protesters gathered on 26 January 1938 and from which the Aboriginal flag still flies, I\u2019m reminded of the enduring challenge to national conscience issued that day. It was a declaration of Indigenous survival, against all odds, of the worst tyrannies of colonialism. And it was a vow to keep fighting for the rights to sovereignty, and to equality of life and opportunity \u2013 economic, social, physical, emotional \u2013 that are still denied to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That was, and is, why Indigenous protest on 26 January is freighted with such importance. It is a day that marks remarkable Indigenous battle for survival, not some post-modern political/cultural skirmish. It is now part of a far bigger fight for a long overdue reckoning. History, for all its complexity and with its demands for truth in the telling, transcends such convenient relegation and cultural confines. Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist.",

      "bodyText": "A mix of coal power plants, pumped hydro and gas-fired power have been presented to the federal government as options for its program to underwrite new electricity generation. But an ambitious $6bn plan by power baron Trevor St Baker for two new coal power plants has been criticised by the Victorian energy and environment minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, who said the bid proved the scheme was designed to boost fossil fuels. A spokesman for the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said the government had received \u201cstrong interest\u201d for the program, after expressions of interest closed on Wednesday. Industry stakeholders have criticised the short timeframe for the program, and the Australian Industry Group has warned it could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities \u201cwith a net present value of billions of dollars\u201d because the government could indemnify projects against the costs of new climate change policies. At least one company that lodged an expression of interest complained to Guardian Australia that the government has not explained who will decide which projects get support, how the government will fund it, whether legislation will be required, and what form of support is on offer, such as loans, grants or contracts-for-difference. Alinta submitted a proposal for a gas-fired power plant at Reeves Plains in South Australia, a pumped hydro project in New South Wales and a \u201cmarginal improvement\u201d to its Loy Yang B coal power plant in Victoria. On Saturday the Australian reported that St Baker had developed a $6bn proposal backed by a Chinese joint venture to develop Australia\u2019s first high-efficiency, low-emissions coal plants in Victoria and New South Wales. The proposal would see a 1300 MW coal plant built at the site of the shuttered Hazelwood station in Victoria, a $500m pumped hydro facility in South Australia and a coal plant in NSW either at AGL\u2019s Liddell coal plant, which is scheduled to shut down in 2022, or at the site of the old Vales Point A power station. \u201cOur plan is the cheapest way to supply the essential firm generation you need for reliable power,\u201d St Baker reportedly said. D\u2019Ambrosio told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe Morrison Liberal government is obsessed with backing new coal plants that would cost Victorians more and this proposal is no different.\u201d Guardian Australia understands the Victorian government has not received any approach or proposal from St Baker, despite the fact the plan would require planning approvals to develop the Hazelwood site. Energy Australia also submitted a proposal but its energy executive Mark Collette told Guardian Australia that investment confidence is the \u201cnot so secret spice\u201d that is still needed to guarantee its new generation projects. \u201cNational energy policy incorporating affordability, reliability and emissions is the best way to deliver investor confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have long argued where there\u2019s confidence, the sector is willing to take risks and invest, helping to form a new, modern and cleaner energy system.\u201d Collette urged the government to \u201cproceed carefully\u201d with the underwriting scheme to \u201cmake sure there are no unintended consequences affecting investment, and of course, our customers\u201d. Federal Labor has warned it does not support the government indemnifying new coal plants against the future risk of a carbon price. Labor\u2019s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said \u201cindustry, investors and the experts have all been clear \u2013 there is no appetite for investing in new coal-fired power stations\u201d. New coal power plants \u201cwould provide relatively high levels of pollution, particularly if it is using brown coal from Victoria\u201d. \u201cIt would be completely inconsistent with our climate change commitments and it would require billions and billions of support from taxpayers.\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said Victorians had overwhelmingly backed Labor\u2019s commitment to increase Victoria\u2019s renewable energy target to 50% by 2030. \u201cSetting an ambitious renewable energy target will boost jobs and investment across regional Victoria, as well as drive down power prices for Victorian businesses and families,\u201d she said. Taylor\u2019s spokesman said the government \u201cwill carefully consider all proposals - some of which have already been reported in the media\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll have more to say once we have considered all the submissions and feedback received during this process.\u201d",

During the financial crisis, when Northern Rock was nationalised and RBS and Lloyds were bailed out, Barclays bosses were desperate to secure investment from the \u201cenormous wealth\u201d of Qatar in order to avoid a bailout, Ed Brown QC, prosecuting on behalf of the Serious Fraud Office, said. But Southwark crown court heard on Thursday that the Qataris, including the then prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, knew Barclays was desperate for cash and were \u201cplaying hardball\u201d. Richard Boath, one of four Barclays executives standing trial on accusations of fraud and conspiracy, told his boss on 28 May 2008 that: \u201cWithout \u00a31bn, at the very least, from Q [Qatar] we are basically dead,\u201d the jury was told. Brown alleges that four Barclays executives, including former chief executive John Varley, conspired together to pay Qatar secret fees in return for investment of nearly \u00a312bn. The court heard that Varley said knowing that Qatar was interested \u201cmade my day\u201d. Varley told Bob Diamond, who was then chief executive of investment banking division Barclays Capital, that: \u201cMade my day. Know [sic] we have to get it over the line, but it\u2019s a great starting point for the conversation.\u201d Brown alleged that the Barclays executives came up with a plan to pay Qatar \u2013 which they referred to with the codename Quail - much greater fees in return for their investment than was offered to other potential investors. In June 2008 Varley emailed Barclays then chairman Marcus Agius: \u201cQuail is bagged at 2bn of the conditional. Very helpful underpin. Took longer than I had hoped, but these people are the new cocks of the roost.\u201d The former Barclays executives - Varley, Boath, Jenkins and Tom Kalaris, who was boss of Barclays\u2019 wealth management division \u2013 are charged with conspiring to commit fraud by making false representations. Varley and Jenkins face an additional charge related to a second round of fundraising. All four men have pleaded not guilty. The trial continues.",

In modern, rich Britain, the visible humanitarian crisis that is homelessness on our streets resembles scenes from a Dickens novel. At least 597 people have died on the streets in the past year. But rough sleepers today have to cope with another threat \u2013 their own government, which seems intent on treating them like criminals. The Vagrancy Act, on the books since 1824, makes it a criminal offence to sleep \u201cin any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or waggon, not having any visible means of subsistence\u201d. The law of the land, which was repealed in Scotland nearly four decades again, gives police the right to arrest or fine the most marginalised in our society, simply because they have nothing. When campaigners brought a petition to the government calling for its repeal last year, the Home Office responded simply that it has \u201cno plans to make changes to the law\u201d, and absurdly claimed that criminal \u201cenforcement measures\u201d are a means to \u201csupport rough sleepers off the streets\u201d. Last month, Jeremy Corbyn announced that when Labour gets into government it will finally repeal the act. As he rightly said, people experiencing homelessness \u201cneed help, not punishment\u201d. But the next opportunity to scrap the Vagrancy Act may come even sooner. The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran has tabled a motion to do just that, which was due to be debated this week. While the volatility of the political situation means that any vote on this particular bill may well be delayed, the conversation about the Vagrancy Act cannot. With the government too weak to pass even its signature legislation, Labour and its fellow opposition parties have the opportunity to take back control, to defend the vulnerable, and they must. We in the Labour Homelessness Campaign are calling on Labour MPs to push as soon as possible for a vote to get rid of the Vagrancy Act once and for all. Labour cannot wait to repeal the Vagrancy Act, simply because those left at its mercy cannot afford to wait. In 2015 alone more than 3,000 prosecutions were made under the act, and while the figures since then haven\u2019t reached that peak, they still number in the thousands. And these are just the prosecutions \u2013 far more people have been arrested or threatened under the act, even if their cases haven\u2019t gone to court. I\u2019ve spoken to people sleeping rough who say they find the most obscure places to hide, partly to stay safe (which particularly applies to women whose vulnerability puts their safety at risk by virtue of them being women), but also because they say they want to avoid the threat of being criminalised for being homeless. A young homeless woman who had been sofa-surfing at her friend\u2019s flat, but is now rough sleeping and out begging for change in below-freezing temperatures, told me: \u201cI try to find different places to put my tent up so I can\u2019t be found. It\u2019s really stressful and makes me feel anxious.\u201d Another man rough sleeping told me he was playing a game of cat-and-mouse with the authorities after being fined for sleeping in a tent in a field. \u201cI\u2019ve got nowhere to go. Do you think I would be here if I did?\u201d As Alex Kumar, the campaigner who launched the Vagrancy Act petition last year, says, these are not isolated cases: \u201cRough sleepers are being charged under this law year on year, month on month. It\u2019s happening right now to someone I know myself.\u201d In my city of Oxford alone, 38 people were arrested in a single year (2013). The figures reveal something else as well; many, if not most, of those individuals arrested were arrested again for the same offence within the same year. The act is often used to convict people for begging, for which they can be fined up to \u00a31,000 and given a two-year criminal record, making it even more difficult to find work and accommodation. Far from getting people off the streets, the Vagrancy Act forces rough sleepers to beg, in order to pay off the fines incurred for begging. Our society is beating down those already suffering. There are cases of rough sleepers having been arrested as many as 17 times. Last year police in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, urged the public to report rough sleepers caught \u201casking for change\u201d so they could be arrested under the act. Windsor council leader Simon Dudley attempted to use the Vagrancy Act to clear rough sleepers out of town, in advance of the royal wedding last year, saying those experiencing homelessness were \u201cexploiting\u201d the town. Across the country, thousands are left trapped in a cycle of poverty, persecution, and stigmatisation. While the 1824 Vagrancy Act remains on the books, we are not simply ignoring the misery of our fellow human beings but actively making things worse. Our society is responsible, and our government is culpable. The Labour Homelessness Campaign is calling for every Labour MP to support the vagrancy act repeal bill when it comes before the House of Commons, and to work with other parties to get it repealed as soon as possible. There is no excuse for waiting. \u2022 Shaista Aziz is a journalist, a Labour councillor in Oxford and co-founder of the Labour Homelessness Campaign",

      "body": "<p>If you have trouble getting to sleep, it might be worth investing in a hammock: scientists say a gentle rocking motion not only helps people to fall asleep more rapidly but also improves the quality of sleep and the memory of the sleeper.</p> <p>While parents have long employed rocking as a way to calm babies and send them to sleep, some studies have suggested it helps adults too. Now researchers say they have found evidence to back this up and discovered further benefits to boot.</p> <p>\u201cRocking in people that do not have any sleep problems can still improve sleep quality, and the beneficial effects of sleep on \u2013 for instance \u2013 memory also seem to be enhanced,\u201d said Dr Paul Franken, a co-author of the research, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31662-2\">Writing in the journal Current Biology</a>, he and colleagues in Lausanne and Geneva reveal that 18 young participants without sleep problems spent three nights in a laboratory: one night getting used to the environment, one night being monitored while sleeping in a stationary bed and one night being monitored with the bed gently rocking from side to side.</p> <p>Participants were asked to learn pairs of unrelated French words and were then tested on their ability to recall these pairs both before and after each of the test nights. Brain waves of the participants were monitored as they slept using EEG, and other metrics such as heart rate were also recorded.</p> <p>The brain wave data revealed that a gentle rocking did not affect the overall time participants spent asleep but did shorten their transition to \u201creal\u201d sleep.</p> <p>Participants spent longer in \u201cdeep sleep\u201d\u2013 known technically as stage three non\u2013rapid eye movement sleep \u2013 and experienced fewer disruptions to this sleep when rocked. The team say this might be linked to the finding that rocking changed the number and timing of particular patterns of brainwaves that occurred during this phase of sleep. These patterns are also related to consolidating memories, they add.</p> <p>Indeed, when the team looked at how well participants fared on the memory test, they found that those who had been rocked as they slept made fewer mistakes and got more pairings correct than those who had slept on a stationary bed.</p> <p>Further experiments carried out in mice and <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31608-7\">published in a separate study</a> shed light on how rocking might help with sleep. The team found that the mice fell asleep faster and crammed more periods of sleep into their hours of rest when they were rocked. However, rocking had no effect on the brainwaves of the sleeping mice, suggesting that it did not affect the quality of their sleep.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/07/schoolchildren-to-be-offered-sleep-lessons-after-rise-in-disorders\">Schoolchildren to be offered sleep lessons after rise in disorders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The mice also seemed to spend less time exploring when they woke up. \u201c[Besides inducing sleep], why people rock their babies is also that it relaxes [the babies], and they become less active when they are awake,\u201d said Franken.</p> <p>A key finding was that mice that lacked a key component of the vestibular system \u2013 which is based in the inner ear and is involved in the sense of balance and body position \u2013 showed no differences in their sleep when rocked. The authors say this supports the theory that this system is part of the mechanism by which rocking affects sleep. The team add that it also explains why the beneficial effect for mice kicked in at a higher rate of rocking than in humans: mice have less sensitive vestibular systems.</p> <p>\ufeffProf Derk-Jan Dijk, director of the Sleep Research Centre at the University of Surrey, welcomed the research, saying it opened up the possibility of new ways to improve people\u2019s sleep without drugs. But researchers needed to look beyond healthy young participants to probe potential benefits, he added.</p> <p>\u201cIt will now be important to repeat these experiment in older people \u2013 who have less deep sleep and lower sleep continuity \u2013 and patients with sleep complaints and sleep disorders,\u201d Prof Dijk said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you have trouble getting to sleep, it might be worth investing in a hammock: scientists say a gentle rocking motion not only helps people to fall asleep more rapidly but also improves the quality of sleep and the memory of the sleeper. While parents have long employed rocking as a way to calm babies and send them to sleep, some studies have suggested it helps adults too. Now researchers say they have found evidence to back this up and discovered further benefits to boot. \u201cRocking in people that do not have any sleep problems can still improve sleep quality, and the beneficial effects of sleep on \u2013 for instance \u2013 memory also seem to be enhanced,\u201d said Dr Paul Franken, a co-author of the research, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. Writing in the journal Current Biology, he and colleagues in Lausanne and Geneva reveal that 18 young participants without sleep problems spent three nights in a laboratory: one night getting used to the environment, one night being monitored while sleeping in a stationary bed and one night being monitored with the bed gently rocking from side to side. Participants were asked to learn pairs of unrelated French words and were then tested on their ability to recall these pairs both before and after each of the test nights. Brain waves of the participants were monitored as they slept using EEG, and other metrics such as heart rate were also recorded. The brain wave data revealed that a gentle rocking did not affect the overall time participants spent asleep but did shorten their transition to \u201creal\u201d sleep. Participants spent longer in \u201cdeep sleep\u201d\u2013 known technically as stage three non\u2013rapid eye movement sleep \u2013 and experienced fewer disruptions to this sleep when rocked. The team say this might be linked to the finding that rocking changed the number and timing of particular patterns of brainwaves that occurred during this phase of sleep. These patterns are also related to consolidating memories, they add. Indeed, when the team looked at how well participants fared on the memory test, they found that those who had been rocked as they slept made fewer mistakes and got more pairings correct than those who had slept on a stationary bed. Further experiments carried out in mice and published in a separate study shed light on how rocking might help with sleep. The team found that the mice fell asleep faster and crammed more periods of sleep into their hours of rest when they were rocked. However, rocking had no effect on the brainwaves of the sleeping mice, suggesting that it did not affect the quality of their sleep. The mice also seemed to spend less time exploring when they woke up. \u201c[Besides inducing sleep], why people rock their babies is also that it relaxes [the babies], and they become less active when they are awake,\u201d said Franken. A key finding was that mice that lacked a key component of the vestibular system \u2013 which is based in the inner ear and is involved in the sense of balance and body position \u2013 showed no differences in their sleep when rocked. The authors say this supports the theory that this system is part of the mechanism by which rocking affects sleep. The team add that it also explains why the beneficial effect for mice kicked in at a higher rate of rocking than in humans: mice have less sensitive vestibular systems. \ufeffProf Derk-Jan Dijk, director of the Sleep Research Centre at the University of Surrey, welcomed the research, saying it opened up the possibility of new ways to improve people\u2019s sleep without drugs. But researchers needed to look beyond healthy young participants to probe potential benefits, he added. \u201cIt will now be important to repeat these experiment in older people \u2013 who have less deep sleep and lower sleep continuity \u2013 and patients with sleep complaints and sleep disorders,\u201d Prof Dijk said.",

In fact, our last minor version (v3.3) was in March 2017 and our last major was a year before that. All things considered it seems right to detail our plans for the future. But in order to explain what we\u2019re replacing Scribe with, it\u2019s probably worth a short catch-up on why we created Scribe in the first place and why it doesn\u2019t fit our current requirements.</p> \n<h2>Why did we create Scribe?</h2> \n<p>Scribe is a text editing engine that was built to abstract away the idiosyncrasies of text editing in the browser and to expose a means of extension through plugins. Back in 2013, as it became clear we were outgrowing our TinyMCE editor, we decided to look for a more powerful alternative that would help us push our editor further. At the time, each of the alternatives had a subset of the things we wanted \u2013 such as fine-grained copy/paste handling, multiple instances per page, and custom menu bars \u2013 but none of them had everything we needed. Consequently, the decision was made to build a full-featured text editor at the Guardian: an editor that could flex to our changing editorial requirements; that was able to cope with text editing at newsroom pace; and that allowed us to implement features that our editors were used to from other native applications such as InCopy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cfee56d3-053e-46e7-9d03-ec0704b3d476\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Where can I find open positions?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Apply for one of our open positions <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/careers/digital-development/\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can I expect from the interview process?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible in our hiring process.

However, as new apps and text editors have come out, features the likes of which we perhaps had not considered at the outset have become commonplace \u2013 such as the collaborative editing and inline annotations found in Google Docs. Additionally, some of Scribe\u2019s plugins suffered from long-standing, fiddly bugs that proved difficult to fix due to browser inconsistencies and issues around Scribe\u2019s underlying model.</p> \n<h2>The problems with Scribe</h2> \n<p>Scribe is essentially a wrapper around <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Editable_content\">contenteditable and execCommand</a>, the main two primitives for creating text editors in the browser. Its main aims were to smooth over the inherent issues that came with these things, to handle the browser bugs between the implementations of contenteditable, and to normalise the inconsistencies that arose from using HTML as a model. contenteditable has oddities and behaviours that are infamous among those that have tried to implement an in-browser text editor and, while there is an <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/editing/contentEditable.html\">open draft</a> to fix many of these things, the current state (which is, in fact, the same as the state in 2013) means that a vanilla implementation of these things is almost certainly not sufficient for even the simplest of text editors \u2013 especially if you care about semantic markup. There are many good articles focused on the <a href=\"https://medium.engineering/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480\">problems</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/content-uneditable/contenteditable-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-261a38555e9c\">benefits</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/content-uneditable/fixing-contenteditable-1a9a5073c35d\">future</a> of contenteditable, but it\u2019s worth laying out a quick summary of the issue that caused us the most problems when building and maintaining Scribe: the use of HTML as the data model.</p> \n<h2>HTML as a model</h2> \n<p>HTML is a great way to mark up and render rich text, but when it is also used as the <em>data model</em> for rich text, it falls down in a few key areas. A good example of this is that one semantic piece of text has many different representations in HTML. Take for example the following text:</p> \n<p><em>Scribe</em></p> \n<p>Below are only a few representations of this in HTML:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"HTML variations for content with the same semantic meaning\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/RichieAHB/b8887044f35b0ffec50833524824f3f4.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>All of the above are valid representations in HTML, and you can encounter any of these different representations when using contenteditable (aside from the fact that contenteditable uses non-semantic <em>b</em> and <em>i</em> tags instead of <em>strong</em> and <em>em</em>) and it\u2019s perhaps not totally clear which the \u201cright\u201d one is. There are, of course, ways to normalise these variants to a single canonical representation (and Scribe does this very well) but the DOM API is not made in a way that facilitates this, so when managing complex markup, or inserted content \u2013 either through pastes or collaborative edits (mandatory aside: HTML as the model isn\u2019t the <em>only</em> difficulty with collaborative edits by any means) \u2013 managing these issues through the DOM API becomes cumbersome and prone to error.</p> \n<p>Another area where HTML as a model falls down is editor-only annotations (markup that helps the writer but is detrimental to the reader). Take for example the need to highlight a word in the text that meets some criteria (a suggested tag, or some legal issue around using this word). You may want to show an inline annotation to ask the editor whether they want to add this as a tag. A possible representation of this in HTML in the editor is:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Example markup for an HTML inline annotation\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/RichieAHB/430020517d6ec0c8a0f9879d8085feeb.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The problem here is that now we have data that is not part of the document, and yet is modelled as <em>part</em> of our document. This is technically solvable but again, the DOM API is not well suited for handling this sort of data modelling, especially when the usage of these features becomes more complex. As you start to force more complex features through an HTML data model, you have to do more and more work to get around HTML\u2019s limitations around modelling a rich text document, and you hit more and more of the browser inconsistencies. Managing all of these issues together, we found that innovating with Scribe became slow and difficult and was more about battling bugs than implementing features, and ultimately development slowed to a crawl.</p> \n<h2>The Guardian after Scribe</h2> \n<p>This brings us to the present day. As mentioned above we are moving to <a href=\"http://prosemirror.net/\">ProseMirror</a>, an open source tool for building text editors that is under active development and has users including the <a href=\"https://open.nytimes.com/building-a-text-editor-for-a-digital-first-newsroom-f1cb8367fc21\">New York Times</a>. At the time of writing our main body copy editor is being driven using ProseMirror.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the first thing to note is that ProseMirror still uses contenteditable under the hood. Despite the problems with contenteditable you get a lot of things out of the box with it that are currently almost impossible to implement without it: platform-native keyboard shortcuts, support for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method\">IMEs</a>, right-to-left text editing etc. In fact there is a section in the W3C spec about the HTML 2D canvas that explains <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#best-practices\">why not to implement a text editor on the canvas</a> \u2013 plenty of which can equally be applied to describing why not to implement a text editor outside of contenteditable. Like Scribe, ProseMirror abstracts away contenteditable and allows granular extensions through plugins.</p> \n<p>The important difference between Scribe and ProseMirror is that ProseMirror implements its own model layer that has a one-to-one mapping from semantics to the model, and an API that is made with document transformation in mind \u2013 not least collaborative editing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"279c849ad3811cbeecc9edac57768a645e817f9c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/279c849ad3811cbeecc9edac57768a645e817f9c/134_0_799_270/500.jpg\" alt=\"An image representation of ProseMirror's model\" width=\"500\" height=\"169\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ProseMirror has a flatter model where possible, making it much easier to reason about</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marijn Haverbeke/prosemirror.net</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In ProseMirror, inline content is <a href=\"https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#doc.structure\">flat rather than a tree</a>, which means operations such as changing styles on text don\u2019t require any tree manipulation.

In other words, \u201che can\u2019t enter unless they invite him in \u2013 Congress works on vampire rules,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWhich is appropriate, because this is sucking the blood of this country.\u201d But the fact that Nancy Pelosi \u201cjust spanked him with a co-equal branch\u201d hasn\u2019t kept Trump\u2019s team from reportedly drafting two State of the Union speeches \u2013 one for Congress, and one to be delivered at a rally anywhere. \u201cBut it has to be a location befitting this president\u2019s dignity,\u201d Colbert joked, \u201cso maybe \u2026 a ball pit at McDonald\u2019s, a sand trap or \u2013 oh, I know! \u2013 Red Square.\u201d Trevor Noah And at the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also addressed a flailing state and State of the Union. The effects of the shutdown are piling up, he said: \u201cLow-income renters are being cut off from housing aid, welfare payments could run out soon and the government is so broke they\u2019re selling ad space on the constitution.\u201d But the focus of yesterday\u2019s news was on the imperiled state of the State of the Union, which isn\u2019t going to be delivered to Congress as scheduled. \u201cIn a surprise move, Trump surrendered,\u201d Noah noted. The president told reporters Wednesday that the State of Union was \u201ccancelled\u201d by Nancy Pelosi, \u201cor Nancy, as I call her.\u201d This gave Noah pause. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Nancy gave Trump a wedgie behind Congress one day, but she did something because she\u2019s the only person he hasn\u2019t given a nickname to,\u201d Noah said. With everyone else, \u201che\u2019s like \u2018Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer, \u2018Little\u2019 Marco Rubio, \u2018Pocahontas\u2019 Elizabeth Warren, \u2018Lyin\u2019 Ted\u2019,\u201d and then there\u2019s Nancy Pelosi, \u201cor as I call her \u2026 Nancy.\u201d",

Next of kin have been informed of this development, and my thoughts go out to the family of the pilot and passenger at this most difficult of times.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>CHELSEA v TOTTENHAM</strong></h2> <p>There are no shortage of talking points ahead of Thursday\u2019s Worthington Cup semi-final second leg between Chelsea and Tottenham at Stamford Bridge. Following a first leg dogged by tedious controversy prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/mauricio-pochettino-var-premier-league-spurs\">by VAR</a> \u2013 exactly the kind VAR was supposed to eliminate \u2013 Spurs lead by the only goal of the tie. They will need that buffer, as it has been well documented that with Son Heung-min, Dele Alli and Harry Kane all absent for various reasons, they are so bereft of bodies with which to fill their forward line they may even be forced to play Fernando Llorente, a World Cup and European Championship-winning striker with just one Big Vase and three Serie A winner\u2019s medals to his name in the centre-forward role.</p> <p>Comparatively untroubled by absenteeism, Chelsea may opt not to play a centre-forward at all, having failed to sign Gonzalo Higua\u00edn in time to make his debut under Maurizio Sarri in this game. By way of alternative, the Chelsea boss looks likely to play Eden Hazard as a false nine, a role much beloved of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/24/false-nine-ancient-tactic-power-shock-football-tactics\">the kind of nerds</a> obsessed with heat maps and turning pyramids upside down, but in which Chelsea\u2019s best player appears as comfortable as The Fiver after getting into a crowded lift only to discover we\u2019re facing the opposite direction to everyone else but wedged in too tightly to turn around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/mauricio-pochettino-var-premier-league-spurs\">Mauricio Pochettino calls for VAR in Premier League to be postponed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having publicly questioned the motivation of his players in the wake of their defeat at the hands of Arsenal, Sarri set about geeing up Hazard for this game by pointing out his lack of leadership skills and saying he needs to do more for the team. \u201cHe is very important for us, because he is a great player,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/maurizio-sarri-questions-eden-hazard-ability-to-be-a-leader-for-chelsea-gonzalo-higuain\">said Sarri</a>. \u201cHe always can win the match in two minutes \u2013 sometimes in one minute but at the moment he\u2019s not a leader. He\u2019s a great player \u2013 one of the best in the world. I think he has to do more, because the potential is higher than the performances.\u201d</p> <p>While mischievous members of the Fourth Estate have been quick to pounce on Sarri\u2019s comments and point to them as evidence that the Italian is losing his marbles and about to lose his dressing room, it should be noted that: a) they were largely complimentary; and b) Hazard has always struck The Fiver as the kind of chilled-out, laidback free spirit who probably isn\u2019t too fussed about any mildly critical remarks his manager might make. A more emotionally fragile flower, Higua\u00edn is an undeniably successful player, albeit one with more high-profile misses to his name than Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp combined.

      "bodyText": "BREAKING NEWS Rescue workers have called off their search for the missing plane carrying Cardiff striker Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson. \u201cWe reviewed all the information available to us, as well as knowing what emergency equipment was on board, and have taken the difficult decision to end the search,\u201d said Guernsey harbourmaster, Capt David Barker. \u201cThe chances of survival at this stage are extremely remote. Next of kin have been informed of this development, and my thoughts go out to the family of the pilot and passenger at this most difficult of times.\u201d CHELSEA v TOTTENHAM There are no shortage of talking points ahead of Thursday\u2019s Worthington Cup semi-final second leg between Chelsea and Tottenham at Stamford Bridge. Following a first leg dogged by tedious controversy prompted by VAR \u2013 exactly the kind VAR was supposed to eliminate \u2013 Spurs lead by the only goal of the tie. They will need that buffer, as it has been well documented that with Son Heung-min, Dele Alli and Harry Kane all absent for various reasons, they are so bereft of bodies with which to fill their forward line they may even be forced to play Fernando Llorente, a World Cup and European Championship-winning striker with just one Big Vase and three Serie A winner\u2019s medals to his name in the centre-forward role. Comparatively untroubled by absenteeism, Chelsea may opt not to play a centre-forward at all, having failed to sign Gonzalo Higua\u00edn in time to make his debut under Maurizio Sarri in this game. By way of alternative, the Chelsea boss looks likely to play Eden Hazard as a false nine, a role much beloved of the kind of nerds obsessed with heat maps and turning pyramids upside down, but in which Chelsea\u2019s best player appears as comfortable as The Fiver after getting into a crowded lift only to discover we\u2019re facing the opposite direction to everyone else but wedged in too tightly to turn around. Having publicly questioned the motivation of his players in the wake of their defeat at the hands of Arsenal, Sarri set about geeing up Hazard for this game by pointing out his lack of leadership skills and saying he needs to do more for the team. \u201cHe is very important for us, because he is a great player,\u201d said Sarri. \u201cHe always can win the match in two minutes \u2013 sometimes in one minute but at the moment he\u2019s not a leader. He\u2019s a great player \u2013 one of the best in the world. I think he has to do more, because the potential is higher than the performances.\u201d While mischievous members of the Fourth Estate have been quick to pounce on Sarri\u2019s comments and point to them as evidence that the Italian is losing his marbles and about to lose his dressing room, it should be noted that: a) they were largely complimentary; and b) Hazard has always struck The Fiver as the kind of chilled-out, laidback free spirit who probably isn\u2019t too fussed about any mildly critical remarks his manager might make. A more emotionally fragile flower, Higua\u00edn is an undeniably successful player, albeit one with more high-profile misses to his name than Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp combined. He will look on from the stands ahead of his debut against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup on Sunday.

With just 64 days until Brexit day, and the government clueless about what to do next, you might have expected a packed house for Brexit departmental questions. Far from it. Just a dozen Tory backbenchers and less than 30 opposition MPs bothered to make the effort. If you\u2019re looking for answers to Brexit questions, then the Brexit secretary is the last person to whom you would turn.</p> <p>Even so, a few brave and persistent souls did try to elicit some information. Presumably, they had nothing better to do. The Scottish National party\u2019s Philippa Whitford got things under way by asking about medicine stockpiling in Scotland. Barclay appeared generally bewildered. He\u2019d never heard of Scotland. Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens tried a different tack with a question about the boss of Airbus having said the government\u2019s Brexit planning had been a disgrace.</p> <p>Hmm, let me think, said Barclay. Airbus, Airbus. The name rang a vague bell. Though hopefully his mind would be a total blank by the evening. His Random Word Generator cranked into action. Of course he took the warnings very seriously but he wanted to stress there was a lot of positivity with Airbus and that\u2019s why the company was backing the prime minister. It was an unusual take that seemed to take even his colleagues by surprise.</p> <p>Tory Glyn Davies hastily changed the subject, as it had belatedly come to his attention that the sheep farmers in his Wales constituency could be financially screwed after Brexit. Barclay\u2019s reply was another masterclass. He was sure the Welsh sheep farmers would be just fine, so long as they had Davies as their MP to ask questions about why they were going out of business. The Brexit minister could talk for hours without ever actually saying anything meaningful.</p> <p>Other questions came and went without Barclay or his junior ministers \u2013 a crack team of highly trained nonentities who have fully taken on board the mission to know nothing \u2013 letting slip any information. The closest we got to news was that all sheep would continue to be sheep after Brexit, but some cows may no longer identify as cows.</p> <p>The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, committed a classic category error by assuming Barclay was involved in the formation of government policy. Time was running out and the prime minister was still being vague about what changes she was hoping to make to her plan that had been resoundingly defeated last week. Would the minister care to enlighten the house?</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t. That kind of knowledge was so restricted that not even Theresa May had access to it. But everyone should chill out a bit. There was still 64 days to go. That was loads of time, when you came to think about it. Yes, the government might have had a teeny weeny bit of a setback with its 230-vote defeat, but it was now actively engaged in the process of not listening to people. So things were looking up. Perhaps everyone would like to join in a sing-song: \u201cAlways look on the bright side of life\u2026\u201d</p> <p>A deadly lethargy descended on the Commons. Bodies felt heavy and minds became confused. Barclay smiled. Mission accomplished.</p>",

If you\u2019re looking for answers to Brexit questions, then the Brexit secretary is the last person to whom you would turn. Even so, a few brave and persistent souls did try to elicit some information. Presumably, they had nothing better to do. The Scottish National party\u2019s Philippa Whitford got things under way by asking about medicine stockpiling in Scotland. Barclay appeared generally bewildered. He\u2019d never heard of Scotland. Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens tried a different tack with a question about the boss of Airbus having said the government\u2019s Brexit planning had been a disgrace. Hmm, let me think, said Barclay. Airbus, Airbus. The name rang a vague bell. Though hopefully his mind would be a total blank by the evening. His Random Word Generator cranked into action. Of course he took the warnings very seriously but he wanted to stress there was a lot of positivity with Airbus and that\u2019s why the company was backing the prime minister. It was an unusual take that seemed to take even his colleagues by surprise. Tory Glyn Davies hastily changed the subject, as it had belatedly come to his attention that the sheep farmers in his Wales constituency could be financially screwed after Brexit. Barclay\u2019s reply was another masterclass. He was sure the Welsh sheep farmers would be just fine, so long as they had Davies as their MP to ask questions about why they were going out of business. The Brexit minister could talk for hours without ever actually saying anything meaningful. Other questions came and went without Barclay or his junior ministers \u2013 a crack team of highly trained nonentities who have fully taken on board the mission to know nothing \u2013 letting slip any information. The closest we got to news was that all sheep would continue to be sheep after Brexit, but some cows may no longer identify as cows. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, committed a classic category error by assuming Barclay was involved in the formation of government policy. Time was running out and the prime minister was still being vague about what changes she was hoping to make to her plan that had been resoundingly defeated last week. Would the minister care to enlighten the house? He wouldn\u2019t. That kind of knowledge was so restricted that not even Theresa May had access to it. But everyone should chill out a bit. There was still 64 days to go. That was loads of time, when you came to think about it. Yes, the government might have had a teeny weeny bit of a setback with its 230-vote defeat, but it was now actively engaged in the process of not listening to people. So things were looking up. Perhaps everyone would like to join in a sing-song: \u201cAlways look on the bright side of life\u2026\u201d A deadly lethargy descended on the Commons. Bodies felt heavy and minds became confused. Barclay smiled. Mission accomplished.",

The reports of garda planning will heighten concerns about the impact a no-deal Brexit will have in the border regions, where previously warring communities have enjoyed peaceful co-existence for the past 20 years. Last week a car bomb in Derry city was a reminder of the fragility of that peace, local politicians and campaigners warned and other newspapers reported that Brexit concerns had been raised by gardai on border counties including Donegal. A meeting between officials from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) and senior commissioners is expected to take place next week in relation to border issues. The Derry car bomb and potential for further violence post-Brexit along the Donegal-Derry and Donegal-Fermanagh border were discussed at a meeting of police in the Irish county last week, the Irish Examiner reported on Thursday. Both the Irish government and the UK have avoided discussing no-deal plans for the border, with neither side publishing contingency plans for operations in the event the UK crashes out of the EU on 29 March. Earlier this month Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, was caught on a microphone warning a colleague not to \u201cstart delving\u201d into the issues if asked by reporters because \u201call of a sudden we\u2019ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland\u201d. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has also highlighted the need for significant extra resources throughout the border counties in the event of a hard border, which poses the potential for smuggling, civil disobedience or violence as well as immigration issues for non-Irish nationals. Last year the PSNI chief constable, George Hamilton, rejected claims that the threat of violence at the Irish border after Brexit was being exaggerated. He said those who said the PSNI was \u201coverplaying the border and Brexit in policing terms\u201d were \u201csimply wrong\u201d. Sources say the PSNI is concerned not just about civil disorder, but the inability to police the border as they do now in close cooperation with the Garda in Ireland. They are also concerned that the European arrest warrant system will fall away in a no-deal scenario, making it easier for criminals to cross a border and return to another jurisdiction, and out of the reach of the law. Last year it was revealed the PSNI was putting more than 100 extra officers in place in the event of no deal. And earlier this month it emerged that another 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland were being training for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of disorder from a no-deal Brexit. The plans were put in place after PSNI chiefs asked for reinforcements to deal with any trouble that arises from a hard border. The training for officers from English forces and Police Scotland is expected to begin this month.",

In August, prosecutors in Agrigento, Sicily, placed Salvini, who is leader of the far-right party the League, under investigation for the alleged kidnapping and detention of 177 migrants whom he prevented from disembarking the Italian coastguard ship Ubaldo Diciotti. The ship had been docked for six days at the Sicilian port of Catania as Salvini maintained a standoff with the EU in an attempt to push other member states to take in the migrants.

Salvini said he was confident he had the support of the senators from the League. But the support of his coalition partners, the populist Five Star Movement, is far less assured. One of the M5S\u2019s founding principles has always been to ask for the resignation of politicians under investigation. Until last year, this principle was written in the Movement\u2019s own statutes. The rule was part of the party\u2019s attempt to present a clean image and distance itself from corruption. Two years ago, Luigi Di Maio, the Italian deputy prime minister and leader of the M5S, called for the resignation of Angelino Alfano, minister of the interior at the time, who was under investigation for abuse of office. Di Maio said: \u201cWe cannot allow a minister of interior under investigation to remain in office. Alfano must resign.\u201d Should the M5S vote against criminal proceedings, thereby rescuing Salvini from a possible conviction, the party would lose credibility among its supporters. But if it supported the investigation against Salvini, then it risks losing him and their political alliance, which would cause the entire government to fall. The ruling by the court of ministers on Thursday came as a surprise, as the chief prosecutor of Catania, Carmelo Zuccaro, known for launching several investigations against rescue boats operated by aid groups, a few months ago dropped the charges against Salvini, suggesting the court of ministers would not put him on trial. \u2018\u2019If what I did means I\u2019m a kidnapper,\u201d Salvini said, \u201cwell, then you can consider me as a kidnapper for the coming months.\u2019\u2019",

As we meet Duncan, he\u2019s receiving his annual physical. He\u2019s turning 50 in two weeks, and looking forward to retirement. Alas, his employer Blut (Matt Lucas) is hellbent on ensuring Duncan doesn\u2019t make it to retirement age. Why? The hitman syndicate offers a very lucrative retirement package. Rather than shell out the millions of dollars owed to his employees, Blut has hired his younger assassins to go around bumping off their elder statesmen. It sounds ludicrous in writing, but in the film it actually feels like an amusing dig at corporate America forcing early retirement and shortchanging employees\u2019 401k accounts.</p> <p>There are occasionally clever moments in Polar such as this, but they are drowned in a sea of blood and guts as \u00c5kerlund stuffs his film with wall-to-wall violence. The repetitive plot follows a motley crew of five assassins making their way across America, investigating every known address for Duncan and grotesquely killing anyone in their way. (Instead of worrying about paydays, Blut should reconsider the efficiency of his prime talent, as sending five assassins on this journey seems like a ridiculous waste of resources.) Meanwhile, Duncan hides out in a remote cabin and befriends his neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens) who is recovering from emotional trauma of her own.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMHwRal-AR8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oMHwRal-AR8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The film is adapted from a webcomic and Dark Horse graphic novel of the same name and its roots are manifest primarily through flashy character intro title screens, outlandish costume design and the hyper-violence, which may have played less offensively on the page than it does on the screen. Each assassination sequence is so ridiculously protracted and inefficiently constructed that it would make a good running gag if the violence wasn\u2019t the one thing the film seemed to take seriously. Perhaps you could argue the sequences are a reflection of the characters\u2019 sadism \u2013 and make no mistake, these characters relish their killings \u2013 but the actual hits are so bone-headedly constructed they require complete suspension of disbelief that they aren\u2019t just masterminded by the film-makers to allow for gratuitous nudity and stomach-turning violence. Prime example is the character of Sindy (Ruby O Fee), who seduces men into prolonged sex acts so her team can simultaneously snipe their target from afar and flank them on the ground.</p> <p>If Polar had been released theatrically and rated by the MPAA, it surely would have bordered on NC-17. Which is a sobering reminder to parents just how easy it is to get around Netflix profile restrictions and that maturity ratings for Netflix movies are less regulated in general; by their own <a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/2064\">admission</a>, ratings are determined by Netflix itself or by an undefined \u201clocal standards organization\u201d. Speaking of Netflix, perhaps the most head-scratching moment of all in Polar is that Duncan pays two visits to a Redbox knockoff without any punchline other than that he falls asleep during the movie. Maybe they are trying to keep physical media alive after all (latest earnings report shows 2.7 million people still have DVD-by-mail plans).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"79d988085059b64d772ca339c01f14138a88aac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79d988085059b64d772ca339c01f14138a88aac4/0_192_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If you\u2019re debating between streaming or watching on DVD, your best bet with Polar is neither.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you\u2019re debating between streaming or watching on DVD, your best bet with Polar is neither.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if you\u2019re debating between streaming or watching on DVD, your best bet with Polar is neither. The film\u2019s violence is senseless in the truest definition of the word: the characters\u2019 violent actions literally don\u2019t make sense. And it\u2019s too graphic to be cartoonish (not that it would necessarily help). Think Tarantino-level gore with power drills driving into skulls and knives into eyeballs but without the social commentary. Yes, there are moments of unexpected contemplation (You Were Never Really Here-esque dreams) and solemnity (a sensitive performance by Hudgens), but they are completely dissonant from the other 90% of the movie. Mikkelsen \u2013 who brings gravitas to upscale Hollywood blockbusters and art house films by Thomas Vinterberg and Susanne Bier \u2013 belongs in an entirely different class of movie. Hopefully he was at least paid handsomely to star in this.</p> <p>It\u2019s the kind of movie Christopher Lambert might have made as a straight-to-video actioner in the 90s. It\u2019s the kind of movie that features a gruesome torture sequence that implicitly evokes Braveheart, then proceeds to play bagpipes and have a character tell an apocryphal story about William Wallace. It\u2019s the kind of movie that includes not one, but four closeups of a corpse\u2019s erection. If this all sounds good to you, well, it\u2019s just a click away.</p> <ul> <li><p>Polar is available on Netflix from 25 January</p></li> </ul>",

It sounds ludicrous in writing, but in the film it actually feels like an amusing dig at corporate America forcing early retirement and shortchanging employees\u2019 401k accounts. There are occasionally clever moments in Polar such as this, but they are drowned in a sea of blood and guts as \u00c5kerlund stuffs his film with wall-to-wall violence. The repetitive plot follows a motley crew of five assassins making their way across America, investigating every known address for Duncan and grotesquely killing anyone in their way. (Instead of worrying about paydays, Blut should reconsider the efficiency of his prime talent, as sending five assassins on this journey seems like a ridiculous waste of resources.) Meanwhile, Duncan hides out in a remote cabin and befriends his neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens) who is recovering from emotional trauma of her own. The film is adapted from a webcomic and Dark Horse graphic novel of the same name and its roots are manifest primarily through flashy character intro title screens, outlandish costume design and the hyper-violence, which may have played less offensively on the page than it does on the screen. Each assassination sequence is so ridiculously protracted and inefficiently constructed that it would make a good running gag if the violence wasn\u2019t the one thing the film seemed to take seriously. Perhaps you could argue the sequences are a reflection of the characters\u2019 sadism \u2013 and make no mistake, these characters relish their killings \u2013 but the actual hits are so bone-headedly constructed they require complete suspension of disbelief that they aren\u2019t just masterminded by the film-makers to allow for gratuitous nudity and stomach-turning violence. Prime example is the character of Sindy (Ruby O Fee), who seduces men into prolonged sex acts so her team can simultaneously snipe their target from afar and flank them on the ground. If Polar had been released theatrically and rated by the MPAA, it surely would have bordered on NC-17. Which is a sobering reminder to parents just how easy it is to get around Netflix profile restrictions and that maturity ratings for Netflix movies are less regulated in general; by their own admission, ratings are determined by Netflix itself or by an undefined \u201clocal standards organization\u201d. Speaking of Netflix, perhaps the most head-scratching moment of all in Polar is that Duncan pays two visits to a Redbox knockoff without any punchline other than that he falls asleep during the movie. Maybe they are trying to keep physical media alive after all (latest earnings report shows 2.7 million people still have DVD-by-mail plans). But if you\u2019re debating between streaming or watching on DVD, your best bet with Polar is neither. The film\u2019s violence is senseless in the truest definition of the word: the characters\u2019 violent actions literally don\u2019t make sense. And it\u2019s too graphic to be cartoonish (not that it would necessarily help). Think Tarantino-level gore with power drills driving into skulls and knives into eyeballs but without the social commentary. Yes, there are moments of unexpected contemplation (You Were Never Really Here-esque dreams) and solemnity (a sensitive performance by Hudgens), but they are completely dissonant from the other 90% of the movie. Mikkelsen \u2013 who brings gravitas to upscale Hollywood blockbusters and art house films by Thomas Vinterberg and Susanne Bier \u2013 belongs in an entirely different class of movie. Hopefully he was at least paid handsomely to star in this. It\u2019s the kind of movie Christopher Lambert might have made as a straight-to-video actioner in the 90s. It\u2019s the kind of movie that features a gruesome torture sequence that implicitly evokes Braveheart, then proceeds to play bagpipes and have a character tell an apocryphal story about William Wallace. It\u2019s the kind of movie that includes not one, but four closeups of a corpse\u2019s erection. If this all sounds good to you, well, it\u2019s just a click away. Polar is available on Netflix from 25 January",

      "bodyText": "The introduction of new, tougher GCSE exams in England has led to a widening of the gap between the results achieved by disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers, according to official figures. The Department for Education (DfE) analysis of last summer\u2019s GCSE exams found the gap between disadvantaged pupils and others at secondary school grew by 0.6 percentage points, after two years in which it had narrowed. While disadvantaged pupils showed an improvement in the proportion gaining a grade 5 \u2013 previously a C \u2013 in the compulsory subjects of English and maths, others made more rapid progress, causing the gap to widen. Just over half of all other pupils gained a 5 or above in English and maths, but fewer than one in four disadvantaged pupils did the same. The DfE was quick to argue the data showed disadvantaged pupils studying in multi-academy trusts were doing better than the national average, vindicating the government\u2019s flagship policy. Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been clear for some time that standards are rising in our schools and today\u2019s data underlines the role academies and free schools are playing in that improvement, with progress above the national average and impressive outcomes for disadvantaged pupils.\u201d However, the overall results for multi-academy trusts showed below-average progress compared with all state-funded mainstream schools.

The DfE\u2019s analysis showed 346 schools were below the government\u2019s floor standards in terms of results, compared with 309 last year. The figures come as school leaders advise parents not to give too much attention to the government\u2019s preferred measure, used in its performance tables, which attempts to gauge the progress made by pupils from the end of primary school to key stage four, when they sit GCSEs. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cPerformance tables can never tell the full story of a school and we urge parents and governors not to place too much weight on them.\u201d Barton said the DfE\u2019s performance tables were \u201clong past their sell-by date\u201d and called for reforms to the way in which school statistics are presented. \u201cThe secondary school performance tables are inherently flawed in that the headline measure of progress 8, which is used to judge the performance of schools, effectively penalises schools which have a high proportion of disadvantaged children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe effect of this is to stigmatise these schools, making it more difficult to recruit headteachers and teachers, and demoralising pupils, parents and communities.\u201d Data analysed by the FFT Education Datalab research unit, and a working paper using previous GCSE exam results published by the University of Bristol, suggested schools with diverse intakes, especially those with a high proportion of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, are unfairly penalised by the government\u2019s measure.

He suggested that for top business executives, having a piece of high-priced real estate is like a \u201ccalling card to get investments in all the hottest new companies\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a value to being No 1,\u201d he said. \u201cYou make a statement: when you entertain, everyone says, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve heard about this place.\u2019 \u201cAnd, surprisingly, at this high end, these properties end up being very good investments,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hold their value much better than a Lamborghini.\u201d An analysis by CityRealty showed that there is a huge surge of about 2,000 newly constructed luxury apartments coming on to the market in New York City. Meanwhile, it found, the average sale price of a new condominium in the city hit $5m in 2017. But Levy said the market for luxury apartments had softened a bit in New York in the last two years. He said the trend was driven by the increasing number of hyper-expensive units becoming available and by a slight decrease in interest among international buyers. Whatever the case, as regards Griffin, \u201cI\u2019m sure he is very excited to have what will arguably be the nicest apartment in New York and, perhaps, the world,\u201d said Levy. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine there\u2019s a lot of buyer\u2019s remorse.\u201d",

With alcohol consumption in sharp decline and more than a quarter of Britain\u2019s pubs having closed their doors since 2001, it is perhaps no surprise to see that the ONS data indicates that the average household spend on alcoholic drinks \u201caway from the home\u201d was \u00a38 a week \u2013 well down on 10 years earlier, when it was \u00a310.90 after adjusting for inflation. The data revealed that for those in the 50 to 74 age group, almost a quarter of their housing spending went on home improvements and alterations. Meanwhile, households in the under-30 age group and families in Northern Ireland spent the most on takeaway meals eaten at home: \u00a37.80 and \u00a38.60 respectively. Kate Smith, head of pensions at insurer Aegon, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures suggest that families across the UK are continuing to spend money, undeterred by the political and economic uncertainty taking place on a macro scale. People are now spending more each week than they did before the financial crisis.\u201d She added that families whose spending outpaced their earnings \u201ccould find themselves in difficulty if their financial position changes suddenly\u201d. Smith said those aged 50-plus were clearly choosing to \u201cimprove rather than move as the traditional notion of downsizing in retirement fails to appeal\u201d. The ONS said there had been \u201can increasing trend in household spending in recent years following a low point in 2012\u201d. Its data is based on face-to-face interviews and spending diaries kept by respondents. Total average weekly household spending was highest in London, at more than \u00a3650.",

      "body": "<p>The <em>gilets jaunes</em> (yellow vests) have named 10 candidates for the European parliament elections in May and called for more of their fellow demonstrators to put their names forward.</p> <p>The French protest movement that, until now, has had no official leaders or formal organisation, announced on Wednesday that it would take part in the vote on 26 May after 10 weeks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/30/paris-police-fire-tear-gas-yellow-vest-gilet-jaunes-protesters\">occasionally violent demonstrations</a> across the country.</p> <p>The list is headed by Ingrid Levavasseur, 31, a health worker who has become one of the most high-profile members of the movement.</p> <p>Nine other candidates, five women and four men whose ages range from 29 to 53 and who come from various backgrounds, have come forward.</p> <p>A communique from the group said names for France\u2019s other 69 seats in the parliament are open to suggestions before 10 February. Candidates will be chosen in a vote by gilets jaunes activists.</p> <p>Levavasseur accused the French president, Emmanuel Macron, of ignoring the gilets jaunes. \u201cWe just want to be heard,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The movement emerged in November in protest at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\">new eco tax</a> on diesel and petrol. Since then, Macron\u2019s centrist government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/05/france-wealth-tax-changes-gilets-jaunes-protests-president-macron\">dropped the tax</a>, but the movement has morphed into wider opposition to the president and his reformist administration.</p> <p>Macron is currently travelling around France overseeing a \u201cgreat national debate\u201d aimed at responding to public anger expressed by the gilets jaunes, but protesters have continued their demonstrations.</p> <p>Gilets jaunes continue to call for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/05/gilets-jaunes-protesters-france-eighth-week\">demonstrations across France</a> every weekend. In major cities including Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille, these have led to violent clashes between police and protesters.</p> <p>The new group is calling itself the <em>Ralliement d\u2019Initiative Citoyenne</em> (Citizen Initiative Rally) and has the same initials \u2013 RIC \u2013 as one of the gilets jaunes\u2019 key demands for citizens\u2019 referendums to decide national policy.</p> <p>\u201cWe want this list to be carried by people who have been involved in the mobilisation on the roundabouts from the beginning.

      "bodyText": "The gilets jaunes (yellow vests) have named 10 candidates for the European parliament elections in May and called for more of their fellow demonstrators to put their names forward. The French protest movement that, until now, has had no official leaders or formal organisation, announced on Wednesday that it would take part in the vote on 26 May after 10 weeks of occasionally violent demonstrations across the country. The list is headed by Ingrid Levavasseur, 31, a health worker who has become one of the most high-profile members of the movement. Nine other candidates, five women and four men whose ages range from 29 to 53 and who come from various backgrounds, have come forward. A communique from the group said names for France\u2019s other 69 seats in the parliament are open to suggestions before 10 February. Candidates will be chosen in a vote by gilets jaunes activists. Levavasseur accused the French president, Emmanuel Macron, of ignoring the gilets jaunes. \u201cWe just want to be heard,\u201d she said. The movement emerged in November in protest at a new eco tax on diesel and petrol. Since then, Macron\u2019s centrist government has dropped the tax, but the movement has morphed into wider opposition to the president and his reformist administration. Macron is currently travelling around France overseeing a \u201cgreat national debate\u201d aimed at responding to public anger expressed by the gilets jaunes, but protesters have continued their demonstrations. Gilets jaunes continue to call for demonstrations across France every weekend. In major cities including Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille, these have led to violent clashes between police and protesters. The new group is calling itself the Ralliement d\u2019Initiative Citoyenne (Citizen Initiative Rally) and has the same initials \u2013 RIC \u2013 as one of the gilets jaunes\u2019 key demands for citizens\u2019 referendums to decide national policy. \u201cWe want this list to be carried by people who have been involved in the mobilisation on the roundabouts from the beginning. No technocrats,\u201d their statement read. \u201dWe must transform the anger into a human political project that is able to bring solutions to the French.\u201d Previous attempts by gilets jaunes to organise have led to those putting themselves forward being subjected to abuse and threats from rival groups. Levavasseur, from Normandy, was signed up by the French television station BFMTV as a commentator, but turned down the job earlier this month after she was abused by other gilets jaunes. Le Figaro newspaper said the group had to raise \u20ac700,000 (\u00a3610,000) to field the election list of candidates and had about 10% of that figure so far. RIC has not said how it will raise the remainder, but is considering appealing for donations through a crowdfunding campaign. Its programme is likely to be anti-European. The group\u2019s statement added: \u201cWe no longer wish to suffer the decisions of European authorities and the diktats of the castes of financiers and technocrats who have forgotten the most important things: the human being, solidarity and the planet.\u201d Le Figaro reported that another gilets jaunes group may present its own list for the European election. An Elabe opinion poll published on Wednesday suggested gilets jaunes candidates could attract 13% of the vote behind Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique en Marche and the far-right Rassemblement National (formerly the Front National).",

Sure enough, by the end of that five-year timeline the company had announced just one successful trial \u2013 with two customers in UK who had huge gardens, lived close to an Amazon depot and were happy to order items that weighed less than 2.6kg. In the meantime, a number of startups have pursued the less ambitious target of putting small autonomous vehicles on pavements to deliver small parcels and food orders. These projects have been controversial in their own right, accused of clogging pavements and privatising public space, as well as leading to a loss of income for delivery workers. But they have progressed nonetheless. Starship Technologies, one of the leading companies in the sector, launched its first commercial business in April 2018 and is currently running trials in Milton Keynes in the UK. A Starship spokesperson gave Amazon\u2019s project a cold welcome, saying: \u201cWe created this space four years ago and have since seen many other companies join, Amazon being the latest.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A 94-year-old peaceful protester has won an eight-year legal battle to force the police to delete details of his political activities from a secretive database. On Thursday, the European court of human rights ruled in favour of John Catt, noting he \u201chad never been convicted of any offence and his risk of violent criminality was remote\u201d. The activist had argued police were not justified in retaining 66 records of his activities at peace and human rights protests. They contained descriptions of his appearance and clothes at the protests and how he liked to draw sketches of the demonstrations. The eight European judges decided police had violated his human rights as they had no pressing need to retain the records on a database of \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d. They added that the database did not have effective safeguards to protect the rights of protesters. Catt\u2019s lawyer, Shamik Dutta, said he had been vindicated. \u201cThis ruling sets an important precedent that it is unlawful for governments across Europe to label citizens engaged in peaceful protest domestic extremists and put them on a searchable database for a potentially indefinite period,\u201d he added. Campaigners called on police to close down the secretive databases they hold on protesters. Forces have been criticised for retaining secret files on the political activities of thousands of campaigners, including the Green party politicians Caroline Lucas and Jenny Jones. The files on Catt had been collected and stored by a secretive police unit whose undercover operations infiltrating political groups caused controversy. Catt, who lives in Brighton, has been a peace campaigner since 1948. In 2010, he used the Data Protection Act 1998 to discover police had conducted surveillance on him at demonstrations between 2005 and 2009. Most of the records concerned a campaign to close down an arms factory in Brighton, while others logged his attendance at a trade union conference in 2006 and a demonstration at the Labour party conference in 2007. They recorded how he \u201csat on a folding chair \u2026 and appeared to be sketching\u201d at one demonstration. Another noted at a different protest, \u201che was using his drawing pad to sketch a picture of the protest and police presence\u201d. The records had been kept by the now defunct National Public Order Intelligence Unit, which police said was tasked with monitoring protesters who used criminal methods to promote their cause. In their verdict, the judges said police were justified in collecting the information as the group campaigning against the Brighton arms factory were known to be violent and potentially criminal. They added that while Catt had never been violent, he had identified himself repeatedly with the group, which is known as Smash EDO. However, the judges said police were not justified in retaining the records on Catt, as they contained personal data including his political opinions, which should have a heightened level of protection from state surveillance. They said it was accepted Catt did not pose a threat to anyone and noted police did not have effective safeguards on the database, particularly as there were no rules on how long files on individuals should be kept for. The judges said they were concerned police had no clear definition of what constituted \u201cdomestic extremism\u201d and, in Catt\u2019s case, did not appear to have respected their fluid definition to recognise he was a peaceful protester. Kevin Blowe of the Network for Police Monitoring civil liberties group said: \u201cThis case highlights concerns Netpol has raised repeatedly over the past decade about the extremely flexible misuse of the \u2018extremist\u2019 label against political activists and the unlawful retention of information about them by the police.\u201d",

Its pleasures number too many to enumerate here \u2013 okay, fine: Hathaway\u2019s character gets a momentous introduction with a Matrix-style 180-degree swoop \u2013 so do yourself the kindness of seeing this zeppelin crash of a film before its unceremonious dismissal from theaters. Insulate yourself from any further knowledge to the best of your ability, and bear witness to the minting of a new gold standard in January movies. Serenity is out in the US on 25 January and in the UK on 1 March",

Their new album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/10/deerhunter-why-hasnt-everything-already-disappeared-review\" title=\"\">Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared?</a> is terrifically bleak without being maudlin, beautifully sketching out worlds that are teetering or actually ending. But Cox, once ensconced in his home, is a picture of contentment. \u201cThe only great fear I have is losing my parents, or anyone in my family, and my dog,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish those things could last for ever, and then I would have heaven. I have everything I want.\u201d</p> <p>He has double-booked me, and apologises: would I mind going to his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/michael-stipe\">Michael Stipe</a>\u2019s birthday party? As inconveniences go, it ranks low, and so we head off to Athens, the next sizeable town to the east. This is where Cox grew up, poor, and had a tough childhood: complications resulting from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/03/yoga-podcast-marfans-syndrome\">Marfan syndrome</a> left him his rake-thin profile, and required surgery and months in hospital. Succour eventually came from going to see bands such as Stereolab. \u201cWhen I was just a boy at 12 or 13, [Stereolab co-founder] Tim Gane said to me his favourite word was \u2018juxtaposition\u2019. I remember that sticking out to me. And I said: \u2018Well, that\u2019ll be my favourite word, and my life will be devoted to juxtaposing.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG2TgCuMcjM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zG2TgCuMcjM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>At Stipe\u2019s house, Cox does not seem particularly thrilled by the party element of the birthday party, and mostly wants to give Stipe his present, a painting by fellow Atlanta visionary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/05/twenty-six-siblings-and-a-child-labour-camp-how-lonnie-holleys-epic-life-led-to-the-years-best-album\">Lonnie Holley</a>. His lanky frame stiffens when we enter Stipe\u2019s noisy kitchen, and we make fitful small talk next to Helena Christensen, Cox holding an untouched portion of cake as if out of duty. There is a great spread, but he would rather head off and eat elsewhere. We get back in the Volvo and head to a diner, where Deerhunter bassist Josh McKay happens to be sitting at another table. A journeyman Georgia indie rocker who once played in a band with River Phoenix, McKay replaced Josh Fauver, who later died young at 39, a subject Cox will not talk about. McKay and keyboardist Javier Morales had themselves dodged death the previous week, after a car smashed into theirs. Cox is not massively sympathetic, slightly scolding McKay for not buying his previous Volvo; McKay breathes his irritation in through his nose and swallows it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s something uniquely toxic about this current situation, a new chemical scent that I\u2019ve never smelled before</p> <footer> <cite>Bradford Cox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is the only glimpse all weekend of the frictions that have sometimes flared up in the band, that first formed in 2001. All the members seem to agree that they are in a better place now than when they were making previous records. Guitarist Lockett Pundt describes 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/09/deerhunter-monomania-review\">Monomania</a> as having \u201ca kind of snarl, a lot of anger and resentment \u2026 the creation was kind of nightmarish\u201d, but has recently noticed a \u201cmaturation in the band \u2026 we enjoy each other\u2019s company more [now] than in the past\u201d. McKay says they are like \u201cmisunderstood cousins\u201d with Cox as \u201cmum and dad in one\u201d. Cox meanwhile, who writes the bulk of the band\u2019s music as demos before the band refine it together, describes their creative process as: \u201cThis oil just erupted through the floor of the desert, but now we\u2019re going to build a scaffolding around it.\u201d</p> <p>The waitress brings over the bill with a Deerhunter lyric quoted on top in Biro. The next day, Faulkner leads us around their cloudless Atlanta neighbourhood as we talk about town planning. In the local cafe, they know how Cox likes his tea: on ice, steeped for seven minutes. Where on earth has Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared?, \u201cempirically a bummer record\u201d according to Cox, come from amid this indie version of Eden?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m basically trying to take a zeitgeist and run with it,\u201d Cox says, back sitting in his living room. \u201cThere\u2019s something uniquely toxic about this current situation, a new chemical scent that I\u2019ve never smelled before. It\u2019s like burning plastic.\u201d Is Trump to blame for this social discord? \u201cHow can you blame one person? There\u2019s a general narcissism, a general sense of meaninglessness, really. And the rush to synthesise some sort of meaning out of the versions of ourselves that we create and promote.\u201d Not that it\u2019s a bad thing for art he says: he was up late watching The Third Man, and quotes the Orson Welles line about the Italians having bloodshed and Michelangelo, and the Swiss having peace and the cuckoo clock. \u201cIt is an interesting way of framing human history: the worse it gets, art restates its value and necessity. In a peaceful and contented culture, art becomes subdued \u2013 all of its art is going to be based on designs for living. [Apple designer] Jonathan Ive is probably one of the most important modern artists,\u201d he says, witheringly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb59b118daff14387ddd07b3c9403b17d5fc1d31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb59b118daff14387ddd07b3c9403b17d5fc1d31/0_103_2896_2928/989.jpg\" alt=\"Bradford Cox\" width=\"989\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradford Cox on stage at Field Day, London, in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Isaac/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One song, the Kinks-referencing No One\u2019s Sleeping, was written straight after Cox heard about the killing of British MP Jo Cox by a man opposed to her stance on the EU and immigration: \u201cGreat unrest / In the country / There\u2019s much duress / Violence has taken hold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was laying in bed with my dog, reading the news, and I was moved to stand up and groan by the frustration,\u201d Cox says. \u201cIt\u2019s just violence, it\u2019s sickening.\u201d Like many, he regards the rise of populism wearily. \u201cHaving grown up in the American south, I understand about poverty. And how poverty can leave one to feel a strange, brassy sense of dignity, and a need for one to possess one\u2019s culture and identity. There\u2019s an aspiration to be the ruling class, the ones who can trace their ancestry to primitive beaches. We feel entitled to a national identity, and tribalism, which is sad.\u201d He compares us unfavourably to Faulkner and his canine friends. \u201cWhen I take my dog up to the dog park, he doesn\u2019t play with dogs of his own size or colouring or breed, he plays with all the dogs. They become a mad pack, tongues wagging, happy to be together.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Punk\u2019s much easier when you don\u2019t have to wake up in the morning, and that\u2019s who dominates punk</p> <footer> <cite>Bradford Cox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another song, Element, is even more stricken, seemingly taking place in a painterly nuclear apocalypse. \u201cHumanity is like a 12-year-old who has just realised what suicide is: \u2018Wait, we could actually just end it all?\u2019 Well, everyone wants to leave if things get not fun; no one wants to stay at a party that turns foul.\u201d He segues into free association, also his songwriting method. \u201cAre black holes punk? Are they nihilist? Do they have safety pins through their cheeks? Is antimatter suicidal, does it possess an urge to destroy, to uncreate?\u201d</p> <p>When he first moved to Atlanta, Cox lived with an underground punk crowd and his no-fucks-given performances (including one where he covered My Sharona for an hour) have a punk attitude, but he is jaded by the snotty aesthetic that \u201cpunk\u201d conjures. To begin with, \u201cpunk is essentially just as misogynistic as being in a frat; a lot of it really was white men creating more conniving ways to impose their self-perceived superiority on people\u201d. Moreover, it was a culture of privilege, he says. \u201cPunk\u2019s much easier when you don\u2019t have to wake up in the morning, and that\u2019s who dominates punk. The working class wake up and they work. The punks would be very happy with all this conservative psychosis: \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s watch it burn!\u2019 Whereas there\u2019s no little object in this house that I haven\u2019t worked for, and I don\u2019t want the world to fall apart because I want my dog and I to stay here.\u201d</p> <p>So have you become more socially conscious? \u201cQuite the opposite. I do not feel myself becoming more engaged with culture or society.\u201d</p> <p>And yet you are communing with what\u2019s happening in that culture. \u201cWe\u2019re living in supernatural times, and the supernatural has always appealed to me. Well, supernatural is now just referred to as genetically modified. Witchcraft is real, now. It\u2019s patented.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cI just sound like a fucking Radiohead interview in 1996.\u201d He warms to the theme, though. \u201cThey\u2019re like the big brothers in college when I was a kid, and now I\u2019m in college, and I\u2019m like: \u2018The world is fucked up!\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018We already knew that. We\u2019re married with kids now, we\u2019re happy, we\u2019ve realised you can just settle into it.\u2019 But I\u2019m an apocalypse writer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8095ded23e2fd57eaa13866d07925a18d2925dc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8095ded23e2fd57eaa13866d07925a18d2925dc9/0_0_6000_3978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deerhunter, with Bradford Cox, left.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deerhunter, with Bradford Cox, left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final track, Nocturne, is described as \u201ca final dispatch before ascending to heaven\u201d, and Cox is saved from total desperation by his belief in God, \u201cin a way that virtually no one would understand. I\u2019m appalled by what people have done in the name of Christianity. But God\u2019s all I\u2019ve got because if I didn\u2019t have that faith \u2026 Are you listening to my lyrics, this stuff that\u2019s coming out of my mouth? I\u2019ve not got a lot else to live for. The flowers in my garden die and are reborn in the spring; I like to hope there\u2019s some design to this cycle.\u201d He calls the new album \u201cvery hopeless\u201d, so has he ever felt truly hopeless himself? \u201cI\u2019ve never been suicidal, if that\u2019s the implication. I don\u2019t find it romantic, I just find it selfish and distasteful. Hopelessness is no different from hunger or having to defecate; it\u2019s just part of the process until the next sense of renewal. I take antidepressants, I\u2019ve battled depression like so many others, but I wasn\u2019t feeling hopeless when I wrote this album; I was writing this album about hopelessness. Horror is not eternal. I personally hug my dog.\u201d</p> <p>And he writes music, including superb solo albums as Atlas Sound; he rushes upstairs to show me how he works, building up a track from drums, guitar and a tone-generation machine used to test children\u2019s hearing. A proud asexual, he says his lack of libido means \u201cmy entire world is based on aesthetic contemplation, with no distractions\u201d. In 2016, Cox told the podcast <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/authors/start-making-sense/\">Start Making Sense</a> that \u201cat 34 years old, I\u2019m actually a virgin\u201d. Might he ever be interested in sex? \u201cThat\u2019s like asking a homosexual: do you think you\u2019ll ever be interested in a woman? It\u2019s a bit rude. The problem with society is they patted themselves on the back \u2013 which is a very white male behaviour \u2013 for accepting the homosexual, the bisexual, the transgender person, as much as they do, which leaves a lot to be desired. But no one acknowledges asexuality as an actual thing. People so often say to me: \u2018Well, you just haven\u2019t met the right person.\u2019 As if asexuality is like having braces, they\u2019ll come off eventually.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/10/deerhunter-why-hasnt-everything-already-disappeared-review\">Deerhunter: Why Hasn't Everything Already Disappeared? review \u2013 beautiful and strange desert drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, he can settle into being an aesthete, and a father to his band and Faulkner.

We feel entitled to a national identity, and tribalism, which is sad.\u201d He compares us unfavourably to Faulkner and his canine friends. \u201cWhen I take my dog up to the dog park, he doesn\u2019t play with dogs of his own size or colouring or breed, he plays with all the dogs. They become a mad pack, tongues wagging, happy to be together.\u201d Another song, Element, is even more stricken, seemingly taking place in a painterly nuclear apocalypse. \u201cHumanity is like a 12-year-old who has just realised what suicide is: \u2018Wait, we could actually just end it all?\u2019 Well, everyone wants to leave if things get not fun; no one wants to stay at a party that turns foul.\u201d He segues into free association, also his songwriting method. \u201cAre black holes punk? Are they nihilist? Do they have safety pins through their cheeks? Is antimatter suicidal, does it possess an urge to destroy, to uncreate?\u201d When he first moved to Atlanta, Cox lived with an underground punk crowd and his no-fucks-given performances (including one where he covered My Sharona for an hour) have a punk attitude, but he is jaded by the snotty aesthetic that \u201cpunk\u201d conjures. To begin with, \u201cpunk is essentially just as misogynistic as being in a frat; a lot of it really was white men creating more conniving ways to impose their self-perceived superiority on people\u201d. Moreover, it was a culture of privilege, he says. \u201cPunk\u2019s much easier when you don\u2019t have to wake up in the morning, and that\u2019s who dominates punk. The working class wake up and they work. The punks would be very happy with all this conservative psychosis: \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s watch it burn!\u2019 Whereas there\u2019s no little object in this house that I haven\u2019t worked for, and I don\u2019t want the world to fall apart because I want my dog and I to stay here.\u201d So have you become more socially conscious? \u201cQuite the opposite. I do not feel myself becoming more engaged with culture or society.\u201d And yet you are communing with what\u2019s happening in that culture. \u201cWe\u2019re living in supernatural times, and the supernatural has always appealed to me. Well, supernatural is now just referred to as genetically modified. Witchcraft is real, now. It\u2019s patented.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cI just sound like a fucking Radiohead interview in 1996.\u201d He warms to the theme, though. \u201cThey\u2019re like the big brothers in college when I was a kid, and now I\u2019m in college, and I\u2019m like: \u2018The world is fucked up!\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018We already knew that. We\u2019re married with kids now, we\u2019re happy, we\u2019ve realised you can just settle into it.\u2019 But I\u2019m an apocalypse writer.\u201d The final track, Nocturne, is described as \u201ca final dispatch before ascending to heaven\u201d, and Cox is saved from total desperation by his belief in God, \u201cin a way that virtually no one would understand. I\u2019m appalled by what people have done in the name of Christianity. But God\u2019s all I\u2019ve got because if I didn\u2019t have that faith \u2026 Are you listening to my lyrics, this stuff that\u2019s coming out of my mouth? I\u2019ve not got a lot else to live for. The flowers in my garden die and are reborn in the spring; I like to hope there\u2019s some design to this cycle.\u201d He calls the new album \u201cvery hopeless\u201d, so has he ever felt truly hopeless himself? \u201cI\u2019ve never been suicidal, if that\u2019s the implication. I don\u2019t find it romantic, I just find it selfish and distasteful. Hopelessness is no different from hunger or having to defecate; it\u2019s just part of the process until the next sense of renewal. I take antidepressants, I\u2019ve battled depression like so many others, but I wasn\u2019t feeling hopeless when I wrote this album; I was writing this album about hopelessness. Horror is not eternal. I personally hug my dog.\u201d And he writes music, including superb solo albums as Atlas Sound; he rushes upstairs to show me how he works, building up a track from drums, guitar and a tone-generation machine used to test children\u2019s hearing. A proud asexual, he says his lack of libido means \u201cmy entire world is based on aesthetic contemplation, with no distractions\u201d. In 2016, Cox told the podcast Start Making Sense that \u201cat 34 years old, I\u2019m actually a virgin\u201d. Might he ever be interested in sex? \u201cThat\u2019s like asking a homosexual: do you think you\u2019ll ever be interested in a woman? It\u2019s a bit rude. The problem with society is they patted themselves on the back \u2013 which is a very white male behaviour \u2013 for accepting the homosexual, the bisexual, the transgender person, as much as they do, which leaves a lot to be desired. But no one acknowledges asexuality as an actual thing. People so often say to me: \u2018Well, you just haven\u2019t met the right person.\u2019 As if asexuality is like having braces, they\u2019ll come off eventually.\u201d Instead, he can settle into being an aesthete, and a father to his band and Faulkner. He tells me what he finds beautiful: \u201cDesigns in plastics like Bakelite, English watercolours, the bass clarinet, always the drums, really fine French paper. It\u2019s kind of pretentious, but there is nothing more beautiful than a blank piece of paper. It\u2019s a bit like seeing a puppy and thinking: \u2018What an amazing time I\u2019m going to have raising you.\u2019\u201d We head off to the park, where Faulkner runs around happily with all the other dogs. \u2022 Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared? is out now on 4AD",

      "bodyText": "Alex Salmond is one of the most significant political figures of recent British history, whose tenure as first minister of Scotland transformed the debate about the UK\u2019s constitutional future. In less than a decade, Salmond succeeded in normalising the question of Scottish independence, rebuilt the Scottish National party into an electoral machine that has convincingly replaced Labour as Scotland\u2019s dominant political force, and laid the groundwork for significant new powers for its devolved government and parliament. News of the charges against him will send shockwaves through his party and its current leadership. Although his influence has diminished markedly since he lost his House of Commons seat in 2017, Salmond still commands significant levels of loyalty among its activists and SNP parliamentarians. Many of them have supported him after the disclosure that the Scottish government had investigated complaints against him. When he launched a crowdfunding campaign to back his legal action over the government inquiry, he raised more than \u00a3100,000 from more than 4,000 people in a matter of days. On 7 January, after months of insisting it would robustly defend its handling of the claims, the Scottish government admitted in an emergency court hearing it had botched it. Leslie Evans, Scotland\u2019s chief civil servant, acknowledged the official charged with handling the formal inquiry had met the complainants before they officially complained. Evans insisted that the outcome did not \u201chave implications, one way or the other, for the substance of the complaints or the credibility of the complainers\u201d, but acknowledged that prior contact was unlawful and gave the appearance of bias. Salmond had become the first SNP first minister in 2007, winning the Holyrood election by a single seat over Labour, with bullish promises to re-energise the Scottish government, making bold offers to abolish student debt and cut local taxes. By then an SNP veteran, it was Salmond\u2019s second stint as leader. He had led the SNP through the 1990s when it was a minor political force with just six MPs. He resigned in 2000, for reasons which remain poorly understood, but came back as leader in 2004, to recast his party as a far more disciplined, focused force.

It is understood that the BBC is also looking at the Netherlands and Ireland as potential sites for the new offshoot. The BBC will need EU-based licences for its international channels \u2013 which include BBC World, BBC Entertainment, BBC First, and BBC Earth \u2013 if it wishes to have them broadcast across the rest of Europe either after 29 March, if the UK leaves without a deal, or after the transition period, should Theresa May\u2019s agreement be approved by parliament. The prime minister has been seeking to include the audiovisual industry in a free trade agreement to avoid the problem, but her pleas have been ignored.

More than 500 pan-European channels use licences issued by the British regulator Ofcom. International media companies reportedly spend about \u00a31bn a year in the UK, making it the most significant such hub. After Brexit, however, the licences are likely to be invalid as the UK will have left the EU\u2019s single market.

      "body": "<p>A fundamental quality of a piece of music is how it makes us experience time. Wagner, Bruckner and Mahler persuade us the world has slowed down; three minutes of punk speeds it up to a frenzy. <a href=\"https://richardcauston.com/\">Richard Causton</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://seenandheard-international.com/2019/01/new-ik-zeg-nu-i-say-now-now-an-interview-with-richard-causton/\">new work for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Ik zeg: NU</a>, holds two timeframes in play simultaneously, and brilliantly. Its title, Dutch for \u201cI say: NOW\u201d, is borrowed from a family history written by a 98-year-old relative, but Causton\u2019s piece isn\u2019t really concerned with the book. Rather, it plays on the idea of time coexisting in eras and seconds, and always, always slipping through one\u2019s fingers.</p> <p>As Causton explained in a brief discussion, the piece has two musical paces. At first, speed grabs us: perky, childlike banter among huddles of woodwind, who play parallel curlicues that evaporate upwards into the quiet swish of a cymbal, then set off again. But below this a longer thread is being spun that eventually coalesces into music that sounds like breathing but is too slow even for sleep. An accordion exhales. The percussion, including a set of microtonal tubular bells made by Causton and his father, set up an impossibly slow descent that sucks in the whole orchestra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3fada09d28d635e6249b65739e3cccf568afa44c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fada09d28d635e6249b65739e3cccf568afa44c/0_92_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Isserlis performs Schumann\u2019s Cello Concerto with the BBCSO under Sakari Oramo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Isserlis performs Schumann\u2019s Cello Concerto with the BBCSO under Sakari Oramo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Causton sustains the tension over 25 minutes \u2013 quite some achievement. It\u2019s as much thanks to the fascination he creates from the shifting balance between the two speeds as to the glowing colours the BBCSO created for conductor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/10/conductor-sakari-oramo-first-night-proms\">Sakari Oramo</a>.</p> <p>The Oramo-BBCSO partnership goes from strength to strength. Their performance of Brahms\u2019s Third Symphony was proof: thickly woven yet full of clarity and purposeful detail, the orchestra putty in Oramo\u2019s hands. In between came Schumann\u2019s Cello Concerto, of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/10/what-horrors-it-must-have-witnessed-steven-isserlis-on-how-a-trench-cello-found-its-voice-again\">Steven Isserlis</a> has long been a champion. As ever, he played it with the joy of a man conducting along to his favourite recording while nobody is watching. His gut-stringed cello is an unassuming beast next to a modern-strung chamber orchestra, but his seamless phrasing and sweet tone drew the ear unfailingly towards him, and his Catalan folksong encore held the hall rapt.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A fundamental quality of a piece of music is how it makes us experience time. Wagner, Bruckner and Mahler persuade us the world has slowed down; three minutes of punk speeds it up to a frenzy. Richard Causton\u2019s new work for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Ik zeg: NU, holds two timeframes in play simultaneously, and brilliantly. Its title, Dutch for \u201cI say: NOW\u201d, is borrowed from a family history written by a 98-year-old relative, but Causton\u2019s piece isn\u2019t really concerned with the book. Rather, it plays on the idea of time coexisting in eras and seconds, and always, always slipping through one\u2019s fingers. As Causton explained in a brief discussion, the piece has two musical paces. At first, speed grabs us: perky, childlike banter among huddles of woodwind, who play parallel curlicues that evaporate upwards into the quiet swish of a cymbal, then set off again. But below this a longer thread is being spun that eventually coalesces into music that sounds like breathing but is too slow even for sleep. An accordion exhales. The percussion, including a set of microtonal tubular bells made by Causton and his father, set up an impossibly slow descent that sucks in the whole orchestra. Causton sustains the tension over 25 minutes \u2013 quite some achievement. It\u2019s as much thanks to the fascination he creates from the shifting balance between the two speeds as to the glowing colours the BBCSO created for conductor Sakari Oramo. The Oramo-BBCSO partnership goes from strength to strength. Their performance of Brahms\u2019s Third Symphony was proof: thickly woven yet full of clarity and purposeful detail, the orchestra putty in Oramo\u2019s hands. In between came Schumann\u2019s Cello Concerto, of which Steven Isserlis has long been a champion. As ever, he played it with the joy of a man conducting along to his favourite recording while nobody is watching. His gut-stringed cello is an unassuming beast next to a modern-strung chamber orchestra, but his seamless phrasing and sweet tone drew the ear unfailingly towards him, and his Catalan folksong encore held the hall rapt.",

      "bodyText": "Kristin Scott Thomas is among the guest stars lined up for the imminent second series of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s BBC comedy-drama Fleabag. The Four Weddings and a Funeral star, a Bafta and Olivier award winner, will appear in an as-yet-unannounced role in the series, which is expected to air this spring. Adapted from Waller-Bridge\u2019s one-woman play of the same name, Fleabag follows its troubled titular character as she muddles through millennial life in London, negotiating grief, social anxiety and a number of awkward sexual encounters. Its first series, which was shown on BBC Three in 2016, received widespread acclaim for its mix of black comedy and affecting drama, and currently holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The show\u2019s second series, which Waller-Bridge says she dreamed up while on a bus, is said to be centred on the theme of \u201cFleabag v God\u201d, as the character wrestles with issues of faith and is brought closer to her estranged sister Claire (Sian Clifford). As well as Scott Thomas, Fleabag\u2019s second series will reunite Fiona Shaw with Waller-Bridge after the Irish actor appeared as the flinty MI6 operative Carolyn Martens in last year\u2019s popular spy thriller Killing Eve, which was also written by Fleabag\u2019s star and creator. The pair join the already announced Andrew Scott, best known for his performance as Moriarty in the BBC\u2019s updating of Sherlock, who will appear as a man of the cloth who prompts Fleabag into a new way of thinking. Olivia Colman, Hugh Skinner and Hugh Dennis are among the returning cast members. Responding to the casting of Scott Thomas and Shaw, Waller-Bridge said, \u201cthey literally begged me to be in it. Begged me. Begged. One of them was crying.\u201d",

That happened to 11,382 people last week alone, of whom 2,329 waited more than an hour. \u201cFor 75,000 sick and vulnerable people to be delayed waiting in ambulances or with paramedics unable to get into hospital really is an indictment of nine years of mismanagement of the NHS,\u201d said Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. \u201cThe NHS remains under severe pressure struggling with chronic staff shortages and wider cuts impacting the front line. Ministers must urgently explain to patients how the NHS will get the staff needed to give patients the care they deserve.\u201d The NHS has been coping better this winter than many senior figures in the service expected, mainly because of the unusually mild weather and lack, so far, of a large-scale flu outbreak. But with record numbers of people seeking help at emergency departments, hospitals have had to divert A&amp;E patients 177 times in the past seven weeks. High demand and staff shortages led Worcestershire acute hospitals trust, which runs hospitals with A&amp;E units in Worcester and Redditch, to divert 51 times \u2013 far more than any other trust in England. In the week up to last Sunday, 11 trusts had at least 99% of their beds occupied. Walsall healthcare trust was the fullest, at 99.71% of capacity, closely followed by the Princess Alexandra hospital trust in Harlow, Essex, on 99.7%. Bed occupancy at Frimley health trust in Surrey, where some of Theresa May\u2019s constituents go for care, was 99.24%, while it was 93.75% at the Royal Berkshire trust in Reading, which also serves her seat in nearby Maidenhead. West Suffolk trust, which covers the constituency of the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, also had very few spare beds. Its occupancy rate was 97.66%. Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said that while an \u201cNHS winter crisis\u201d had not begun at the start of January, winter pressures were starting to bite. \u201cThis year has felt like a steady ramping-up of pressure day by day, week by week since Christmas. The service is working harder than ever to achieve what it has so far this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressure is a bit less intense than last year but is constant and inching upwards. But to say that it is not last year does not mean things are good.\u201d About half of the NHS\u2019s acute medical specialists, who treat admissions not requiring surgery, have been asked to work extra shifts at weekends to help hospitals cope, Scriven added. While fewer people are getting flu than last year, it is often leaving people who contract it more unwell, which is putting pressure on intensive care and high dependency units. \u201cI work in a small hospital but we\u2019ve had at least one patient in our intensive care unit every day since 23 December with flu-related illness,\u201d added Scriven. An NHS spokesperson said the service was dealing well with the extra challenges winter involves. \u201cThe NHS continues to perform well thanks to the hard work of its staff, with fewer delayed ambulance handovers and hospitals supporting more patients to return home quicker. \u201cWith cold weather alerts in place, the public have an important role to play in doing what they can to stay well and making use of health services wisely.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>22. Gigli (2003)</h2> \n<p>Could it have been anything else? Gigli wasn\u2019t just a lead balloon; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1049520,00.html\" title=\"\">it was the Hindenburg</a>. It\u2019s widely considered to be one of the worst films ever made. It made a 10th of its budget back. It derailed the careers of Lopez and Ben Affleck (who were engaged but split up shortly after it was made) and the director, Martin Brest, who never directed again. To quote one of the great poets, \u201cgobble gobble\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UhCCHFZugE\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8UhCCHFZugE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>21. Jersey Girl (2004)</h2> \n<p>How did Lopez bounce back from this historic flop? By making the second-worst film of her career, also with Affleck. A sludgy Kevin Smith melodrama, Lopez\u2019s role was pruned for fear it would remind people of Gigli, which it did anyway. The best thing about it is that Lopez dies quite quickly.</p> \n<h2>20. Jack (1996)</h2> \n<p>One of those films where every detail makes you question whether or not it even existed. It stars Robin Williams as a schoolboy who looks like a middle-aged man. The poster features the title written in crayon. Bill Cosby is in it. Francis Ford Coppola directed it, for crying out loud. Lopez isn\u2019t bad in Jack \u2013 she has a relatively small, sweet part \u2013 but that shouldn\u2019t detract from the fact that she\u2019s in it.</p> \n<h2>19. Bordertown (2007)</h2> \n<p>Booed at its Berlin premiere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/27/news2\" title=\"\">Bordertown</a> is a witless would-be thriller that obliterates every one of its good intentions with sheer turbo-powered boneheadedness. Lopez plays a hardbitten news reporter on investigating a spate of murders on the US-Mexico border in a film that contains a genuinely confusing musical number by <a href=\"https://www.juanes.net/\" title=\"\">the Colombian pop star Juanes</a> for literally no reason at all.</p> \n<h2>18. The Back-Up Plan (2010)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"357fd2d07088879e5a3afc111d9cece8ee8240ad\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/357fd2d07088879e5a3afc111d9cece8ee8240ad/0_0_2048_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Back-Up Plan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Back-Up Plan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sony</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By far the worst J-Lo romcom of all time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/06/the-back-up-plan-review\" title=\"\">The Back-Up Plan</a> sees Lopez playing a woman who falls in love with an anonymous boy actor three seconds after being artificially inseminated with twins. Will they stay together? Will he raise her kids? Who decided this film was a good idea? Fun fact: Lopez vomits into a bin at the end.</p> \n<h2>17. An Unfinished Life (2005)</h2> \n<p>AKA what happens when Lopez takes a dumb swing at Oscar bait. There\u2019s grief, there\u2019s domestic abuse, there\u2019s a car crash, there\u2019s endless hokey small-town Americana, there\u2019s a bear attack. Robert Redford is in this; if it wasn\u2019t for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/09/thriller.tomcruise\" title=\"\">Lions for Lambs</a>, this would be his worst film.</p> \n<h2>16. El Cantante (2006)</h2> \n<p>Gigli and Jersey Girl taught Lopez important lessons about the dangers of working with your romantic partner. But she clearly never listened, because in 2006 she made this entirely generic vanity project of a music biopic with her new husband, Marc Anthony. It is just as miserable as you would expect.</p> \n<h2>15. Lila &amp; Eve (2015)</h2> \n<p>Last year, Viola Davis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/20/viola-davis-stifled-who-was-lost-years-the-help\" title=\"\">railed against her unfair treatment as a black woman in Hollywood</a>. Looking at Lila &amp; Eve \u2013 a direct-to-VOD vigilante crime drama co-starring Lopez from 2015, in which she recites the Alcoholics Anonymous serenity prayer to avenge her son\u2019s death \u2013 it\u2019s hard to disagree.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogfry3rFHDw\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ogfry3rFHDw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>14. Angel Eyes (2001)</h2> \n<p>A mystical jazz musician-turned-hobo walks the streets of Chicago performing kind acts for strangers. One of these kind acts, inexplicably, involves stopping the world\u2019s most beautiful cop from being shot in the head with a machine gun. Then they fall in love. I promise I am not making any of this up.</p> \n<h2>13. Shall We Dance? (2004)</h2> \n<p>Richard Gere plays Richard Gere from Pretty Woman, Jennifer Lopez plays Jennifer Lopez from 70% of all Jennifer Lopez films and Susan Sarandon slowly realises that she made a terrible mistake by agreeing to appear in such a soggy wad of a film.</p> \n<h2>12. The Boy Next Door (2015)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f0977b79b1d0d9bd94e6df82067fbd3a4ee7d14\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f0977b79b1d0d9bd94e6df82067fbd3a4ee7d14/0_109_3238_1943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Literary \u2026 J-Lo in The Boy Next Door.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Literary \u2026 J-Lo in The Boy Next Door.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Hanover/Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In which Lopez\u2019s teenage neighbour gives her a suspiciously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/22/the-boy-next-door-first-look-review\">new-looking first-edition copy of the Iliad</a>, sleeps with her, then goes bananas and ultimately gets stabbed in the eye with an EpiPen. Not anywhere as fun as I\u2019ve made it sound.</p> \n<h2>11. Second Act (2018)</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/24/second-act-review-jennifer-lopez\">Second Act review \u2013 Jennifer Lopez in ludicrous Working Girl knock-off</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A film that only exists by sheer dint of J-Lo\u2019s effort. It borrows the hacky romcom premise of her other films (low-class woman is mistaken for high-class woman), gives itself a title that\u2019s clearly meant to be seen as a future delineation point in Lopez\u2019s filmography, then spaffs itself raw trying and failing to justify its own existence. You will watch this on a plane and then instantly forget about it.</p> \n<h2>10. Parker (2013)</h2> \n<p>On paper, this should have been Lopez\u2019s nadir \u2013 playing a supporting role in a Jason Statham film, for God\u2019s sake \u2013 and yet it isn\u2019t completely awful. It\u2019s a little anonymous, and entirely forgettable, but she\u2019s made much worse.</p> \n<h2>9. Anaconda (1997)</h2> \n<p>True, sequels such as Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid, Anaconda 3: Offspring, Anacondas: Trail of Blood and Lake Placid vs Anaconda might have taken the shine off the original a little. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/nov/20/features2\" title=\"\">this is still fun and stupid</a>, especially if you like watching Owen Wilson get swallowed by a snake.</p> \n<h2>8. Enough (2002)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c15012d6de44856d4167c50772e3e61e96dc4f0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c15012d6de44856d4167c50772e3e61e96dc4f0/0_0_2336_3504/667.jpg\" alt=\"Enough.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enough.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A film that Lopez could only have made at the height of her fame. It\u2019s a sort of Karate Kid remake, but about a woman who learns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/17/krav-maga-from-bratislavan-streetfighting-to-westminster\" title=\"\">krav maga</a> in order to kill her abusive husband. It\u2019s a drama (sort of), it\u2019s issue-led (sort of) and it\u2019s actually quite good (sort of).</p> \n<h2>7. U Turn (1997)</h2> \n<p>A dumb \u2013 extraordinarily dumb \u2013 mid-90s Tarantino-ish thriller from Oliver Stone that wants to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/27/favourite-film-chinatown\" title=\"\">Chinatown</a> but ends up hitting Doc Hollywood. Lopez is literally the only good thing about this.</p> \n<h2>6. Maid in Manhattan (2002)</h2> \n<p>One of J-Lo\u2019s best-known roles, playing a hotel chambermaid who gets mistaken for a millionaire socialite by a clot. It\u2019s Pretty Woman without any sex work, and only really let down by Ralph Fiennes, who bungles his potential mainstream breakout by generally coming off like a witness protection serial killer.</p> \n<h2>5. Monster-in-Law (2005)</h2> \n<p>Maligned upon release, this romcom succeeds purely for one reason: Jane Fonda. Everyone else in this film plays it straight from the J-Lo romcom rulebook, but Fonda is coming from an entirely different universe. She hadn\u2019t made a film for 15 years before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/16/dvdreviews1\" title=\"\">Monster-in-Law</a>, and attacks her role like an exploding volcano. Seriously, watch it just for her.</p> \n<h2>4. The Cell (2000)</h2> \n<p>Has Lopez ever made a more visually arresting film than this? No. The Cell is a work of art. Every frame of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/04/fall.tarsem.singh\" title=\"\">Tarsem Singh\u2019s debut</a> has clearly been agonised over. But has anyone who has ever watched The Cell figured out what it\u2019s about? Again, probably no.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fcf554665a961655c9097011061bc3b03ebe2376\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcf554665a961655c9097011061bc3b03ebe2376/0_0_2646_1778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cell.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/New Line</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3. The Wedding Planner (2001)</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209475/\" title=\"\">The definitive J-Lo romcom</a> in a field packed with them. In fact, probably the platonic ideal of what a romcom should be. Two beautiful leads (the other is Matthew McConaughey). A love story packed with obstacles. A demented belief in the undying sanctity of marriage. Judy Greer in a supporting role that she\u2019s clearly overqualified for. This film has everything, and in the middle of it is Lopez.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d833e19b49b3cfd7959ce7429cd87ccf9de53fc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d833e19b49b3cfd7959ce7429cd87ccf9de53fc/0_39_2745_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wedding Planner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wedding Planner.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/COLUMBIA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>2. Selena (1997)</h2> \n<p>The film that put Lopez on the map, and the lighter flipside to El Cantante. It\u2019s another musical biopic, but one that plays to all of Lopez\u2019s early strengths. She\u2019s radiant, restless and determined here. She\u2019s so good, in fact, that Selena gives all of her subsequent films a slightly bitter aftertaste. What could she have achieved, you wonder, if she had stayed this loose and free instead of hardening into J-Lo?</p> \n<h2>1. Out of Sight (1998)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_GOrRyhABg\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A_GOrRyhABg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Lopez\u2019s best film by a country mile. She, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh have never been better than in this stylish, sexy, unquestionably cool <a href=\"https://film.avclub.com/in-out-of-sight-jennifer-lopez-and-george-clooney-made-1826307354\" title=\"\">Elmore Leonard adaptation</a>. The whole thing is like taking off your shoes and wriggling your toes in a thick carpet, and it\u2019s propelled by the crackling chemistry between the two leads. It did badly at the box office and Lopez never went near anything like this again. Which is an extraordinary shame.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "22. Gigli (2003) Could it have been anything else? Gigli wasn\u2019t just a lead balloon; it was the Hindenburg. It\u2019s widely considered to be one of the worst films ever made. It made a 10th of its budget back. It derailed the careers of Lopez and Ben Affleck (who were engaged but split up shortly after it was made) and the director, Martin Brest, who never directed again. To quote one of the great poets, \u201cgobble gobble\u201d. 21. Jersey Girl (2004) How did Lopez bounce back from this historic flop? By making the second-worst film of her career, also with Affleck. A sludgy Kevin Smith melodrama, Lopez\u2019s role was pruned for fear it would remind people of Gigli, which it did anyway. The best thing about it is that Lopez dies quite quickly. 20. Jack (1996) One of those films where every detail makes you question whether or not it even existed. It stars Robin Williams as a schoolboy who looks like a middle-aged man. The poster features the title written in crayon. Bill Cosby is in it. Francis Ford Coppola directed it, for crying out loud. Lopez isn\u2019t bad in Jack \u2013 she has a relatively small, sweet part \u2013 but that shouldn\u2019t detract from the fact that she\u2019s in it. 19. Bordertown (2007) Booed at its Berlin premiere, Bordertown is a witless would-be thriller that obliterates every one of its good intentions with sheer turbo-powered boneheadedness. Lopez plays a hardbitten news reporter on investigating a spate of murders on the US-Mexico border in a film that contains a genuinely confusing musical number by the Colombian pop star Juanes for literally no reason at all. 18. The Back-Up Plan (2010) By far the worst J-Lo romcom of all time, The Back-Up Plan sees Lopez playing a woman who falls in love with an anonymous boy actor three seconds after being artificially inseminated with twins. Will they stay together? Will he raise her kids? Who decided this film was a good idea? Fun fact: Lopez vomits into a bin at the end. 17. An Unfinished Life (2005) AKA what happens when Lopez takes a dumb swing at Oscar bait. There\u2019s grief, there\u2019s domestic abuse, there\u2019s a car crash, there\u2019s endless hokey small-town Americana, there\u2019s a bear attack. Robert Redford is in this; if it wasn\u2019t for Lions for Lambs, this would be his worst film. 16. El Cantante (2006) Gigli and Jersey Girl taught Lopez important lessons about the dangers of working with your romantic partner. But she clearly never listened, because in 2006 she made this entirely generic vanity project of a music biopic with her new husband, Marc Anthony. It is just as miserable as you would expect. 15. Lila &amp; Eve (2015) Last year, Viola Davis railed against her unfair treatment as a black woman in Hollywood. Looking at Lila &amp; Eve \u2013 a direct-to-VOD vigilante crime drama co-starring Lopez from 2015, in which she recites the Alcoholics Anonymous serenity prayer to avenge her son\u2019s death \u2013 it\u2019s hard to disagree. 14. Angel Eyes (2001) A mystical jazz musician-turned-hobo walks the streets of Chicago performing kind acts for strangers. One of these kind acts, inexplicably, involves stopping the world\u2019s most beautiful cop from being shot in the head with a machine gun. Then they fall in love. I promise I am not making any of this up. 13. Shall We Dance? (2004) Richard Gere plays Richard Gere from Pretty Woman, Jennifer Lopez plays Jennifer Lopez from 70% of all Jennifer Lopez films and Susan Sarandon slowly realises that she made a terrible mistake by agreeing to appear in such a soggy wad of a film. 12. The Boy Next Door (2015) In which Lopez\u2019s teenage neighbour gives her a suspiciously new-looking first-edition copy of the Iliad, sleeps with her, then goes bananas and ultimately gets stabbed in the eye with an EpiPen. Not anywhere as fun as I\u2019ve made it sound. 11. Second Act (2018) A film that only exists by sheer dint of J-Lo\u2019s effort. It borrows the hacky romcom premise of her other films (low-class woman is mistaken for high-class woman), gives itself a title that\u2019s clearly meant to be seen as a future delineation point in Lopez\u2019s filmography, then spaffs itself raw trying and failing to justify its own existence. You will watch this on a plane and then instantly forget about it. 10. Parker (2013) On paper, this should have been Lopez\u2019s nadir \u2013 playing a supporting role in a Jason Statham film, for God\u2019s sake \u2013 and yet it isn\u2019t completely awful. It\u2019s a little anonymous, and entirely forgettable, but she\u2019s made much worse. 9. Anaconda (1997) True, sequels such as Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid, Anaconda 3: Offspring, Anacondas: Trail of Blood and Lake Placid vs Anaconda might have taken the shine off the original a little. However, this is still fun and stupid, especially if you like watching Owen Wilson get swallowed by a snake. 8. Enough (2002) A film that Lopez could only have made at the height of her fame. It\u2019s a sort of Karate Kid remake, but about a woman who learns krav maga in order to kill her abusive husband. It\u2019s a drama (sort of), it\u2019s issue-led (sort of) and it\u2019s actually quite good (sort of). 7. U Turn (1997) A dumb \u2013 extraordinarily dumb \u2013 mid-90s Tarantino-ish thriller from Oliver Stone that wants to be Chinatown but ends up hitting Doc Hollywood. Lopez is literally the only good thing about this. 6. Maid in Manhattan (2002) One of J-Lo\u2019s best-known roles, playing a hotel chambermaid who gets mistaken for a millionaire socialite by a clot. It\u2019s Pretty Woman without any sex work, and only really let down by Ralph Fiennes, who bungles his potential mainstream breakout by generally coming off like a witness protection serial killer. 5. Monster-in-Law (2005) Maligned upon release, this romcom succeeds purely for one reason: Jane Fonda. Everyone else in this film plays it straight from the J-Lo romcom rulebook, but Fonda is coming from an entirely different universe. She hadn\u2019t made a film for 15 years before Monster-in-Law, and attacks her role like an exploding volcano. Seriously, watch it just for her. 4. The Cell (2000) Has Lopez ever made a more visually arresting film than this? No. The Cell is a work of art. Every frame of Tarsem Singh\u2019s debut has clearly been agonised over. But has anyone who has ever watched The Cell figured out what it\u2019s about? Again, probably no. 3. The Wedding Planner (2001) The definitive J-Lo romcom in a field packed with them. In fact, probably the platonic ideal of what a romcom should be. Two beautiful leads (the other is Matthew McConaughey). A love story packed with obstacles. A demented belief in the undying sanctity of marriage. Judy Greer in a supporting role that she\u2019s clearly overqualified for. This film has everything, and in the middle of it is Lopez. 2. Selena (1997) The film that put Lopez on the map, and the lighter flipside to El Cantante. It\u2019s another musical biopic, but one that plays to all of Lopez\u2019s early strengths. She\u2019s radiant, restless and determined here. She\u2019s so good, in fact, that Selena gives all of her subsequent films a slightly bitter aftertaste. What could she have achieved, you wonder, if she had stayed this loose and free instead of hardening into J-Lo? 1. Out of Sight (1998) Lopez\u2019s best film by a country mile. She, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh have never been better than in this stylish, sexy, unquestionably cool Elmore Leonard adaptation. The whole thing is like taking off your shoes and wriggling your toes in a thick carpet, and it\u2019s propelled by the crackling chemistry between the two leads. It did badly at the box office and Lopez never went near anything like this again. Which is an extraordinary shame.",

      "body": "<p>A former police officer has been arrested on suspicion of concealing evidence in the unsolved case of the \u201cCrazy Brabant Killers\u201d, a gang who murdered 28 people in Belgium, including children, in a series of raids and robberies in the 1980s.</p> <p>During a three-year crime spree, supermarkets, jewellers, bars and hostels were raided by the group \u2013 usually comprising three disguised men wearing face paint known as \u201cthe Giant\u201d, \u201cthe Killer\u201d and their getaway driver, \u201cthe Old Man\u201d.</p> <p>Their haul was often of limited value but the French-speaking group became known for casually shooting dead customers, staff and even children without mercy, taunting and shouting at their victims.</p> <p>The gang, named after the province in which they were most active, suddenly ceased their activities and disappeared in 1985, prompting countless theories about their identity and motives.</p> <p>A retired police officer, named only as Philippe V, was arrested on Wednesday and is reportedly expected to appear in front of an investigatory judge on Thursday.

      "bodyText": "A former police officer has been arrested on suspicion of concealing evidence in the unsolved case of the \u201cCrazy Brabant Killers\u201d, a gang who murdered 28 people in Belgium, including children, in a series of raids and robberies in the 1980s. During a three-year crime spree, supermarkets, jewellers, bars and hostels were raided by the group \u2013 usually comprising three disguised men wearing face paint known as \u201cthe Giant\u201d, \u201cthe Killer\u201d and their getaway driver, \u201cthe Old Man\u201d. Their haul was often of limited value but the French-speaking group became known for casually shooting dead customers, staff and even children without mercy, taunting and shouting at their victims. The gang, named after the province in which they were most active, suddenly ceased their activities and disappeared in 1985, prompting countless theories about their identity and motives. A retired police officer, named only as Philippe V, was arrested on Wednesday and is reportedly expected to appear in front of an investigatory judge on Thursday. He was a member of the Belgian police\u2019s Delta group, which had been investigating the gang in the 1980s. He has been questioned in relation to his role in the November 1986 discovery in a canal of a bulletproof vest, a firearm stolen from a police officer and ammunition. Eric Van Der Sypt from the federal prosecutor\u2019s office said a previous search of the canal a year before had not yielded anything. Forensic research, published in 2013, suggested the items could have been thrown into the water a few weeks before the police found them. \u201cIt is clear that when you dive in 1985, you cannot find anything,\u201d Van Der Sypt said. \u201cWhen we dive again in 1986, we find a lot of objects, which is not normal.\u201d A spokesman for the prosecutor\u2019s office said the former officer had been questioned on suspicion that he had \u201cretained at least certain, possibly crucial, information\u201d. Walter Damen, the former officer\u2019s lawyer, told the Flemish TV channel VRT his client denied any allegations of wrongdoing. \u201cHe says that he did not influence the investigation at all, that he had no contact with the band of Brabant killers \u2026 In January 2019, he is asked for information on November and December 1986. It is difficult, because [to] each sentence must be added \u2018I think\u2019 or \u2018I do not know\u2019,\u201d Damen said. Due to the killers\u2019 proficiency in handling weapons, suspicions were raised at the time of the murders of a link with a now disbanded paramilitary police force. There were also rumours they were part of an attempt by the far left or far right to undermine the state, a theory the Belgian government recently said remained a possibility. In 2017, the brother of a retired policeman in Aalst, west of Brussels, came forward to claim his dying sibling, Christiaan Bonkoffsky, had confessed to being \u201cthe Giant\u201d. The federal prosecutor\u2019s office said last year they were convinced this was not the case. The gang\u2019s final crimes took place in November 1985, when they burst into a supermarket in Aalst firing pump-action shotguns.

Less evident, so far, is whether military chiefs and key army units will uphold his self-declared alternative presidency. Given the history of disastrous US interventions in Latin America, Maduro\u2019s denunciation of a coup by the \u201cgringo empire\u201d carries considerable weight.</p> <p>Then there is the added complication of strong Russian and Chinese support for the current regime. Moscow has condemned the attempted takeover. Maduro was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-13/china-to-give-venezuela-5-billion-loan-as-maduro-visits-beijing\" title=\"\">feted in Beijing last autumn</a>, where he was offered a financial bailout.</p> <p>If the military stays broadly loyal to Maduro, Trump and his hawkish national security adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/who-is-john-bolton-trump-national-security-adviser\" title=\"\">John Bolton</a>, who has led the charge for regime change in Caracas, will have failed to meet the first, elementary requirement for successful coup-making: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/world/americas/trump-venezuela-military.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">ensure the guys with the guns are on your side</a>.</p> <p>Maybe this is no surprise. Going off half-cock in crucial matters of foreign policy and international relations is a familiar characteristic of the Trump administration. Trump himself is demonstrably clueless about such matters. And after a wave of high-level sackings and resignations during his first two years in office, he badly lacks experienced, politically savvy and level-headed advisers. That dangerous weakness may be about to be exposed.</p> <p>Much has been written about the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/20/jim-mattis-resign-trump-administration\" title=\"\">adults in the room</a>\u201d who have supposedly restrained Trump\u2019s worst instincts and puerile tantrums \u2013 or did so, at least, until they were fired.

Their views and prejudices are likely to have seriously negative impacts during Trump\u2019s remaining time in the White House. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/opinion/government-shutdown-trump.html\" title=\"\">As one US commentator put it</a>, \u201cLincoln had a team of rivals; Trump has a team of morons\u201d.</p> <p>The contention that Trump really has been reined in, until now, by wiser, more experienced advisers is itself questionable. For example, James Mattis, his former defence secretary, failed to prevent Trump\u2019s serial assaults on Nato or his rash decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/19/us-troops-syria-withdrawal-trump\" title=\"\">withdraw US troops from Syria</a>. To be fair, Mattis did stamp on some wilder Trump wheezes (those that we know about), such as his reported wish to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/04/donald-trump-bob-woodward-fear-syria-assad-claims\" title=\"\">assassinate Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad</a>.</p> <p>Yet the Venezuela intervention suggests similar or worse decision-making may now be in the offing as an ever angrier, more volatile Trump, besieged by a hostile Congress and noisy talk of impeachment, furtively schemes and plots to salvage a second term.</p> <p>The more Trump is tempted to lash out, make a splash, or opportunistically create a diversion to wrest back control of the agenda \u2013 which is how he may view Venezuela \u2013 the more calm, sensible advice will be required. Yet this is what is signally lacking in an administration peopled not by the \u201cbest and the brightest\u201d \u2013 David Halberstam\u2019s famous, semi-ironic term for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_and_the_Brightest\" title=\"\">John F Kennedy\u2019s White House team</a> \u2013 but by the worst and the dumbest with no reputation to lose.</p> <p>Bolton is the scariest of the bunch \u2013 a terrier-like zealot who seizes on an issue and worries it to death, impervious to facts or reason. He acted thus over Iraq, urging George W Bush to invade on what wiser heads knew were bogus grounds.</p> <p>Bolton is repeating the mistake over Iran, where he has previously advocated <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/1/14/18181962/iran-news-bolton-strike-pentagon-trump-mattis\" title=\"\">forcible regime change</a> regardless of the consequences. Once again, a supposed WMD threat is being exaggerated and conflated with insincere concerns about democracy and human rights.</p> <p>Bolton\u2019s Iran obsession produced a massive overreaction to two minor incidents involving Tehran-backed militias in Iraq last autumn, when the National Security Council demanded the Pentagon provide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/13/white-house-asked-pentagon-plans-strike-iran\" title=\"\">immediate options for military strikes on Iran</a>. \u201cPeople were shocked.

The Pentagon, the world\u2019s largest, nuclear-armed, war-fighting machine, is currently run by an obscure former Boeing executive, Patrick Shanahan, who, in contrast to Mattis, has zero military or policymaking experience. <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/28/the-militarys-new-boss-is-walking-into-an-ambush/\" title=\"\">Not a good situation when a crisis such as Venezuela breaks</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s incoming attorney-general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/william-barr-attorney-general-trumpian-logic\" title=\"\">William Barr</a>, seems to think his legal duty is to unquestioningly do whatever Trump tells him.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s implicit threat of direct US military intervention in Venezuela is a high-risk gamble that could backfire calamitously. By publicly and aggressively backing the opposition\u2019s bid to supplant him, Trump has presented Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the country\u2019s incumbent president, with a very personal, existential challenge. If Maduro reacts, as he has in the past, by using violence to suppress his opponents, or if he arrests US diplomats who ignore his order to leave the country, Trump may face a daunting choice between rapid escalation, including possibly sending in US forces, and a humiliating climbdown. It seems clear that Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader, has the backing of many if not most Venezuelans. Less evident, so far, is whether military chiefs and key army units will uphold his self-declared alternative presidency. Given the history of disastrous US interventions in Latin America, Maduro\u2019s denunciation of a coup by the \u201cgringo empire\u201d carries considerable weight. Then there is the added complication of strong Russian and Chinese support for the current regime. Moscow has condemned the attempted takeover. Maduro was feted in Beijing last autumn, where he was offered a financial bailout. If the military stays broadly loyal to Maduro, Trump and his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, who has led the charge for regime change in Caracas, will have failed to meet the first, elementary requirement for successful coup-making: ensure the guys with the guns are on your side. Maybe this is no surprise. Going off half-cock in crucial matters of foreign policy and international relations is a familiar characteristic of the Trump administration. Trump himself is demonstrably clueless about such matters. And after a wave of high-level sackings and resignations during his first two years in office, he badly lacks experienced, politically savvy and level-headed advisers. That dangerous weakness may be about to be exposed. Much has been written about the so-called \u201cadults in the room\u201d who have supposedly restrained Trump\u2019s worst instincts and puerile tantrums \u2013 or did so, at least, until they were fired. Less attention has been paid to the third-raters, chancers and nobodies who have replaced them in the most senior US government positions. The fact Trump sought help to break the government shutdown stalemate from his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a political greenhorn, showed the dearth of seasoned domestic policy talent in the White House. Trump\u2019s replacement foreign policy crew likewise shares a startling ignorance of the world beyond America. Their views and prejudices are likely to have seriously negative impacts during Trump\u2019s remaining time in the White House. As one US commentator put it, \u201cLincoln had a team of rivals; Trump has a team of morons\u201d. The contention that Trump really has been reined in, until now, by wiser, more experienced advisers is itself questionable. For example, James Mattis, his former defence secretary, failed to prevent Trump\u2019s serial assaults on Nato or his rash decision to withdraw US troops from Syria. To be fair, Mattis did stamp on some wilder Trump wheezes (those that we know about), such as his reported wish to assassinate Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad. Yet the Venezuela intervention suggests similar or worse decision-making may now be in the offing as an ever angrier, more volatile Trump, besieged by a hostile Congress and noisy talk of impeachment, furtively schemes and plots to salvage a second term. The more Trump is tempted to lash out, make a splash, or opportunistically create a diversion to wrest back control of the agenda \u2013 which is how he may view Venezuela \u2013 the more calm, sensible advice will be required. Yet this is what is signally lacking in an administration peopled not by the \u201cbest and the brightest\u201d \u2013 David Halberstam\u2019s famous, semi-ironic term for John F Kennedy\u2019s White House team \u2013 but by the worst and the dumbest with no reputation to lose. Bolton is the scariest of the bunch \u2013 a terrier-like zealot who seizes on an issue and worries it to death, impervious to facts or reason. He acted thus over Iraq, urging George W Bush to invade on what wiser heads knew were bogus grounds. Bolton is repeating the mistake over Iran, where he has previously advocated forcible regime change regardless of the consequences. Once again, a supposed WMD threat is being exaggerated and conflated with insincere concerns about democracy and human rights. Bolton\u2019s Iran obsession produced a massive overreaction to two minor incidents involving Tehran-backed militias in Iraq last autumn, when the National Security Council demanded the Pentagon provide immediate options for military strikes on Iran. \u201cPeople were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were,\u201d a senior official said. Hopes that diplomacy might curb reckless White House tendencies have evaporated under the sacked Rex Tillerson\u2019s state department successor, Mike Pompeo. Recent speeches by the hawkish former CIA director in Brussels and Cairo exhibited slavish subservience to his master\u2019s voice, echoing Trump\u2019s tunnel-vision nationalism and simplistic division of the world into friends and foes. Pompeo\u2019s statement on Wednesday evening instructing US diplomats in Caracas to ignore Maduro\u2019s order to leave the country was especially rash. The diplomats could become virtual hostages in any prolonged internal power struggle. Those searching for more able leadership elsewhere in the higher echelons of Trump-land will search in vain. The Pentagon, the world\u2019s largest, nuclear-armed, war-fighting machine, is currently run by an obscure former Boeing executive, Patrick Shanahan, who, in contrast to Mattis, has zero military or policymaking experience. Not a good situation when a crisis such as Venezuela breaks. Trump\u2019s incoming attorney-general, William Barr, seems to think his legal duty is to unquestioningly do whatever Trump tells him. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, hates the press. And his White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is a temp who once described his new boss as a \u201cterrible human being\u201d. Even if Trump and his ship of fools and knaves do not start a war in Venezuela, they could just as easily trigger new conflicts in the Middle East or with China, without even meaning to. And Venezuela\u2019s Juan Guaid\u00f3 should be aware \u2013 these people do not make reliable allies. With Trump\u2019s \u201cteam of morons\u201d in charge, there is no safety net, no room for error \u2013 and no telling what happens next. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",

That they are doing this only to enter a benefits system where the odds are proved to be stacked against them is only crueller. This is not to say that people with physical health problems are somehow given an easy ride \u2013 on the contrary, anyone from people with Parkinson\u2019s to terminal cancer patients are routinely rejected for benefits \u2013 but rather, that there is a deep-seated prejudice against mental illness running through the Conservatives\u2019 social security system. Back in 2013, as the coalition launched its so-called welfare reform, the court of appeal upheld a ruling finding that the process used to decide whether hundreds of thousands of people are eligible for employment and support allowance (ESA) \u201cdisadvantages\u201d people with mental health problems, learning disabilities and autism. Five years later, the high court ruled that another benefit, personal independence payment, was \u201cblatantly discriminatory\u201d against people with mental health conditions \u2013 forcing the government to review the disability benefit claims of 1.6 million people with anxiety who may have wrongly been turned down for help. Rather than having a system designed to protect people with mental health problems, the Conservatives have engineered one that pushes them into crisis. The UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) says the government\u2019s benefit reforms, including sanctions and cuts, \u201care having a toxic impact on mental health\u201d; rates of severe anxiety and depression among unemployed people have soared by more than 50% between 2013 and 2017. Universal credit has already been linked to an increased suicide risk, with the stress of being left for weeks without money, affecting claimants\u2019 mental health so profoundly that some are being pushed to consider taking their own life. Suicide has slowly become a fixture of Britain\u2019s benefit system. Michael O\u2019Sullivan, a 60-year-old father of two from north London who had long-term depression and agoraphobia, took his own life in 2013 after being found \u201cfit for work\u201d, with his coroner stating the benefit process was a key \u201ctrigger\u201d in his death. He was far from the last. Gut the benefits budget enough, and human beings are cut adrift. Even those who champion \u201cwelfare reform\u201d cannot surely respond to this with anything but shame. If people with mental health problems can neither trust the government to treat them fairly or even protect their life, the safety net has lost all meaning. Theresa May was right: mental health is a burning injustice. But in the benefits system, it is the Conservatives themselves who lit the match. \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is 1800 737 732. In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 and the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

The dealers say the practice, in imitation of the way milk is sometimes poured over effigies of Hindu gods during rituals, encourages theft. The practice of paal abhishekam (anointing with milk) posters and cardboard cutouts of the actors is done in the lead-up to a blockbuster release in the hope that it will become a hit. It has been discouraged by some actors, but this week the Tamil star Silambarasan Thesingu Rajendar, also known as Simbu, posted a video on social media telling fans to \u201ccelebrate my movie release like never before by erecting huge banners and cutouts and pouring pots of milk\u201d. The video prompted a police complaint from the Tamil Nadu Milk Dealers Employees Welfare Association, whose president told the Guardian that the practice should be banned immediately. \u201cIn Tamil Nadu, 20% of people are not able to access milk and there are a lot of children in the streets without milk,\u201d SA Ponnusamy said. \u201cWe are as a nation saying we need more milk for children, not cutouts.\u201d He estimated that more than 15,000 gallons of milk could be wasted each day by being poured over posters and billboards after a big film release. He said people delivering milk early in the morning were routinely being rushed by groups of youths who ran off with two or three boxes of milk each. \u201cWe\u2019d prefer the youth be encouraged to do things like signing up to be organ donors or planting trees,\u201d Ponnusamy said. \u201cAll the heroes have to motivate their youth in this direction.\u201d In October a Simbu fan attached himself to a crane so he could be lifted high enough to pour milk over a billboard of the actor. In a country obsessed with cinema, the adoration shown to actors in the Tamil film industry, or Kollywood, might exceed all others. The 2016 release of the film Kabali, starring the Tamil actor Rajinikanth, prompted such a frenzy that many companies gave their employees a day off. A aeroplane decorated with Rajinikanth\u2019s face was flown from Bangalore to Chennai, serving Rajinikanth\u2019s favourite food on board, to bring 100 fans to a \u201cfirst day, first show\u201d screening.

      "bodyText": "The climate crisis is intensifying a new military buildup in the Arctic, diplomats and analysts said this week, as regional powers attempt to secure northern borders that were until recently reinforced by a continental-sized division of ice. That so-called unpaid sentry is now literally melting away, opening up shipping lanes and geo-security challenges, said delegates at the Arctic Frontiers conference, the polar circle\u2019s biggest talking shop, who debated a series of recent escalations. Russia is reopening and strengthening cold war bases on the Kola peninsula in the far north-west of the country. Norway is beefing up its military presence in the high Arctic. Last October, Nato staged Trident Juncture with 40,000 troops, its biggest military exercise in Norway in more than a decade. A month earlier Britain announced a new \u201cDefence Arctic Strategy\u201d and promised a 10-year deployment of 800 commandos to Norway and four RAF Typhoons to patrol Icelandic skies. The US is also sending hundreds more marines to the region on long-term rotations and has threatened to send naval vessels through Arctic shipping lanes for the first time. While these strategic moves have echoes of the cold war, the modest buildup falls far short of that era, and there remains a strong spirit of cooperation in many areas. The current tensions are a result of a world warmed by industrial emissions. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet, shrinking sea ice and exposing more water and territory to exploitation and access. \u201cRight now, the reasons we are seeing more military activity is that countries are worried by the spectre of open water,\u201d one of the speakers, Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the Guardian. \u201cThe unique Arctic security architecture has shape and form that come from natural extremities. If the Arctic becomes just another ocean, this breaks down. It\u2019s elemental.\u201d The Arctic\u2019s unique characteristics are under attack from all sides. Below, the once-frozen ocean is now mixed with warmer, more saline Atlantic waters. In the skies above, the polar vortex above is weakening, allowing intrusions of balmy air currents from the south. Sea ice is being lost at a rate of more than 10,000 tonnes per second, according to Tore Furevik, a professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. \u201cWe\u2019re heading for a new and uncertain Arctic with ramifications for nature and politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should strive to be less suspicious, less hostile and more open-minded if we are to deal with a problem that we have so recklessly created.\u201d By 2035, the Arctic is forecast to be free of ice during summer, which will allow ships to sail across the north pole. Business interest is growing. For the first time, last summer, a Maersk container ship navigated the northern sea route from Asia to Europe carrying fish and electronic goods. Energy companies are exploring new oil and gas fields. Once remote regions are becoming geopolitical hotspots. Troms\u00f8, in Norway, which hosted the conference, was once a tiny trading post. Today, it\u2019s a tourism hub and a gateway to the mineral-rich north. \u201cNow we have a historically strange situation with political and economic activity in the Arctic. So many people are knocking on our door, including business and state representatives from China, Pakistan, Singapore and Morocco,\u201d the mayor, Kristin R\u00f8ymo, told the Guardian. \u201cThere is also a very obvious increased naval presence.\u201d This concerns many conference participants, who highlight the peaceful history of cross-border cooperation in the far north. Even during the cold war, there were agreements on fishing, scientific research and reindeer herding that continue today. Norwegian politicians were at pains to downplay the significance of the current military buildup. \u201cThere is no direct link between climate change and conflict,\u201d the former defence minister Espen Barth Eide said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because there is an immediate threat, it\u2019s that, as an area becomes more important, it\u2019s natural to have a heightened military presence.\u201d He compared the situation to the South China Sea, where China, the US and other nations compete, not by firing weapons, but by demonstrating capacity and presence. \u201cTo some extent that is happening now in the Arctic,\u201d he said, although he stressed there were no territorial disputes to inflame passions. The build-up is portrayed almost as a form of climate adaptation \u2013 strengthening the military presence along with infrastructure affected by melting permafrost. However, there are tensions.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Nothing can stop me,\u201d sings Dawn Richard on the title track of New Breed, \u201cI do what I wanna.\u201d Of course, pop stars are always saying things like that, but Richard is more headstrong and unique than most.</p> <p>The path from TV talent show pop star to edgy leftfield auteur is largely untrodden \u2013 or at least it was until Richard started gamely tramping down it. She first came to prominence in the US as a member of Danity Kane, a girl group manufactured to Sean Combs\u2019s specifications on the MTV series Making the Band. After their brief career ended in the obligatory acrimonious split (<a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6214288/dawn-richard-pens-open-letter-after-danity-kane-breakup\">an attempted reunion in 2013</a> was drawn to a swift conclusion by a fight), and following an equally brief period in Combs\u2019s ho-hum collective Diddy-Dirty Money, Richard took off on <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22648-redemption/\">a solo career</a> no one could have predicted. She made three critically hosannaed, interlinked concept albums. Lyrical imagery drawn from science-fiction and medieval warfare crashed into futuristic production and songs that frequently dispensed with standard verse-chorus-verse structures in favour of a stream-of-consciousness approach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3dc779ef27e2b14e8ac3c4674951e3aaa9fd1e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3dc779ef27e2b14e8ac3c4674951e3aaa9fd1e1/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn: New Breed album artwork\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DAWN: New Breed album artwork</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind its extraordinary cover \u2013 Richard reclining on the front porch of a derelict wooden house, clad in silver platform boots and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYRdfo0hI8o\">a vast white feathered headdress</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.empirewashitaw.org/\">Washitaw, a group</a> of black Americans who claim to be a sovereign Native American nation \u2013 <a href=\"https://whenthehornblows.com/content/2019/1/22/album-review-dawn-new-breed\">New Breed</a> is a slightly more straightforward prospect than its predecessors. It is rooted in her home town of New Orleans: the lyrics are thick with references to locations in the city, and there are samples of discussions of local cultural traditions and of artists shouting out to their home town from the stage between songs. But New Orleans\u2019 musical imprint is subtle. If the ghosts of the R&amp;B records that poured out of the city in the late 50s and early 60s haunt the sampled voices on opener The Nine, you would never characterise the results as an obvious homage.</p> <p>Similarly, there\u2019s a hint of the Meters\u2019 taut funk about the guitar line of Dreams and Converse, and an echo of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/nov/10/allen-toussaint-seven-of-his-greatest-songs\">Allen Toussaint</a> in the lovely, rolling piano of We, Diamonds, but they sit amid thoroughly modern pop songs. The former is a wash of dreamy synthesiser and house-influenced beats, the latter boasts a mesh of overlapping voices and the kind of chorus that \u2013 in a fairer world, where Richard\u2019s placings on end-of-year-lists were matched on the actual charts \u2013 could provoke arenas to sing along. Meanwhile, two of the album\u2019s best tracks are built around music that, geographically speaking, couldn\u2019t be further from Louisiana: Spaces features a gorgeous, rippling synthesiser motif that sounds as if it stepped off a mid-70s Tangerine Dream album, while Jealousy maps out an intriguing space between dubby lover\u2019s rock and DJ Screw.</p> <p>Listening to tracks like that, one wonders if the weirdness of Richard\u2019s work might have been overstated. There is a tendency in some quarters to write about her music in a way that makes it sound avant garde and challenging, as if you have to steel yourself to listen to it. It does her a disservice. The music on New Breed is often hugely inventive but it also functions as pop: you get the feeling she spends as much time bulletproofing her choruses as she does tinkering with the futuristic sound design. The fact that her music exists on the margins (tellingly, the abortive Danity Kane reunion came about after Richard failed to generate enough money on Kickstarter to make her 2015 album <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20104-blackheart/\">Blackheart</a>) seems to say more about how narrow the confines of mainstream pop currently are, than about any lack of commerciality on her part.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-KnKAD5veQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x-KnKAD5veQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This fact clearly hasn\u2019t escaped Richard. As well as lyrics about sexuality, or warning a partner\u2019s ex off in no uncertain terms (\u201cI know you feel you have a right to call him \u2013 you don\u2019t\u201d), she keeps returning to the subject of how hard she has had to work to forge her musical identity. The spoken-word introductions to Spaces and We, Diamonds offer a list of compelling reasons for why the pop landscape isn\u2019t more densely populated with figures like her, railing against the way the music industry categorises black women and doubts their ability to be anything more than divas. You can see why she feels she must reiterate that doing what she does involves real struggle, and not just because it highlights a more general injustice.</p> <p>Adventurous but never abstruse, New Breed sounds effortless, as though transforming yourself from a manufactured pop star into a unique artist is the easiest thing in the world: \u201cThis shit is simple, do the math, I\u2019m the answer and the proof,\u201d she sings on the title track. But of course it isn\u2019t: making it seem so is just one of its author\u2019s multitude of talents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3VItHcgg8MmJkLJYWyATtZ\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3VItHcgg8MmJkLJYWyATtZ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>This week Alexis listened to \u2026</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql3HNPDSOKE\">Flohio: Wild Yout</a></strong></p> <p>This track is a couple of months old, but still sounds fresh.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Nothing can stop me,\u201d sings Dawn Richard on the title track of New Breed, \u201cI do what I wanna.\u201d Of course, pop stars are always saying things like that, but Richard is more headstrong and unique than most. The path from TV talent show pop star to edgy leftfield auteur is largely untrodden \u2013 or at least it was until Richard started gamely tramping down it. She first came to prominence in the US as a member of Danity Kane, a girl group manufactured to Sean Combs\u2019s specifications on the MTV series Making the Band. After their brief career ended in the obligatory acrimonious split (an attempted reunion in 2013 was drawn to a swift conclusion by a fight), and following an equally brief period in Combs\u2019s ho-hum collective Diddy-Dirty Money, Richard took off on a solo career no one could have predicted. She made three critically hosannaed, interlinked concept albums. Lyrical imagery drawn from science-fiction and medieval warfare crashed into futuristic production and songs that frequently dispensed with standard verse-chorus-verse structures in favour of a stream-of-consciousness approach. Behind its extraordinary cover \u2013 Richard reclining on the front porch of a derelict wooden house, clad in silver platform boots and a vast white feathered headdress of the Washitaw, a group of black Americans who claim to be a sovereign Native American nation \u2013 New Breed is a slightly more straightforward prospect than its predecessors. It is rooted in her home town of New Orleans: the lyrics are thick with references to locations in the city, and there are samples of discussions of local cultural traditions and of artists shouting out to their home town from the stage between songs. But New Orleans\u2019 musical imprint is subtle. If the ghosts of the R&amp;B records that poured out of the city in the late 50s and early 60s haunt the sampled voices on opener The Nine, you would never characterise the results as an obvious homage. Similarly, there\u2019s a hint of the Meters\u2019 taut funk about the guitar line of Dreams and Converse, and an echo of Allen Toussaint in the lovely, rolling piano of We, Diamonds, but they sit amid thoroughly modern pop songs. The former is a wash of dreamy synthesiser and house-influenced beats, the latter boasts a mesh of overlapping voices and the kind of chorus that \u2013 in a fairer world, where Richard\u2019s placings on end-of-year-lists were matched on the actual charts \u2013 could provoke arenas to sing along. Meanwhile, two of the album\u2019s best tracks are built around music that, geographically speaking, couldn\u2019t be further from Louisiana: Spaces features a gorgeous, rippling synthesiser motif that sounds as if it stepped off a mid-70s Tangerine Dream album, while Jealousy maps out an intriguing space between dubby lover\u2019s rock and DJ Screw. Listening to tracks like that, one wonders if the weirdness of Richard\u2019s work might have been overstated. There is a tendency in some quarters to write about her music in a way that makes it sound avant garde and challenging, as if you have to steel yourself to listen to it. It does her a disservice. The music on New Breed is often hugely inventive but it also functions as pop: you get the feeling she spends as much time bulletproofing her choruses as she does tinkering with the futuristic sound design. The fact that her music exists on the margins (tellingly, the abortive Danity Kane reunion came about after Richard failed to generate enough money on Kickstarter to make her 2015 album Blackheart) seems to say more about how narrow the confines of mainstream pop currently are, than about any lack of commerciality on her part. This fact clearly hasn\u2019t escaped Richard. As well as lyrics about sexuality, or warning a partner\u2019s ex off in no uncertain terms (\u201cI know you feel you have a right to call him \u2013 you don\u2019t\u201d), she keeps returning to the subject of how hard she has had to work to forge her musical identity. The spoken-word introductions to Spaces and We, Diamonds offer a list of compelling reasons for why the pop landscape isn\u2019t more densely populated with figures like her, railing against the way the music industry categorises black women and doubts their ability to be anything more than divas. You can see why she feels she must reiterate that doing what she does involves real struggle, and not just because it highlights a more general injustice. Adventurous but never abstruse, New Breed sounds effortless, as though transforming yourself from a manufactured pop star into a unique artist is the easiest thing in the world: \u201cThis shit is simple, do the math, I\u2019m the answer and the proof,\u201d she sings on the title track. But of course it isn\u2019t: making it seem so is just one of its author\u2019s multitude of talents. This week Alexis listened to \u2026 Flohio: Wild Yout This track is a couple of months old, but still sounds fresh. The Bermondsey rapper does her thing over scourging, head-on, industrial beats from Clams Casino, sounding as powerful as anything the UK rap scene has produced of late.",

      "bodyText": "Think of Ed Stafford as the inverse of Bear Grylls. Although they share an enormous amount in common \u2013 fortysomething former servicemen who found new lives performing feats of adventure rather beyond the realms of common sense \u2013 he presents a very different face to camera. Where Grylls\u2019 persona is one of relaxed sureness \u2013 \u201cAnyone can survive by drinking their own urine, and it\u2019s fun, too!\u201d \u2013 Stafford comes over as a one-man existential crisis on the hunt for food. You see that most clearly on Naked and Marooned, the show documenting the 60 days he spent alone on the Pacific island of Olorua in 2012, filming himself as he struggled to survive. It\u2019s the rare reality show you watched both agog with astonishment and desperately concerned about the protagonist\u2019s mental health. \u201cIt was one of the most intense things I\u2019ve ever done, and the hardest two months of my life,\u201d Stafford tells me on a trip into central London \u2013 he\u2019s not a fan \u2013 as he munches a sandwich before meetings about his new series, First Man Out. \u201cI haven\u2019t hidden the fact that I had to go into therapy afterwards,\u201d he says. \u201cThat extended period of isolation was extraordinarily difficult to cope with. I was adopted as a kid and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that as a 38-year-old man I decided to maroon myself.\u201d He explains that he had \u201cabandonment issues coursing through my veins\u201d, then reveals his fascination with \u201chow one can subconsciously put oneself into situations I actually needed to go through to work through things that were holding me back in adult life.\u201d The island may have been the most difficult time, but it was also the \u201cfastest catalyst\u201d towards self-awareness. \u201cIt changed me more than walking the Amazon.\u201d Ah yes, the Amazon. That was how Stafford made his name. On 2 April 2008, he began a year-long trek to become the first man to walk the length of the world\u2019s longest river. It ended up taking him two and a half but he managed it, and was hailed by Ranulph Fiennes for an achievement \u201cin the top league of expeditions, past and present\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhere are George Clooney and co now that Sudan needs them?\u201d asked an Opinion article in the Guardian this week. The oped assumed that a lack of public statements by us and others with a long association with Darfur, Sudan more broadly, and South Sudan meant that we were doing nothing in response to the Sudanese regime\u2019s brutal crackdown of escalating protests throughout the country. This is indeed a critical moment in Sudan\u2019s fraught history. The people of Sudan are rightly leading demands for change, and we believe our role is to support the cause of human rights for Sudanese people by using strategic and tactical advocacy in Europe, the US, and Africa focused on key points of leverage. As the demonstrations have unfolded this past month, our entire team has continuously engaged officials in governments around the world to take measures to hold the Bashir regime accountable. Much of this advocacy is not done in public. To support Sudanese efforts for change we have been working assiduously behind the scenes to suspend the US government\u2019s process for removing President Omar al-Bashir\u2019s regime from its state sponsors of terrorism list. Such a move would lift remaining sanctions and make the Sudanese government eligible for massive debt relief; one of the few points of leverage the international community has over the Khartoum regime. We have been engaging the Trump administration and the US Congress to suspend the process of normalising relations with Bashir\u2019s regime, whose human rights abuses go far beyond killing protesters. And we have dispatched staff to engage governments in Europe and to the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa. Over more than a dozen years, we\u2019ve invested millions of dollars into efforts to address Sudan\u2019s \u2013 and South Sudan\u2019s \u2013 crises. We launched the Satellite Sentinel Project to monitor the regime\u2019s mass atrocities using satellite technology and teams of imagery analysts. We were able to uncover evidence of mass graves, Chinese-made rockets, hidden troop movements in violations of ceasefires, and many other destabilising actions of the Sudan regime. But over time, we realised that naming and shaming the regime and exposing its complicity in mass atrocities were not having sufficient impact on the policies of governments in Europe, America and Africa, so we decided on a new approach. We assessed the most significant point of vulnerability of this unshamable regime to be all the money it has been stealing from its people and squirrelling out of the country into hidden accounts, real estate and shell companies, funnelling the rest of the funds into the machinery of state repression now responsible for killing and arresting protesters. So we decided to go after the regime\u2019s massive corruption and illicit financial flows by creating an organisation called The Sentry, aimed at making it harder for them to loot the natural resources of the country to line their pockets and finance their repression. Our financial forensic investigative team is gathering evidence and we hope to have our first reports on Sudan in the coming year, just as we have already done in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The Sentry has also undertaken an assessment of Sudan\u2019s anti-money laundering framework, and our report coming in the near future will show that the system is barely sufficient to meet international standards on paper, and far more concerning in practice. Bashir\u2019s theft has taken longer to crack because his regime has been more sophisticated in obscuring its illicit money trails, including through manipulating and abusing their own flawed systems. It is our belief that exposing the Bashir regime\u2019s massive theft of resources from its people, and the complicity of the international financial system in this effort, constitutes the most critical way in which we can support Sudanese activists on the ground as they lead the campaign for justice and human rights.

This work has gone hand-in-hand with our ongoing efforts in South Sudan. We\u2019ve worked to expose the vast corruption in the Juba regime, and to successfully advocate for network sanctions and anti-money laundering measures imposed against key regime officials and financiers.

      "body": "<p>Diana Athill, who has died aged 101, was one of book publishing\u2019s most remarkable editors, but in the latter part of her life it was her own writing that brought her much-enjoyed literary success. First there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/04/biography.highereducation\" title=\"\">Stet</a> (2000), which described her long career at Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, and then, over the next decade, forgotten books were reprinted and new writing emerged, in particular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/12/biography\" title=\"\">Somewhere Towards the End</a>, which won the 2008 Costa prize for biography, and became a bestseller. In 2009, four volumes of her memoirs (including Stet and Somewhere Towards the End) were republished as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/13/diana-athill-memoirs-interview-tim-adams\" title=\"\">Life Class</a>.</p> \n<p>In all her work, observations were clear-sighted and seemed truthful, even when they exposed her own emotional frailties. She rose to the challenge, as Ian Jack wrote in the introduction to Life Class, of Jean Rhys\u2019s phrase to \u201cget it as it was, as it really was\u201d.</p> \n<p>Athill\u2019s first memoir, Instead of a Letter (1963), was written when she was in her 40s. The blurb on the original flyleaf said that Athill had \u201cwritten this autobiography in order to discover the truth about herself and about what her life has been for. Her book is uncompromisingly honest. Yet although she discusses with unusual frankness matters not usually discussed by conventionally reared daughters of British colonels, she is never embarrassing because nothing embarrasses her.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/24/diana-athill-writer-and-editor-dies-aged-101\">Diana Athill, writer and editor, dies aged 101</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Those were to remain her traits \u2013 she talked of herself as \u201ca beady-eyed watcher\u201d. In 2004, when she was 87, she wrote \u2013 in the third person \u2013 of her own miscarriage at the age of 43. Unmarried, she had come to cherish the pregnancy. Then she miscarried, the loss being graphically described in an intimate manner but without sentiment. Having nearly died, Athill concluded that \u201cnot having died was more important to her than losing the child\u201d. The piece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/21/diana-athill-interview-memoir-alive-alive-oh\" title=\"\">later</a> formed a chapter of her 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/23/diana-athill-alive-alive-oh-review-memoir\" title=\"\">memoir</a>, Alive, Alive-Oh! and Other Things That Matter.</p> \n<p>Although she often wrote about tragedy, she was far from a tragic figure. Softly pink-skinned, warm-hearted but never cuddly, she remained, in elegant old age, an optimistic, inquiring woman. She was an entertaining conversationalist \u2013 her talk, which had the same searching tone as her writing, was delivered in a crisp upper-class timbre. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e9ea22a0-3eb7-452a-a0a6-9cee05379f0a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4-20VOVTol0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Athill was born in Kensington, west London, during a first world war zeppelin raid. Her father, Lawrence Athill, was an army officer, her mother, Alice (nee Carr), the daughter of a family with a large estate, <a href=\"https://ditchinghamestate.com/hall/ditchingham-hall/\" title=\"\">Ditchingham Hall</a>, in Norfolk, where Diana spent much of her childhood \u2013 20 bedrooms, landscaped park and lake, but also many books. There, with her younger brother, Andrew, and sister, Patience, she experienced a carefree life of ponies and hunting, but, above all, reading, encouraged by her much-loved grandmother. As she wrote in Stet, \u201cReading was what one did indoors as riding was what one did out of doors.\u201d This childhood was explored in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jan/13/biography.features\" title=\"\">Yesterday Morning</a> (2002) \u2013 a book that shines in its Englishness of a privileged time Athill considered blessed despite the submerged unhappiness that underpinned her parents\u2019 marriage.</p> \n<p>Until she was 14, she was educated at home by governesses \u2013 before a spell at boarding school, and on to read English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, in 1936. Then she discovered \u2013 somewhat to her alarm \u2013 that she had to earn her own living. She wanted to be a librarian; it was wartime and she joined the BBC, where she worked in its information department. It was a meeting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/12/news.obituaries\" title=\"\">Andr\u00e9 Deutsch</a>, a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9, at a dinner party in 1943, which changed her life. She joined him as an editor at the end of the war in his first publishing venture, Allan Wingate, and then became founding director of his new company, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66e988c306a44c727c62faec52b056f60a4ae915\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66e988c306a44c727c62faec52b056f60a4ae915/0_0_1920_2880/667.jpg\" alt=\"Diana Athill at Oxford University just before the second world war\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diana Athill at Oxford University just before the second world war</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph: Ramsey and Muspratt</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She remained there from 1952 until her retirement, aged 75, in 1993. Publishing was then a career where women were usually in the publicity department rather than the boardroom. Indeed, she was not much concerned that women were not on equal pay. But Athill, an initial shyness overcome, had found her niche: in her gift for discovering new authors and for her dealings with them and their writing she would become known as \u201cthe best editor in London\u201d.</p> \n<p>She loved the job. The sense of being a midwife to books was its essential pleasure. She once described a heavy rewrite on a badly written book as \u201clike removing layers of crumpled brown paper from an awkwardly shaped parcel, and revealing the attractive present which it contained\u201d. Among Athill\u2019s authors were <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-molly-keane-1306345.html\" title=\"\">Molly Keane</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/12/vs-naipaul-obituary\" title=\"\">VS Naipaul</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jul/05/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Mordecai Richler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jan/13/fiction\" title=\"\">Brian Moore</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/22/jean-rhys-novelist-yearning-rage-desire\" title=\"\">Jean Rhys</a>, all of whom feature in Stet.</p> \n<p>Her dedication to her authors was legendary. She was responsible for coaxing Rhys\u2019s great novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/15/book-beach-wide-sargasso-sea-jean-rhys\" title=\"\">Wide Sargasso Sea</a> out of her. Athill\u2019s efforts, over many years, to nurture Rhys and her work are described with great understanding and sympathy in Stet. Of Rhys, she wrote of \u201cthe existence within a person so incompetent and so given to muddle and disaster \u2013 even to destruction \u2013 of an artist as strong as steel\u201d.</p> \n<p>Athill, too, showed certain mettle in dealing with her writers. Naipaul, for example, walked out after Athill had suggested that two characters in a new novel, Guerrillas, did not convince. If Stet contains literary gossip, it certainly is not from a smugly exclusive point of view, and is packed with insight as to how editors and writers relate. Athill wrote: \u201cAll this book is, is the story of one old ex-editor who imagines that she will feel a little less dead if a few people read it.\u201d In fact, it was, to her great pleasure, amazingly successful, as were all her other books, and she became a sought-after speaker on the literary festival circuit.</p> \n<p>Athill\u2019s own writing life had begun in 1958, when she won an Observer short-story competition (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/17/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Muriel Spark</a> had done the same seven years earlier). She had entered the competition under the pseudonym Mr What, the name of that spring\u2019s Grand National winner. Her own win did more than enrich her by \u00a3500; more importantly, it unlocked the possibility of happiness. It smoothed, as she wrote, the \u201clumpy presence\u201d of failure.</p> \n<p>For, despite a flourishing career, a longstanding sense of failure had menaced Athill\u2019s life. This, indeed, is the story at the heart of Instead of a Letter. The book begins with a loving description of her childhood and then plunges into an emotional pilgrimage. Athill\u2019s fiance, a young pilot, goes off to war to serve in Egypt. She plans to join him \u2013 and have four children. Letters arrive every day. Then suddenly, they stop. After two years, there is a numbingly offhand request that he be released from his engagement. He has found someone else. The narrative of Athill\u2019s pain, the insight into that rejection, is fervent. On <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00938c1\" title=\"\">Desert Island Discs</a>, in 2004, she said that it was not until she wrote Instead of a Letter \u2013 20 years after being jilted \u2013 that she completely recovered.</p> \n<p>Writing about yourself was pointless, she believed, unless it was true. \u201cI write to get to the bottom of things,\u201d she told a journalist. This included a no-nonsense approach to writing about sex. Her one novel, Don\u2019t Look at Me Like That (1967), feels semi-autobiographical with its tale of a young woman in bohemian London in the 1950s who has an affair with a married man. A collection of short stories, An Unavoidable Delay, appeared in 1962.</p> \n<p>As well as Instead of a Letter, there were memoirs that in different ways dealt with Athill\u2019s relationships, occasionally curiously masochistic, with difficult men. After a Funeral (1986) tells the story of an Egyptian writer called \u201cDidi\u201d, who comes to live in Athill\u2019s spare room. He makes her life a misery, and exploits her friendship and generosity. She reads his diary. It is full of insults and wounding remarks about her. Yet she does not cast him out.

      "bodyText": "Diana Athill, who has died aged 101, was one of book publishing\u2019s most remarkable editors, but in the latter part of her life it was her own writing that brought her much-enjoyed literary success. First there was Stet (2000), which described her long career at Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, and then, over the next decade, forgotten books were reprinted and new writing emerged, in particular Somewhere Towards the End, which won the 2008 Costa prize for biography, and became a bestseller. In 2009, four volumes of her memoirs (including Stet and Somewhere Towards the End) were republished as Life Class. In all her work, observations were clear-sighted and seemed truthful, even when they exposed her own emotional frailties. She rose to the challenge, as Ian Jack wrote in the introduction to Life Class, of Jean Rhys\u2019s phrase to \u201cget it as it was, as it really was\u201d. Athill\u2019s first memoir, Instead of a Letter (1963), was written when she was in her 40s. The blurb on the original flyleaf said that Athill had \u201cwritten this autobiography in order to discover the truth about herself and about what her life has been for. Her book is uncompromisingly honest. Yet although she discusses with unusual frankness matters not usually discussed by conventionally reared daughters of British colonels, she is never embarrassing because nothing embarrasses her.\u201d Those were to remain her traits \u2013 she talked of herself as \u201ca beady-eyed watcher\u201d. In 2004, when she was 87, she wrote \u2013 in the third person \u2013 of her own miscarriage at the age of 43. Unmarried, she had come to cherish the pregnancy. Then she miscarried, the loss being graphically described in an intimate manner but without sentiment. Having nearly died, Athill concluded that \u201cnot having died was more important to her than losing the child\u201d. The piece later formed a chapter of her 2015 memoir, Alive, Alive-Oh! and Other Things That Matter. Although she often wrote about tragedy, she was far from a tragic figure. Softly pink-skinned, warm-hearted but never cuddly, she remained, in elegant old age, an optimistic, inquiring woman. She was an entertaining conversationalist \u2013 her talk, which had the same searching tone as her writing, was delivered in a crisp upper-class timbre. Athill was born in Kensington, west London, during a first world war zeppelin raid. Her father, Lawrence Athill, was an army officer, her mother, Alice (nee Carr), the daughter of a family with a large estate, Ditchingham Hall, in Norfolk, where Diana spent much of her childhood \u2013 20 bedrooms, landscaped park and lake, but also many books. There, with her younger brother, Andrew, and sister, Patience, she experienced a carefree life of ponies and hunting, but, above all, reading, encouraged by her much-loved grandmother. As she wrote in Stet, \u201cReading was what one did indoors as riding was what one did out of doors.\u201d This childhood was explored in Yesterday Morning (2002) \u2013 a book that shines in its Englishness of a privileged time Athill considered blessed despite the submerged unhappiness that underpinned her parents\u2019 marriage. Until she was 14, she was educated at home by governesses \u2013 before a spell at boarding school, and on to read English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, in 1936. Then she discovered \u2013 somewhat to her alarm \u2013 that she had to earn her own living. She wanted to be a librarian; it was wartime and she joined the BBC, where she worked in its information department. It was a meeting with Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9, at a dinner party in 1943, which changed her life. She joined him as an editor at the end of the war in his first publishing venture, Allan Wingate, and then became founding director of his new company, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch. She remained there from 1952 until her retirement, aged 75, in 1993. Publishing was then a career where women were usually in the publicity department rather than the boardroom. Indeed, she was not much concerned that women were not on equal pay. But Athill, an initial shyness overcome, had found her niche: in her gift for discovering new authors and for her dealings with them and their writing she would become known as \u201cthe best editor in London\u201d. She loved the job. The sense of being a midwife to books was its essential pleasure. She once described a heavy rewrite on a badly written book as \u201clike removing layers of crumpled brown paper from an awkwardly shaped parcel, and revealing the attractive present which it contained\u201d. Among Athill\u2019s authors were Molly Keane, VS Naipaul, Mordecai Richler, Brian Moore and Jean Rhys, all of whom feature in Stet. Her dedication to her authors was legendary. She was responsible for coaxing Rhys\u2019s great novel Wide Sargasso Sea out of her. Athill\u2019s efforts, over many years, to nurture Rhys and her work are described with great understanding and sympathy in Stet. Of Rhys, she wrote of \u201cthe existence within a person so incompetent and so given to muddle and disaster \u2013 even to destruction \u2013 of an artist as strong as steel\u201d. Athill, too, showed certain mettle in dealing with her writers. Naipaul, for example, walked out after Athill had suggested that two characters in a new novel, Guerrillas, did not convince. If Stet contains literary gossip, it certainly is not from a smugly exclusive point of view, and is packed with insight as to how editors and writers relate. Athill wrote: \u201cAll this book is, is the story of one old ex-editor who imagines that she will feel a little less dead if a few people read it.\u201d In fact, it was, to her great pleasure, amazingly successful, as were all her other books, and she became a sought-after speaker on the literary festival circuit. Athill\u2019s own writing life had begun in 1958, when she won an Observer short-story competition (Muriel Spark had done the same seven years earlier). She had entered the competition under the pseudonym Mr What, the name of that spring\u2019s Grand National winner. Her own win did more than enrich her by \u00a3500; more importantly, it unlocked the possibility of happiness. It smoothed, as she wrote, the \u201clumpy presence\u201d of failure. For, despite a flourishing career, a longstanding sense of failure had menaced Athill\u2019s life. This, indeed, is the story at the heart of Instead of a Letter. The book begins with a loving description of her childhood and then plunges into an emotional pilgrimage. Athill\u2019s fiance, a young pilot, goes off to war to serve in Egypt. She plans to join him \u2013 and have four children. Letters arrive every day. Then suddenly, they stop. After two years, there is a numbingly offhand request that he be released from his engagement. He has found someone else. The narrative of Athill\u2019s pain, the insight into that rejection, is fervent. On Desert Island Discs, in 2004, she said that it was not until she wrote Instead of a Letter \u2013 20 years after being jilted \u2013 that she completely recovered. Writing about yourself was pointless, she believed, unless it was true. \u201cI write to get to the bottom of things,\u201d she told a journalist. This included a no-nonsense approach to writing about sex. Her one novel, Don\u2019t Look at Me Like That (1967), feels semi-autobiographical with its tale of a young woman in bohemian London in the 1950s who has an affair with a married man. A collection of short stories, An Unavoidable Delay, appeared in 1962. As well as Instead of a Letter, there were memoirs that in different ways dealt with Athill\u2019s relationships, occasionally curiously masochistic, with difficult men. After a Funeral (1986) tells the story of an Egyptian writer called \u201cDidi\u201d, who comes to live in Athill\u2019s spare room. He makes her life a misery, and exploits her friendship and generosity. She reads his diary. It is full of insults and wounding remarks about her. Yet she does not cast him out. In the end, he takes his own life in her flat. A similarly flawed and exploitative man, Hakim Jamal, who was later murdered, was at the centre of her book Make Believe (1993). The much younger Jamal, an African-American activist and associate of Malcolm X whose book Andr\u00e9 Deutsch had published, also spent time at her flat, and became her lover. This flat, which had seen so much drama, was at the top of a house owned by her cousin Barbara Smith in Primrose Hill, north London. For more than 40 years Athill lived in this cosy space, full of books, her own embroidered cushions, with the playwright Barry Reckord, until he returned to Jamaica to be cared for by his family, where he died in 2011. At one point in this long relationship, Athill had welcomed Reckord\u2019s new, much younger girlfriend to live with them, although by then Athill and Reckord were no longer lovers.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top story: Russia and other allies stand by Maduro The US, Canada, the EU and several South American powers have backed Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, after he declared himself the country\u2019s interim president in a bid to oust Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, amid days of political unrest in which 14 people have died. Maduro is being supported by allies including Russia, Turkey and Bolivia. Entrenched power. Donald Trump warned that \u201call options are on the table\u201d if Maduro responded to his opponents\u2019 challenge with force but it remained unclear whether or how Maduro can be decisively unseated. Bolivar\u2019s legacy. Guaid\u00f3 declared himself president while holding a copy of Venezuela\u2019s constitution bearing a portrait of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, a 19th century revolutionary. Bol\u00edvar was a national hero whose mantle was also claimed by Maduro\u2019s mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Trump backs down on State of the Union address Trump has said he will wait until the partial government shutdown is resolved to deliver his annual State of the Union address, after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, vowed to block him from making the speech in the House chamber on 29 January as originally planned. Following speculation he might spite her by delivering the address from elsewhere, the president announced on Twitter that \u201cno venue \u2026 can compete with the history, tradition and importance\u201d of the chamber and he looked forward to giving a \u201cgreat\u201d speech \u201cin the near future\u201d. Air safety. Union leaders representing air traffic controllers and other aviation workers issued an urgent joint statement on Wednesday, warning the shutdown posed a heightened risk to the safety and security of air travel in the US. Top adviser describes \u2018war\u2019 inside the FDA over opioids The chair of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s opioid advisory committee has said there is a \u201cwar\u201d within the agency over its approach to the opioids crisis. Dr Raeford Brown told the Guardian the FDA had put the interests of big pharma ahead of public health by continuing to approve high-strength painkillers while failing \u201cto learn the lessons\u201d of a prescription drug epidemic, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. \u201cFor every day \u2026 the FDA don\u2019t do the right thing, people drop dead on the streets,\u201d he said. \u2018Terrible drug\u2019. Brown singled out the \u201cterrible drug\u201d, Dsuvia, which was recently approved by the FDA despite being up to 10 times as potent as Fentanyl. Court to rule on Amanda Knox\u2019s last outstanding conviction The European court of human rights is set to decide on Thursday whether Amanda\u2019s Knox\u2019s final remaining conviction for malicious accusation should be overturned. Knox, now 31, spent almost four years in an Italian prison after being convicted of the 2007 murder of her British housemate, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, before she and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were acquitted on appeal in 2011. \u2018Malicious accusation\u2019. The American was convicted for suggesting another person should be a suspect in the murder. She is appealing on the grounds that Italian police assaulted her, denied her an interpreter and subjected her to psychological pressure while under arrest. Crib sheet North Korean state media has reported Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u201cgreat satisfaction\u201d at receiving a letter from Trump ahead of a second summit between the two leaders, slated for February. The hedge fund founder Ken Griffin is the proud new owner of America\u2019s most expensive home after forking out roughly $238m for a 24,000-sq-ft penthouse on New York\u2019s Billionaire\u2019s Row, more than double the previous record. At least five people were killed in a shooting at a bank in Sebring, Florida, on Wednesday. The 21-year-old suspect, named as Zephen Xaver, surrendered to police. Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine has been blocked by Chinese authorities, having previously been the only major foreign search engine accessible behind China\u2019s so-called Great Firewall. Must-reads The hunt for the perfect flu vaccine Vaccines have successfully seen off smallpox, rabies and polio, and all but defeated other diseases such as measles. So why does a reliable, consistent flu vaccination continue to elude modern medicine? Jeremy Brown reports. Victims of conspiracy theories speak out Marcel Fontaine was wrongly identified as the Parkland shooter. James Alefantis was falsely accused of running a paedophile ring from his pizza restaurant. Ed Pilkington spoke to them and others about how they survived being swept up in conspiracy theories. The Gillette founder\u2019s utopian dream In 1894, just as he was perfecting his design for a disposable razor, King Camp Gillette came up with another futuristic idea: replace all north American cities with a single vast metropolis built above, and powered by, Niagara Falls. Alexandra Heal examines his proposal. Has your local bus been resurrected in Guatemala? Many of Guatemala City\u2019s buses began life on US streets, writes Martha Pskowski, part of a worldwide pattern of old vehicles being \u201cdumped\u201d on developing countries despite their emissions inefficiencies \u2013 with potentially serious environmental consequences. Opinion Trump has spent his life surrounding himself with young, compliant women, writes Jill Filipovic. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so destabilised by the competence and experience of Nancy Pelosi. The women of Trumpworld have a single role, and that is to say \u201cyes\u201d. Trump has long bought and paid for that acquiescence. Now, Pelosi is telling him no, and she has real power and can\u2019t be ignored, replaced, or waved away. Sport The US Open champion, Naomi Osaka, will face Petra Kvitova in the Australian Open final, after beating Kvitova\u2019s fellow Czech Karolina Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 in three sets. Real Madrid and Barcelona have both overtaken Manchester United at the top of Deloitte\u2019s annual ranking of the world\u2019s highest-earning football clubs. The 20 top-earning clubs generated a record $9.7bn in combined revenue in 2017-18, up 6% on the previous year. Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

The 32-year-old\u2019s hair is now shorter - and thinner, the bandanas aren\u2019t quite so piratical, the brow is more furrowed, but he does still have the intense focus and relentless energy, which he shows with his obligatory jumping up and down during the coin toss followed by his raging bull charge to the back of the court for the warm-up. </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AusOpen?src=hash\"><br></a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-24T08:41:38.322Z\">at 8.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c497860e4b0a585f6e855bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-24T08:37:56.824Z\">8.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The winner of this match will take on either Novak Djokovic or Lucas Pouille</strong>, who meet tomorrow.

He\u2019s won all his matches in straight sets, hasn\u2019t been broken since the first round and, having already dismissed two Next Gen talents in Alex de Minaur and Frances Tiafoe, appears to be in the mood to show another young upstart who\u2019s boss.<br></p> <p>The 32-year-old was underestimated coming into the tournament because of his wretched run of injuries since Wimbledon last year, but every time you think the end credits on his career may be about to roll, the stubborn and superb Spaniard keeps. Coming. Back. And tennis is all the better for that.<br></p> <p>If one of Nadal\u2019s assorted ailments flares up today, whether it be his taped abdomen, the thigh strain that forced his withdrawal from Brisbane this month, the ankle that was operated on last year or his perennially creaking knees, Tsitsipas can take full advantage. The long-haired, bandanaed Greek with the look of Bjorn Borg, the competitiveness of Andy Murray and the one-handed backhand of Federer has wowed the Melbourne crowds with his bold play, skill at the net and unwavering self-belief. He showed little fear against Federer in the last 16 and will be determined to do the same today, even though this is his first grand slam semi-final and he\u2019s facing a man appearing in his 30th.<br></p> <p>For some time Alexander Zverev has been the undisputed leader of the Next Gen, widely regarded as the player most likely to break tennis\u2019s established order and shake up a sport that has become an old man\u2019s game at the very top level but now, suddenly, another young challenger with the X-factor has come along.

      "bodyText": "Right that\u2019s it from me. Many thanks for your company today, and do join us tomorrow for coverage of the second semi-final between Novak Djokovic and Lucas Pouille. We shouldn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves \u2026 but the last time Nadal and Djokovic met at the Australian Open was in that near six-hour final of 2012. More of the same on Sunday, please. Bye! This from the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Athens: It might be the end of a dream but the verdict in Greece where compatriots have been rooting for Tsitsipas is that no man has brought them such pride on the tennis court. \u201cStefanos Tsitsipas gave what he could. Against the great Spaniard he didn\u2019t succeed in prevailing again. But right now that is of little importance,\u201d wrote Sports 24 in its live blog of the match. Not that long ago tennis was a rarified sport in Greece. The sensational 20-year-old has now put it on the map - and on the back of tennis\u2019 new-found attraction, Nadal, as chance would have it, is about to open a tennis academy in the country. And never mind Nadal\u2019s tennis ... Tsitsipas\u2019s win over Federer on Sunday was labelled as a changing of the guard in men\u2019s tennis, including by Mr McEnroe, but Nadal has shown the old guard isn\u2019t going anywhere yet. A tournament that started with Andy Murray\u2019s possible goodbye could end with another creaking 30-something great lifting the title. Nadal\u2019s level of play was quite staggering. He played with such aggression \u2013 on serve, from the baseline and at the net \u2013 cracking 28 winners, facing only one break point and reeling off the last nine games. He\u2019s won 18 consecutive sets this fortnight, hasn\u2019t been broken since round one and has lost an average of only eight games a match. The stats don\u2019t lie, he\u2019s been the player of this tournament, and he\u2019s playing the best tennis he has on a hard court in several years. Nadal\u2019s one win away from becoming the first man to claim all four grand slams twice in the Open era and victory on Sunday would be only his second Australian Open title - 10 years after his first. \u201cCan you play any better than that?\u201d asks John McEnroe in the on-court interview. \u201cHopefully yes,\u201d smiles Nadal. \u201cHow?\u201d McEnroe asks in almost disbelief. \u201cI don\u2019t know. it\u2019s been a great match, a great tournament. I\u2019ve played very well every day. Thanks everyone for the support and everyone who sends me messages in the low moments.\u201d Nadal is asked about the up and coming youngsters. \u201cThey are improving every month,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the beautiful thing about this sport, we are able to share generations. They are really here now fighting for the most important things. I wish them a very successful career. [Tsitsipas] has everything to become a multi grand slam champion. He\u2019s in the semi-finals, that says a lot of good things about him. I hope to face him in important rounds in the coming years.\u201d McEnroe then hits Nadal with a probing question. \u201cWhy have you gone back to the sleeveless shirt?\u201d he wonders. \u201cI have small issues when I\u2019m playing in very hot conditions when I hit my forehand, so I like to play without the sleeves,\u201d says Nadal. \u201cIt makes me feel younger again.\u201d Lastly, what about the final? \u201cNovak is the favourite, he\u2019s been in that position so many times, but Lucas has amazing potential. Let\u2019s see. Anything can happen.\u201d At 15-all, Nadal pounds a serve to Tsitsipas\u2019s forehand, which flies high and wide. 30-15. Nadal attempts to pull off an audacious volley but shows he can sometimes be human when he nets. 30-all. Another netted Nadal volley! 30-40. A first break point of the match for Tsitsipas! Perhaps he wants to extend his misery for a little longer, the masochist. But Nadal\u2019s always in charge and needs only to pat away Tsitsipas\u2019s meek lob to get to deuce. Advantage Nadal, so after one hour and 45 minutes he has match point. Tsitsipas smacks his return into the net and Nadal has put the young challenger well and truly in his place to reach his 25th grand slam final! He raises his arms repeatedly and roars to the night skies. Tsitsipas scurries off court rather quickly. It\u2019s been quite some tournament for the 20-year-old but he\u2019s been taught a lesson by a ruthless and inspired Nadal, who\u2019ll now face Novak Djokovic sorry either Novak Djokovic or Lucas Pouille in Sunday\u2019s final. Third set: Tsitsipas 2-6, 4-6, 0-5 Nadal* ... which Nadal can almost taste when Tsitsipas goes 0-15, 0-30, 0-40 down. Tsitsipas is going through the motions now. He barely tries on the first break point, which Nadal - of course - wins. The Spaniard\u2019s about to serve for a place in his fifth Australian Open final, and first since his defeat to Roger Federer two years ago. Third set: *Tsitsipas 2-6, 4-6, 0-4 Nadal Nadal holds and the bagel is still on ... Third set: Tsitsipas 2-6, 4-6, 0-3 Nadal* Tsitsipas may have been broken in that opening game of this set but, credit to him, his resolve doesn\u2019t seem to be, you can see he\u2019s still thinking, trying to stay positive and find a way to get back into this. But this is turning into a tragedy for the young Greek, when a wonderful spinning return from Nadal for 30-all combined with a dismissive overhead smash on break point secures the double break. I think this is a much better match-up for Nadal - he relishes playing right-handers with a one-handed backhand because it\u2019s harder for them to get his viciously spun, high-bouncing forehands back. But I\u2019d also say Nadal is in better form than Federer is. He\u2019s been the best player of the tournament. Third set: *Tsitsipas 2-6, 4-6, 0-2 Nadal So much of the talk in the buildup to this match was about the first coming of Tsitsipas, but this is what seems like the 673rd coming of Nadal. For much of the past decade, you would probably have bet your house on injuries ending the Spaniard\u2019s career before Andy Murray\u2019s, but here he is, after all of his physical problems and lay-offs, closing in on another grand slam final and his first away from Roland Garros since the 2017 US Open. He\u2019s still been the king of clay in the past couple of years, with his 11 French Open titles, but he hasn\u2019t been a king on the hard courts. But he\u2019s ruling over Tsitsipas here, and he biffs a backhand, his 22nd winner of the night, to break the Greek at the start of the third. He then backs it up for 2-0. Nadal shows remarkable reactions and dexterity at the net to get his racket on a forehand volley for the winner. 30-0. Tsitsipas tonks out, 40-0. Three set points. A stinging serve out wide, Tsitsipas is on the spin and gets his racket to it, but the ball\u2019s not coming back into play. The mountain has just got even bigger for the young Greek. Second set: Tsitsipas 2-6, 4-5 Nadal* Nadal decides it\u2019s time to strike, and brings up two break points at 15-40. Tsitsipas serves to Nadal\u2019s backhand, sprints straight to the net, and rushes the Spaniard into the error. 30-40. Could Tsitsipas be about to pull off another great escape, after his Houdini act at 2-2? No, Tsitsipas makes the error and Rafa races to his chair knowing if he wins the next game he\u2019s only a set away from a fifth Australian Open final. Tsitsipas lashes out at a ball in frustration - and nearly whacks a ballkid instead. That would have made his evening even worse than it already is. Second set: *Tsitsipas 2-6, 4-4 Nadal And you know what happens next, right? Nadal continues his serving domination in this match with a love hold quicker than you can say: \u201cThey\u2019re level going into the business end of the second set.\u201d Second set: Tsitsipas 2-6, 4-3 Nadal* Move along, there\u2019s nothing to see here. Tsitsipas holds with ease. Second set: *Tsitsipas 2-6, 3-3 Nadal Those saved break points were almost like saved set points given the way Nadal is giving nothing away on his serve. Tsitsipas showed tremendous courage under fire in that game, but Nadal is back firing here. A no-nonsense hold and they\u2019re all square in the second set as the match clock ticks into a second hour. Second set: Tsitsipas 2-6, 3-2 Nadal* But the progress is stalled. 0-15. 0-30. 0-40. Three break points. Tsitsipas\u2019s team - including Serena Williams\u2019s coach Patrick Mouratoglou, who\u2019s also been helping the Greek - have their heads in their hands. Tsitsipas produces a fine point to fend off the first, with a forehand down the line, then a forehand cross-court, followed by a deft volley - that\u2019s the level he has to play at to deny Nadal. He then saves the second and third too! Deuce. And from 0-40, it\u2019s Tsitsipas\u2019s advantage! Could this be a turning point? Tsitsipas is back from the brink and takes the game with an ace out wide. He\u2019s screaming and the Greek flags are waving. Second set: *Tsitsipas 2-6, 2-2 Nadal A poor volley from Nadal gives Tsitsipas a chance on the opening point, but the 14th seed can\u2019t take advantage. 15-0, cue a steely Nadal fist pump. 30-15. An ace out wide, 40-15. Tsitsipas challenges ... he needn\u2019t have bothered, it caught most of the line. The chase is on for Nadal on the next point, but he can only net. 40-30. A glimmer for Tsitsipas? No, Nadal wins the game. But that\u2019s the first time since the second game of the match that Tsitsipas has won two points on Nadal\u2019s serve. Small progress is still progress, eh? Second set: Tsitsipas 2-6, 2-1 Nadal* Tsitsipas has found his serving touch in this second set. A fierce forehand brings up 40-0. The pair are slicing away at each other on the fourth point, there\u2019s some lobbing and scampering too, and Nadal wins the game of cat and mouse. 40-15. But from there the Greek holds firm for the game. There\u2019s very little giving on serve at the moment. Second set: *Tsitsipas 2-6, 1-1 Nadal Newsflash! Nadal loses only his fourth point on serve. It\u2019s 40-15. But that\u2019s about all the drama there is. Nadal secures the next point for the game. Second set: Tsitsipas 2-6, 1-0 Nadal* At least Tsitsipas has the advantage of serving first in the second set. He\u2019s briefly inconvenienced at 30-0 as a ballkid removes a bug from the court \u2013 Tsitsipas is probably wishing the ballkid could also remove his opponent as well \u2013 but the Greek shows character to win his first game in four, and he does it to love. At 30-15, Nadal sends Tsitsipas this way and that way, before coming into the net and making a tough, low forehand volley look like a practice shot in the park. 40-15, two set points. And Nadal settles matters at the first opportunity with a serve down the T that Tsitsipas sends long! That\u2019s now 16 sets on the spin he\u2019s won at this year\u2019s Australian Open. If Tsitsipas\u2019s task wasn\u2019t hard enough already, it\u2019s just become a whole lot tougher. Apart from a few early nerves in the opening two games, it\u2019s been a near-perfect set of tennis from Nadal. First set: Tsitsipas 2-5 Nadal* Tsitsipas is chattering to himself. He\u2019s probably trying to figure out what on earth he can do to subdue Nadal. The Greek could do with some help from the gods, and he\u2019s looking to the skies after serving two consecutive double faults to slip from 40-15 to deuce. Which turns into Nadal\u2019s advantage. A Tsitsipas drop shot has Nadal charging forward and the Spaniard is able to combine the sprint with a sublime touch at the net to put the ball behind a backpedalling opponent! Nadal has the security of a second break and will come out after the changeover to serve for the first set. First set: *Tsitsipas 2-4 Nadal Nadal is firing off both wings - \u201cit\u2019s like two forehands\u201d parps Chris Bradnam on the Eurosport commentary - and if Nadal\u2019s backhand is as vicious as his forehand tonight, what hope does Tsitsipas have? 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. After sliding 15-30 down in his opening service game, Nadal hasn\u2019t conceded a point on serve. First set: Tsitsipas 2-3 Nadal* However three consecutive games for Nadal has not got to the Greek. Tsitsipas shows admirable resolve to come up with a love game of his own, rounding things off with a beautiful one-handed backhand winner down the line. First set: *Tsitsipas 1-3 Nadal Nadal backs up the break with his first love game. He\u2019s got the look of a man who means business, which is ominous for his young opponent. First set: Tsitsipas 1-2 Nadal* Tsitsipas and Nadal are now even on unsuccessful Hawk-Eye challenges and they\u2019re also even in this game at 15-all. Nadal forges ahead for 15-30 but Tsitsipas thwacks a forehand cross-court winner for 30-all. Cue a little yelp of encouragement from the big 6ft 4in Greek. But it\u2019s to no avail. Nadal soon has a break point at 30-40 and he decides to get in on Tsitsipas\u2019s net-rushing act. The Greek tries to go down the line but misses. After 11 minutes, Nadal has the first break of the match! First set: *Tsitsipas 1-1 Nadal Nadal knifes a volley into the tramlines. 0-15. It\u2019s the champion looking more nervous than the challenger at the moment. A failed Hawk-Eye appeal from the second seed and it\u2019s 15-30. An early hint of danger on Nadal\u2019s serve. But danger, what danger? Nadal smashes down an ace for 30-all, Tsitsipas loops his one-handed backhand long and Nadal takes the game after another unforced error from his opponent. First set: Tsitsipas 1-0 Nadal* Ladies and gentlemen, Stefanos Tsitsipas won the toss and has elected to serve first. And so, this fascinating match-up of youth v experience, a grand slam semi-final debutant v a 17-time major winner is under way. Tsitsipas starts as he means to go on with a brilliant, attacking first point, the serve-volley getting him to 15-0. A longer second point plays out but it also goes the way of the Greek. 30-0. Nadal gets on the board with a brutal backhand return which he takes early, and Tsitsipas nets. 30-15. 40-15. Game, after a netted Nadal return. The Greek fans are already in good voice, both on Rod Laver and elsewhere. There is, of course, a strong Greek population in Melbourne. Nadal is keeping Tsitsipas waiting. Mind games? The Greek is pacing in the corridors for more than five minutes before the Spaniard appears. Nadal must feel rather old when he sees his opponent, given Tsitsipas probably reminds him of his younger, swashbuckling self. The 32-year-old\u2019s hair is now shorter - and thinner, the bandanas aren\u2019t quite so piratical, the brow is more furrowed, but he does still have the intense focus and relentless energy, which he shows with his obligatory jumping up and down during the coin toss followed by his raging bull charge to the back of the court for the warm-up. The winner of this match will take on either Novak Djokovic or Lucas Pouille, who meet tomorrow. But surely Djokovic needs more snackage than this to fuel his bid for a record seventh Australian Open title? The head-to-head doesn\u2019t make great reading for Tsitsipas \u2013 he was blown away on the Barcelona clay last May 6-2, 6-1 and also lost to Nadal a few months later in the Rogers Cup final \u2013 but that\u2019s not putting him off. \u201cI felt very close to beating him in Toronto, though the score was 6-2, 7-6,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember coming back to the locker room and promising to myself I\u2019m going to do much better against him next time. \u201cIt felt like I understood a bit better what he was doing on the court after that match, and especially on hard court. It\u2019s going to be interesting. I feel like I can do something good against him.\u201d Nadal, meanwhile, appears slightly wary. \u201cThey can wait a little bit,\u201d he says of the young challengers. \u201cBut looks like they don\u2019t want to wait. They\u2019re here. \u201cStefanos is one of the best players of the world. He\u2019s ready to win against anybody. To have the chance to be in that final, I need to play my best, and that\u2019s what I am looking for.\u201d They\u2019re raising the roof! Nadal will be happy with that. His powers are slightly weakened indoors, and wasn\u2019t too happy playing under the roof in the Wimbledon semi-final against Novak Djokovic last year. \u201cThere is a considerable fanbase growing around the charismatic Greek player with the single-handed backhand and the multi-layered brain. He is different, a relaxed and attractive thinker who says there is more to life than tennis, yet gives the impression he would drive himself to the extremities of collapse to win a big match. Nadal might force him to go to that place.\u201d These are the words of our man in Melbourne, Kevin Mitchell. You can read the rest of his thoughts on the semi-final here. Meanwhile there will be no grand slam final for Britain\u2019s Neal Skupski. He and Spain\u2019s Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez lost 6-0, 6-4 to the third seeds, Barbora Krejcikova and Rajeev Ram, in the mixed doubles semis. As I try to thaw out after my icy walk into Guardian Towers this morning in temperatures of minus one, the news that it\u2019s still more than 40 degrees in Melbourne is making me feel slightly warmer. It means the roof is closed, as it was during the women\u2019s semi-finals, when Petra Kvitova ended the run of the unseeded American Danielle Collins 7-6, 6-0 and Naomi Osaka held off a comeback from the inspired conqueror of Serena Williams, Karolina Pliskova, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4. What a final that should be on Saturday. Kvitova will be playing in her first grand slam final since nearly losing fingers in a knife attack just over two ago and her first since Wimbledon 2014, while Osaka is going for back-to-back major wins after her breakthrough triumph at the US Open. And there\u2019s more than just the title on the line; the winner will take the world No 1 ranking from Simona Halep. Good morning/afternoon/evening depending on your worldly whereabouts and welcome to our coverage of the first men\u2019s semi-final between the man of the week and the man of the fortnight. While the 20-year-old sensation Stefanos Tsitsipas caused a major Melbourne earthquake on Sunday by ending Roger Federer\u2019s title defence for the win of his life, Rafael Nadal has created few tremors because his progress has been so smooth. He\u2019s won all his matches in straight sets, hasn\u2019t been broken since the first round and, having already dismissed two Next Gen talents in Alex de Minaur and Frances Tiafoe, appears to be in the mood to show another young upstart who\u2019s boss. The 32-year-old was underestimated coming into the tournament because of his wretched run of injuries since Wimbledon last year, but every time you think the end credits on his career may be about to roll, the stubborn and superb Spaniard keeps. Coming. Back. And tennis is all the better for that. If one of Nadal\u2019s assorted ailments flares up today, whether it be his taped abdomen, the thigh strain that forced his withdrawal from Brisbane this month, the ankle that was operated on last year or his perennially creaking knees, Tsitsipas can take full advantage. The long-haired, bandanaed Greek with the look of Bjorn Borg, the competitiveness of Andy Murray and the one-handed backhand of Federer has wowed the Melbourne crowds with his bold play, skill at the net and unwavering self-belief. He showed little fear against Federer in the last 16 and will be determined to do the same today, even though this is his first grand slam semi-final and he\u2019s facing a man appearing in his 30th. For some time Alexander Zverev has been the undisputed leader of the Next Gen, widely regarded as the player most likely to break tennis\u2019s established order and shake up a sport that has become an old man\u2019s game at the very top level but now, suddenly, another young challenger with the X-factor has come along. And tennis is all the better for that too. The players will be on court at: 8.30am GMT/7.30pm Melbourne time. In the meantime why don\u2019t you: watch the highlights of Nadal\u2019s 2009 Australian Open win, his only title triumph in Melbourne. Tsitsipas was 10 at the time.",

For years, residents have relied on \u201cred buses\u201d: old American school buses painted bright red that are privately owned and largely unregulated. Drivers of red buses collect cash fares onboard and change their routes at will. Gangs have targeted red buses for extortion payments in recent years because drivers carry large amounts of cash, sometimes even <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/113293/900-bus-drivers-dead-guatemala-city-worlds-most-dangerous-job\">killing drivers</a> who don\u2019t pay up.As a result, their owners often struggle to break even; buying new buses is out of the question.</p> <p>In contrast, private companies receive permits to operate Transurbano buses, and the new system includes prepaid fares, designated bus stations and established routes.</p> <p>\u201cThere are red buses on the street that are 30 years old,\u201d says Castro. \u201cWe just restored some 1992 model red buses.\u201d Guatemala has no regulations limiting vehicle emissions and it is common for older cars to remain on the road.

      "bodyText": "The Food and Drug Administration is sacrificing American lives by continuing to approve new high-strength opioid painkillers, and manipulating the process in favor of big pharma, according to the chair of the agency\u2019s own opioid advisory committee. Dr Raeford Brown told the Guardian there is \u201ca war\u201d within the FDA as officials in charge of opioid policy have \u201cfailed to learn the lessons\u201d of the epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people over the past 20 years and continues to claim about 150 lives a day. Brown accused the agency of putting the interests of narcotics manufacturers ahead of public health, most recently by approving a \u201cterrible drug\u201d, Dsuvia, in a process he alleged was manipulated. \u201cThey should stop considering any new opioid evaluation,\u201d said Brown. \u201cFor every day and every week and every month that the FDA don\u2019t do the right thing, people drop dead on the streets. What they do has a direct impact on the mortality rate from opioids in this country.\u201d Brown, an anesthesiologist who chairs the FDA committee of specialists advising the agency on whether to approve new opioid painkillers, said he no longer had confidence in repeated assurances by the FDA leadership that it was taking the epidemic seriously and prepared to put public health above the commercial interests of drug makers. \u201cI think that the FDA has learned nothing. The modus operandi of the agency is that they talk a good game and then nothing happens. Working directly with the agency for the last five years, as I sit and listen to them in meetings, all I can think about is the clock ticking and how many people are dying every moment that they\u2019re not doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of insight that continues to be exhibited by the agency is in many ways a willful blindness that borders on the criminal.\u201d Brown\u2019s comments echo criticisms by US senators who have condemned the FDA for what they say is its \u201ccomplicity\u201d in the epidemic, for approving the powerful painkillers that drove the crisis and then failing to use its powers to protect the public as the death toll escalated. Four US senators wrote to the head of the FDA, Dr Scott Gottlieb, late last year urging him not to allow Dsuvia, a powerful opioid pill, on to the market because it was \u201cto the detriment of public health\u201d. Dsuvia is a branded narcotic sufentanil pill, a more potent version of fentanyl, made by Californian pharmaceutical company AcelRx. The signatories included Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, whose state has the highest rate of opioid overdose deaths in the country. \u201cThis puzzling and unacceptable course of events is unfortunately reminiscent of previous FDA processes and practices that contributed to the opioid epidemic,\u201d the letter said. The FDA\u2019s credibility has been badly damaged by the opioid crisis amid accusations that at times it behaved less as a regulator overseeing the pharmaceutical industry than a business partner of drug manufacturers. The agency helped unleash the epidemic two decades ago when it approved the sale of a high strength narcotic pill, OxyContin, as safer and more effective than other painkillers on the say so of the manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, and without requiring clinical trials. Since then the FDA has approved other opioids for wide prescribing even as evidence mounted the drugs were addictive, open to abuse and often not effective for long-term use. The FDA was also embarrassed by revelations that officials responsible for opioid approvals were taking part in \u201cpay to play\u201d schemes in which manufacturers paid to attend meetings to draw up the criteria for approving prescription narcotics. Donald Trump\u2019s opioid commission identified the failure of the FDA and other federal institutions to properly regulate opioids and their manufacturers as an important factor in the epidemic. After Trump appointed Gottlieb, the new FDA chief admitted the agency \u201cdidn\u2019t get ahead\u201d of the crisis and promised \u201cdramatic\u201d action. He said he favoured examining not only whether an opioid worked but whether it was needed and whether the risks of it feeding the epidemic outweighed benefits for patients. But that commitment has been called into question by the slow pace of introducing new practices and regulations \u2013 and by the approval of Dsuvia, a potent pill developed with the US defense department. An advisory committee rejected the drug in 2017 over safety concerns. The senators said that they were \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d that when Dsuvia was resubmitted for consideration the following year, the FDA excluded members of the agency\u2019s drug safety committee from the hearing. The senators also said they were concerned because the decision was made when Brown, a strong critic of Dsuvia, was absent at a professional conference in San Francisco. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind right that they did that on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FDA has a lack of transparency. They use the advisory committees as cover.\u201d The FDA is not required to follow the decisions of its advisory committees but has been wary of going against their decisions since 2012, when the agency created a political storm by overruling a decision to reject Zohydro, an opioid 10 times more powerful than regular painkillers. Doctors and specialists on the committee questioned the safety of the drug and the need for it given the epidemic. The senior FDA official at the hearing, Dr Bob Rappaport, who was head of the agency\u2019s opioid approval division, angered other members by telling them there had to be \u201ca level playing field for business\u201d, which was widely interpreted as putting the right of pharmaceutical companies to make money ahead of public health. Brown described a breakdown in confidence and trust between his advisory committee and FDA officials responsible for opioid approvals. He characterized them as out of touch with the consequences of the epidemic and locked into a view promoted by drugmakers that those who become hooked are to blame for their addiction not the pills or prescribing practices. Brown blamed the problem in part on \u201ccozy, cozy relationships between the pharmaceutical industry and various parts of the FDA\u201d. Since a change to the FDA\u2019s funding in the 1990s, the agency division responsible for opioid approvals relies on the drug industry for 75% of its budget. The agency denies the money buys influence. The FDA declined to respond to Brown\u2019s specific criticisms. Gottlieb has previously defended Dsuvia by saying it is required for use in circumstances where other drugs cannot be administered, such as a battlefield.

But Brown remains skeptical. \u201cNothing is fundamentally being done to effect change in the regulation of opioids. If the FDA continues to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to turn out opioid after opioid after opioid, and the regulation of those opioids is no better than it was in 1995, then we\u2019ll be cleaning this up for a long time,\u201d said Brown.

      "body": "<p>Shortly after getting off the phone to me, the two-Michelin-star chef Sat Bains texts a PS: \u201cOne guy rang 450 times today as our March diary opened. He was pissed off. That means when he comes it better be amazing.\u201d</p> <p>That was one of 670 individual booking inquiries at Nottingham\u2019s Restaurant Sat Bains that day. It is not an extraordinary number for a top-end restaurant. At one time, Copenhagen\u2019s Noma <a href=\"https://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Article/2012/05/01/Exclusive-Rene-Redzepi-reveals-secrets-to-Noma-s-success\" title=\"\">was fielding 100,000 emails a month</a>. But it illustrates how, in an increasingly globalised world, hot restaurants and bars have become stand-alone tourist destinations \u2013 sites of pilgrimage for national and international food obsessives.</p> <p>When many restaurants are struggling to survive, that clamour for tables is a nice problem to have. But, particularly in smaller, neighbourhood venues, such acclaim can be disruptive. It also puts pressure on chefs who, suddenly, find themselves stars of the show. A recent University of Lleida study, published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.intangiblecapital.org/index.php/ic/article/view/1090/714\" title=\"\">Intangible Capital</a>, identified a group of food tourists who travel explicitly to eat at Michelin-starred restaurants. They want to meet the chef, visit the kitchen and love the \u201cstatus\u201d this confers on them. Unabashed show-offs, the majority relay all of this on social media.</p> <p>Bains handles this by remaining \u201cauthentic\u201d. \u201cIf people save to come here, it\u2019d be rude for me not to say hello. It\u2019s called hospitality. But I\u2019m a working chef. By 11.30pm on Saturday night, I\u2019m drained. I\u2019ve spilled shit over my jacket. I might be bollocking someone. It\u2019s a working kitchen. I hope you enjoyed yourself. Here\u2019s a menu. But I don\u2019t pretend to be a host. I\u2019m a chef.\u201d</p> <p>Bains\u2019s profile built gradually, between 2003 and 2011, as he accumulated stars and won the 2007 Great British Menu with his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/hameggandpeas_85942\" title=\"\">slow-cooked duck egg, ham and pea</a> sorbet: \u201cThat egg filled our restaurant for a year.\u201d But for others, sudden attention can be bewildering.</p> <p>When the Lima-born chef Jose Luis de Cossio opened Paiche in Portland, Oregon, he intended it to be an affordable, neighbourhood breakfast-lunch joint in Lair Hill, a part of the city described by Portland Monthly as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pdxmonthly.com/restaurants/paiche\" title=\"\">foodie desert</a>\u201d. De Cossio had worked in celebrated restaurants but, by 2016, he wanted to do something less intense to make time for his family and his other great love, surfing.</p> <p>Immediately, Paiche went stratospheric. Named restaurant of the year in the Willamette Week, trend-hunting foodies flocked from across Portland to try the ceviche. Queues grew, as did customer expectations. De Cossio felt compelled to open for dinner, and gussy-up the menu. Prices rose accordingly. \u201cI was putting too much luxury there. Paying $32 for a grouper from Tokyo, it\u2019s not sustainable. I think the press made me feel like a false hero, and it affected my ego \u2013 a chef\u2019s worst enemy. I should never have changed for recognition.\u201d</p> <p>Soon de Cossio was grumbling about the \u201cnarrow customer\u201d his 32-seat restaurant was attracting. \u201cI don\u2019t want to focus on fine dining. I don\u2019t want to be a superstar chef in town,\u201d he told Willamette Week.</p> <p>Radically, in 2017, he abandoned dinner service, turned Paiche vegan and began serving $6 dishes. \u201cWhy not make a humble place, man?\u201d the 46-year-old asks. Paiche closed late in 2018 (\u201cI need a break, new air to build my energy\u201d), but: \u201cI really love that, at the last, it was counter-service and open to people who have a lower budget.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3ac48ec71b7e475a4e0c8e87d0d1befd0987546\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3ac48ec71b7e475a4e0c8e87d0d1befd0987546/0_72_3947_2368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raan Jae Fai restaurant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raan Jae Fai restaurant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diego Azubel/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paiche is not alone in being overwhelmed by a crowd. From the Kernel brewery, in London, which closed its brew-tap after Bermondsey\u2019s \u201cbeer mile\u201d became wildly popular, to Raan Jay Fai, a backstreet kitchen in Bangkok that gained a Michelin star, many have found it to be logistically problematic. Raan Jay Fai had to drop complex dishes to cope with an influx of 200 diners a day. \u201cI wish I could give the star back,\u201d the exhausted 72-year-old chef-owner, Supinya Junsuta, told reporters.</p> <p>A high demand for seats can damage your reputation, too. In no-bookings venues, regulars get upset they can no longer get in easily, while those travelling for hours to eat there complain about queues. When the award-winning Altrincham Market House food hub opened in 2014, the co-owner Nick Johnson had to hold his nerve and ignore any critical TripAdvisor reviews. \u201cI don\u2019t put great store in TripAdvisor because you don\u2019t know who it is has left that review and you can\u2019t trust their value judgments,\u201d he says. \u201cI would no sooner ask my father where to eat than I would an alsatian dog, but he\u2019s allowed to leave a TripAdvisor review \u2013 therefore it has no value.\u201d</p> <p>Market House relies on an element of chaos for its \u201cenergy\u201d, Johnson insists. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody. But if you enjoy busy-ness and that atmosphere, you\u2019ll tough it out.\u201d Similarly, he thinks local people adapted. \u201cYou want busy places in your community. The locals know when it\u2019s busiest and work around that.\u201d</p> <p>John Pybus is a more interventionist operator. Landlord of the Blue Bell, one of tourist-mobbed York\u2019s most famous pubs, he loves \u201cnice, Camra-type\u201d (Campaign for Real Ale) visitors, but won\u2019t serve the large gangs of \u201cshitfaced, rowdy knobheads\u201d that \u201cmake the city centre a bit of a no-go area on Saturday afternoons\u201d.</p> <p>Signs outside the pub state: no stags, no hens, no groups. Policing that, says Pybus, is an inexact science: \u201cIf it\u2019s Tuesday afternoon and I\u2019ve got 10 70-year-old blokes in reminiscing, fine. If it\u2019s Saturday and it\u2019s three lads in fancy dress, you\u2019re a group.\u201d But in a city centre where, Pybus claims, some older people don\u2019t feel safe at weekends, he thinks it is \u201cimperative we have local pubs run by and for local people, where those people take precedence. The tourists who come in appreciate that sense of community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74abc6c3f0267f2520baedf710f849a021fae841\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74abc6c3f0267f2520baedf710f849a021fae841/0_0_6678_4452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Altrincham Market House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Altrincham Market House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Michelin-starred restaurants, the problems that tourists present tend to be more abstract. Bains is dismayed by diners who collect Michelin-starred meals like \u201cfootball cards. Do you appreciate it? Are you mindful of what you\u2019re eating?\u201d</p> <p>Others are conflicted about serving dishes made famous by MasterChef, Great British Menu or even Instagram, which a significant minority of diners will travel hundreds of miles to taste. Birmingham\u2019s Glynn Purnell told Restaurant magazine: \u201cSometimes you feel like Elton John must when people ask him to sing Rocket Man. There is a lot more to his work, but some people are only interested in the hits.\u201d</p> <p>Purnell still serves his GBM-winning burnt English egg surprise. Like Bains, who finally took his winning dish off in 2018, it felt churlish to refuse to \u2013 and daft, financially. \u201cI was taking \u00a365,000 a year on it. Have two eggs!\u201d laughs Bains.</p> <p>A lingering misconception that a Michelin star signifies gilded, old-school luxury can also be an issue. Restaurant Sat Bains is on a suburban croft under a flyover. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t come down unless you were going dogging,\u201d Bains says. \u201cOne guy left because there\u2019s a pylon nearby. I can\u2019t move it, chief.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/13/we-are-a-working-class-two-star-restaurant-sat-bains\">Sat Bains: 'We are a working-class two Michelin-star restaurant'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Irish restaurant Bon App\u00e9tit closed its Michelin-starred fine-dining arm in 2014 for similar reasons. \u201c[Michelin] is not about amuse bouches, dickie bows, cloches and all of that.

It is not an extraordinary number for a top-end restaurant. At one time, Copenhagen\u2019s Noma was fielding 100,000 emails a month. But it illustrates how, in an increasingly globalised world, hot restaurants and bars have become stand-alone tourist destinations \u2013 sites of pilgrimage for national and international food obsessives. When many restaurants are struggling to survive, that clamour for tables is a nice problem to have. But, particularly in smaller, neighbourhood venues, such acclaim can be disruptive. It also puts pressure on chefs who, suddenly, find themselves stars of the show. A recent University of Lleida study, published in the journal Intangible Capital, identified a group of food tourists who travel explicitly to eat at Michelin-starred restaurants. They want to meet the chef, visit the kitchen and love the \u201cstatus\u201d this confers on them. Unabashed show-offs, the majority relay all of this on social media. Bains handles this by remaining \u201cauthentic\u201d. \u201cIf people save to come here, it\u2019d be rude for me not to say hello. It\u2019s called hospitality. But I\u2019m a working chef. By 11.30pm on Saturday night, I\u2019m drained. I\u2019ve spilled shit over my jacket. I might be bollocking someone. It\u2019s a working kitchen. I hope you enjoyed yourself. Here\u2019s a menu. But I don\u2019t pretend to be a host. I\u2019m a chef.\u201d Bains\u2019s profile built gradually, between 2003 and 2011, as he accumulated stars and won the 2007 Great British Menu with his slow-cooked duck egg, ham and pea sorbet: \u201cThat egg filled our restaurant for a year.\u201d But for others, sudden attention can be bewildering. When the Lima-born chef Jose Luis de Cossio opened Paiche in Portland, Oregon, he intended it to be an affordable, neighbourhood breakfast-lunch joint in Lair Hill, a part of the city described by Portland Monthly as a \u201cfoodie desert\u201d. De Cossio had worked in celebrated restaurants but, by 2016, he wanted to do something less intense to make time for his family and his other great love, surfing. Immediately, Paiche went stratospheric. Named restaurant of the year in the Willamette Week, trend-hunting foodies flocked from across Portland to try the ceviche. Queues grew, as did customer expectations. De Cossio felt compelled to open for dinner, and gussy-up the menu. Prices rose accordingly. \u201cI was putting too much luxury there. Paying $32 for a grouper from Tokyo, it\u2019s not sustainable. I think the press made me feel like a false hero, and it affected my ego \u2013 a chef\u2019s worst enemy. I should never have changed for recognition.\u201d Soon de Cossio was grumbling about the \u201cnarrow customer\u201d his 32-seat restaurant was attracting. \u201cI don\u2019t want to focus on fine dining. I don\u2019t want to be a superstar chef in town,\u201d he told Willamette Week. Radically, in 2017, he abandoned dinner service, turned Paiche vegan and began serving $6 dishes. \u201cWhy not make a humble place, man?\u201d the 46-year-old asks. Paiche closed late in 2018 (\u201cI need a break, new air to build my energy\u201d), but: \u201cI really love that, at the last, it was counter-service and open to people who have a lower budget.\u201d Paiche is not alone in being overwhelmed by a crowd. From the Kernel brewery, in London, which closed its brew-tap after Bermondsey\u2019s \u201cbeer mile\u201d became wildly popular, to Raan Jay Fai, a backstreet kitchen in Bangkok that gained a Michelin star, many have found it to be logistically problematic. Raan Jay Fai had to drop complex dishes to cope with an influx of 200 diners a day. \u201cI wish I could give the star back,\u201d the exhausted 72-year-old chef-owner, Supinya Junsuta, told reporters. A high demand for seats can damage your reputation, too. In no-bookings venues, regulars get upset they can no longer get in easily, while those travelling for hours to eat there complain about queues. When the award-winning Altrincham Market House food hub opened in 2014, the co-owner Nick Johnson had to hold his nerve and ignore any critical TripAdvisor reviews. \u201cI don\u2019t put great store in TripAdvisor because you don\u2019t know who it is has left that review and you can\u2019t trust their value judgments,\u201d he says. \u201cI would no sooner ask my father where to eat than I would an alsatian dog, but he\u2019s allowed to leave a TripAdvisor review \u2013 therefore it has no value.\u201d Market House relies on an element of chaos for its \u201cenergy\u201d, Johnson insists. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody. But if you enjoy busy-ness and that atmosphere, you\u2019ll tough it out.\u201d Similarly, he thinks local people adapted. \u201cYou want busy places in your community. The locals know when it\u2019s busiest and work around that.\u201d John Pybus is a more interventionist operator. Landlord of the Blue Bell, one of tourist-mobbed York\u2019s most famous pubs, he loves \u201cnice, Camra-type\u201d (Campaign for Real Ale) visitors, but won\u2019t serve the large gangs of \u201cshitfaced, rowdy knobheads\u201d that \u201cmake the city centre a bit of a no-go area on Saturday afternoons\u201d. Signs outside the pub state: no stags, no hens, no groups. Policing that, says Pybus, is an inexact science: \u201cIf it\u2019s Tuesday afternoon and I\u2019ve got 10 70-year-old blokes in reminiscing, fine. If it\u2019s Saturday and it\u2019s three lads in fancy dress, you\u2019re a group.\u201d But in a city centre where, Pybus claims, some older people don\u2019t feel safe at weekends, he thinks it is \u201cimperative we have local pubs run by and for local people, where those people take precedence. The tourists who come in appreciate that sense of community.\u201d At Michelin-starred restaurants, the problems that tourists present tend to be more abstract. Bains is dismayed by diners who collect Michelin-starred meals like \u201cfootball cards. Do you appreciate it? Are you mindful of what you\u2019re eating?\u201d Others are conflicted about serving dishes made famous by MasterChef, Great British Menu or even Instagram, which a significant minority of diners will travel hundreds of miles to taste. Birmingham\u2019s Glynn Purnell told Restaurant magazine: \u201cSometimes you feel like Elton John must when people ask him to sing Rocket Man. There is a lot more to his work, but some people are only interested in the hits.\u201d Purnell still serves his GBM-winning burnt English egg surprise. Like Bains, who finally took his winning dish off in 2018, it felt churlish to refuse to \u2013 and daft, financially. \u201cI was taking \u00a365,000 a year on it. Have two eggs!\u201d laughs Bains. A lingering misconception that a Michelin star signifies gilded, old-school luxury can also be an issue. Restaurant Sat Bains is on a suburban croft under a flyover. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t come down unless you were going dogging,\u201d Bains says. \u201cOne guy left because there\u2019s a pylon nearby. I can\u2019t move it, chief.\u201d The Irish restaurant Bon App\u00e9tit closed its Michelin-starred fine-dining arm in 2014 for similar reasons. \u201c[Michelin] is not about amuse bouches, dickie bows, cloches and all of that. But people expect that and we\u2019ve had comments over the years about the table linen, plates, staff hairstyles. It\u2019s frustrating trying to live up to people\u2019s inaccurate expectations,\u201d the chef-owner, Oliver Dunne, told the Irish Independent. Such expectations do not come higher than when you have been named the world\u2019s best restaurant, as the Black Swan, in Olstead, North Yorkshire, was in 2017 by TripAdvisor. \u201cThere have been people who\u2019re like: \u2018We\u2019ve been to Noma and Eleven Madison Park and we don\u2019t think you compare.\u2019 Well \u2026 fine. It\u2019s a tiny pub. We never claimed to be the world\u2019s best,\u201d says chef and co-owner Tommy Banks. Ultimately, Banks could only react with bluff northern humour: \u201cPeople were flying from America to eat here, spending thousands. It\u2019s incredibly humbling, but I\u2019d joke: \u2018Frankly, it\u2019s not worth that.\u2019\u201d When the foodie tourists descend, a little laughter \u2013 and perspective \u2013 goes a long way.",

      "body": "<p>The longtime anti-tax activist and prominent Trump supporter Grover Norquist once said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d You don\u2019t have to listen hard to hear the water running.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/22/senate-republicans-shutdown-bill-trump-plan\">government shutdown</a> enters its second month, we are witnessing an unprecedented effort by the administration to starve out federal employees, decimate the agencies we compose, and undermine the very foundation of the civil service. Unprecedented \u2013 but not unexpected.</p> <p>From Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, to his budget blueprint in 2017 proposing the elimination of 19 federal agencies ranging from the Chemical Safety Board to the National Endowment for the Arts, the president has been gunning for the federal sector for years. He implemented a federal hiring freeze in the first days of his term. Following that with a $1.5tn tax cut, Trump and congressional Republicans set the stage for budget shortfalls \u2013 and their attendant cuts to services \u2013 for years to come.</p> <p>The president was less effective in his second year. Last summer, he aimed to gut what\u2019s left of federal labor protections with three executive orders that were later largely struck down by the courts. These orders were paired with a proposal to eliminate or hollow out several agencies, consistent with the vision of the small-government fundamentalists that surround Trump. But, like the executive orders, Trump\u2019s proposal remains only a proposal, without legislative support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/20/government-shutdown-trump-tax-cuts-trumponomics\">The shutdown has exposed Trumponomics for what it is: a disaster | Robert Reich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump appears to see the shutdown as his opportunity to press on, outside of pesky legal constraints, to win the political fight against \u201cbig government\u201d. Last week, the Daily Caller ran <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/14/smoke-out-resistance/\">a piece</a> from an anonymous \u201csenior official in the Trump administration\u201d that called on the president to continue the shutdown for \u201ca very long time\u201d in order to slash the federal workforce by \u201csmoking out the resistance\u201d. A long shutdown, the official argued, could demonstrate \u201cthat government is better when smaller\u201d.</p> <p>Lest anyone get the impression that this \u201csenior official\u201d couldn\u2019t get a hearing for this strategy with their boss, Trump shared the editorial with his 57 million Twitter followers.</p> <p>Many federal workers are still in denial. Sure, we\u2019re angry \u2013 especially those of us not getting paid. But there\u2019s little sense that there\u2019s anything we can do. In today\u2019s political context, calling our congressional representatives is understood to be even less effective than it\u2019s ever been. The painful and demoralizing truth for us federal workers is that we\u2019ve never had great friends in Congress, no matter how many times we\u2019ve called.</p> <p>Since the 1970s, the erosion of the public sector has been overseen by both parties (one, undeniably, more enthusiastic than the other). And even during the prior decades, when the federal sector was expanding, political leaders of both parties were careful to carve out and preserve exceptions to the rights of public employees. To this day, it is not only illegal for federal workers to strike, but, according to the same statute, it is illegal for us to even assert the right to strike. The dubious constitutionality of such a clause aside, it has had its intended effect. Our mere discussion of a federal strike \u2013 to say nothing of others\u2019 explicit <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/we-work-for-the-federal-government-and-its-time-to-stri-1831879716\">endorsement</a> of such an action \u2013 compels us to author opinions anonymously.</p> <p>Leaving aside the strike question, one must understand that federal workers are bullied even when it comes to the most elementary political activity. Consider the Hatch Act, which prohibits lobbying or partisan electoral activity on the clock. The act\u2019s reasonable restrictions are designed to guard against graft, but are being weaponized by agency bosses against any political speech. Consider last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://tyt.com/stories/4vZLCHuQrYE4uKagy0oyMA/22Bbi27G7kYpo83nn93O0I\">internal email to FAA employees</a>, which conflates at-work partisan activity with \u201cremarks made in any forum\u201d.</p> <p>Under such a vindictive administration as this one, we expect such memos of intimidation to become commonplace anytime our collective indignation starts to outweigh our fears. This tactic by management of overstating the restrictions of the Hatch Act works in a particularly insidious way. A shocking number of federal employees believe that basic constitutional protections do not apply to themselves.</p> <p>So those calling for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/opinion/its-time-for-tsa-workers-to-strike.html\">a TSA strike</a> or <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/01/federal-workers-government-shutdown-union-power\">French-style mass pickets</a> will forgive us for treading lightly while some of our colleagues believe their jobs to be at risk for far less. But the authors\u2019 points are well-taken. The truth is that without a pushback from organized labor, more and more of the civil service continues to face ever deeper cuts. The question we should be asking is not whether federal workers will, can or should strike. There\u2019s a different question, more immediately relevant to all of organized labor.</p> <p>How can federal workers and the jobs that we do \u2013 from protecting health and the environment to collecting taxes to maintaining public infrastructure and security \u2013 become central commitments of our society again? How can the broader labor movement start to see the modest first steps of rank and file federal workers as the necessary next steps toward defending the public sector from the privatizers and the deregulators?</p> <p>Tuesday night, at a church kitchen in Montclair, New Jersey, federal workers and their families gathered for a <a href=\"https://www.northjersey.com/picture-gallery/news/essex/montclair/2019/01/23/shutdown-social-federal-workers-montclair-tonis-kitchen/2655815002/\">free dinner</a> and groceries donated by local businesses and supporters. This Friday, in lower Manhattan, a small union local that represents federal workers who are not furloughed will be hosting <a href=\"https://fedworkersnyc.org/2019/01/18/january-25-indoor-rally-and-solidarity-event/\">a similar event</a> for the benefit of those who are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/government-shutdown-republicans-trump-truth\">Republicans\u2019 lack of alarm over the shutdown reveals a disturbing truth | Ross Barkan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Small, morale-boosting events like these may not rise to the level necessary to force an end to the shutdown. Nevertheless, they demonstrate a craving for the kind of solidarity that might begin to tip the balance in our favor. So organized labor could support such efforts where they emerge, or help get them going in locations with concentrations of federal staff.</p> <p>Such solidarity, of course, must be a two-way street and federal workers can do our part by, for example, refusing to scab on striking teachers such as Denver public schools have asked local feds <a href=\"https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/denver-public-schools-recruits-workers-affected-by-government-shutdown-as-substitutes-ahead-of-potential-strike/73-be76571b-ada7-4dba-b173-98f279aed49d\">to do</a>. In truth, we have a lot to learn from such teachers and, like the rest of the country, we are taking notes.</p> <p>But more than anything else, federal workers need solidarity from the broader labor movement: actual material support while we are locked out or forced to work without pay can help bring us to our feet. We need all unions to defend the role of the public sector and the integrity of civil service against small government fanatics. And we need political repression and intimidation in federal agencies to be understood as a threat to all of labor.</p> <p>If you want to see federal workers run, you can offer a hand, help get us on to our feet and walk with us.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The longtime anti-tax activist and prominent Trump supporter Grover Norquist once said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d You don\u2019t have to listen hard to hear the water running. As the government shutdown enters its second month, we are witnessing an unprecedented effort by the administration to starve out federal employees, decimate the agencies we compose, and undermine the very foundation of the civil service. Unprecedented \u2013 but not unexpected. From Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, to his budget blueprint in 2017 proposing the elimination of 19 federal agencies ranging from the Chemical Safety Board to the National Endowment for the Arts, the president has been gunning for the federal sector for years. He implemented a federal hiring freeze in the first days of his term. Following that with a $1.5tn tax cut, Trump and congressional Republicans set the stage for budget shortfalls \u2013 and their attendant cuts to services \u2013 for years to come. The president was less effective in his second year. Last summer, he aimed to gut what\u2019s left of federal labor protections with three executive orders that were later largely struck down by the courts. These orders were paired with a proposal to eliminate or hollow out several agencies, consistent with the vision of the small-government fundamentalists that surround Trump. But, like the executive orders, Trump\u2019s proposal remains only a proposal, without legislative support. Trump appears to see the shutdown as his opportunity to press on, outside of pesky legal constraints, to win the political fight against \u201cbig government\u201d. Last week, the Daily Caller ran a piece from an anonymous \u201csenior official in the Trump administration\u201d that called on the president to continue the shutdown for \u201ca very long time\u201d in order to slash the federal workforce by \u201csmoking out the resistance\u201d. A long shutdown, the official argued, could demonstrate \u201cthat government is better when smaller\u201d. Lest anyone get the impression that this \u201csenior official\u201d couldn\u2019t get a hearing for this strategy with their boss, Trump shared the editorial with his 57 million Twitter followers. Many federal workers are still in denial. Sure, we\u2019re angry \u2013 especially those of us not getting paid. But there\u2019s little sense that there\u2019s anything we can do. In today\u2019s political context, calling our congressional representatives is understood to be even less effective than it\u2019s ever been. The painful and demoralizing truth for us federal workers is that we\u2019ve never had great friends in Congress, no matter how many times we\u2019ve called. Since the 1970s, the erosion of the public sector has been overseen by both parties (one, undeniably, more enthusiastic than the other). And even during the prior decades, when the federal sector was expanding, political leaders of both parties were careful to carve out and preserve exceptions to the rights of public employees. To this day, it is not only illegal for federal workers to strike, but, according to the same statute, it is illegal for us to even assert the right to strike. The dubious constitutionality of such a clause aside, it has had its intended effect. Our mere discussion of a federal strike \u2013 to say nothing of others\u2019 explicit endorsement of such an action \u2013 compels us to author opinions anonymously. Leaving aside the strike question, one must understand that federal workers are bullied even when it comes to the most elementary political activity. Consider the Hatch Act, which prohibits lobbying or partisan electoral activity on the clock. The act\u2019s reasonable restrictions are designed to guard against graft, but are being weaponized by agency bosses against any political speech. Consider last week\u2019s internal email to FAA employees, which conflates at-work partisan activity with \u201cremarks made in any forum\u201d. Under such a vindictive administration as this one, we expect such memos of intimidation to become commonplace anytime our collective indignation starts to outweigh our fears. This tactic by management of overstating the restrictions of the Hatch Act works in a particularly insidious way. A shocking number of federal employees believe that basic constitutional protections do not apply to themselves. So those calling for a TSA strike or French-style mass pickets will forgive us for treading lightly while some of our colleagues believe their jobs to be at risk for far less. But the authors\u2019 points are well-taken. The truth is that without a pushback from organized labor, more and more of the civil service continues to face ever deeper cuts. The question we should be asking is not whether federal workers will, can or should strike. There\u2019s a different question, more immediately relevant to all of organized labor. How can federal workers and the jobs that we do \u2013 from protecting health and the environment to collecting taxes to maintaining public infrastructure and security \u2013 become central commitments of our society again? How can the broader labor movement start to see the modest first steps of rank and file federal workers as the necessary next steps toward defending the public sector from the privatizers and the deregulators? Tuesday night, at a church kitchen in Montclair, New Jersey, federal workers and their families gathered for a free dinner and groceries donated by local businesses and supporters. This Friday, in lower Manhattan, a small union local that represents federal workers who are not furloughed will be hosting a similar event for the benefit of those who are. Small, morale-boosting events like these may not rise to the level necessary to force an end to the shutdown. Nevertheless, they demonstrate a craving for the kind of solidarity that might begin to tip the balance in our favor. So organized labor could support such efforts where they emerge, or help get them going in locations with concentrations of federal staff. Such solidarity, of course, must be a two-way street and federal workers can do our part by, for example, refusing to scab on striking teachers such as Denver public schools have asked local feds to do. In truth, we have a lot to learn from such teachers and, like the rest of the country, we are taking notes. But more than anything else, federal workers need solidarity from the broader labor movement: actual material support while we are locked out or forced to work without pay can help bring us to our feet. We need all unions to defend the role of the public sector and the integrity of civil service against small government fanatics. And we need political repression and intimidation in federal agencies to be understood as a threat to all of labor. If you want to see federal workers run, you can offer a hand, help get us on to our feet and walk with us.",

Simple parts of the daily routine, yet also signs of why the club that wouldn\u2019t die \u2013 as \u201cAccie\u201d describe themselves \u2013 are thriving, setting an example and dismantling a tired joke. \u201cWe still get the jibes about the milk advert,\u201d the manager, John Coleman, says. \u201cYou can let it annoy you or embrace the fact it is one of the things that made us famous. We are a unique club. The name is famous around the world. We are the archetypal underdog. If you wanted a David and Goliath you would say Man United and it would always be Accrington Stanley. As of late, we are not that. We are trying to get away from that.\u201d A second FA Cup fourth-round appearance in three seasons and a remarkable title triumph in between illustrates the progress made. \u201cOh I don\u2019t want that to be the end,\u201d adds Coleman on winning League Two last year. \u201cYou should always strive to be better.\u201d Preparations are under way for Saturday\u2019s visit of Derby on the morning the Guardian takes a look behind the scenes at the Wham Stadium. A deal is being struck to hire digital advertising screens to go around the perimeter of the pitch. They will generate extra revenue on top of the \u00a3150,000 for being live on BT Sport and will be removed on Sunday. There is a seating issue to resolve. Frank Lampard has more backroom staff than Accrington have seats in the away dugout. And space must be kept available for paramedics. Derby\u2019s technical area will be a squeeze but many of their 2,600 supporters, their portion of a capacity 5,400 crowd, will be in comparative luxury in the new Eric Whalley Stand. Built for \u00a31.2m and part of an ongoing stadium redevelopment that has brought new floodlights, concourses, drainage, pitch, power and water supply (\u00a3800,000 is also being spent on the Clayton Road end), it will be fully open and operational for the first time against Derby. Negotiations are taking place over two transfers. Agents\u2019 demands are relayed across the directors\u2019 lounge to Coleman, who instantly responds with lower counter-offers.

But what was surprising to me was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-players-extremely-difficult-to-motivate-arsenal\" title=\"\">what Sarri had to say afterwards</a>: criticising his players\u2019 \u201cmental approach\u201d, saying Arsenal were \u201cfar more determined than we were\u201d and most eye-catchingly suggesting Chelsea\u2019s squad is \u201cextremely difficult to motivate\u201d. More recently Sarri made it clear that he had said something similar in the dressing room. \u201cWhy keep it a secret?\u201d he asked. \u201cI want to be direct with them in private and in public.\u201d But I think this is always dangerous ground for a coach to tread, especially so early in his tenure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b8e62d1b-d729-4cf1-aa17-39775b3f9e7d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B9UzmSnctkI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I think public criticism of players can go one of two ways: either the players will want to raise a proverbial middle finger at their manager and prove them wrong, or the squad will go within themselves and performances will deteriorate. I do not have managerial experience but I think if a manager wants to get a reaction they are better off speaking to players privately. What we\u2019ve seen in the recent past is that public criticism of players just doesn\u2019t work. Think of Marcus Rashford, Luke Shaw and Paul Pogba at Manchester United under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Players are under enough pressure to perform from fans and the media without a manager complicating matters further in public. Top players will not let it affect them too much but I know it is not something they appreciate.</p> \n<p>After all, Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, had a golden rule never to criticise his players in public despite being famously known to give \u201chairdryer treatments\u201d in private. This approach in protecting his players publicly clearly worked for Ferguson and brought him unprecedented success and the loyalty of his players. I often question why so many modern managers of top clubs depart from this approach.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/24/gonzalo-higuain-quiz-chelsea-striker-football\">Gonzalo Higua\u00edn quiz: how well do you know Chelsea's new striker?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Sarri to go down this path at Chelsea is even more surprising. The Blues have had three very strong characters in the dugout over the past four seasons: Mourinho, Antonio Conte and now Sarri. Of those managers, Mourinho eventually left in a huff, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/17/jose-mourinho-chelsea-michael-emenalo-palpable-tensions\" title=\"\">players becoming fed up with his antics</a>. Conte also left in a huff, amid what seemed to be a sharp contrast to the title\u2011winning togetherness in his previous season. This is the situation Sarri walked into in the summer, and he has got to tread very carefully or it might end as badly for him as it did for his predecessors. And both Mourinho and Conte had won the league title before their relationship with the players started to slide.</p> \n<p>Into this tricky period, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/23/gonzalo-higuain-joins-chelsea-from-juventus-alvaro-morata\" title=\"\">Chelsea have added Gonzalo Higua\u00edn</a>. The Argentinian scored a lot of goals under Sarri at Napoli, and the expectation will be that he will do the same at Chelsea. His arrival will free Eden Hazard to move away from the false nine position with which he\u2019s clearly dissatisfied.</p> \n<p>The Belgian enjoys playing with forwards who hold the ball up and bring him into play, allowing him to make those dashing runs infield from the left. It could be that this is the effect Sarri is hoping Higua\u00edn\u2019s arrival will have, but perhaps this is another sign that he is a manager who, in the end, prefers to play in a familiar way with familiar players.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db365e3a4aafbdf817444fbd8a907539247a7269\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db365e3a4aafbdf817444fbd8a907539247a7269/0_285_4277_2566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorginho, left, is not having the kind of impact which would justify forcing N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 out of his preferred role.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorginho, left, is not having the kind of impact which would justify forcing N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 out of his preferred role.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many managers bring players they have previously worked with into a new club \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t always mean they will continue to enjoy success together. Jorginho was the first player to follow Sarri to Chelsea from Napoli, and for a few weeks he seemed to have made the transition seamlessly. But it didn\u2019t take very long for teams to suss out that if you press Jorginho you can stop Chelsea\u2019s attacking supply. Jorginho, with no assists to his name, is not having the kind of impact that would justify forcing Kant\u00e9 out of his preferred role. Kant\u00e9 is the engine of the Chelsea team, as he was in their most recent title-winning season and Leicester\u2019s before that, not to mention the World Cup-winning France side.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For a new manager to come in and move Kant\u00e9 is the equivalent of someone taking over from Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham and shifting Harry Kane to the wing to make space for a player from his previous club. Kant\u00e9 hasn\u2019t spoken out about any frustration he might be feeling \u2013 like Hazard did, for example, when asked to play as a false nine by Conte \u2013 but despite being a humble, unassuming guy he still has a massive impact on the team. Maybe Sarri, famed for his attacking style, doesn\u2019t necessarily value the unglamorous work that Kant\u00e9 does \u2013 breaking up play, stopping counterattacks \u2013 as much as other managers have. But hopefully Sarri can look at the attributes of players such as Kant\u00e9 and play them in their preferred roles, in which they have enjoyed success with Chelsea in the past.</p>",

Top players will not let it affect them too much but I know it is not something they appreciate. After all, Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, had a golden rule never to criticise his players in public despite being famously known to give \u201chairdryer treatments\u201d in private. This approach in protecting his players publicly clearly worked for Ferguson and brought him unprecedented success and the loyalty of his players. I often question why so many modern managers of top clubs depart from this approach. For Sarri to go down this path at Chelsea is even more surprising. The Blues have had three very strong characters in the dugout over the past four seasons: Mourinho, Antonio Conte and now Sarri. Of those managers, Mourinho eventually left in a huff, the players becoming fed up with his antics. Conte also left in a huff, amid what seemed to be a sharp contrast to the title\u2011winning togetherness in his previous season. This is the situation Sarri walked into in the summer, and he has got to tread very carefully or it might end as badly for him as it did for his predecessors. And both Mourinho and Conte had won the league title before their relationship with the players started to slide. Into this tricky period, Chelsea have added Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. The Argentinian scored a lot of goals under Sarri at Napoli, and the expectation will be that he will do the same at Chelsea. His arrival will free Eden Hazard to move away from the false nine position with which he\u2019s clearly dissatisfied. The Belgian enjoys playing with forwards who hold the ball up and bring him into play, allowing him to make those dashing runs infield from the left. It could be that this is the effect Sarri is hoping Higua\u00edn\u2019s arrival will have, but perhaps this is another sign that he is a manager who, in the end, prefers to play in a familiar way with familiar players. Many managers bring players they have previously worked with into a new club \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t always mean they will continue to enjoy success together. Jorginho was the first player to follow Sarri to Chelsea from Napoli, and for a few weeks he seemed to have made the transition seamlessly. But it didn\u2019t take very long for teams to suss out that if you press Jorginho you can stop Chelsea\u2019s attacking supply. Jorginho, with no assists to his name, is not having the kind of impact that would justify forcing Kant\u00e9 out of his preferred role. Kant\u00e9 is the engine of the Chelsea team, as he was in their most recent title-winning season and Leicester\u2019s before that, not to mention the World Cup-winning France side. For a new manager to come in and move Kant\u00e9 is the equivalent of someone taking over from Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham and shifting Harry Kane to the wing to make space for a player from his previous club. Kant\u00e9 hasn\u2019t spoken out about any frustration he might be feeling \u2013 like Hazard did, for example, when asked to play as a false nine by Conte \u2013 but despite being a humble, unassuming guy he still has a massive impact on the team. Maybe Sarri, famed for his attacking style, doesn\u2019t necessarily value the unglamorous work that Kant\u00e9 does \u2013 breaking up play, stopping counterattacks \u2013 as much as other managers have. But hopefully Sarri can look at the attributes of players such as Kant\u00e9 and play them in their preferred roles, in which they have enjoyed success with Chelsea in the past.",

There, Mekas borrowed money and bought his first Bolex 16mm movie camera. His film-making days had begun.</p> <p>But they weren\u2019t conventional films. Mekas eschewed narrative and plot. He didn\u2019t have time for the artifice of Hollywood. Why did every scene have to connect to every other from start to finish? And yet there was something traditional in his film-making. He was always interested in capturing those magical moments that make up a life, moments at once prosaic and transcendent. His films often look like home movies \u2013 Proustian scraps of memories, children smiling, a day at the seaside, revisiting Lithuania, home cooking, walking through New York. Sometimes footage is speeded up so it becomes dizzying, sometimes it\u2019s slowed down.

By 1958, Mekas was writing a film column for the Village Voice.

Here, any number of legendary \u2013 or soon to be legendary \u2013 artists met to watch endless films in which nothing happened, while discussing cultural possibilities.

He has little time for those who regard Warhol as merely a self-publicist. He didn\u2019t seek out fame, says Mekas \u2013 it was the other way round.</p> <p>\u201cThe newspapers began to attack him and it created a kind of fame. Then the society around him began to seek him out. Then everybody began to write and say, \u2018Andy is only interested in those fake people, he only wants fame.\u2019 But it was the reverse . He was never interested in them and, the more he ignored them, the more they flocked to him.

      "bodyText": "Jonas Mekas tells me he\u2019s 27 years old. Strictly speaking, he\u2019s 95, but the avant garde film-maker, poet, critic and philosopher decided 68 years ago that he was sticking at 27. \u201cAfter 27, people begin to become old, according to Melville,\u201d he says. \u201cThey look back and repeat. After 27, you begin to think, \u2018Is this the right way to do it?\u2019 You think twice. Before that, you say, \u2018Fuck you, I don\u2019t care. I just do it.\u2019\u201d Is he still in his \u201cFuck you\u201d period? \u201cYes I am. When I came to New York I was 27. I was very angry about what I had lost before 27. I always blamed the \u2018civilisation\u2019 that threw me out of my home.\u201d Mekas still has a thick European accent. He grew up in a small village in northern Lithuania called Semeni\u0161kiai \u2013 he calls it a paradise \u201cwhere nothing happened then suddenly everything happened\u201d. He lost paradise when the Soviets invaded in 1940. That is when he took his first photograph, aged 17. A soldier snatched his camera and confiscated the film. A year later, the Germans invaded. Mekas joined the resistance, typing out news bulletins sourced from BBC broadcasts and distributing them clandestinely. One day, his typewriter went missing and he feared he\u2019d been found out. He and his brother Adolfus fled Lithuania in 1944, but were stopped on a train in Germany and imprisoned in a Nazi labour camp in Hamburg for eight months. The brothers escaped but were caught and kept until 1946 in displaced persons\u2019 camps. Eventually, they emigrated to America, settling in Brooklyn, New York. There, Mekas borrowed money and bought his first Bolex 16mm movie camera. His film-making days had begun. But they weren\u2019t conventional films. Mekas eschewed narrative and plot. He didn\u2019t have time for the artifice of Hollywood. Why did every scene have to connect to every other from start to finish? And yet there was something traditional in his film-making. He was always interested in capturing those magical moments that make up a life, moments at once prosaic and transcendent. His films often look like home movies \u2013 Proustian scraps of memories, children smiling, a day at the seaside, revisiting Lithuania, home cooking, walking through New York. Sometimes footage is speeded up so it becomes dizzying, sometimes it\u2019s slowed down. The camera rarely stops: one continuous shot and that\u2019s that. Lost, Lost, Lost \u2013 made in 1976 \u2013 is a gorgeous three-hour memoir about the move from Lithuania to New York. The film conveys his loss, loneliness, bewilderment \u2013 and ultimately his sense of rapture at his new homeland. It is composed of hundreds, if not thousands, of disconnected images, accompanied by Mekas in a voiceover that is both lyrical and stumbling staccato: \u201cI was there with my camera to record conflicting passions. I was there, the chronicler, the diarist. I recorded it all. And I don\u2019t know \u2013 am I singing or am I crying?\u201d It is more prose-poem than conventional voiceover and, as with all his work, it is accompanied by an incredibly diverse soundtrack, ranging from Lithuanian folk to Jewish prayer, Billie Holiday to avant-garde jazz. Much of the music was taken straight from the radio. Occasionally, Mekas employed actors. His adaptation of the Kenneth H Brown play The Brig, a brutal depiction of life in a Marine Corps jail, was so realistic it won first prize in the documentary section of the 1964 Venice film festival. We meet at the hotel where he is staying, near Bloomsbury in the heart of literary London. Mekas suggests we sit at a table at the back of the lounge, where it is quiet. His son Sebastian, with whom he lives, walks over and says he has been told this table is reserved for management meetings. But Mekas isn\u2019t having any of it. He has spent a lifetime pushing back at authority. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should go,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cThe manager should be happy we are sitting here.\u201d Mekas could almost pass as a painter-decorator. He is wearing his trademark blue cotton jacket splodged with white paint, paired with a flat cap. His face is dotted with liver spots and when he smiles \u2013 which he does a lot \u2013 his blue eyes narrow to slits. He is as busy as ever. He has come to Britain to promote a book of his conversations with film-makers, but is already talking about his next project, an anthology of his diaries. And he\u2019s as contrary as ever. Asked what attracted him to the avant garde, he takes issue with the term. \u201cThere is nothing avant garde about what I have done and what I am doing.\u201d He simply says he has spent his life doing what had to be done. By the time Mekas got to America in 1949, he was not interested in filming anything dark or bleak. He had already witnessed too much hell. He wanted to film the stuff that made life worth living. In 1954, he and Adolfus founded Film Culture, a magazine that explored underground cinema. By 1958, Mekas was writing a film column for the Village Voice. In the early 1960s, he co-founded what eventually became Anthology Film Archives, one of the world\u2019s largest repositories of avant-garde film. Perhaps most importantly, he opened up his loft to friends and fellow travellers in the avant garde. Here, any number of legendary \u2013 or soon to be legendary \u2013 artists met to watch endless films in which nothing happened, while discussing cultural possibilities. These included Andy Warhol, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Kenneth Anger, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs. (Although he was firmly rooted in the counterculture, he had many establishment friends. Mekas taught the children of John and Jackie Kennedy to make films.) It was at Mekas\u2019s apartment that Warhol first became interested in film-making. \u201cIn my loft,\u201d he says, \u201cAndy met film-makers and was inspired by them. That\u2019s where he got the bug. My loft was a gathering space for musicians, poets, film-makers.\u201d Mekas helped Warhol shoot Empire, an eight-hour, slow-motion film of an unchanging view of the Empire State Building. He has little time for those who regard Warhol as merely a self-publicist. He didn\u2019t seek out fame, says Mekas \u2013 it was the other way round. \u201cThe newspapers began to attack him and it created a kind of fame. Then the society around him began to seek him out.

He\u2019d tell you that life is like an apple then put his hand in his pocket and pull one out to illustrate the point.\u201d Although Mekas has devoted his life to film, he once famously said: \u201cShoot all scriptwriters and we may yet have a rebirth of American cinema.\u201d As far as he was concerned, scriptwriters were the enemy of spontaneity, the authors of control. Mekas championed such brilliant film-makers as Roberto Rossellini in Italy and John Cassavetes in the US, who made movies that looked as if they were sticking their camera in front of reality and letting it roll. His book of interviews with film-makers makes for remarkable reading. At times, he sounds like a headmaster calling pupils into his office to reprimand them for selling out or having one eye on the Hollywood leviathan. He more or less tells Susan Sontag she should stick to writing, accuses Agn\u00e8s Varda of making an \u201cescapist\u201d film that sides with with \u201ccapitalistic cinema\u201d, and asks Robert Downey senior: \u201cWhy do you have to resort to vulgarity?\u201d Mekas smiles when I mention the interviews. He says he might have been critical, but he never interviewed anybody he did not admire. Nor did he always enjoy speaking his mind. \u201cIt was not easy for me to tell Susan Sontag that, particularly knowing how much she thought of herself as a film-maker. But we were friends and remained friends.\u201d Mekas also championed the taboo.

Mekas and two others were found guilty of showing an obscene motion picture and given a suspended sentence. In recent years, he says, his taste has become a little more conservative: \u201cI read very little that was not written before the 13th century.\u201d When push comes to shove, he prefers going back to the third century and Saint Jerome, when society was more in touch with the the spiritual. Everything these days, he says, is about industry and productivity. \u201cI\u2019m now trying to get back what the civilisation took away from humanity.

I am firmly of the opinion that Australia\u2019s attack (especially after seeing Richardson today) will have plenty of pace bowling power heading into the Ashes. My only doubt is whether they have the patience to winkle out England with a ball that will behave quite differently to the Kookaburra.

Copes performed at The Grade Cricketer live show last night (with the OBO\u2019s own Sam Perry) and said that his own hopes of an Ashes recall are far from dead. Nor should they be, either. We learned the hard way in 2015 how an unbalanced attack in England can go around and around. They need an old-fashioned seamer and Copeland has to be in that conversation alongside Worrall, Siddle and Sayers. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/7Cricket/status/1088257172536844288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Get to know more about Kurtis Patterson as he chats to h\u0336i\u0336s\u0336 \u0336n\u0336u\u0336m\u0336b\u0336e\u0336r\u0336 \u0336o\u0336n\u0336e\u0336 \u0336f\u0336a\u0336n\u0336 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/copes9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@copes9</a> \ud83d\ude05 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUSvSL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AUSvSL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ViHnqZIYAB\">pic.twitter.com/ViHnqZIYAB</a></p>&mdash; #7Cricket (@7Cricket) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/7Cricket/status/1088257172536844288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4920bbe4b024f0efead400\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-24T02:21:29.898Z\">2.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The track. </strong>Yes, that looks a bit green.

The good news for the players is that the stinging heat of yesterday has not been repeated for the opening afternoon of this two Test series, the temperature currently 30 degrees, with a tiny bit of cloud cover. <br></p> <p>For the hosts, this could serve as the platform to a much better 2019, finding a way to win again. Alternatively, if they drop this series, it will be the worst possible result ahead of an away Ashes in August. As for the visitors, they have suffered from their own well-documented troubles over the last 12 months, keen here to find a way to salute in their first ever Test Match in this country. <br></p> <p>In the middle, Kurtis Patterson and Jhye Richardson have just received their baggy greens from Mike Hussey and Damien Fleming. They are into the side along with home town booy Joe Burns, recalled for his first Test at home for 27 months. </p> <p>We\u2019re still none the wiser as to what Sri Lanka will do at the toss, blessed with quite a few options following a productive tour game at Hobart last week. But with big outs - Mathews and Pradeep - they go in as underdogs. To what extent the pink ball can level things up after dark, time will tell. More on that in a moment. <br></p> <p>Geoff, JP and I are looking forward to your company throughout the week from Brisbane. How do you see this going?

      "bodyText": "A confidence-boosting day for Australia following the chastening series defeat against India. It mattered little that Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat because the gulf in class between the visiting batting order and Australia\u2019s bowling attack was obvious from the outset. Each member of Australia\u2019s bowling quartet bagged a wicket, including three for the impressive Jhye Richardson on debut. Mitchell Starc passed the 200 Test wicket mark in quicktime, while Pat Cummins\u2019 haul of four was the most for the day. Only Niroshan Dickwella offered any meaningful resistance with a supremely entertaining 64, including the most audacious ramp for six you will ever see. In reply Australia lacked conviction during their 25 overs under lights. Joe Burns will rue fishing outside his off stump while Usman Khawaja needs to rethink his strategy against Dilruwan Perera. Marcus Harris remains unbeaten on 40 but has looked far from fluent. The pitch is not a Gabba monster but it is expected to quicken under the sun tomorrow. Geoff, Adam and I will be back then to find out how many runs Australia can score on it, and if my prediction of a three-day Test moves closer to reality. 25th over: Australia 72-2 (Harris 40, Lyon 0) Lyon uses all his experience to make sure this is the final over of the day, but he\u2019s lucky to survive it, getting a firm inside-edge onto his pad off Perera\u2019s bowling, but the diving short-leg couldn\u2019t hold on. 24th over: Australia 72-2 (Harris 40, Lyon 0) Harris has put his cue in the rack. Lakmal cannot tempt Australia\u2019s opener to do anything more ambitious than prop forward and deadbat the ball back down the pitch. One, at the most two, overs remaining tonight. 23rd over: Australia 72-2 (Harris 40, Lyon 0) Lyon, with liberal use of his front pad, sees off the remainder of Perera\u2019s over. Finally some good fortune for Sri Lanka. Dilruwan Perera gets a second over and his first delivery from around the wicket to Khawaja is pretty straight and destined for the top of off, Australia\u2019s No 3 tries to cut but doesn\u2019t have anywhere near enough room and ends up chopping the ball onto his stumps via his gloves. Here comes the GOAT. 22nd over: Australia 72-1 (Harris 40, Khawaja 11) That\u2019s more like it from Harris. The first ball of Lakmal\u2019s second spell is rubbish and Harris slashes it confidently for four behind point. The third delivery isn\u2019t as bad but Harris stands and delivers a la David Warner and punches firmly through the offside ring. With just over ten minutes to go before the close of play Marnus Labuschagne has removed his pads in the Australian dressing room. Nightwatchman Nathan Lyon is ready for action. 21st over: Australia 66-1 (Harris 34, Khawaja 11) More runs for Australia behind square on the offside, this time courtesy of a canny Khawaja guide for four from a decent Kumara yorker. The bowler then beats the batsman\u2019s outside edge next delivery. Sri Lanka haven\u2019t bowled intimidatingly well tonight, but nor have they had much luck when they\u2019ve put the ball in the right areas. 20th over: Australia 61-1 (Harris 34, Khawaja 7) Sri Lanka have enjoyed a host of mini-victories in this night session without creating many clear wicket-taking opportunities. This over Chameera finds the outside edge of both batsmen, Khawaja\u2019s nibble landing well short of the cordon, Harris\u2019 squirting between the slips and gully and away for runs. 19th over: Australia 58-1 (Harris 32, Khawaja 6) Harris into the 30s, but it\u2019s a streaky arrival, driving away from his body up and over gully for four. 18th over: Australia 54-1 (Harris 28, Khawaja 6) Harris doesn\u2019t know whether to stick or twist at the moment, wafting unconvincingly at Chameera outside off on a couple of occasions. It might be an affliction that\u2019s catching with Khawaja looking a little lazy to one angled across him. Australia just need to knuckle down for the next half hour and regroup in the morning. 17th over: Australia 53-1 (Harris 27, Khawaja 6) Harris\u2019 lack of timing is highlighted by an attempted pull that he drags to the ground a couple of metres in front of his toes. That was off the returning Kumara after the dalliance with spin lasted just one over. 16th over: Australia 52-1 (Harris 26, Khawaja 6) Khawaja is easing into his work, pulling for two then nudging for one. Harris, despite advancing to 26, hasn\u2019t yet looked entirely at home in the middle, and he\u2019s been fortuitous with a number of plays and misses and inside-edges. This Chameera over is a case in point, playing false strokes to consecutive deliveries angled across him. 15th over: Australia 46-1 (Harris 23, Khawaja 3) First look at spin this innings with Dilruwan Perera ending Lakmal\u2019s seven-over spell. Harris is delighted with the change of bowling, tucking into a long hop outside off stump and punching it behind point for four. 14th over: Australia 42-1 (Harris 19, Khawaja 3) Since that timid opening seven or eight overs Sri Lanka have improved enormously. Chameera continues his decent spell by lingering outside Khawaja\u2019s off stump. Australia\u2019s No 4 is reining in his instincts, knowing he needn\u2019t chance his arm under lights when there\u2019s a day or two of glorious batting on offer if he can make it to the close. 13th over: Australia 41-1 (Harris 19, Khawaja 3) A third maiden in a row looked inevitable until a decisive swing of Khawaja\u2019s bat earned three runs through the covers. Staying on the James Anderson theme: 12th over: Australia 37-1 (Harris 19, Khawaja 0) Consecutive maidens. Chameera\u2019s found a nice rhythm from the Vulture Street end, beating both the outside and inside edges of Harris\u2019 bat in consecutive deliveries with a much fuller length than we\u2019ve seen for most of the innings so far. 11th over: Australia 37-1 (Harris 19, Khawaja 0) Wicket-maiden for Lakmal. Can Sri Lanka make further inroads under lights? Come come, I know for a fact Oxford in the snow is a beautiful sight. Surely you can return fire with a shot of High Street dusted in icing sugar or a frosted Radcliffe Camera? Huzzah! World class commentator\u2019s curse there. Sri Lanka fans, you\u2019re welcome. Lakmal tempts Burns into fishing outside his off stump and he nicks to the cordon where Kusal Mendis does well to dive to his left from second slip to pouch a tidy catch. That was the kind of shot to the kind of delivery that does not instil confidence ahead of an Ashes tour. Very James Anderson areas that one. 10th over: Australia 37-0 (Harris 19, Burns 15) Trent Copeland has just done a neat piece to camera on TV illustrating how inadvisably short Sri Lanka have bowled with the new ball. This has not been the treacherous session Australia\u2019s batsman might have feared against the pink ball under lights. 9th over: Australia 36-0 (Harris 19, Burns 14) A couple of couples for Harris to another neat Lakmal over that lacks penetration and includes a misfield. 8th over: Australia 32-0 (Harris 15, Burns 14) Chameera comes into the attack and because of a few technical issues I don\u2019t really give it much of my attention. This diversion of my attention includes Harris losing a couple of runs to leg-byes that appeared initially to be off the bat. 7th over: Australia 30-0 (Harris 17, Burns 12) Lakmal moves back over the wicket to Harris and it almost pays immediate dividends. First he gets one to carry on with the angle and beat the outside edge, then he finds the inswinger, Harris inside-edging perilously close to leg stump. Harris survives though and advances by four shortly afterwards when Lakmal leaks on the batsman\u2019s pads again. \u201cHiya from Spain,\u201d hi Dave Langlois, \u201cGreat to have OBO on this non-England-involving match. Sooo international to be living in Spain following Australia-Sri Lanka on a British paper,\u201d our pleasure. \u201cCummins apart the Aussie quicks have stuttered rather lately. But, don\u2019t know if other poms are thinking likewise but I\u2019ve just got a horrible feeling that Starc, Cummins and Hazlewood are all going to come good in the Ashes, with the Goat grazing on the leftovers\u201d. I am firmly of the opinion that Australia\u2019s attack (especially after seeing Richardson today) will have plenty of pace bowling power heading into the Ashes. My only doubt is whether they have the patience to winkle out England with a ball that will behave quite differently to the Kookaburra. Hazlewood in particular will be crucial with his metronomic style if he can return to form and fitness after a disappointing summer. 6th over: Australia 24-0 (Harris 11, Burns 12) Kumara begins the over with two short balls, Burns responds with two pulled boundaries. The first displayed fast hands to a delivery around chest height, the second was more swivelly that benefited from the latest example of Sri Lanka\u2019s lamentable fielding. 5th over: Australia 16-0 (Harris 11, Burns 4) The first loud shout of the innings is curtailed a brief moment after Lakmal appeals for LBW, the bowler realising that despite beating Harris with some inswing from around the wicket the line was taking the ball beyond leg stump. Lakmal is getting some nice shape though, and you can see that he could be a handful if he found the right line and length often enough. Collo\u2019s showing off while I\u2019m glued to the keys. 4th over: Australia 16-0 (Harris 11, Burns 4) Another misfield, this time in the ring, gifts Harris another run. That single brings Burns onto strike and he gets off the mark with an effortless cover drive for four. One of those strokes where time seems to slow down just before the moment of contact. Glorious. 3rd over: Australia 11-0 (Harris 10, Burns 0) Harris is the recipient of more gifts from Sri Lanka\u2019s fast bowlers. First Lakmal drifts onto the left-hander\u2019s pads, then with the ball within diving reach at the square-leg fence Kumara gets it all wrong and turns two into four with a clumsy dive. Lakmal gets it right to Burns with his final delivery of the over, getting some nibble away from the right-hander that Burns can\u2019t resist fishing at. 2nd over: Australia 6-0 (Harris 6, Burns 0) The barrel chested Lahiru Kumara shares the new ball and he\u2019s into the 140s kph with his bustling action. Like Lakmal before him he\u2019s too straight to Harris allowing the strike to be rotated with ease. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Harris 5, Burns 0) Suranga Lakmal opens the bowling for Sri Lanka and despite finding some nice shape in the air his line and length errs a couple of times allowing Harris to milk a two then a three through the onside. Australia up and running. Big moment for Joe Burns, the Brisbane boy striding out into the middle of the Gabba to resume his Test career. Marcus Harris is at the other end following his promising debut series against India. I\u2019m not sure we gave Mitchell Starc enough love for reaching 200 earlier today. It has been quite the accomplishment. The upside for Sri Lanka is they\u2019ll probably be bowling at the best time in the match when they\u2019re thrown the new ball under lights on a day one Gabba track. Four for Cummins, three for Richardson on debut, two for Starc - taking him beyond 200 in Tests, and one for Lyon. A very happy 56.4 overs for Australia in Brisbane. Chameera\u2019s 20-ball stay ends on 0. He\u2019s not good enough to attack Cummins but he tries anyway, the ball skewing in the air to the safe hands of Patterson at fourth slip. One slog too many for Dickwella and his enterprising knock comes to an end. Length from Cummins invited Dickwella to swing across the line but the ball lobbed gently off the bat to the debutant Patterson at midwicket. The end is nigh. 56th over: Sri Lanka 144-8 (Dickwella 64, Chameera 0) If some of Dickwella\u2019s batting to the pacemen has been a tad graceless, his form against Lyon has been much more aesthetically pleasing. A reverse sweep deserved better than to find the field, a beautiful lofted drive over the covers was worth more than two, while the conventional sweep to rotate the strike was executed with authority. As is becoming a pattern, Chameera has no problem blocking his complement to advance the partnership. 55th over: Sri Lanka 141-8 (Dickwella 61, Chameera 0) Dickwella continues to tee off to maximum effect with the minimum of technique. A wild larrup to Cummins\u2019 first ball skims off the toe of the bat, over Paine, and away for four. Further hoicks are aimed with varying degrees of success until he relinquishes the strike to Chameera for two deliveries. Again the man with an average of five holds up his end, despite being beaten all ends up by a Cummins conker in the corridor of catastrophe. 54th over: Sri Lanka 134-8 (Dickwella 54, Chameera 0) This is already the highest partnership of the match, despite Chameera contributing nothing off his own bat. However, in the circumstances that is fine, and he enhances his reputation by playing a straight bat to a Lyon maiden. 53rd over: Sri Lanka 134-8 (Dickwella 54, Chameera 0) Dickwella is compelling viewing. A missed ramp precedes a mistimed hook which is followed by a top edged drive, all of which advances the scoreboard by two runs. A couple of play and misses and a bunted drive to the ring field end the six with Chameera on strike for the start of Lyon\u2019s next over. If this is not used in an end-of-play montage by one of the broadcasters I will eat my hat*. *I have a miniature novelty chocolate hat for just these purposes. 52nd over: Sri Lanka 132-8 (Dickwella 52, Chameera 0) Nathan Lyon continues his work from the Stanley Street end, and again Dickwella declines an easy single before finding the boundary, this time with a firm sweep that just beats the fielder on the square-leg rope. That stroke brings up a very entertaining 50, Dickwella\u2019s 11th in Tests. A single brings Chameera on strike but the tailender does his bit, blocking three balls with the minimum of fuss. Channel Seven referencing the recent blackout at the Gabba during the BBL. 51st over: Sri Lanka 127-8 (Dickwella 47, Chameera 0) Pat Cummins begins the action in this awkward twilight spell where natural night and the floodlights are competing for dominance. Dickwella is on strike and he tries to smack the pink pill to Ipswich just about every delivery. A French cut results in a declined single and after a couple of whoosh and misses he connects with a firm cut for four through point. The piece de resistance is a single through gully from the final delivery to retain strike. Ok, play will resume after Dinner shortly. Just the small matter of 40 (forty) overs to squeeze into the next two-and-a-half hours. Channel 7 and Fox Sports will be delighted. On that subject, Jon Coghill (ex-Powderfinger drummer), might even be reading this blog. He definitely keeps in touch with the Guardian. While the natural light dims and the floodlights take effect settle back with a track that could hardly be more appropriate; Sunsets, from a proudly Brisbane band, off an album called Vulture Street. You know the drill, this is always more fun if I\u2019m not the only one talking, so please keep me company, either on Twitter - @JPHowcroft- or by email - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. Be like Gary: And our own Adam Collins captured the moment beautifully. That said, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s an absence of entertainment. Far from it with Niroshan Dickwella at the crease. Shortly before Dinner he unfurled one of the most outrageous shots even seen in Test cricket. \u201cEvening Jonathan,\u201d evening Phil Withall. Pleasure as always to have you on board. \u201cI confess to being slightly disappointed in the Sri Lankan performance so far. After a fairly competitive showing against England, although in a series defeat, they seem to have struggled significantly on their travels. The New Zealand tour was underwhelming and today\u2019s efforts aren\u2019t much better. I hope I\u2019m wrong but this series is already looking a little bit grim\u201d. I hope you\u2019re wrong too Phil, but I don\u2019t think you will be. I know it\u2019s tempting fate to say Australia are going to win this Test inside three days, but I\u2019m going to. How Tim Paine must have wished he had the chance of leading his team out against India at the Gabbatoir. It really is a graveyard for touring sides. Here\u2019s some archival footage of the St Lawrence Lime in action over a century ago. One of the figures captured in this extraordinary scene (as an umpire) is the 1899 Wisden cricketer of the year, Albert Trott. The Melbourne-born allrounder represented both Australia and England, and legend has it he\u2019s the only batsman to smite a ball over the pavilion at Lord\u2019s. He is also one of only two players to take two hat-tricks in the same first-class innings. It\u2019s always a pleasure to follow in your blogsteps Mr Lemon, easily my favourite contributor to cricket with a name that misleadingly implies citrus fruit since the St Lawrence Lime. Thanks very much Geoff. Slipping into the chair like... Australia\u2019s day, despite a little comeback there from Dickwella. The home team have bowled accurately and let the conditions do the work. Richardson has three wickets, Starc and Cummins two apiece, and Lyon one. For Sri Lanka, only Dickwella has been able to muster resistance on a pitch with a touch of swing and seam movement when the ball is in the right spot. Of course, the evening session can be tricky to bat if the ball is moving, so Australia might not love their chance with the bat once they knock over these last two wickets. That\u2019s it from me, it\u2019ll be Jonathan Pheasant Howcroft to accompany you through the evening, give you a bath, sing you a song, and put you to bed. 50th over: Sri Lanka 122-8 (Dickwella 42, Chameera 0) Last over before the dinner break. And humming Moloko, Dickwella decides that the time is now. He backs away outside leg and slaps the ball over cover for four! Gave it a clout, and Head can\u2019t haul it in. Next ball Dickwella punches the gap at backward point and gets back for a second run. Then to complete the set, Dickwella steps across and ramps him waaaaaay over the keeper for six! Perfect contact, that extravagant shot, falling to the off side, toppling over, ending up flat on the ground, but having got his angled bat under the ball to trampoline it dead straight behind the batsman and into the sightscreen behind Tim Paine. Glorious. Glorious. Then a single to fine leg, giving Chameera one ball to block out, which he does. So Sri Lanka reach the break with Dickwella ready to resume, on strike, to try and clout them some more much-needed runs. 13 from that over. 49th over: Sri Lanka 109-8 (Dickwella 29, Chameera 0) Richardson bowling and Dickwella wants to get him away. Tries a ramp shot over fine leg but doesn\u2019t connect. Pulls through midwicket and gets back for the second run. Then plays a short-arm swat to midwicket, just dinked that ball away deliberately for a single, giving Chameera one ball to survive. The bowler (who is currently batting) sways away from the ball outside off. 48th over: Sri Lanka 106-8 (Dickwella 26, Chameera 0) Edged into the gully by Chameera first ball, on the bounce. Then a big appeal for an edge, and Starc gets Paine to go upstairs, but DRS finds daylight between ball and edge. Dickwella will have strike for the next over, and it\u2019s time for him to have a dip. The field drops back aside from four in the cordon. Only a matter of time. Perera was struggling, of course, so he decided he wanted to thunk something. Had a big drive at Starc, but was yanking his hand off the bat handle even before the outside edge had reached third slip. 47th over: Sri Lanka 105-7 (Dickwella 25, Perera 1) Cummins streaming in from the Vulture Street end, long fluid run-up, striding along next to his lengthening shadow. Dickwella drives three runs through cover, exposing Perera to the bowling. The wounded man blots out four balls. 46th over: Sri Lanka 102-7 (Dickwella 22, Perera 1) Perera may not want an X-ray, but he yanks his hand off the bat handle as soon as he plays his first defensive shot. Not encouraging but he\u2019s brave to come back out. Plays and misses at the next. There it is! Starc\u2019s 200th Test wicket is restored to him, after a DRS review earlier took it away. Lakmal slashes a boundary through backward point, then edges the next into the cordon. It was a full ball speaking in at the stumps from around the wicket from the left-armer, and Lakmal\u2019s defensive prod took the thick edge low to third slip. Starc\u2019s 200th wicket in his 50th Test, nice round numbers. And what\u2019s this? Dilruwan Perera is coming back to bat on. No trips to hospital, no X-rays, straight back to the middle. 45th over: Sri Lanka 97-6 (Dickwella 21, Lakmal 3) After a drinks break, Cummins continues and he\u2019s bashed Perera in the glove! That really hurt. The batsman dropped his blade immediately as he was hit, and the ball lobbed away to land safely despite the attentions of short leg. But of more concern might be his broken thumb. That hit Perera on his bowling hand, and the off-spinner is Sri Lanka\u2019s only slow bowler. If it\u2019s broken, Sri Lanka are in even more trouble. And he\u2019s going to come off. He retires hurt, unable to carry his bat off the field. Big trouble. Suranga Lakmal replaces him, and plays a lovely flick off his pads first ball to pick up three through midwicket. That\u2019s a nice start. \u201cHow\u2019s he going to go with the short ball?\u201d asks Stuart Clark on the radio. \u201cNot good,\u201d answers Roshan Abeysinghe without hesitation. 44th over: Sri Lanka 93-6 (Dickwella 20, Perera 1) Dickwella might be well advised to play some shots and harvest a few runs while he can. The way Australia has batted lately, anything over 200 against them could be enough. But that\u2019s a long way away. Dickwella takes a single first ball of the over and lets Perera face Starc. The lower-order batsman plays into the cordon twice, three times, squeezing the ball away as Starc gets his line right. Then Perera finds a single to cover. 43rd over: Sri Lanka 91-6 (Dickwella 19, Perera 0) Cummins ends the over doused with sweat, but successful. He\u2019d already nearly run out Silva earlier in that over from a brilliant piece of fielding. We saw one from him in Adelaide, but this could even have been better, because he was the bowler as well. Dickwella tapped the ball to the off side of the pitch and ran with the stroke. Cummins ran down the ball, picked it up, and flick-threw it underneath his body while diving, towards the striker\u2019s stumps. Silva was nowhere in the frame but Cummins missed. Never mind. He pinged the ball off the outside edge a couple of balls later. Dilruwan Perera, a spinner but decent with the bat, walks to the middle. Cummins zips one past his edge for good measure. Has 2 for 21 now. The slide continues! Cummins with a beauty, seamed away a touch after angling in at the off stump. Decking and taking the edge of Roshen Silva\u2019s defensive prod, going softly at the ball but the pace of the pitch seeing it carry through regardless. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 90-5 (Silva 9, Dickwella 18) Mitchell Starc returns, trying to find some rhythm. He doesn\u2019t initially, bowling a bit wide of the right-hander\u2019s off stump from over the wicket. Silva doesn\u2019t often have to play. 41st over: Sri Lanka 90-5 (Silva 9, Dickwella 18) Tell you what, this Dickwella show is fast and loose. First he tries to trampoline Cummins over the slips, and misses by a mile. Then he leaves a ball that angles in to be on the line of the stumps, but hits him high and lets him survive. The over is a maiden. 40th over: Sri Lanka 90-5 (Silva 9, Dickwella 18) Can\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop sweeping. Dickwella goes with the paddle this time, and makes good connection to take Lyon for four. Next ball he tries to launch into the sun, and misses out completely. Lyon gets good turn again as Dickwella leaves outside off, then the batsman lands another sweep for a single. He\u2019s doubled Silva\u2019s score. 39th over: Sri Lanka 85-5 (Silva 9, Dickwella 13) Cummins squares up Dickwella, shaving past the left-hander\u2019s edge. Then does the same for Silva a few balls later. Some games he\u2019s relentless with his attacking line and length. 38th over: Sri Lanka 84-5 (Silva 9, Dickwella 12) Lyon bowls, and Dickwella is dropped! Reverse sweeping, swinging hard, but getting mostly a top edge. It looped rather than skying, and almost carried Head at backward point, but his dive got a left hand to the ball. He almost dived too far in the end and wore it on the wrist. Dickwella survives, barely. 37th over: Sri Lanka 82-5 (Silva 8, Dickwella 11) Lover-ly. Dickwella sees Pat Cummins start a new over, bowl a long half volley, and the batsman drives it clean and correct through mid-off for four. Two slips and a gully for Dickwella, not a very populated cordon. Two men out for the hook so Cummins can bounce him. Dickwella goes back and glides into that cordon gap for two, so Paine brings in a third slip and moves the gully finer. 36th over: Sri Lanka 76-5 (Silva 8, Dickwella 5) Roshen Silva is looking more comfortable at the crease, tapping Lyon into the covers for a single. Dickwella doesn\u2019t, hurling his bat for an outside edge that races past slip for three. Travis Head gets on the treadmill as he steps on the boundary rope after knocking the ball back, and it slides out from under him. 35th over: Sri Lanka 72-5 (Silva 7, Dickwella 2) A nice little punch through cover to get off the mark for Dickwella. He isn\u2019t the sort of player who\u2019ll refrain from playing his shots, so he ends the over with a flapping attempt at a pull shot despite being on the front foot. Got nowhere near it. 34th over: Sri Lanka 70-5 (Silva 7, Dickwella 0) Australian Test leg-spinner Kristen Beams was just on ABC Grandstand with Alison Mitchell. I wonder if this is the first time in Australia that two women have called a men\u2019s Test? The first in my recollection, anyway. Good to hear a bit more variety on our airwaves in recent years. Lyon comes over the wicket, and Roshen Silva plays a reverse-sweep for four! That was extravagant, and entertaining. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 66-5 (Silva 3, Dickwella 0) Young Jhye Richardson on debut has 3 for 18 so far. A friendlier match to debut in than bowling against Kohli, Pujara and Rahane, but he\u2019s done the job regardless. Niroshan Dickwella the Sri Lankan keeper is a left-hander, and Richardson gets some extravagant seam movement away from him twice in a row. It looked like a matter of time: that forward lean, those hard hands at the ball, and the inevitable happens. De Silva facing Richardson, who moves the ball away a touch again and takes the edge to Paine. A push at the ball, and Sri Lanka are falling in a heap. 32nd over: Sri Lanka 66-4 (Silva 3, de Silva 5) Outside edge from Dhananjaya\u2019s bat from Lyon, past slip, and they hare up and down for three. Roshen Silva looks more confident against Lyon, skipping down the pitch a couple of times to try whipping the ball away. Gets one shot where he wants it, worth a couple. Good positive play. 31st over: Sri Lanka 60-4 (Silva 1, de Silva 1) Dhananjaya de Silva has a hook at Richardson but doesn\u2019t land it very well. Gets a single. Roshen Silva leaves the rest of the over alone. 30th over: Sri Lanka 60-4 (Silva 1, de Silva 1) Lyon getting some serious turn and bounce already. He doesn\u2019t mind bowling on the first day in Brisbane. Was good here during the corresponding Ashes fixture. By the end of his over the batsmen finally get the nurdle going, with a single each to get off the mark. 29th over: Sri Lanka 58-4 (Silva 0, de Silva 0) Interesting technique from Dhananjaya. Watching him from nearly side on, it becomes clear how much he leans forward at the bowler. Right over his front leg, looking like a stiff breeze would tip him forward onto his face. That gets him into position to throw his hands at the ball, or rather doesn\u2019t give him much option to do anything but. Unsurprisingly, most balls he plays at in this Richardson over end up at point. 28th over: Sri Lanka 58-4 (Silva 0, de Silva 0) A maiden for Lyon to follow one for Richardson, as Roshen Silva tries to keep the off-spinner out. Largely succeeds, though one ball beats his edge. 27th over: Sri Lanka 58-4 (Silva 0, de Silva 0) The Australians will, as they say, get around him. Richardson, that is, who moved around to the Vulture Street end to start this session, taking the end that Starc had used before tea, and Richardson was immediately more effective. What a pearler. Dhananjaya de Silva comes out for a double Silva attack. Bowled him! That\u2019s destructo-ball right there. Jhye Richardson had just seen one set of stumps light up after Mendis hit a straight drive back past him, but next ball Richardson lights up the other set of sticks. A ball that snakes in towards the right-hander\u2019s toe, then cuts the other way off the seam. Beats him totally and removes off stump. That\u2019s a gorgeous bit of bowling and Sri Lanka\u2019s best batsman is on his way. Thanks Adam. And I can confirm that it\u2019s officially as hot as blazes out there in Brisbane. Just walked outside and my shirt ironed itself. A rare cheerful session for Australia in this home summer, and now they have to drive home the advantage as the day wends on. Normally the second session of day-night Tests is the best for batting, so we\u2019ll see. 26th over: Sri Lanka 58-3 (Mendis 14, Silva 0) Another outstanding over from Lyon to finish, beating Silva on both the outside and inside edge, turning and bouncing the ball as much as you will see from a finger spinner in the first session of a Test Match. And with that maiden, it is the tea break. It being a day-night Test, we take the 20 minute interval now, dinner taken after the middle stanza. All told, a very good two hours for Australia after losing the toss, Cummins, Richardson and Lyon all into the book along the way. I\u2019ll leave you now with Geoff Lemon to take the OBO through the next session. Catch you tomorrow! 25th over: Sri Lanka 58-3 (Mendis 14, Silva 0) Starc to Mendis. It\u2019s a maiden, but that flatters the quick who twice sprayed down the legside. He needs this break. But they will get one final over in beforehand, racing to their positions. 24th over: Sri Lanka 58-3 (Mendis 14, Silva 0) Three men out on the legside for Lyon against Mendis, who dominated him in Sri Lanka in 2016, bowling round the wicket too. It is fair to say that Brendon Julian does not approve of this defensive starting point but it does keep Mendis quiet until the second last ball, deflected for one. The men stay out for the new man Roshen Silva, Lyon finding his inside edge with the ball nearly ending back on his stumps from the awkward, failed cut shot. 23rd over: Sri Lanka 57-3 (Mendis 13, Silva 0) Nice stroke from Mendis, tucking into another overpitched Starc delivery, pushing through cover for three. The quick is copping some heat from Brendon Julian and Mike Hussey on TV for his length in this spell so far, wanting him to pull it back a bit. Superbly taken from Paine, moving to his left after Lyon clipped the glove of Karunaratne with another ball that turned big and bounced generously from round the wicket. So a good innings from the opener ends within 15 minutes of the first break, undone by a fine piece of bowling and some equally excellent wicketkeeping. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 54-3 (Mendis 10) 21st over: Sri Lanka 53-2 (Karunaratne 24, Mendis 9) Starc, who was handy to begin the Test, is back for a second burst before lunch from the Vulture Street End. He gives Karunaratne one on his pads here though, the opener whipping it away to the rope with ease. Starc is back where he needs to be on the fourth stump line by the end of the set. \u201cAustralia will be disappointed if Sri Lanka are only two down by the break,\u201d Brendon Julian states on TV, noting how much swing and movement they have been getting with the pink ball throughout the session. 20th over: Sri Lanka 49-2 (Karunaratne 20, Mendis 9) This is better from Karunaratne, looking more comfortable on the front foot. Mendis also scores early in the Lyon over, working with the spin behind square. Some good running to finish the left-hander pushing into cover, racing through for a quick single. 19th over: Sri Lanka 46-2 (Karunaratne 18, Mendis 8) Mendis is defending and leaving in rotation, Cummins asking all the usual questions. From nowhere, though, comes an impotent half-tracker to finish, the Sri Lankan star hammering a cut shot to the boundary. 18th over: Sri Lanka 42-2 (Karunaratne 18, Mendis 4) Another top over from Lyon, starting his work this Test in ideal fashion. Mendis gets off strike second ball down the ground, offering up the left-hander Karunaratne who does well to get through the rest without making an error with the balls turning square and men around the bat - including Starc at leg slip. I\u2019m enjoying this mission creep from the quicks, two of them now serving vice-captains and Starc a reborn slipper. Some fine Samson statto work here. 17th over: Sri Lanka 41-2 (Karunaratne 18, Mendis 3) A point of discussion on TV that Australia have bowled only 16 overs with 37 minutes scheduled until lunch. I\u2019ve speculated in earlier day-night Tests that this could be intentional, making sure that they get to bowl as many overs as possible later on after dark. We\u2019ll see. Allan Border is debating whether there should be two drinks breaks in this session. Never change, AB. Back in the middle, Cummins sends down another superb delivery at Mendis to start the fresh over that beats the edge, repeating the dose with another absolutely beauty with his penulitmate offering. We\u2019ve seen some high class fast bowling here this afternoon. But the Sri Lankan young gun is off the mark from the final ball, the 15th he\u2019s faced, pushing three behind point with nice control along the ground. 16th over: Sri Lanka 38-2 (Karunaratne 18, Mendis 0) On comes Nathan Lyon, at the ground where the Cult of \u2018Nice Garry\u2019 began two summers ago, against the team he made his famous Test debut at Galle all the way back in 2011. He\u2019s generating big spin to start at Karunaratne, beating the southpaw on the back foot. A carbon copy comes later in the over, fending at a deliveryon the basis of line rather than length. Good batting to finish, now on the front foot pushing two down the ground. They take a second drinks break. 15th over: Sri Lanka 36-2 (Karunaratne 16, Mendis 0) Cummins concedes some runs this time around, Karunaratne driving a couple to cover then taking a two more from a pair of balls aimed at the stumps. Given a chance at Mendis, still yet to score, the athletic quick is straight on to a tight fourth stump line. Let\u2019s enjoy this, two of the young superstars of world cricket going at each other. \u201cJason Gillespie did it for South Australia,\u201d says Sam Perry to my left. That he did. I reckon Paul Reiffel popped himself there at a similar stage of his state career. 14th over: Sri Lanka 31-2 (Karunaratne 11, Mendis 0) Richardson bowls his seventh, still getting a ton of movement. He\u2019s so close to removing Mendis without scoring, beating him with an unplayable. \u201cHe\u2019s really in a rhythm now,\u201d notes Allan Border on telly. In response, Paine moves Mitch Starc into fourth slip. It\u2019s not without precedent for the fast bowler to find himself in the cordon, spending a fair bit of time at first slip in Abu Dhabi last October. Who are the best quicks who caught in the grippers? Botham, of course. Brian McMillan stands out. Jimmy Anderson has also done plenty of good work in there, albeit mostly to spinners. Joel Garner, right? Oh, Terry Alderman - how can I forget. Who else? 13th over: Sri Lanka 31-2 (Karunaratne 11, Mendis 0) Mendis is both the future and the present of this Sri Lankan team, with siz Test tons already to his name by age 23. The first of those was a stunning, matchwinning 171 against Australia at Kandy in 2016, a side that has four (by my count) players out there today. It means they cannot take the foot off and Cummins doesn\u2019t, sending down an accurate maiden at Karunaratne, dealt with respectfully. \u201cHe\u2019s their Pujara,\u201d Kerry O\u2019Keefe says of the Sri Lankan opener, who looks just about set now, having faced 43 balls. And how about the reaction! A wonderful way for Richardson to pick up his first Test wicket! It\u2019s a textbook outswinger, forcing Chandimal to play, kissing his outside edge, taken beautifully by Burns diving across from second slip. He has the visiting skipper within minutes of walking out. What a moment for the young West Australian. 12th over: Sri Lanka 31-2 (Karunaratne 11) 11th over: Sri Lanka 27-1 (Karunaratne 11, Chandimal 1) The skipper, Chandimal, was not down to bat at No3 but he is walking out now at the fall of the first wicket instead of Dhananjaya. He\u2019s off the mark first ball with a push to mid-on, Karunaratne defending the rest of the successful set with soft hands. That was the first wicket for Pat Cummins as Australia\u2019s vice-captain. Through him, we\u2019re one step closer to the fast bowler captaincy revolution. Viva! Full and round the wicket, Cummins gave Thirimanne an invitation to drive that he could not turn down. Doing just enough off the deck, the outside edge flew straight into the hands of the local boy Labuschagne at third slip. They\u2019re away. 10th over: Sri Lanka 26-0 (Karunaratne 11, Thirimanne 12) Jumping Jhye was all over Karunaratne early and he\u2019s once again up for leg before. This is the least convincing of the appeals so far, though, the ball pitching well outside leg. But on the whole, the experienced opener now looks to be working himself into a nice groove. 9th over: Sri Lanka 26-0 (Karunaratne 11, Thirimanne 12) Cummins gets a chance now, replacing Starc after a sharp four over stint. As usual, he\u2019s straight into the idea channel at Thirmanne from round the wicket, taking only three balls to find an inside edge. On Fox Criket, they note that James Anderson has picked up Thirimanne seven times in Tests. The England champion was the best of their bowlers on the opening day at Barbados, his overnight figures 25-12-4-33. As you do at age 36. 8th over: Sri Lanka 26-0 (Karunaratne 11, Thirimanne 12) Better over for Sri Lanka, Karunaratne tucking Richardson then Thirimanne doing likewise for a couple. He plays the same shot later in the over but finer again, the angle good enough to secure the first boundary of the Test! Richardson keeps it together, finishing the over with an excellent off-cutter that beats Karunaratne. 7th over: Sri Lanka 20-0 (Karunaratne 10, Thirimanne 7) Starc is bowling some unplayables in this spell, Thirimanne beaten again from a ball that jags away that he has to play at. Sure enough, there is a bouncer in there too. The opener makes good contact to a drive later in the over, albeit straight back to the bowler, but he\u2019s beaten again to finish from a delivery he really should have been leaving alone. 6th over: Sri Lanka 19-0 (Karunaratne 9, Thirimanne 7) Richardson gets another go at Karunaratne, who made the ICC Test Team of the year for 2018 for eight 50+ scores in nine Tests. But it only takes two balls for his inside edge to be located, his skiddy trajectory of the new West Australian taking some getting used to. The left-hander knows he has to leave whenever he can, given a couple of inaccurate short balls to watch in an over a touch less potent. NOT OUT! Well, that looked pretty good live but the review shows it missing leg stump. Mitch Starc will have wait for his 200th Test wicket; Thirimanne survives. 5th over: Sri Lanka 16-0 (Karunaratne 8, Thirimanne 7) The error was set up by some super bowling, Starc beating the edge with a beauty after flooring the opening with a rapid bumper. The Australians are on. HAS STARC PICKED UP THIRIMANNE? He\u2019s been given lbw but sends it straight upstairs. Stand by. 4th over: Sri Lanka 14-0 (Karunaratne 7, Thirimanne 6) Richardson is once again appealing first ball of his second set, this time pinning Karunaratne to the crease with a delivery shaping back beautifully from over the wicket. The umpire doesn\u2019t fancy it, the bounce again convincing Paine not to review. A nice battle continues between the pair, the opening bat taking two to midwicket and leaving competently, the bowler locating an inside edge to finish. Really good cricket. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Karunaratne 5, Thirimanne 6) Starc now finds the outside edge of Thirimanne\u2019s blade, doing it tough early on here, but it lands just short of the cordon. The talisman leader then attacks the stumps before losing his line a bit as the over came to an end, Karunaratne collecting one off his pads. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 9-0 (Karunaratne 4, Thirimanne 5) So close! It is all happening in Jhye Richardson\u2019s first over of Test cricket, ever so close to a breakthrough. He nearly joined a special club with his first ball, Thirimanne almost pushing a catch to Labuschagne at short leg off the shoulder of the bat. Back on strike later in the over, the same man shouldered arms to a delivery that came back a long way, prompting a massive appeal from the West Australian and the cordon. On the basis of height, Paine elected not to go upstairs. Tons to like about this kid. 1st over: Sri Lanka 6-0 (Karunaratne 3, Thirimanne 3) Lovely shot first ball of the Test from Karunaratne, pushing Starc with perfect timing through midwicket for three. Thirimanne is busy early, hit by a bumper on the arm that he can\u2019t get away from before steering a couple nicely past point to get off the mark. A yorker to finish, dug out for a single to retain the strike. Good cricket from all involved. The players are on the field! Mitchell Starc has the ball in his hand, bowling the first ball from the Vulture Street End. Karunaratne is facing, the man in the form of his life, alongside Thirimanne. PLAY! Indigenous welcome to country and national anthems. Sri Lanka\u2019s is a corker, running to about four minutes in total. Of course, they are playing for the Warne-Murali Trophy in this series, one of the most divisive in the game. Personally, I love it. I might even have called it stately in my copy last night. There are not many people here. It\u2019s hard to judge at the Gabba with their kaleidoscopic seating, but the fact that more tickets were sold to Canberra than here as of two weeks ago suggests this might be a bit of a battle. Of course, that attendance number will swell after business hours for that final session. Speaking of the witching hour, it is a good thing that the pink ball is no longer a major talking point, this the fifth day-night Test played in Australia. Talking to their officials here this morning, the only change to the ball from last season is that they have smoothed the leather less before applying the cover. That\u2019s a negligible alteration, designed to prevent peeling. In short, the ball is good as gold, Tim Paine saying as much yesterday at his pre-Test press conference. This is what that ball looks like up close, with added content included in that link: The Mavis\u2019s singing Cry on Recovery in 1997. Niche, but worth it. Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal (c), Kusal Mendis, Roshen Silva, Dhananjaya de Silva, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Dilruwan Perera, Suranga Lakmal, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Kumara I\u2019m extremely happy to see Dhananjaya at three. The three quicks as expected; Perera the spinner. No other surprises. Australia: Marcus Harris, Joe Burns, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Travis Head, Kurtis Patterson, Tim Paine (c &amp; wk), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Lyon Sri Lanka still coming. Not sure what\u2019s going on here, but I\u2019ll have it up asap. Dinesh Chandimal has called correctly. Teams as named coming in a tick. This is nice. Trent Copeland is Kurtis Patterson\u2019s club captain at St George and perhaps the most excited man in Australia about his elevation to the Test side. Copes performed at The Grade Cricketer live show last night (with the OBO\u2019s own Sam Perry) and said that his own hopes of an Ashes recall are far from dead. Nor should they be, either. We learned the hard way in 2015 how an unbalanced attack in England can go around and around. They need an old-fashioned seamer and Copeland has to be in that conversation alongside Worrall, Siddle and Sayers. The track. Yes, that looks a bit green. But do not - I repeat do not get carried away. It\u2019ll be a road. We\u2019re in Australia, it is always a road. Bat early, bat often. Kurtis Patterson putting on his baggy green for the first time. Nice. Hello from the Gabba! The good news for the players is that the stinging heat of yesterday has not been repeated for the opening afternoon of this two Test series, the temperature currently 30 degrees, with a tiny bit of cloud cover. For the hosts, this could serve as the platform to a much better 2019, finding a way to win again. Alternatively, if they drop this series, it will be the worst possible result ahead of an away Ashes in August. As for the visitors, they have suffered from their own well-documented troubles over the last 12 months, keen here to find a way to salute in their first ever Test Match in this country. In the middle, Kurtis Patterson and Jhye Richardson have just received their baggy greens from Mike Hussey and Damien Fleming. They are into the side along with home town booy Joe Burns, recalled for his first Test at home for 27 months. We\u2019re still none the wiser as to what Sri Lanka will do at the toss, blessed with quite a few options following a productive tour game at Hobart last week. But with big outs - Mathews and Pradeep - they go in as underdogs. To what extent the pink ball can level things up after dark, time will tell. More on that in a moment. Geoff, JP and I are looking forward to your company throughout the week from Brisbane. How do you see this going? Drop me a line, send me a tweet.",

By cutting out the need for single-use containers, Helias hopes to make \u201csignificant\u201d reductions in plastic waste, but until the pilot schemes are evaluated it is difficult to estimate the savings, or the costs. New York and Paris will see the first pilot schemes later this year, but if they are successful after a 12-month trial the scheme will be rolled out widely. However, schemes like this are likely to be limited in their ability to cut waste, according to Mirjam Kopp, plastics project leader at Greenpeace. \u201cMany of the businesses behind the initiative are expanding production of single-use plastic and looking to grow in markets that simply cannot take more plastic,\u201d she argued. \u201c[The impact of the scheme] depends on whether these companies are actually ready to change their business models.\u201d The \u201cwaste-free shopping platform\u201d will be launched on Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where Greenpeace will publicly debate the issue of plastic waste with Procter &amp; Gamble chief executive David Taylor. Taylor is also chair of the recently forged Alliance to End Plastic Waste, under which companies will invest $1bn (\u00a3778m) over five years in ways to stop plastic ending up in the oceans, where it has a disastrous effect on marine life.",

      "bodyText": "Airbus has called the UK government\u2019s handling of Brexit a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and warned the aerospace firm could pull out of the UK if the country crashes out of the EU without a deal. In a video message released on Thursday, Tom Enders, its chief executive, said that if there was a no-deal Brexit, Airbus would have to make \u201cpotentially very harmful decisions for the UK\u201d. He added: \u201cPlease don\u2019t listen to the Brexiteers\u2019 madness, which asserts that because we have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong.\u201d The European aerospace group is one of the biggest manufacturers in the UK, where it employs more than 14,000 people. A further 110,000 supply-chain jobs depend on its operations, which have an annual turnover of \u00a36bn. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said he took the warning \u201cvery seriously\u201d. He told parliament: \u201cWhat the chief executive and others in the business community are clear on is that they want a deal to avoid the uncertainty of no deal and that is why he is backing the prime minister.\u201d Enders called for a pragmatic withdrawal agreement that allowed for an orderly Brexit. Airbus had previously backed Theresa May\u2019s proposed deal, which failed to get a parliamentary majority. The Airbus warning was another blow for the government in a week in which Sir James Dyson, the Brexit-backing billionaire, announced plans to shift his company HQ from Wiltshire to Singapore and Sony confirmed it was moving its European HQ from London to Amsterdam. Enders said: \u201cOf course it\u2019s not possible to pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately. However, aerospace is a long-term business and we could be forced to redirect future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit and, make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft.\u201d His comments followed previous warnings that Airbus was considering abandoning plans to build new wings in the UK, which would mean thousands of job losses. Wings for its range of commercial aircraft are manufactured in Broughton, north Wales, where it employees 6,000 people. Broughton produces more than 1,000 wings a year and even has a football team nicknamed the Wingmakers, who play in the Cymru Alliance League. Airbus\u2019s design and engineering site in Filton, Bristol, employs 3,000. Darren Jones, the Labour MP for Bristol North West, tweeted: Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, tweeted: \u201cGood for @Airbus, telling it as it is. We need more business leaders to be honest &amp; truthful about #BrexitShambles. Why it\u2019s vital parliament blocks a crash out no-deal #Brexit next week.\u201d David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham and a remain advocate, tweeted: \u201cAirbus has warned it could move wing-building out of the UK because of Brexit. There is no clearer imagery for this national project of self-harm than this. Wings clipped, we will be isolated and alone.\u201d Enders said the UK\u2019s aerospace industry stood \u201cat a precipice\u201d. He added: \u201cIn a global economy the UK no longer has the capability to go it alone. Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital.\u201d Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, said ministers and MPs must stop gambling with the future of UK workers by taking \u201cno deal\u201d off the table. The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201cTens of thousands of decent well-paid skilled jobs that support families and represent the backbone of communities across the country are caught in the crossfire of a no-deal face-off which could deny future generations the hope and opportunity of high-quality, well-paid apprenticeships into skilled work.\u201d Airbus workers have their say Employees at the Broughton plant have expressed concern after the warning from the aerospace firm that wing-building could be moved out of the UK in the event of a no-deal-Brexit. Andrew Wilson, 60, who has been working at the plant for 10 years, said of Enders\u2019 remarks: \u201cIf he truly cares about Britain he shouldn\u2019t be saying things like that \u2013 threatening thousands of people\u2019s jobs. \u201cDo you know how hard it would be to move all of the stuff in this plant elsewhere?\u201d Another employee, a cleaner who works at the firm through a contractor, said she found the news very concerning. \u201cThat would be a massive blow; that\u2019s so many thousands of people\u2019s jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with Brexit at the moment but if we leave without a deal I assume it is going to be bad for people\u2019s jobs and businesses.\u201d Last June, Airbus said it was considering cutting thousands of jobs in the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. A fitter who works at Airbus and had just left a meeting after Enders\u2019 warning, disagreed with the CEO, describing the situation as \u201cfine\u201d. He said: \u201cObviously there are a lot more powerful people in control of the situation than us but we\u2019ve been told there\u2019s nothing to immediately worry about. \u201cWe\u2019ve got orders for up to the next 20, 30 years, so I can\u2019t see them actually closing this place.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>After last weekend\u2019s AFC Championship Game, in which Tom Brady <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/20/new-england-patriots-kansas-city-chiefs-afc-championship-game-nfl\">led the New England Patriots to victory</a> over MVP front-runner Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, the internet was abuzz with praise for a third quarterback, this one working from the booth. Tony Romo, the former Dallas Cowboys QB who began his career as an NFL broadcaster in 2017, received wide acclaim for his in-game analysis alongside play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz.</p> <p>Through four quarters and overtime, Romo gleefully diagnosed the strengths and weaknesses of both teams, offering sharp insight into the mindsets of his fellow quarterbacks. Most impressive of all, Romo predicted how plays would develop with uncanny accuracy, earning him the title of \u201cRomostradamus\u201d from Nantz and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bharper3407/status/1087200336345935873\">a #You\u2019reAWizardTony hashtag</a> from MLB All-Star Bryce Harper. On Monday, the NFL tweeted a compilation of Romo\u2019s eerily accurate pre-play predictions:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1087505913756319744\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonyromo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TonyRomo</a> was calling plays before they happened! \ud83d\udd2e <a href=\"https://t.co/4jdm9I8Pl5\">pic.twitter.com/4jdm9I8Pl5</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1087505913756319744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>His employers CBS are just as impressed as the NFL. This week, there have been reports that <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/21/cbs-is-trying-to-end-any-pricey-tony-romo-tv-sweepstakes/\">the broadcaster is willing to give Romo a substantial raise</a>, just in case he feels tempted by any of the \u201clegitimate contract offers\u201d he has <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/777404/2019/01/21/media-circus-tony-romo-discusses-his-best-segments-dealing-with-scrutiny-and-more/\">reportedly received from NFL teams</a>. And that interest may be because Sunday\u2019s game was far from a one-off, Romo has generally been considered the best analyst in US sports for some time. And we won\u2019t have to wait long to hear him in action again: Romo and Nantz are on the call for next month\u2019s Super Bowl between the Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/11/monday-night-football-jason-witter-booger-mcfarland\">Monday Night Football: Has Jason Witten ruined a US television institution?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What makes Tony Romo so good at his job? It\u2019s a combination of the same qualities that made him a good quarterback: enthusiasm, knowledge of the game, and the ability to communicate clearly and, importantly on a live broadcast, quickly.</p> <p>Part of Romo\u2019s appeal is that he cares. He\u2019s like your favorite teacher from school, bubbling with a genuine passion for his subject. None of the other color commentators match his energy. Compared to Tony Romo, Fox\u2019s Troy Aikman is downright lethargic. Jason Witten \u2013 the former Dallas Cowboy who caught 37 career touchdowns from Romo \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/11/monday-night-football-jason-witter-booger-mcfarland\">widely panned during his first year</a> in ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Football booth, coming across as confused and unnatural. Since 2006, Cris Collinsworth has been a linchpin of NBC\u2019s well-produced Sunday Night Football broadcasts, but his style is more restrained. Romo, on the other hand, manages to share a slew of interesting details without speeding into the manic excess of Jon Gruden, the ex-Monday Night Football commentator and present head coach for the Oakland Raiders.</p> <p>Of course, all of these ex-NFL players and coaches know the game of football. What\u2019s been lost in our collective gushing over Romo-as-analyst is that his commentary is middle-school algebra compared to the advanced calculus of what\u2019s actually happening on the field. Personnel packages, pass concepts, gap alignments, blitz and protection schemes: the modern game is incredibly complex, and, given the speed of the action and the demands of producing an accessible, entertaining broadcast, it would be impossible for any commentator to do more than scratch the surface. Romo tells us more than most.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a63cfc5487e468c8d7c0598daf443c1df7075495\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a63cfc5487e468c8d7c0598daf443c1df7075495/0_44_2550_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Romo played 156 games for the Cowboys over 13 years in Dallas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Romo played 156 games for the Cowboys over 13 years in Dallas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Miron/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But let\u2019s not kid ourselves into believing that he\u2019s a seer. His pre-snap predictions are the result of years of experience combined with basic observations about formations, motions, shifts, game trends, and down-and-distance. Many coaches and plenty of savvy players \u2013 at every level of football, from the NFL to college to high school \u2013 could make similar predictions and frequently get them right. Rex Ryan, the former Jets head coach and current on-air ESPN personality, <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/special-report-tv-upfront/espn-pre-games-upfront-agency-visits/313485/\">said as much in an interview last May</a>: \u201cSure, Romo calls a lot of plays ahead of time, but do you know how easy that is to do? \u2026 If Romo always knows what\u2019s coming, how is it that I used to trap him into throwing picks all the time?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s fair to say Ryan\u2019s own TV career <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/09/12/rex-ryan-is-a-surprising-espn-disaster/\">isn\u2019t exactly on a par with Romo\u2019s</a>, but his comments raise an interesting question: if anyone with football know-how can predict plays, then why don\u2019t more commentators do it?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/22/nfl-officiating-nfc-championship-game-rules-analysts\">Rise of the TV rules analysts shows the NFL has a problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The simple answer is that it\u2019s a bad look when you inevitably get a call wrong. The production crews at the major networks operate like well-oiled machines, always working to minimize risk and keep the show on track. Errant predictions, bad jokes and awkward exchanges are road bumps to be avoided. Romo has previously suggested that his producers at CBS never asked him to predict anything: calling out things he noticed just felt natural.</p> <p>With the goodwill he has already built up with viewers, Romo now has leeway to simply say what he sees. And, to his credit, he\u2019s usually on-point with his predictions. Romo is only a couple years removed from being an NFL quarterback, the most mentally-demanding position in sports, so his knowledge of the game is essentially current and his playing experience perfectly suited to quick thinking and fast talking. These advantages \u2013 along with the novelty of predicting plays \u2013 may wane over time, but, for now, it\u2019s a joy to experience the biggest games in the company of such a natural and genuine communicator.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I watched the AFC Championship with friends and family.

      "bodyText": "After last weekend\u2019s AFC Championship Game, in which Tom Brady led the New England Patriots to victory over MVP front-runner Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, the internet was abuzz with praise for a third quarterback, this one working from the booth. Tony Romo, the former Dallas Cowboys QB who began his career as an NFL broadcaster in 2017, received wide acclaim for his in-game analysis alongside play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz. Through four quarters and overtime, Romo gleefully diagnosed the strengths and weaknesses of both teams, offering sharp insight into the mindsets of his fellow quarterbacks. Most impressive of all, Romo predicted how plays would develop with uncanny accuracy, earning him the title of \u201cRomostradamus\u201d from Nantz and a #You\u2019reAWizardTony hashtag from MLB All-Star Bryce Harper. On Monday, the NFL tweeted a compilation of Romo\u2019s eerily accurate pre-play predictions: His employers CBS are just as impressed as the NFL. This week, there have been reports that the broadcaster is willing to give Romo a substantial raise, just in case he feels tempted by any of the \u201clegitimate contract offers\u201d he has reportedly received from NFL teams. And that interest may be because Sunday\u2019s game was far from a one-off, Romo has generally been considered the best analyst in US sports for some time. And we won\u2019t have to wait long to hear him in action again: Romo and Nantz are on the call for next month\u2019s Super Bowl between the Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams. What makes Tony Romo so good at his job? It\u2019s a combination of the same qualities that made him a good quarterback: enthusiasm, knowledge of the game, and the ability to communicate clearly and, importantly on a live broadcast, quickly. Part of Romo\u2019s appeal is that he cares. He\u2019s like your favorite teacher from school, bubbling with a genuine passion for his subject. None of the other color commentators match his energy. Compared to Tony Romo, Fox\u2019s Troy Aikman is downright lethargic. Jason Witten \u2013 the former Dallas Cowboy who caught 37 career touchdowns from Romo \u2013 was widely panned during his first year in ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Football booth, coming across as confused and unnatural. Since 2006, Cris Collinsworth has been a linchpin of NBC\u2019s well-produced Sunday Night Football broadcasts, but his style is more restrained. Romo, on the other hand, manages to share a slew of interesting details without speeding into the manic excess of Jon Gruden, the ex-Monday Night Football commentator and present head coach for the Oakland Raiders. Of course, all of these ex-NFL players and coaches know the game of football. What\u2019s been lost in our collective gushing over Romo-as-analyst is that his commentary is middle-school algebra compared to the advanced calculus of what\u2019s actually happening on the field. Personnel packages, pass concepts, gap alignments, blitz and protection schemes: the modern game is incredibly complex, and, given the speed of the action and the demands of producing an accessible, entertaining broadcast, it would be impossible for any commentator to do more than scratch the surface. Romo tells us more than most. But let\u2019s not kid ourselves into believing that he\u2019s a seer. His pre-snap predictions are the result of years of experience combined with basic observations about formations, motions, shifts, game trends, and down-and-distance. Many coaches and plenty of savvy players \u2013 at every level of football, from the NFL to college to high school \u2013 could make similar predictions and frequently get them right. Rex Ryan, the former Jets head coach and current on-air ESPN personality, said as much in an interview last May: \u201cSure, Romo calls a lot of plays ahead of time, but do you know how easy that is to do? \u2026 If Romo always knows what\u2019s coming, how is it that I used to trap him into throwing picks all the time?\u201d It\u2019s fair to say Ryan\u2019s own TV career isn\u2019t exactly on a par with Romo\u2019s, but his comments raise an interesting question: if anyone with football know-how can predict plays, then why don\u2019t more commentators do it? The simple answer is that it\u2019s a bad look when you inevitably get a call wrong. The production crews at the major networks operate like well-oiled machines, always working to minimize risk and keep the show on track. Errant predictions, bad jokes and awkward exchanges are road bumps to be avoided. Romo has previously suggested that his producers at CBS never asked him to predict anything: calling out things he noticed just felt natural. With the goodwill he has already built up with viewers, Romo now has leeway to simply say what he sees. And, to his credit, he\u2019s usually on-point with his predictions. Romo is only a couple years removed from being an NFL quarterback, the most mentally-demanding position in sports, so his knowledge of the game is essentially current and his playing experience perfectly suited to quick thinking and fast talking. These advantages \u2013 along with the novelty of predicting plays \u2013 may wane over time, but, for now, it\u2019s a joy to experience the biggest games in the company of such a natural and genuine communicator. I watched the AFC Championship with friends and family. After a few quarters of listening to Romo\u2019s commentary, I noticed that we were joining him in dissecting every pre-snap movement, every player\u2019s alignment: \u201cThe tight end is motioning to the left, it\u2019s a run!\u201d We were absorbed in the action. Romo may or may not be a mastermind \u2013 or a future head-coach, as some players believe \u2013 but he certainly knows football. And he inspires us viewers at home to feel like we know football too. During Super Bowl LIII, most of us will understand only a portion of the game\u2019s many layers, but we\u2019ll see the field a little more clearly with Romo on the call.",

      "bodyText": "Half of all parents with small children have been exposed to misinformation about vaccines on social media, according to a new report that finds the most common reason not to vaccinate is the fear of side-effects. \u201cWe need to counteract health misinformation online and via social media,\u201d said Shirley Cramer, the chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), which published the report. \u201cWe call on the social media giants and the platforms to look at what they could do around this because it is a breeding ground for misleading information and negative messaging. There could be some really negative and dangerous consequences. They need to take some responsibility.\u201d \u201cAnti-vaxx\u201d groups target the parents of new babies via social media, posting stories claiming babies have died or been harmed by vaccination. A US group called Stop Mandatory Vaccination, run by Larry Cook, was censured by the UK\u2019s advertising watchdog in November over a paid-for Facebook post, after a complaint by the mother of a young baby in the UK. \u201cParents, not only can any vaccine given at any age kill your child, but if this unthinkable tragedy does occur, doctors will dismiss it as \u2018sudden infant death syndrome\u2019 (Sids),\u201d ran the post, which showed a picture of a baby with his eyes closed with his apparent name and date of birth \u2013 and death. It urged readers to join the Facebook group. In response to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the anti-vaxx group said it \u201ctargeted users with an interest in parenting because they intended to cause parents some concern before choosing to vaccinate their children\u201d. The ASA ruled that the post was misleading advertising and likely to cause fear and distress, particularly to parents seeking factual information about the risks of vaccinating their children. Cook did not comply with the ruling, the ASA told the Guardian, so it worked with Facebook to have the ad in question removed. But the regulator said its powers were limited. \u201cThere may still be posts appearing on the Larry Cook Facebook page that would, however, fall outside our remit; the ASA can only take action to remove paid-for ads on Larry Cook\u2019s Facebook page that encourage users towards making a financial donation to Larry Cook.\u201d A Facebook spokesperson said on Wednesday night: \u201cWe don\u2019t want misleading content on Facebook and have made significant investments in recent years to stop misinformation from spreading and to promote high-quality journalism and news literacy. \u201cThat said, we always try to strike a balance between allowing free speech and keeping people safe \u2013 which is why we don\u2019t prevent people from saying something that is factually incorrect, particularly if they aren\u2019t doing so intentionally. \u201cHowever we do take steps to ensure this kind of content is demoted in people\u2019s news feeds to give it less chance of being seen and spread and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 to discourage those posting it.\u201d Immunisation levels against common, potentially lethal diseases in Europe have fallen under the influence of sceptics who disseminate their views through social media. Measles cases in Europe are at a 20-year high and 72 children and vulnerable adults died of it last year. The EU health commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, has warned against the peddling of \u201cfake news\u201d about vaccine safety. The RSPH report said parents generally supported vaccination in the UK but found \u201csome worrying statistics\u201d. Two in five parents of children under 18 said they were exposed to negative vaccine messages on social media or in online forums \u201coften or sometimes\u201d. That rose to half of parents whose children were under two and 47% whose children were under five. Only one in 10 parents said they believed what they saw on social media. The report said: \u201cThis substantial exposure to negative vaccination messages may influence attitudes to vaccinations over time: repetition of messages is often mistaken for accuracy, a phenomenon known as the illusory truth effect. \u201cIt has been found that even when people know a message is untrue, if it is repeated enough times, they will begin to believe it.\u201d The research, which included a survey of more than 2,600 parents as well as 2,000 other adults, found that there was a fairly low understanding of vaccines, with more than a quarter (28%) wrongly believing that a person can have too many. The furore over the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine triggered in 1998 by the disgraced gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield, who claimed it could cause autism, was responsible for a huge drop in take-up, which has largely now recovered in the UK. However, the research found that one in 10 parents had still not given their child the MMR. Most (70%) said they were afraid of potential side-effects. The discredited autism hypothesis still circulates widely on social media. One in five of all parents, including those who had their child vaccinated, believed the jab was likely to cause side-effects. Uptake of the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine against cervical cancer is good, with more than 83% of girls in school year 9 getting a two-dose course in 2016-17. But it is not as good as uptake of other vaccines. Of the 2,600 parents surveyed, 180 had chosen not to have their child vaccinated and two-thirds of those cited side-effects. Scare stories have been promoted by anti-vaxx campaigns, including through a YouTube video, claiming the vaccine had caused severe reactions in thousands of girls and hundreds of deaths. Expert investigations in response to the scare, including a review by the European Medicines Agency, have confirmed that the vaccine is safe. The Royal Society has also recommended that vaccinations should be available in a wider range of locations, including \u201cpop-up\u201d clinics in the high street, gym and workplaces for adult vaccines such as flu and shingles. Cramer said social media companies should take responsibility for misinformation about vaccines in the same way that they are doing for mental health. She said: \u201cWe think they should clamp down on this spread of fake news and prioritise health information from reputable sources.\u201d In the RSPH survey, she added: \u201cFour out of five adults agreed with us that social media platforms should take steps to limit fake news regarding vaccination.

      "body": "<p>Adam Foulds is the real deal. He has previously won the Costa poetry award for his reimagining of the Kenyan Mau Mau uprising, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview\" title=\"\"><em>The Broken Word</em></a>, and been Man Booker-shortlisted for his 2009 novel about John Clare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/02/the-quickening-maze\" title=\"\"><em>The Quickening Maze</em></a>.</p> <p>This is his fourth novel and it follows two protagonists: Henry Banks, a successful and solipsistic actor with an emptiness at the centre of his being that only the next big break can fill (but never does); and Kristin, a recently divorced American who is so obsessed with Henry that she writes letters to him twice a week and soon travels to London to begin the happy-ever-after life together that her stalker\u2019s mind has convinced her awaits. Eventually they meet and \u2026 uh-oh.</p> <p>Foulds opens Henry\u2019s narrative with a simple sentence: \u201cThe hunger was beginning to hurt.\u201d The actor is on a diet for what he hopes will be the lead role in the next movie of the great auteur, Miguel Garcia. But the ravenousness in this novel is as much metaphysical as physical. There\u2019s deep psychology on every page \u2013 Henry is a textured portrait of a human being hollowed out by vanity and ambition, living in the dead eye at the centre of the celebrity vortex; but Foulds renders him vulnerable and lost and existentially panicked and therefore understandable. Meanwhile, Kristin\u2019s mind is remote from reality in the opposite way; she lives enshrouded and dazed in the hex that celebrity projects.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the details of the writing itself \u2013 the precision of the word selection combined with the precision of the observation \u2013 that make for such enjoyable reading. Henry\u2019s taxi pauses at traffic lights, for example, so that he might notice a man eating an apple by \u201cdelicately picking with his teeth at the remaining edible flesh by the core\u201d. In his description of Henry\u2019s lover, Virginia, a gangly fashion model \u201cjust this side of grotesque\u201d, Foulds writes: \u201cHer wrists were long and gave the impression of an unused excess of dexterity when she handled her glass and drinking straw.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb4d3ca1cd351597c4d83d9b89df1afbacecaa09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb4d3ca1cd351597c4d83d9b89df1afbacecaa09/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Foulds \u2026 dramatic reach and range.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Foulds \u2026 dramatic reach and range.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tourists ask for a picture from Kristin when she\u2019s outside Buckingham Palace: as she points the camera, \u201ctheir smiles grew fiercer\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Adam Foulds is the real deal. He has previously won the Costa poetry award for his reimagining of the Kenyan Mau Mau uprising, The Broken Word, and been Man Booker-shortlisted for his 2009 novel about John Clare, The Quickening Maze. This is his fourth novel and it follows two protagonists: Henry Banks, a successful and solipsistic actor with an emptiness at the centre of his being that only the next big break can fill (but never does); and Kristin, a recently divorced American who is so obsessed with Henry that she writes letters to him twice a week and soon travels to London to begin the happy-ever-after life together that her stalker\u2019s mind has convinced her awaits. Eventually they meet and \u2026 uh-oh. Foulds opens Henry\u2019s narrative with a simple sentence: \u201cThe hunger was beginning to hurt.\u201d The actor is on a diet for what he hopes will be the lead role in the next movie of the great auteur, Miguel Garcia. But the ravenousness in this novel is as much metaphysical as physical. There\u2019s deep psychology on every page \u2013 Henry is a textured portrait of a human being hollowed out by vanity and ambition, living in the dead eye at the centre of the celebrity vortex; but Foulds renders him vulnerable and lost and existentially panicked and therefore understandable. Meanwhile, Kristin\u2019s mind is remote from reality in the opposite way; she lives enshrouded and dazed in the hex that celebrity projects. But it\u2019s the details of the writing itself \u2013 the precision of the word selection combined with the precision of the observation \u2013 that make for such enjoyable reading. Henry\u2019s taxi pauses at traffic lights, for example, so that he might notice a man eating an apple by \u201cdelicately picking with his teeth at the remaining edible flesh by the core\u201d. In his description of Henry\u2019s lover, Virginia, a gangly fashion model \u201cjust this side of grotesque\u201d, Foulds writes: \u201cHer wrists were long and gave the impression of an unused excess of dexterity when she handled her glass and drinking straw.\u201d Tourists ask for a picture from Kristin when she\u2019s outside Buckingham Palace: as she points the camera, \u201ctheir smiles grew fiercer\u201d. Add to this keenness of perception a poetical ear for euphony and cadence and you have the quiddity of Foulds\u2019s gift. On a boat trip during a festival in Qatar, Henry thinks: This was being a tourist in the modern world, enjoying the view while knowing the water was poisoned, the sea overfished and the sea level rising. Among educated people this might be a topic of conversation, too, at least for a while, a little geo-political mournfulness between forgetful pleasures.

That heat won\u2019t just disappear, it takes hours.\u201d</p> <p>Benbow said many locals were flocking to the local pool today, while the council has also opened up its air-conditioned community sporting complex for people to flee from the heat.

Usually, they would rotate that around so the same area isn\u2019t affected, he added. So is it going to happen? </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty tight,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAssuming everything goes to plan, it should be OK, but we have something like a coal plant trip or there\u2019s a really bad forecast of demand there could be trouble.\u201d<strong> <br></strong></p> <p>The potential \u201ctrouble\u201d, as McConnell put it, has been caused by the fact that a power unit at AGL\u2019s Loy Yang A power station is down. \u201cOne of their boilers has got a tube leak,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very common. So they will have to take that unit offline. I imagine they\u2019ll be working pretty rapidly.\u201d </p> <p>The other main factor, of course, is the huge demand for power caused by today\u2019s stinking hot temperatures.

      "bodyText": "This blog is wrapping up for the evening, thanks for reading. While some parts of the country that have sweltered today will get some relief tomorrow, others will heat up. The latest forecast is for a high of 44C in Melbourne, 39C in Canberra and 38C in Penrith in western Sydney (the forecast for Sydney is for a high of 29C). Hobart is expected to reach a high of 37C, Brisbane 32C and Darwin 32C. SA\u2019s Port Augusta, where it hit a maximum of 49.5C earlier today, will still be very hot \u2013 37C. Menindee, the site of recent fish kills in western New South Wales, is predicted to reach 48C on Friday. We will bring you the latest on the Tasmanian bushfires and the ongoing heatwave tomorrow. The heatwave has been hard on animals and humans alike. This image was sent to us by reader Andrew Correll. The ABC is reporting South Australia\u2019s emergency power generators have been switched on for the first time amid the ongoing heatwave. It reports: \u201cTemporary diesel power generators owned by the South Australian government have been switched on for the first time, as the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) deals with record-breaking heat conditions across SA and Victoria. \u201cThe state government said AEMO ordered the generators to deal with a supply shortfall in Victoria.\u201d And here\u2019s how far the heat will stretch tonight. There\u2019s still a lot of 40C spots, as of right now, all across the country. I\u2019m now remembering some ominous words from the mayor of Port Augusta, Brett Benbow, who we spoke to earlier. \u201c[The heat] won\u2019t peak until about 7.30 tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cThat heat won\u2019t just disappear, it takes hours.\u201d For context, the highest temperature ever recorded in Australia is 50.7C, at Oodnadatta airport in South Australia, on 2 January 1960. At 49.5C, Port Augusta is now equal to the highest ever Queensland temperature, recorded on Christmas Eve 1972 at Birdsville police station, and only 0.2C below the highest NSW temperature \u2013 from 10 January 1939 at Menindee post office. Port Augusta has already beaten the highest temperatures in Victoria, the Northern Territory and Tasmania. We\u2019ve already watched Port Augusta \u2013 the hottest place in Australia today \u2013 break its all-time heat record with 49.1C earlier in the day. The previous record was set just 10 days ago (48.9C). Now it\u2019s crept up again. Port Augusta has hit 49.5C, as of 4.22pm. Hello everyone, Naaman Zhou here, taking over from my colleague Luke. Some further clarification has come in on Adelaide\u2019s record-breaking heat. It\u2019s even hotter than you thought. That 46.6C figure comes from the bureau\u2019s official temperature gauge for the city, which is at West Terrace. Other parts of Adelaide, by the bureau\u2019s own calculations, are in fact soaring up past that \u2013 but can\u2019t be included as the maximum for Adelaide. Kent Town, for example, has officially hit 47.4C today. The mercury has continued to rise in Adelaide, which can now lay claim to being the hottest capital in Australia \u2013 at least for today. Its peak temperature on Thursday of 46.6 has eclipsed the record held by Melbourne, which reached 46.4C. A reminder that Melbourne is expected to drop to an \u201coppressive\u201d 29C tonight. The overnight record is 30.6C. The bureau has also revised its forecast up to 44C for tomorrow. As it stands, today\u2019s forecast has also been blown out of the water. The top temperature in central Melbourne was 40.4C at 4pm, according to the bureau. It was only expected to reach 36C. I would not recommend this. All eyes have been on whether Port Augusta, the hottest place in Australia, can break its own record of 48.9C that was set on 15 January. It appears to have done so. The Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s observations data says the town hit a peak temperature of 49.1C at 3.15pm. Crews battling scores of fires across Tasmania will be without water-bombing aircraft on one of the highest-risk days on record and major national parks will be closed as a precaution. Fifty fires are burning across the state on Thursday. Two-thirds of them are considered uncontained, and authorities are bracing for worsening conditions. \u201cOn a whole, across the whole part of the state, I haven\u2019t seen conditions at this level,\u201d the Tasmania Fire Service\u2019s regional chief, Jeff Harper, said. The conditions are set to peak from 5am on Friday, with hours of dry air, temperatures reaching into the high 30s, and 40km/h winds gusting up to 90km/h. \u201cThe weather tomorrow may see that our aerial assets that have been so vital to us over the past week or so not able to fly,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThe wind conditions are so turbulent that rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft, it\u2019s not safe for them to fly under those conditions.\u201d Ground crews will be stepped up to try to cover the loss of aircraft, but Harper said human safety and property defence efforts would be prioritised. Two fires have could threaten communities. One at central Great Pine Tier could bear down on the township of Shannon, and the other the Gell river fire southwest of Hobart which has been burning since December 28. Residents are being told of the threat and efforts are being made to clear fuel from around the communities. In some cases there is 40 tonnes of fuel each hectare. One house has been lost near central Miena, and residents remain on alert at Barren Tier, Tods Corner, Penstock Lagoon, Liawenee and Shannon. A statewide fire ban is in place until Monday. The government will close some of the state\u2019s major national parks. The road to the pinnacle of Mount Wellington, overlooking Hobart, will be closed from Thursday night. Other popular sites including Mount Field national park near Hobart, and Hastings Caves, south of the capital, will be closed. \u201cThe government\u2019s priority is community and visitor safety,\u201d the premier, Will Hodgman, said. They have closed the roof at the tennis. And for good reason. At Rod Laver arena, the on-court temperature is 39C. After winning through to the Australian Open final, Petra Kvitova said: \u201cI was happier than the fans that the roof closed.\u201d Understandable. Marko Jovanovic-Jozic, 18, brought his cousin Mary to beat the heat. \u201cMy cousin came from Germany for the warm weather,\u201d Marko said. \u201cShe came from -38 degree weather and the experience here has gotten a bit much. I told her if you want to cool off, the best place is the ice arena.\u201d That may be true, but even the chillers at the Thebarton Ice Arena in Adelaide\u2019s west have been struggling in the heat, and the industrial ice is wet. Still, more than 350 people have come through its doors. I don\u2019t believe these temperatures have been confirmed by the Bureau of Meteorology but this gives you a sense of how it is in Australia right now. As South Australia continues to swelter, let\u2019s look ahead briefly to tomorrow when the heat is expected to sweep through to Victoria. On Thursday Melbourne eclipsed its forecast top by two degrees, reaching 38C. Earlier I spoke to Jonathan How, a forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, who set the scene: \u201cVictoria will be the hottest place in Australia tomorrow. Places like the Murray will be getting into 45-46C territory; places like Mildura, Swan Hill, Echuca are all going to be 46C. Some of those places will break January records. \u201cMelbourne is going for a top of 43C but it could get as hot as 44C in some of the suburbs. \u201cIt all depends on the timing of the change coming through. If the change comes through a little bit later it might be higher than 43C. If it comes through earlier it might not get as hot.\u201d How also noted that Melbourne would drop only to a \u201chumid\u201d 29C overnight. Here our full report on the likely culling of dozens of animals in central Australia. Yes please. Just on the issue of heatwaves and climate change, the ABC Melbourne presenter Rafael Epstein has pointed to recent statements from Victoria\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology (Bom). \u201cThe ocean waters around Australia have also warmed significantly over the past century, and have been very warm to record warm consistently across the past two decades,\u201d the Bom said. \u201cThe background warming trend can only be explained by human influence on the global climate. The role of climate change is further discussed in State of the Climate 2018.\u201d While the weather in South Australia will be hottest on Thursday, the heat is forecast to sweep through Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales over the coming days. The Lort Smith Animal Hospital is warning pet owners to take precautions. \u201cPets most at risk include the very young, senior pets, and those with underlying medical conditions,\u201d said Andrew Kapsis, Lort Smith\u2019s head vet. \u201cAnimals should not be tethered out in the sun. Importantly, pets should never be left in cars \u2013 even for a short time with the windows down. In a car, heat stress and death can occur within minutes. \u201cIf you see an animal locked in a hot car, call 000 and ask for police. \u201cWarning signs of heat stroke in pets include excessive panting, dark or bright red tongue and gums, sticky or dry gums and tongue, staggering, seizures, diarrhoea and vomiting. \u201cIf you are concerned a pet has been affected, get them into a cooler environment. Use wet cloths but not iced water to cool them. Also offer the animal water \u2013 but don\u2019t force them to drink. \u201cEven if the animal cools and appears to recover, take them to a vet for a thorough check as internal organs could be affected.\u201d Adelaide is not the only place where records have been broken. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, there have been new top temperatures at towns through South Australia. Those include: Minlaton (45.7C), Snowtown (47.3C), Parafield (46.6C), Stenhouse Bay (45.6C), Roseworthy (46.9C), Minnipa (47.3C) and Hindmarsh Island (45.2C). The town of Port Lincoln also made history, reaching 47.3C. Other locations to break records included Adelaide Airport (44.3C) and Noarlunga (44.9C). As anticipated, Adelaide has broken its 80-year-old heat record, with the city of churches hitting a scorching hot 46.2C on Thursday afternoon. Royce Kurmelovs: On Wednesday, an Adelaide pub in the working-class neighbourhood of Elizabeth North announced it was offering free beer. But only if the temperature soared above 45C. And on Thursday it did. Lines were out the door with thirsty patrons made to wait 40 minutes or more without shade. Muoi Pham, 60, was turned away by security who said the venue was at capacity. Instead, the local business owner brought free water to those waiting in line. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s too hot, [they\u2019re] waiting there for too long for one beer,\u201d Pham said. Some news stemming from the power outage in northern Victoria. It appears to have hit 45C in Adelaide. Some people are coping better than others. Eat fresh? Not today. Meanwhile in Western Australia: People along Western Australia\u2019s north-west coast have been warned to prepare for a cyclone that could bring heavy rain and damaging winds. A tropical low north of Kuri Bay, in the Kimberley region, could develop into a tropical cyclone on Thursday and intensify as it moves south-west over water later this week, the Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) warns. \u201cThe tropical low is forecast to move generally parallel to the coast, with communities along the Kimberley and possibly the Pilbara coast at risk of experiencing damaging winds, squally thunderstorms and heavy rain which could cause damage to homes,\u201d the Bom\u2019s severe weather services manager, Brad Santos, said on Wednesday. The Department of Fire and Emergency Services\u2019 acting chief superintendent, Paul Carr, said people must be prepared before the weather hits and reconsider their travel plans. \u201cAhead of the Australia Day long weekend, we urge all travellers and people returning home to plan their journey ahead of time to avoid the severe weather, and under no circumstances drive through floodwaters,\u201d he said. Source: Australian Associated Press If you think #Adelaide is hot, inland is worse. Marree \u2013 gateway to the Oodnadatta Track and site of the first mosque in Australia \u2013 is expecting it to get to 47C. Joe Calvert, a Brit who has lived in Marree for the past five years and manages the Marree hotel, says there isn\u2019t much to do except sit under an air conditioner. \u201cIt\u2019s like opening an oven,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s in the pub. One fella\u2019s been in, he\u2019s 87 years old and comes in every day for two beers.\u201d In Maree heat can be lethal \u2013 as anyone who gets stuck out will find out. Joe says a while back some German backpackers died when they were caught in the middle of nowhere after a breakdown. \u201cPeople do crazy things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey take all their clothes off and do anything to try to get cool.\u201d In Tasmania, dozens of bushfires are raging through the island\u2019s Central Highlands area, as they have been since mid-January. The state\u2019s fire service is now warning people in threatened areas to leave the area ahead of Friday, when conditions are expected to be at their worst. A major concern is that high-conservation value wilderness areas may be destroyed by a fire burning near Mount Anne, inside Tasmania\u2019s Wilderness World Heritage Area. The Gondwanan ecosystems are under threat, according to environmentalists who describe the vegetation as \u201ciconic\u201d and say the plant communities in question have not changed for thousands of years. Meanwhile, one property was destroyed. Two days ago, the Skittle Ball Plans Homestead in the central highlands burned to the ground despite the best efforts of its owners and fire crews, according to the ABC. The fires in Tasmania are estimated to be covering a total of 19,000 hectares, the ABC said. More than 100 more feral animals could be culled in central Australia because they are dying from thirst in the prolonged extreme heatwave. The Central Land Council is consulting a second remote community about carrying out an emergency cull of 120 horses, goats and donkeys because the animals are in such poor health they cannot be mustered or transported. It comes after the publication of shocking images that showed 40 dead horses at the dried up Apwerte Uyerreme waterhole. More than 50 more horses found at the same site had to be killed via an aerial cull last Friday. The temperature in Port Augusta has reached at least 46C, according to Weatherzone. A clock in town says the mercury might be at 48C, just shy of the record 48.9C. Already, last night, the town broke its January overnight record, with the mercury only dropping to 33.2C. Even in an air-conditioned home, it was stinking hot, according to the mayor, Brett Benbow. \u201cLast night and the night before I think my wife and I were watching TV in bed with air conditioner on and it was still showing about 30C about 2.30 at night,\u201d he said. \u201c[The heat] won\u2019t peak until about 7.30 tonight. That heat won\u2019t just disappear, it takes hours.\u201d Benbow said many locals were flocking to the local pool today, while the council has also opened up its air-conditioned community sporting complex for people to flee from the heat. Council employees were also working to varied shifts, starting and finishing earlier. \u201cWe\u2019ve put initiatives in place to do the best we can,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the extent of this extreme heat is quite unusual. I grew up here all my life ... once you get over the 40 mark it\u2019s extremely different heat.\u201d Benbow suggested that the problem for locals was not so much the extreme heat today, when the town\u2019s record might be eclipsed, but the fact the heatwave had just lasted so long. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to feel the pinch because it\u2019s dragging on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more drinking a lot more water \u2026 and staying indoors more. \u201cUnfortunately for the businesses do need to keep running. Even in the business where I work, we\u2019re supplying ice blocks in the freezer and chilled water. A lot of companies are doing that.\u201d While temperatures are set to fall into the mid-30s by the weekend, Benbow was worried that the heatwave itself might drag on for months. \u201cHopefully we normally get a southerly come through that will hang around for a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way it\u2019s going, I think we\u2019ll still get some of this heat for a couple of months. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened the last two or three years.\u201d Royce Kurmelovs: In Adelaide, South Australia\u2019s deputy premier, Vickie Chapman, and the human services minister, Michelle Lensing, have just arrived at the Hutt Street Centre, where people are handing out bottles of water and providing support to the homeless. Mike Francis, a spokesman for the centre, said the homeless service is at \u201cred alert\u201d and has extended service hours to cope with the current conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s extreme,\u201d he said. \u201cOur support services for the homeless ramp up during situations like this. \u201cFor people sleeping [in] cars, it is a very dangerous situation to be.\u201d Anyone who sees a homeless person and is concerned for their health should buy them a bottle of water and refer them to the centre, Francis added. An hour from Port Augusta in Whyalla, South Australia, it is also forecast to be unbearably warm. The predicted top temperature is 48C, which may have already been reached. Royce Kurmelovs: If you are eating out today in Adelaide today spare a thought for the chefs, cooks and service staff who spent last night knowing they might be working in kitchens without any form of climate control. With a characteristic mix of gallows humour, bluntness and sarcasm, users posting to the Adelaide Hospitality Crew Facebook page are sharing their fears about working tonight. \u201cTrying to cancel all booking for tomorrow lunch,\u201d one said. \u201cIf successful my work will not be open.\u201d Another chimed in: \u201cIt\u2019s the same in warehouses ... It will reach 50C at my work. Stay cool folks.\u201d Another user today urged others to buy water for homeless, while it was announced Fumo Blue on Rundle Street in Adelaide\u2019s CBD will be open at 2am for hospitality workers to beat the heat. My colleague Royce Kurmelovs has headed to Adelaide\u2019s Central Markets, where stallholder, Ross, says the \u201cmedia hype\u201d about the heat has scared everyone away. Sorry about that, Ross. \u201cThere are no customers,\u201d he tells Royce. \u201cNormally we don\u2019t have time for coffee.\u201d The temperature in Adelaide has already reached 39.5C. That is a very, very red map. Please spare a thought for the more than 2,700 people in north central Victoria who have been left without power today. The AusNet customers were hit by the power outage near Nagambie this morning, according to a report by AAP. Temperatures in the area are expected to exceed 40C and residents have been warned the underground cable fault might not be fixed until 5pm. The worst of the heatwave is not expected to Victoria hit until Friday after a hot and humid night with overnight temperatures around 30C. AAP has more here: The Australian Energy Market Operator is also trying to allay fears the state might suffer a power shortage over the next few days. Chief executive Audrey Zibelman said there were enough reserves to see through the heat. \u201cWe first go to the generators that are in the market, then we go into our reserves and we carry enough reserves to lose two units and then, only then, we would ask for people to reduce their usage, but that\u2019s the last point and we\u2019re not even close to that yet,\u201d she told ABC Radio. Melbourne will swelter through its hottest night in a year with the temperature dropping to just 29C, before hitting a top of 43C on Friday. Authorities are asking people not to take risks during the hot weather, including leaving children in cars or swimming at unpatrolled beaches. Twenty people have drowned in Victoria since 1 December. A cool change is expected late on Friday but it will bring gusts of up to 80km/h, thunderstorms and increased fire risk. Fire crews are on stand-by while extra paramedics and ambulances will be on call to assist those struggling in the heat. Some good advice here. The hottest place in Australia today will be Port Augusta. I can\u2019t think of many reasons to go outside there today but dolphins might be one of them. To make sense of the situation in Victoria, where the energy market operator is warning of possible \u201cload shedding\u201d, I have been speaking with the University of Melbourne energy expert Dylan McConnell. Last night, the energy market operator believed load shedding might be required but has since said it does not believe the situation will get to that point. \u201cWhat we\u2019re at the moment is called \u2018lack of reserve level two\u2019,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at that level, that means you can operate the power system like that, but if something happens \u2026 they will have to do load shedding to bring the system back into a safe operating state.\u201d \u201cWhat they might do is turn off a suburb or turn off a transformer somewhere,\u201d McConnell said. Usually, they would rotate that around so the same area isn\u2019t affected, he added. So is it going to happen? \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty tight,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAssuming everything goes to plan, it should be OK, but we have something like a coal plant trip or there\u2019s a really bad forecast of demand there could be trouble.\u201d The potential \u201ctrouble\u201d, as McConnell put it, has been caused by the fact that a power unit at AGL\u2019s Loy Yang A power station is down. \u201cOne of their boilers has got a tube leak,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very common. So they will have to take that unit offline. I imagine they\u2019ll be working pretty rapidly.\u201d The other main factor, of course, is the huge demand for power caused by today\u2019s stinking hot temperatures. In fact, the worst of it is not expected to hit Melbourne until Friday. As Royce says, be like the animals. Royce Kurmelovs: Over the course of the last week, the animals at Adelaide zoo have been getting a pampering as the heat builds. The zoo\u2019s presentations manager, Nicholas Bishop, says until it cools down, shows and interactives have been cancelled, overhead misters have been turned on and the animals have been given iceblocks to help them stay cool. \u201cYou don\u2019t tend to see animals sitting out in conditions like this,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you hear people putting themselves under extraordinary strain by exposing themselves to conditions like this. Animals seem to have it sorted in terms of taking care of themselves. \u201cThe bilbies, which are burrowing animals, dig down into the soil. Some animals will dig themselves a scrape in the mulch bed of the top of the soil. \u201cThe hippos and alligators don\u2019t notice it much. \u201cYou might see a cassowary sitting in its pond looking like bizarre Jurassic swan from hell. You\u2019ll see it sitting in the water, the shape is like a swan. But it is a cassowary. It\u2019s a thing. \u201cWe\u2019ll set up misters, give them an ice block for many species so they can get stuck into getting their food from the interaction with the ice block.\u201d All up, the approach is pretty much the same for animals as it is for humans: find some shade, drink lots of water and eat a zooperdooper. Or three. The message: be like the animals. For context, the hottest temperature in Australia on record is 50.7C at Oodnadatta, South Australia. That was on 2 January 1960. As of 9am today, it was already 41C. The forecast top is 47C. The town bears a large sign that says: \u201cThe driest town, the driest state of the driest Continent.\u201d Globally, the hottest air temperature ever recorded was 56.7C in the summer of 1913 at Death Valley, California. Here\u2019s a look at where it is going to be particularly hot today. South Australia 49C: Port Augusta; 48C: Whyalla; Wudinna; Tarcoola 47C: Port Pirie; Roseworthy; Snowtown; Cummins; Coober Pedy; Roxby Downs; Woomera; Maree; Oodnadatta New South Wales 46C: Wilcannia, 45C: Broken Hill; Ivanhoe; Menindee; Bourke; Tibooburra 44C: Hay; Wentworth; Lake Mungo; Cobar; Brewarrina Victoria 44C: Mildura; Swan Hill; Ouyen; Horsham Source: Bureau of Meteorology One thing to look out for today is the possibility of blackouts. Against the backdrop of scorching hot temperatures over the next two days, the energy market operator is already warning about a potential need for businesses in Victoria to power down today. The whole situation is being exacerbated by a breakdown of an energy unit at AGL\u2019s Loy Yang A power station. The Australian Energy Market Operator chief executive, Audrey Zibelman, is warning Victorians \u201cto be conscious to not use more energy than they need\u201d. We\u2019ll have more details on this for you throughout the day. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the heatwave that will hit large swathes of Australia today. In South Australia, temperatures are set to eclipse 45C, with Port Augusta looking at a top of 49C. Adelaide is also potentially on track to break its 80-year-old heat record and my colleague, Royce Kurmelovs, is there. He\u2019ll be filing updates from across the city throughout the day. Tasmania\u2019s firefighters, meanwhile, say conditions in that state are expected to worsen throughout the day. In Victoria, the north-west town of Mildura is tipped to hit 44C, while mercury will soar to 46C at Wilcannia in New South Wales\u2019 Central Darling Shire. If you\u2019re out and about and have some heatwave-related photos or stories to share, please drop me a line on Twitter (@lukehgomes) or via email: luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com Most importantly, stay cool!",

All options, always, all options are on the table.\u201d Pence was more specific in a television interview on Wednesday night. \u201cThe United States is going to continue to bring the full weight of our economic and diplomatic pressure until freedom and democracy and fair elections are restored for the people of Venezuela,\u201d he told the Fox Business Network.Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said Maduro\u2019s government was \u201cnow fully entrenched as a dictatorship\u201d, and called on him to hand power to the national assembly until new elections were held.The sudden developments came as tens of thousands joined marches across the country, which followed two nights of violent protests in working-class neighbourhoods of Caracas \u2013 once bastions of support for the government \u2013 and the apparent foiling of an armed uprising by members of the national guard. Morelia Armini, a saleswoman from Caracas, could barely contain her joy at the day\u2019s developments. \u201cThis is a wonderful thing,\u201d she said, after watching to Guaid\u00f3 take the oath. \u201cLike a phoenix, this is the rebirth of Venezuela.\u201d Wednesday also marked the anniversary of the 1958 uprising that overthrew the military dictator Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez \u2013 symbolism that was not lost on Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, a social worker from Caracas who was born on the day of the 1958 rebellion. \u201cI was born in democracy,\u201d she said on her way to the march in Caracas. \u201cI want my freedom; this is a dictatorship.\u201d Across town, several hundred supporters held a rival march in support of Maduro. Though it was dwarfed in size by the opposition protest, those in attendance were in a buoyant mood. \u201cWe are here to support our president and defend our resources,\u201d said Ana Medina, who works for the state oil company PDVAs, as salsa music blasted from loudspeakers. \u201cWe know that other countries are against Maduro because they want to take over our resources.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There is no end to speculation about what has driven the rise of the radical right over the past few years. Threaded through all the theories, however, is a single, agreed claim \u2013 that the far right is the domain of men. Angry white men populate media images. Scholars discuss men\u2019s desire for strength, power, loyalty, belonging and the return to a romantic, pure and untroubled national past that can be restored through heroic male action. Policymakers report on uncertainty about jobs and rising unemployment as factors disproportionately affecting men.</p> <p>However, there is reason to believe that male dominance of the far right is changing. Women play an increasing role in radical and far-right movements in ways that have largely been overlooked. Yet, as we argue in our recent book, Gender and the Radical and Extreme Right, attention to gender is critical for understanding the radical right.</p> <p>Historically, women have represented a small minority of visible activists in radical-right movements and were assumed to play traditional supportive roles, with some exceptions. Kathleen Blee\u2019s work <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520257870/women-of-the-klan\" title=\"\">on women\u2019s roles in the Ku Klux Klan,</a> for example, documents ways in which women were active participants in the early to mid-20th century, not only in the KKK itself but in groups such as the women\u2019s auxiliaries of the pro-Nazi German-American Bund. Still, women have generally been disregarded as serious radical-right activists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/17/why-is-the-far-right-dominated-by-men\">Why is the far right dominated by men? | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As far-right ideas and aesthetics have become more mainstream the stigma of participating in far-right movements has declined, encouraging women to join where they might previously have hesitated. While a \u201cgender gap\u201d in voting for radical-right parties remains, it is often overemphasised. An <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0031322X.2015.1024404?needAccess=true&amp;\" title=\"\">analysis</a> of European Social Survey data in seven European countries showed that more than 40% of votes for the populist radical right come from women. Women are more visibly active in radical-right movements than ever before.</p> <p>Some of the increase in women\u2019s engagement in such parties and movements is the result of a shift in radical-right positions on gender and sexuality. While the far right has traditionally argued against same-sex marriage and has promoted women\u2019s roles as wives and homemakers as part of \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cChristian\u201d values, newer radical-right groups argue that western democratic traditions and values include supporting women\u2019s rights, a wider range of sexualities, and tolerance toward the LGBT community.</p> <p>This was most striking in the case of the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1363460716642153\" title=\"\">Pim Fortuyn List</a> in the Netherlands, but parties such as the Swedish Democrats and the Danish People\u2019s party, while not explicitly seeking to protect gay and lesbian citizens, have also <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2016.1274383\" title=\"\">became more ambiguous</a> on LGBT issues. This platform is used to draw a contrast with a perceived Islamic threat from increased migration to gay and lesbian rights, tolerance for sexual difference, and secular modernity. The strategy has attracted female voters to radical-right platforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3021d10853edc4f36a1b90bf2d93089e434f1cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3021d10853edc4f36a1b90bf2d93089e434f1cf/0_80_4829_2899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alternative for Germany leader Alice Weidel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alternative for Germany leader Alice Weidel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The English Defence League (EDL) has also declared an openness to women and LGBT supporters. In the EDL, women remain a minority but mostly join on their own initiative, play an active role and share in the camaraderie of activism. Other far-right movements have also made deliberate strides to recruit women. Half of the Latvian National Front\u2019s members are women, and it depicts women as spiritually superior to men, tasked with leadership and positioned as pioneers who safeguard the nation.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, women have assumed key leadership positions in far-right parties such as Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany and France\u2019s National Rally. Women are also visibly violent in far-right movements. Last year, the German neo-Nazi terrorist Beate Zsch\u00e4pe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/11/german-neo-nazi-beate-zschape-gets-life-for-nsu-murders\" title=\"\">received a life sentence</a> for her role in 10 murders, two bombings and other crimes.</p> <p>Of course, there are still plenty of traditional gendered understandings at the core of modern far- and radical-right movements. This is clearest around the idea of women as wives and mothers who will reproduce white nations through childbirth and childrearing. Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn depicts women as the reproductive engines of the nation who will mother future soldiers. It tells women to refrain from entering the workforce or public roles unless they are in positions aligned with their purportedly natural, feminine roles as nurturers at home.</p> <p>Women who challenge these traditional norms pose a threat to the far right\u2019s worldview. Rhetoric about women becoming \u201ctoo powerful\u201d has fuelled the far right\u2019s attacks on changing social norms. In this sense, gender is crucial in triggering in many far-right men a discomfort with the world and desire for a return to some imagined simpler time. We see similar themes in the overlap online between far-right groups and the misogynistic \u201cincel\u201d movement, in which \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d men\u2019s sense of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies has occasionally erupted in mass violence against women \u2013 most recently through the <a href=\"https://eu.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/11/02/shooting-tallahassee-yoga-studio-injuries-reported/1862893002/\" title=\"\">Tallahassee yoga studio</a> shooting in Florida.</p> <p>It is not only the regulation of women\u2019s bodies that motivates the far right, but also their protection. Radical-right groups have mobilised female voters with anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that is specifically tied to women\u2019s rights, sexuality or assaults on women \u2013 using cases such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/germany-crisis-cologne-new-years-eve-sex-attacks\" title=\"\">2015 New Year\u2019s Eve attacks in Cologne</a> to argue that increased migration will lead to more rape and violence against white women. The recent riots in Chemnitz, Germany, were sparked by the death of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/27/germany-xenophobic-riots-chemnitz-far-right-pegida\" title=\"\">Cuban-German man</a> during a street fight with two asylum seekers. Less widely reported were <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-riots-in-chemnitz-and-their-aftermath-the-return-of-the-ugly-german-a-1225897.html\" title=\"\">unproven rumours</a> that the fight started when the Cuban-German man defended a German woman from an attempted sexual assault.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/23/cosmopolitan-sweden-far-right-refuge-europe\">I was a natural cosmopolitan. Sweden, and the far right, changed all that | Umut \u00d6zk\u0131r\u0131ml\u0131</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scholars, policymakers and the media have made great strides in understanding the role of masculinity in attracting men to far-right groups. But we have paid less attention to the potential for (re)framing femininity, women\u2019s role in the nation, or discussions of women\u2019s right to be used for recruitment or radicalisation by far-right political parties and movements. There is also scant discussion of the potential for women\u2019s anger, their greater vulnerability during economic crises, or how the disproportionate impact of public service cutbacks on women is influencing their support for far-right politics.</p> <p>Shifting dynamics around gender and sexuality as well as <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/exploring-masculinities-9780199315673?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\" title=\"\">changing social norms around traditional notions of masculinity</a> may also play a role in how radical- and extreme-right movements mobilise \u2013 whether by trying to regulate and protect women\u2019s bodies or by using the language of gender and sexual rights to argue for anti-migration and anti-Islam platforms.</p> <p>These developments suggest a need for a more nuanced understanding of gender in far-right movements. Without it, we are missing a big piece of the puzzle of why the radical right has proven appealing for so many people at this particular moment in history.</p> <p>\u2022 Cynthia Miller-Idriss is professor of education and sociology at the American University in Washington DC.

      "bodyText": "There is no end to speculation about what has driven the rise of the radical right over the past few years. Threaded through all the theories, however, is a single, agreed claim \u2013 that the far right is the domain of men. Angry white men populate media images. Scholars discuss men\u2019s desire for strength, power, loyalty, belonging and the return to a romantic, pure and untroubled national past that can be restored through heroic male action. Policymakers report on uncertainty about jobs and rising unemployment as factors disproportionately affecting men. However, there is reason to believe that male dominance of the far right is changing. Women play an increasing role in radical and far-right movements in ways that have largely been overlooked. Yet, as we argue in our recent book, Gender and the Radical and Extreme Right, attention to gender is critical for understanding the radical right. Historically, women have represented a small minority of visible activists in radical-right movements and were assumed to play traditional supportive roles, with some exceptions. Kathleen Blee\u2019s work on women\u2019s roles in the Ku Klux Klan, for example, documents ways in which women were active participants in the early to mid-20th century, not only in the KKK itself but in groups such as the women\u2019s auxiliaries of the pro-Nazi German-American Bund. Still, women have generally been disregarded as serious radical-right activists. As far-right ideas and aesthetics have become more mainstream the stigma of participating in far-right movements has declined, encouraging women to join where they might previously have hesitated. While a \u201cgender gap\u201d in voting for radical-right parties remains, it is often overemphasised. An analysis of European Social Survey data in seven European countries showed that more than 40% of votes for the populist radical right come from women. Women are more visibly active in radical-right movements than ever before. Some of the increase in women\u2019s engagement in such parties and movements is the result of a shift in radical-right positions on gender and sexuality. While the far right has traditionally argued against same-sex marriage and has promoted women\u2019s roles as wives and homemakers as part of \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cChristian\u201d values, newer radical-right groups argue that western democratic traditions and values include supporting women\u2019s rights, a wider range of sexualities, and tolerance toward the LGBT community. This was most striking in the case of the Pim Fortuyn List in the Netherlands, but parties such as the Swedish Democrats and the Danish People\u2019s party, while not explicitly seeking to protect gay and lesbian citizens, have also became more ambiguous on LGBT issues. This platform is used to draw a contrast with a perceived Islamic threat from increased migration to gay and lesbian rights, tolerance for sexual difference, and secular modernity. The strategy has attracted female voters to radical-right platforms. The English Defence League (EDL) has also declared an openness to women and LGBT supporters. In the EDL, women remain a minority but mostly join on their own initiative, play an active role and share in the camaraderie of activism. Other far-right movements have also made deliberate strides to recruit women. Half of the Latvian National Front\u2019s members are women, and it depicts women as spiritually superior to men, tasked with leadership and positioned as pioneers who safeguard the nation. Elsewhere in Europe, women have assumed key leadership positions in far-right parties such as Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany and France\u2019s National Rally. Women are also visibly violent in far-right movements. Last year, the German neo-Nazi terrorist Beate Zsch\u00e4pe received a life sentence for her role in 10 murders, two bombings and other crimes. Of course, there are still plenty of traditional gendered understandings at the core of modern far- and radical-right movements. This is clearest around the idea of women as wives and mothers who will reproduce white nations through childbirth and childrearing. Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn depicts women as the reproductive engines of the nation who will mother future soldiers. It tells women to refrain from entering the workforce or public roles unless they are in positions aligned with their purportedly natural, feminine roles as nurturers at home. Women who challenge these traditional norms pose a threat to the far right\u2019s worldview. Rhetoric about women becoming \u201ctoo powerful\u201d has fuelled the far right\u2019s attacks on changing social norms. In this sense, gender is crucial in triggering in many far-right men a discomfort with the world and desire for a return to some imagined simpler time. We see similar themes in the overlap online between far-right groups and the misogynistic \u201cincel\u201d movement, in which \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d men\u2019s sense of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies has occasionally erupted in mass violence against women \u2013 most recently through the Tallahassee yoga studio shooting in Florida. It is not only the regulation of women\u2019s bodies that motivates the far right, but also their protection. Radical-right groups have mobilised female voters with anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that is specifically tied to women\u2019s rights, sexuality or assaults on women \u2013 using cases such as the 2015 New Year\u2019s Eve attacks in Cologne to argue that increased migration will lead to more rape and violence against white women. The recent riots in Chemnitz, Germany, were sparked by the death of a Cuban-German man during a street fight with two asylum seekers. Less widely reported were unproven rumours that the fight started when the Cuban-German man defended a German woman from an attempted sexual assault. Scholars, policymakers and the media have made great strides in understanding the role of masculinity in attracting men to far-right groups. But we have paid less attention to the potential for (re)framing femininity, women\u2019s role in the nation, or discussions of women\u2019s right to be used for recruitment or radicalisation by far-right political parties and movements. There is also scant discussion of the potential for women\u2019s anger, their greater vulnerability during economic crises, or how the disproportionate impact of public service cutbacks on women is influencing their support for far-right politics. Shifting dynamics around gender and sexuality as well as changing social norms around traditional notions of masculinity may also play a role in how radical- and extreme-right movements mobilise \u2013 whether by trying to regulate and protect women\u2019s bodies or by using the language of gender and sexual rights to argue for anti-migration and anti-Islam platforms. These developments suggest a need for a more nuanced understanding of gender in far-right movements. Without it, we are missing a big piece of the puzzle of why the radical right has proven appealing for so many people at this particular moment in history. \u2022 Cynthia Miller-Idriss is professor of education and sociology at the American University in Washington DC.

I\u2019m looking for a monitor for serious photo editing. I want to get as true to what the print will be like (when printing via online printers). My budget is about \u00a3300. <strong>Pa</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Sad to say, prints can never look like screen images. Screens are bright and display colours using combinations of red, green and blue pixels (RGB). Prints don\u2019t light up so they can\u2019t have the same brightness or contrast range, and they\u2019re printed using cyan, yellow, magenta and black inks (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model\">CMYK</a>).</p> <p>Colours are also affected by the light under which you view things, which is why smart buyers take clothes and materials to shop doorways to see what the colours look like in daylight. Do you do the same thing when viewing prints? A print viewed under warm room lighting should not look the same as it does on a monitor set to the standard daylight colour temperature of 6500K, even though your brain will automatically try to compensate for the difference.</p> <p>Nonetheless, photographers can learn from experience of how colours are going to be reproduced, as long as the process is consistent. I was obliged to do this in the days before personal computing, when I edited photography magazines. Today\u2019s DSLR cameras produce images that are much like the colour slides we used to view on lightboxes, so happily this skill has transferred. However, the more variables you can eliminate, the better your guesses should be. This is where colour gamuts, screen calibration, printer profiles and, yes, standard light sources can help.</p> <h2><strong>A thought experiment\u2026</strong></h2> <p>There should be a way to get the screen image closer to the print, but it would be quite a lot of work, expensive, and you probably won\u2019t like it. First, get a <a href=\"https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-monitor-calibrator\">calibration device</a> such as an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/X-Rite-i1Display-Pro-Black-silver/dp/B0055MBQOW/\">X-Rite i1 Display Pro</a> (\u00a3178) or a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/datacolor-S5EL100-Datacolor-Spyder5ELITE/dp/B00UBSL3L6\">Datacolor\u2019s Spyder5 Elite</a> (also \u00a3178). Next, calibrate your monitor to match the printer and paper you\u2019re using. In other words, adjust the screen display so that the white matches the white of your paper, and the black matches the maximum black that ink can produce on that particular paper.</p> <p>It\u2019s better to print a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00465G49G/\">colour patch</a> or test card, rather than a naturalistic image where the brain can interfere with the colour rendering. Fujifilm has a good <a href=\"http://fujiclub.pro/attachments/frontier_color57s-jpg.198/\">composite test card</a>.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never actually tried this, but I imagine the monitor display would be disappointing. You\u2019d have reduced the brightness and contrast range, and most people like bright, contrasty screens.</p> <p>I\u2019m also not sure how well this would work when using an online printer rather than your own ink-jet. If they do their own colour profiling, their software might try to compensate for yours. You could certainly ask if their printer will respect your colour management profiles (there are <a href=\"https://www.photoshopessentials.com/basics/color-settings/\">\u201cpreserve embedded profiles\u201d settings for RGB</a> and CMYK in Adobe Photoshop), but affordable colour printing is based on a high level of automation.</p> <h2><strong>Colour-accurate monitors</strong></h2> <p>If your monitor produces accurate colour and the printer produces accurate colour, then the results ought to be predictable, even though the images are not identical. This is the device-independent solution that underlies the traditional answer, which is to buy a monitor with an accurate colour profile. The main ones are standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB\">sRGB</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_RGB_color_space\">Adobe RGB</a>. Of course, for this to work, the whole reproduction chain must follow the same standard.</p> <p>The argument for using Adobe RGB is that it\u2019s wider and includes most of the colours that a CMYK printer can print. That should be better. The argument for using 8-bit sRGB is that practically every device supports it well, and some devices don\u2019t support anything else.</p> <p>If you\u2019re producing images for internet distribution and on-screen viewing, I think you are better off sticking to sRGB. If you\u2019re producing images for some form of printing, there\u2019s an argument for using Adobe RGB, as long as you can be sure it will be printed that way. You\u2019d have to check this with your online printing service.

      "bodyText": "I read your answer about the best computer monitor for under \u00a3200. I\u2019m looking for a monitor for serious photo editing. I want to get as true to what the print will be like (when printing via online printers). My budget is about \u00a3300. Pa Sad to say, prints can never look like screen images. Screens are bright and display colours using combinations of red, green and blue pixels (RGB). Prints don\u2019t light up so they can\u2019t have the same brightness or contrast range, and they\u2019re printed using cyan, yellow, magenta and black inks (CMYK). Colours are also affected by the light under which you view things, which is why smart buyers take clothes and materials to shop doorways to see what the colours look like in daylight. Do you do the same thing when viewing prints? A print viewed under warm room lighting should not look the same as it does on a monitor set to the standard daylight colour temperature of 6500K, even though your brain will automatically try to compensate for the difference. Nonetheless, photographers can learn from experience of how colours are going to be reproduced, as long as the process is consistent. I was obliged to do this in the days before personal computing, when I edited photography magazines. Today\u2019s DSLR cameras produce images that are much like the colour slides we used to view on lightboxes, so happily this skill has transferred. However, the more variables you can eliminate, the better your guesses should be. This is where colour gamuts, screen calibration, printer profiles and, yes, standard light sources can help. A thought experiment\u2026 There should be a way to get the screen image closer to the print, but it would be quite a lot of work, expensive, and you probably won\u2019t like it. First, get a calibration device such as an X-Rite i1 Display Pro (\u00a3178) or a Datacolor\u2019s Spyder5 Elite (also \u00a3178). Next, calibrate your monitor to match the printer and paper you\u2019re using. In other words, adjust the screen display so that the white matches the white of your paper, and the black matches the maximum black that ink can produce on that particular paper. It\u2019s better to print a colour patch or test card, rather than a naturalistic image where the brain can interfere with the colour rendering. Fujifilm has a good composite test card. I\u2019ve never actually tried this, but I imagine the monitor display would be disappointing. You\u2019d have reduced the brightness and contrast range, and most people like bright, contrasty screens. I\u2019m also not sure how well this would work when using an online printer rather than your own ink-jet. If they do their own colour profiling, their software might try to compensate for yours. You could certainly ask if their printer will respect your colour management profiles (there are \u201cpreserve embedded profiles\u201d settings for RGB and CMYK in Adobe Photoshop), but affordable colour printing is based on a high level of automation. Colour-accurate monitors If your monitor produces accurate colour and the printer produces accurate colour, then the results ought to be predictable, even though the images are not identical. This is the device-independent solution that underlies the traditional answer, which is to buy a monitor with an accurate colour profile. The main ones are standard sRGB and Adobe RGB. Of course, for this to work, the whole reproduction chain must follow the same standard. The argument for using Adobe RGB is that it\u2019s wider and includes most of the colours that a CMYK printer can print. That should be better. The argument for using 8-bit sRGB is that practically every device supports it well, and some devices don\u2019t support anything else. If you\u2019re producing images for internet distribution and on-screen viewing, I think you are better off sticking to sRGB. If you\u2019re producing images for some form of printing, there\u2019s an argument for using Adobe RGB, as long as you can be sure it will be printed that way. You\u2019d have to check this with your online printing service. The websites I looked at all requested sRGB. Another advantage of using sRGB is that it sets a lower standard that cheap monitors can meet, though better Adobe RGB scores generally indicate a better quality monitor. In passing, \u201cthe whole chain\u201d ought to include the camera, and you can set some (most?) serious cameras \u2013 including my own Nikon D7500 \u2013 to produce Jpeg images to either sRGB or Adobe RGB standards. This doesn\u2019t mean the colours will be accurate: most cameras give pictures a pleasantly warm boost.

But it was the Japanese who found an extra gear in the third, returning to some of the aggressive, fine-margin tennis that saw her power through the opening set - one break proving enough to grind out a three-set thriller in just shy of two hours. 56 winners and 15 aces from the world No 4; who could leap to world No 1 with a win here in Melbourne.</p> \n  <p>Her opponent in the final Petra Kvitova also has eyes on that prize, after she progressed in relatively easier fashion against the unseeded American Danielle Collins. In sweltering Melbourne heat, where the temperature rose to 40 degrees centigrade, the Czech had to battle heat as well as the determined outsider Collins. Kvitova looked there for the taking in a tough first set, but the decision to close the roof with the match poised at 4-4 seemed to help settle the Czech, who closed down the match superbly 7-6 (7-2), 6-0 with powerful serving and clever ground strokes.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s all for now - we\u2019ll be back later tonight with the first of our men\u2019s semi-finals. Don\u2019t miss it, as Rafael Nadal faces the Federer-slayer, Greece\u2019s Stefanos Tsitsipas, live from Rod Laver Arena.

      "bodyText": "So, it ends on the narrowest of calls, but with a consistent quality of tennis that you\u2019d expect from two semi-finals. It loomed for the merest of moments as a potential all-Czech final as Karolina Pliskova threatened to back up from her heroics last night in defeating Serena Williams during a pulsating second set in which she was nearly flawless, levelling the ledger against Naomi Osaka. But it was the Japanese who found an extra gear in the third, returning to some of the aggressive, fine-margin tennis that saw her power through the opening set - one break proving enough to grind out a three-set thriller in just shy of two hours. 56 winners and 15 aces from the world No 4; who could leap to world No 1 with a win here in Melbourne. Her opponent in the final Petra Kvitova also has eyes on that prize, after she progressed in relatively easier fashion against the unseeded American Danielle Collins. In sweltering Melbourne heat, where the temperature rose to 40 degrees centigrade, the Czech had to battle heat as well as the determined outsider Collins. Kvitova looked there for the taking in a tough first set, but the decision to close the roof with the match poised at 4-4 seemed to help settle the Czech, who closed down the match superbly 7-6 (7-2), 6-0 with powerful serving and clever ground strokes. That\u2019s all for now - we\u2019ll be back later tonight with the first of our men\u2019s semi-finals. Don\u2019t miss it, as Rafael Nadal faces the Federer-slayer, Greece\u2019s Stefanos Tsitsipas, live from Rod Laver Arena. Thanks for your company! Serving for the match, Osaka puffs out her cheeks and draws a deep breath after she finds the net with an unforced error to make it 15-15. Is the pressure showing? Another unforced error sees Pliskova level again at 30-30 but the Japanese keeps her cool to bring up match point! She aces, or at least she thinks she does, but the call is out. She challenges, naturally, and would you believe it, she\u2019s bang on! The ball clipped the line and Osaka is in the semis! We said it was a game of margins, and a brave Pliskova bows out - game, set, match Osaka! Third set: Pliskova* 4-5 Osaka (*denotes server): And under huge pressure the Czech holds on; dramatic tennis, as you\u2019d expect in a semi-final, with a shot at becoming world No 1 for both women also on the line. Osaka pushes for the match, but Pliskova hangs in. The Japanese to serve for the match. Third set: Pliskova 3-5 Osaka* (*denotes server): A key third point as Osaka offers up a second serve with the score 15-all. But Pliskova drags her shot long. The Czech then misses a winner by millimetres, but returns well to force 30-40. Another strong return draws the Osaka error for deuce - here we go? And another excellent deep return at the feet of Osaka draws a shot that drifts long. Break point - and she fires an ace to the corner! Her 14th of the night. Pressure tennis, this. And Osaka holds. Third set: Pliskova* 3-4 Osaka (*denotes server): Pliskova again finding joy with the pinning serve; she\u2019s not enjoyed too many aces tonight (still just the one?) but she\u2019s targeting her opponent well. Osaka pounces on a weak second serve and fires a cross-court forehand, but Pliskova holds well. She still trails the one break though. Third set: Pliskova 2-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): The crowd very much behind the young Japanese, despite the quality tennis from both players, and they squeal with delight as she rattles off another service game to love. An interest patch here, with both players holding well, almost for the first time all match. Third set: Pliskova* 2-3 Osaka (*denotes server): Solid service game, and she kicks wide and curling to evade Osaka. Important steadying game for the Czech. Third set: Pliskova 1-3 Osaka* (*denotes server): Just what the doctor ordered as Osaka flies to 40-0, a run of nine consecutive points. Pliskova fires one back, but it\u2019s a relatively comfortable service game for the Japanese. Now to try and turn the screws on her opponent\u2019s serve. Third set: Pliskova* 1-2 Osaka (*denotes server): Wowee. This match is see-sawing dramatically. Osaka with a big winner, before she digs out a tough cramping serve to open up three break points. She wins to love - could that be the decisive break? The way the last fifteen minutes has played out you wouldn\u2019t bet on it. But a big service game from Osaka here could spark a run. Third set: Pliskova 1-1 Osaka* (*denotes server): A big winner fires the Japanese after dropping the opening point. She follows with a curling ace and the crowd respond to lift. A big return from Pliskova earns a break point, but Osaka saves it with a fiercely struck forehand, and fires off a big \u201cCome on\u201d! She drags a forehand just long and Pliskova looks at a second break point - again though it\u2019s a bigger winner down the line from Osaka to save. Pliskova earns a third break chance with a big winner of her own, but she just clips the tape of the net on the next and slams her racquet in frustration. Osaka eventually holds - what a marathon game! Third set: Pliskova* 1-0 Osaka (*denotes server): Pliskova pins her opponent again with the serve; that\u2019s the risk when standing so close while receiving, I guess. The radar is looking better tuned now from Pliskova and she opens the third set with a hold. Just three errors in that entire second set - she may have started it a woman looking like she\u2019d played her final yesterday (against Serena Williams) but Pliskova finishes it like a woman who means business. It\u2019s a shot dragged long from Osaka to open, before a powerful forehand clips the tape and drops fortuitously over for Pliskova. She offers the customary apology, but it can barely conceal her pleasure. What a time of the match for a moment like that! An error from Osaka offers up three set points, and Pliskova is good enough to take the first. Well, this is a turn about. One set a piece: game on! Second set: Pliskova* 5-4 Osaka (*denotes server): It starts comfortably for the Czech, but a big Osaka forehand in the corner and then a double fault open a small window. Pliskova looking much stronger in this second set though, and she holds to put the pressure on Osaka. Second set: Pliskova 4-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): Pliskova with a big forehand winner down the line off a looping second serve, but Osaka punches a sharp jabbed backhand winner in return. They trade blows like two heavyweight boxers as Pliskova slogs a winner down the line for deuce. Osaka survives a break point, and rattles off a big winner to hold. A huge game. Pliskova was almost serving for the second set. Second set: Pliskova* 4-3 Osaka (*denotes server): A terrific rally on the second point, as Pliskova again forces her opponent to cover a stack of ground. A first ace of the match - remarkably - takes the Czech to 40-15 and she closes out the game well. Second set: Pliskova 3-3 Osaka* (*denotes server): Booming ace down the T to open - a seventh of the match so far. She drops a solitary point through a double fault, but it\u2019s a temporary blip as the Japanese closes with an ace. Second set: Pliskova* 3-2 Osaka (*denotes server): First look at a second serve and Osaka monsters it from a metre inside the baseline. Pliskova comes to the net next point, but Osaka fires a cross-court winner past her. Pliskova then pins her with a well-directed serve, before the Japanese reels off another powerful forehand winner. A real battle, but she holds the Czech - a big game. Second set: Pliskova 2-2 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka fires some near perfect shots, deep and under the feet of the 6ft+ Czech, before serving well, to round out a first game of the match to love. Second set: Pliskova* 2-1 Osaka (*denotes server): It\u2019s advantage the returner as Osaka races to bring up three break points, 0-40. Pliskova saves the first, and the second, and then the third after a hard-fought rally. Three big first serves to dig her way out of a hole, and that\u2019s a great service hold, and perhaps a big morale boost too. Second set: Pliskova 1-1 Osaka* (*denotes server): Pliskova with a strong winner down the line, before Osaka punches one wide. The Czech brings up two break points, Osaka saves the first with an ace, but she can\u2019t prevent the second. A break straight back - this is more positive from the world No 7. Second set: Pliskova* 0-1 Osaka (*denotes server): She\u2019s creating angles from nowhere, Osaka, as she fires a sharp cross-court forehand winner to start the game, before firing a winner down the line. She misses the overhead smash, to allow Pliskova a foothold back in the game. But Osaka pounces once again - a set and now a break; it\u2019s a blistering start for the Japanese. Pliskova draws the error on the opening point as she mixes her pace on returns, but Osaka fires an ace in response. Osaka challenges an out call and is proved correct by a few millimetre, and turns round a crucial point for 40-30. Then closes with a big ace. Upon such fine margins championship matches can turn! First set: Pliskova* 2-5 Osaka (*denotes server): Terrific rally on the fourth point, Osaka like an spring ready to uncoil on every groundstroke. Pliskova works her well to the edges, but the Japanese punches a winner. The Czech saves a break point with a fine backhand winner, but Osaka forces her through two deuces. A double fault hands her younger opponent a second break, and a chance to serve for the set. First set: Pliskova 2-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): Few chinks in the armour on that service game, as Osaka drops just one point. She serves well to the edges, and attacks each shot with verve, rattling off several winners. First set: Pliskova* 2-3 Osaka (*denotes server): Far more comfortable on serve from the Czech, and she makes short work of that game. Now to put pressure on Osaka\u2019s serve. First set: Pliskova 1-3 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka looking really sharp, and she drops just one point during a pretty comfortable service game. But it\u2019s her speed across the court that\u2019s worrying Pliskova. What can the Czech come up with over the next few games? First set: Pliskova* 1-2 Osaka (*denotes server): A huge return of serve from Osaka gets Pliskova on the run before a double fault brings up two break points. She saves the first with a well worked rally, before cramping Osaka on the next with a clever serve. Osaka works her opponent well after a blistering winner down the line though, and she grabs the first break of the match! First set: Pliskova 1-1 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka drops the opening two points but builds her way into the game. A big ace at 30-30 helps steady the early nerves but again it goes to deuce. Pliskova also pouncing on the early second serves, but she can\u2019t quite fashion the break. Osaka holds, as Pliskova makes any early unsuccessful challenge to a line call. First set: Pliskova* 1-0 Osaka (*denotes server): The tall Czech serves first with noticeable taping on her left knee. Hopefully that won\u2019t affect her game today. It\u2019s a mixed bag as Osaka looks to attack the second serve early and earns herself a break point. But Pliskova fires a strong serve down the T to save, before holding the game following a long rally. Both players make their way out onto the Rod Laver Arena, first Pliskova, followed closely by Osaka. A decent reception for both, but the Australian crowd leaning slightly towards Osaka in terms of support. And it\u2019s hit 40 degrees in Melbourne. So much for a top of 36, predicted pre-game! They begin their warm ups. Pliskova with a 6cm height advantage over her opponent; she\u2019s never won a grand slam, despite making No 1 a few years back. Osaka, of course with the one grand slam victory, in that remarkable win at the US Open against Serena Williams last year. So, to find out who will be Kvitova\u2019s opponent in the final, and on to our second semi-final, between Karolina Pliskova and Naomi Osaka. There were some shots of Osaka earlier taking a keen look at the \u201cheat stress\u201d index graphic just before the roof was closed. My understanding is we\u2019ll stay with the roof closed for this second semi - not sure if that will favour anyone in particular. A relieved Kvitova talks to Jim Courier. \u201cThe first set was very tight for myself, I\u2019m really glad it came (together) in the tie-break.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad the roof closed, I prefer to play indoor.\u201d Certainly it was something that seemed to change proceedings, with the game tight at 4-4, and Kvitova\u2019s serve getting noticeably better in the controlled environment. Still, her ground game proved too strong for Collins, and surely nobody would malign the Czech a finals appearance. A big volley from the net, a strong serve down the T, a forehand from Collins dragged wide, and she finishes with a big forehand winner! And so ends the brave run of the unseeded Danielle Collins - but it\u2019s a return to a grand slam final for Petra Kvitova! Second set: Kvitova 5-0 Collins* (*denotes server): She won\u2019t go down without swinging, however Collins. After some shaky serves she runs Kvitova from corner to corner, winning a long baseline volley before smashing a high double-backhander cross-court. Kvitova steels herself with a punchy return of serve, before Collins misses a drop shot. And the Czech leaps on yet another second serve to break for a third time this set. Second set: Kvitova* 4-0 Collins (*denotes server): She has arguably the best service game of the four remaining women, and in the controlled conditions the tall left hander begins to consistently hit her strides. Collins no chance on a sliding serve out wide, but she anticipates an overhead volley from the net well to scramble to 30-30. Kvitova closes out the game calmly though, and holds. Second set: Kvitova 3-0 Collins* (*denotes server): A rare foray to the net from Collins, but the Czech is good enough to loop her opponent, and then comes to the net herself to line up two break points. Huge cross-court backhand to win it, and Kvitova brings up a second break. Second set: Kvitova* 2-0 Collins (*denotes server): Kvitova begins to find her groove, firing some strong first and second serves, and races through the game, dropping just one point. Collins needs to find something, including some more first serves if she\u2019s to chase this match. Second set: Kvitova 1-0 Collins* (*denotes server): Now Collins argues the toss after a faulty let call. It\u2019s one thing to be \u201cfeisty\u201d, but she seems rattled here. A second mechanical let call sounds on a fault and the American is deeply unhappy in not being allowed to reserve. Trailing 15-40 she changes her racquet, and saves a break with a sharp forehand winner. But she misses one from the deep, and Kvitova enjoys an early break. We start on serve, but it\u2019s a first mini-break to Kvitova as Collins cries in frustration as the Czech fires a forehand deep and fast to the corner. Collins clips the tape to go down 3-1, before framing a serve deep. Kvitova fires a backhand winner to race to 5-1. Collins argues the toss with the chair umpire Carlos Ramos as a serve is called wide. Kvitova fires an ace down the T, then volleys home from the net. Ice cool, from the now cooled down Czech - who fires a glowering look back over the net. First set, Kvitova. First set: Kvitova 6-6 Collins* (*denotes server): The game opens with a 17-hit rally, and it\u2019s Kvitova who seems to expend the most energy during it. Collins races to 40-0 as Kvitova punches a wild forehand well wide. Another love hold, and we have a tie-break. First set: Kvitova* 6-5 Collins (*denotes server): Why all this temperature chat matters is of course that with the roof closed, serving conditions are now a little more comfortable. In theory that aids Kvitova, but there are plenty of permutations such as racquet tension, ball speed etc that are affected, and require adjustment. Kvitova doesn\u2019t make light work of her second service game in the new conditions, being dragged to deuce with an unforced error. She holds on the first advantage point though, and pumps the fist. First set: Kvitova 5-5 Collins* (*denotes server): So much for that pre-game forecast of 33; it\u2019s just hit 38 degrees in Melbourne, hence the roof closing. At least we\u2019re not in Adelaide today, it\u2019s 47. Collins continues to miss her first serve, but she\u2019s defending her second serves well. Kvitova misses a straight-forward enough drop shop, and Collins holds - snarling a glare over the net at her opponent. First set: Kvitova* 5-4 Collins (*denotes server): So we recommence after a 6-7 minute break as the roof is closed. Both women are beginning to become more vocal as Collins rattles off a big \u201cCome on\u201d after firing a blistering forehand winner. The let cord gives Kvitova a lucky drop and she offers her opponent the customary apology. She goes on to hold, as Collins cries out in frustration after a return flies long. And, hello \u201cheat stress\u201d - our tournament referee has come lurking out of the shadows to announce the roof will be closed, with the on-court heat stress indicator hitting 5. Collins argues the toss, but to no avail. She presumably fancies her chances against Kvitova in the heat, but that\u2019s moot now, the roof shuts. First set: Kvitova 4-4 Collins* (*denotes server): New balls and Collins utilises the extra pace well, racing through her service game. Big forehand down the line on route to a first hold to love of the game. First set: Kvitova* 4-3 Collins (*denotes server): A positive start for the Czech, who fires a booming ace down the T, then snaps a forehand winner down the line to race to 40-0. Kvitova then with a double fault before Collins fires a sliced return that earns the crowd\u2019s admiration. Kvitova steadies however, and holds. First set: Kvitova 3-3 Collins* (*denotes server): Collins striding between serves with purpose but again her first serve percentage remains low. Kvitova monsters a few second serves. An errant forehand from Kvitova sees her miss a chance to break straight back, and again she fires long on a second break point. Collins saves to deuce before Kvitova snarls off her first celebratory growl of the day after bringing up a fourth break point. Collins fires back an ace to save, but it\u2019s fifth time a charm, as Kvitova breaks straight back. First set: Kvitova* 2-3 Collins (*denotes server): Both players are retreating to the shade at the back of the court between serves, and it\u2019s Kvitova who blinks first, allowing her opponent a look at two break points. Collins squanders the first as Kvitova fires a second serve up the T, but a terrific cross-court backhand secures the break! First blood, Collins. First set: Kvitova 2-2 Collins* (*denotes server): Kvitova prowling very much inside the baseline looking to pressurise the Collins serve, it doesn\u2019t come off to start with, but she fires another forehand winner to bring it back to 30-15. Collins mixes up her pace to draw the error on return, but another double fault puts her under pressure. Kvitova challenges a line call but it\u2019s long. Collins holds. First set: Kvitova* 2-1 Collins (*denotes server): Huge serve to the American\u2019s backhand for Kvitova, who then rattles of a strong winner. Another baseline rally sees Kvitova fire long, but she snaps a forehand cross-court to take the game. A note on the heat, I was perhaps a touch blas\u00e9 earlier - the new \u201cheat index\u201d is being looked at quite closely; should it persist much higher we could see a temperature break. First set: Kvitova 1-1 Collins* (*denotes server): Collins starts brightly, racing through the first points before Kvitova launches a fine cross-court winner. A double fault and a nervy second serve brings the world No 6 to the net, but she only finds the tape. Collins settles to hold. First set: Kvitova* 1-0 Collins (*denotes server): Kvitova serves first and starts by losing the first point before blasting the second past Collins\u2019 forehand. The American attacks the serve well to take 15-30, but a long rally sees the Czech fire a precision pass to level. Kvitova steadies and holds. Both players have headed out on to Rod Laver court and begun their warm ups; so we\u2019re not too far away with live action. Flicking through the history books re an unseeded player running deep into the tournament, here\u2019s the seeding of the player that\u2019s won the women\u2019s singles over the last ten years or so: 5, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 7, 2, 2. The year before that (in 2007) it was in fact an unseeded player who won, but that was Serena Williams; so not exactly an unknown quantity. Before that? Christine O\u2019Neil in 1978. Much has been made of Collins\u2019 mental toughness, we\u2019ll see how she fares on that front shortly. Obviously the grand slam title is the thing at this stage of the tournament, but an interesting subplot is who will be crowned women\u2019ss world No 1 come tournament\u2019s end? Simona Halep\u2019s exit at the hands of Serena Williams means one of three women could claim the crown - including Petra Kvitova - with our second semi-finalists Naomi Osaka and Karolina Pliskova also in the frame. She\u2019s never been to the summit before, Kvitova (although she climbed to world No 2 in 2011) - will that add pressure or provide extra incentive for the Czech today? It\u2019s a crisp 33 degrees in Melbourne today, with tops of 36. So positively balmy given recent temperatures. It shouldn\u2019t affect players too much, but we\u2019ll watch that as the matches progress. If you\u2019re just waking up from an extensive slumber and double checking your guides as to who Danielle Collins is, here\u2019s a fine backgrounder from Whitney McIntosh on the unseeded American: Some terrific quotes, here. \u201cI\u2019m feisty. I love making it kind of a war. If somebody wants to get in my face on my unforced errors, I have no problem getting right back\u201d. Your move, Kvitova. Hello to all and sundry - good evening, good morning, to thee and thine from wherever you\u2019re following Guardian Australia\u2019s coverage today. It\u2019s Richard Parkin in the chair, and as ever please enlighten your fellow readers with your best insights, witticisms and general observations. Fire me an email or tweet to join the coverage. First up, who do you fancy to win today, and why? And so to the day after the night before. With the dramatic late capitulation of Serena Williams the women\u2019s draw at the Australian Open has been blown wide open. Today we find out who will capitalise on that space. Danielle Collins has had a fairytale run at the tournament, as the scourge of both Julia Goerges and Angelique Kerber looks to continue her remarkable run. Standing her way is Petra Kvitova who must certainly be eyeing a third grand slam with the biggest guns in the women\u2019s draw falling before the semi finals. We\u2019ll have first action shortly, so put your kettle to the metal and clear your evenings, it\u2019s women\u2019s semi-finals action, live from Melbourne.",

      "body": "<p>Don\u2019t tell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a>, but Britain wasn\u2019t always an island. It used to be part of the European landmass, connected by a territory called Doggerland, which was located beneath what is now the North Sea, between Suffolk and Holland. Doggerland was fertile, rich and marshy, and supported an abundance of animals as well as successive eras of human life, from Neanderthals to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Around 6,000 years ago, it was inundated by rising sea levels and disappeared beneath the waves, though traces of its presence frequently resurface. Dutch trawlers dredge up mammoth bones alongside wriggling fish; divers encounter submerged forests; the jaws of rhinoceroses crop up on beaches after storms.</p> <p>Julia Blackburn, who lives in Suffolk, became interested in Doggerland in the wake of her husband Herman Makkink\u2019s death in 2013. Makkink was a Dutch artist (he made the sinister phallic murder weapon in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/11/a-clockwork-orange-cannes\" title=\"\">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>), and there was something magnetic about the idea of this vanished territory that had once connected their two homelands. A magpie anyway, eyes to the ground, always turning up oddities, she\u2019d become fascinated by the immense age of the worked flints and fossilised bones she kept finding in the eroding cliffs of Covehithe beach, a place where \u201cthings \u2026 often appear magically out of nowhere and then vanish with an equal magic\u201d.</p> <p>As in her last book, <em>Threads</em>, a loosely woven study of the fisherman-turned-artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/13/life-on-rocks-john-craske-saved-by-sea\" title=\"\">John Craske</a>, Blackburn conducts her investigations by way of a sort of stubborn pottering. It is research as beachcombing, patiently sifting, waiting to see what the tide has brought in. The story of Doggerland and its enigmatic inhabitants accumulates via dreamy, seemingly half-distracted anecdotes and encounters, not only with professional experts in the Mesolithic and Palaeolithic, but also with local fossil finders and treasure hunters, their garages stuffed with ice\u2011cream tubs of Roman coins and ammonites.</p> <p>Like Blackburn, all of them are fascinated by the relics of deep time, gummed in the mud beneath their feet. There\u2019s Ray the slaughterman, who found a medieval well after a storm, and the Dutch custom inspector Dick Moll, whose house is crammed with mammoth bones and molars and who gives Blackburn a parting gift of mammoth hair, \u201cvery red and pubic\u201d. But the most spectacular find belongs to Bob Mutch, a disabled former bank manager who discovered the worked flints that put the presence of humans in Britain back by 200,000 years. \u201cStill,\u201d he says laconically, \u201cit was quite a thing to know you\u2019re the first person to touch it since Pioneer Man came over from Europe.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>On Goldcliff island, Blackburn sees tiny pockmarks in the mud: rain falling on a particular day between 5500 and 5200BC</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These encounters are interspersed by what Blackburn calls \u201ctime songs\u201d, 18 elliptical, quasi-poetic summaries of books and interviews, condensing dense compendia of information into something not so much like songs as lecture notes. Many explain the great eras of geological time (\u201cthe isotypes take me back / Forty thousand years\u201d), one describes the discovery of the Sweet Track in Somerset, another retells a folktale about beavers. They share a slightly awkward quality, but what they do transmit is a sense of intense effort, like being with someone who is listening very hard.</p> <p>There has always been a speculative, unsteady quality to Blackburn\u2019s writing. She doesn\u2019t so much research the past as think her way into absences: Goya, Napoleon, Billie Holiday, a partisan village in wartime Liguria. Practice work, she calls it, looking at the meadow behind her house and imagining the castle that was once there, or gazing out at the familiar grey waves and trying to will time backwards, the sea receding, the forests restored. It\u2019s an approach that more than once recalls Ursula Le Guin\u2019s beguiling work of future-archaeology, <em>Always Coming Home</em>. \u201cI told myself,\u201d Blackburn writes, \u201cthat the answer lies in the pleasure of the doing, the pleasure of diving down into one\u2019s uncertainty and finding a way back to the shore.\u201d</p> <p>Gradually, the people come into view. People who lived very lightly, stopping for a night and moving on, knapping tools to butcher an animal and immediately discarding them. The traces of their existence are minuscule: a few stone axes and arrows, the remains of a basket. On Goldcliff island in the Severn estuary, Blackburn sees tiny pockmarks in the mud: rain falling on a particular day between 5500 and 5200BC. Nearby are human footprints: two small children, aged five or six, struggling with their balance, and an adult who slips in the mud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06c5009ef31d29b42e2135363b8760367360ccc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06c5009ef31d29b42e2135363b8760367360ccc3/0_123_3720_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rotting wood from old pilings at Goldcliff, Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rotting wood from old pilings at Goldcliff, Wales.

Blackburn draws on material from more recent hunter-gatherer cultures like the /Xam Bushmen and Netsilik Inuit, as well as her own experiences with the Indigenous Australians she encountered while writing her 1994 book <em>Daisy Bates in the Desert</em>. But she also does something more subtle, an interweaving or drawing together of times, juxtaposing the now and the then until the gap contracts. Tenses shift abruptly, within the field of a paragraph. She describes a Mesolithic burial, a baby cradled on a swan\u2019s outstretched wing, and then, casually, her own husband\u2019s cremation, the way they painted the cardboard coffin with a jagged line of red ochre, for the mountains he loved, and crowned it with a circlet of ivy.</p> <p>The deliberate inconsequentialities begin to gather meaning. The people now, with their lop-eared rabbits and clumber spaniels, eating muffins and losing their phones, seem consolingly similar to the vanished hunter-gatherers who preceded them, flanked by dogs, gathering samphire and sliding in the mud. \u201cThe people who lived here,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s not quite clear which ones she means.</p> <p>In Denmark, she visits Tollund Man, the revenant found in 1950 in a Jutland bog, where he had lain for at least 2,000 years. He looks like her husband, she thinks, in the last days of his life. Sitting beside him on a little stool, she feels \u201cas if he was about to laugh at a joke that had appeared in his dream and there was a sense that although his eyes were closed they were not fully closed and he could see me, could see any one of his visitors, at the point where the eyelids let in a narrow strip of light\u201d.</p> <p>There is something of the <em>ubi sunt</em> tradition about all this. The question of where the dead go \u2013 <em>ubi sunt qui ante nos fuer</em><em>unt</em>, or \u201cwhere are those who have gone before us\u201d \u2013 was a pervasive theme in Anglo-Saxon and Middle English literature. Vanished but close, Doggerland serves as a ready metaphor for lost things, the extinct and the dead. Perhaps it\u2019s simply a mark of Blackburn\u2019s attention to fragility, but it\u2019s noticeable that many of her Doggerland interlocutors are ill, limping after Lyme disease or crippled with spinal muscular atrophy.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Herman, gone but not gone, little fragments of his presence washing up all the time. How can it be said that death is any kind of end, when it is so apparent that people don\u2019t entirely go away, but linger and return? Blackburn is keener on the notion of what one of her scientists calls \u201cprocess\u201d: the way people, animals, even objects continue after death, transitioning through forms, a slow scattering into parts that will last hundreds, thousands, even millions of years.</p> <p>There are so many losses behind us. Deep time is comprised of endless seemingly cataclysmic events, eras of extreme cold and heat, mass extinctions followed by stubborn regeneration.

One issue surely to be glossed over, if not completely ignored, is the persistence of racial segregation. Even writing it feels off-topic, like referring to an anachronism. We have become so habituated to the ingrained treads of our racial geography that they are unremarkable. When segregation is remarked upon, it is almost always in reference to the <em>histories</em> of public policy and private action that were necessary to the invention of \u201cblack neighborhoods\u201d or \u201cwhite suburbs\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v2/index.html?vertical=opinion&amp;opinion-tint=true&amp;title=Antiracism%20and%20America&amp;description=A%20collaboration%20between%20The%20Guardian%20and%20American%20University%E2%80%99s%20Antiracist%20Research%20and%20Policy%20Center%2C%20Antiracism%20and%20America%20is%20an%20ongoing%20series%20that%20sheds%20light%20on%20the%20structures%20at%20the%20root%20of%20racial%20inequities.%20It%20highlights%20the%20ideas%20of%20writers%2C%20scholars%2C%20activists%2C%20and%20others%20focused%20on%20dismantling%20these%20structures%20in%20an%20attempt%20to%20move%20to%20an%20antiracist%20America%0A&amp;link-1-headline=What%20led%20Chicago%20to%20shutter%20dozens%20of%20majority-black%20schools%3F%20Racism&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2Fa4zz8&amp;link-2-headline=This%20is%20what%20an%20antiracist%20America%20would%20look%20like.%20How%20do%20we%20get%20there%3F&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2Fa4zzc&amp;link-3-headline=&amp;link-3-url=&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2Fseries%2Fantiracism-and-america\" data-alt=\"...\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v2/index.html?vertical=opinion&opinion-tint=true&title=Antiracism%20and%20America&description=A%20collaboration%20between%20The%20Guardian%20and%20American%20University%E2%80%99s%20Antiracist%20Research%20and%20Policy%20Center%2C%20Antiracism%20and%20America%20is%20an%20ongoing%20series%20that%20sheds%20light%20on%20the%20structures%20at%20the%20root%20of%20racial%20inequities.%20It%20highlights%20the%20ideas%20of%20writers%2C%20scholars%2C%20activists%2C%20and%20others%20focused%20on%20dismantling%20these%20structures%20in%20an%20attempt%20to%20move%20to%20an%20antiracist%20America%0A&link-1-headline=What%20led%20Chicago%20to%20shutter%20dozens%20of%20majority-black%20schools%3F%20Racism&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2Fa4zz8&link-2-headline=This%20is%20what%20an%20antiracist%20America%20would%20look%20like.%20How%20do%20we%20get%20there%3F&link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2Fa4zzc&link-3-headline=&link-3-url=&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2Fseries%2Fantiracism-and-america\">...</a> </figure>  <p>In other words, residential segregation and discrimination in the American housing market are considered historical matters. That the nefarious operations of the Federal Housing Administration have come to light and redlining has become more widely understood have not been enough to generate the urgency necessary to dismantling today\u2019s unjust housing practices. Consider the muted recognition of the 50th anniversary of the 1968 Fair Housing Act.</p> <p>In its time, federal fair housing, which entailed the right to be free of racial discrimination in the housing market, was hailed as the crowning achievement of the \u201crights revolution\u201d of the 1960s. But the effects of \u201cfair housing\u201d have been imperceptible in large swaths of the country, where poor and working-class African Americans live in racially segregated enclaves. The reluctant celebrations of the Fair Housing Act\u2019s milestone anniversary this past year were rooted in the basic fact that racism continues to pervade the American housing market. This reality was made worse by the selection of the underwhelming neurosurgeon Ben Carson as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Carson has characterized the formal objectives of the Fair Housing Act, including the affirmative pursuit of racially and ethnically mixed communities, as \u201csocial engineering\u201d. He has worked to undo the legally mandated responsibility of Hud to not only fight racial discrimination but to pursue integrated communities where it can.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The effects of 'fair housing' have been imperceptible in large swaths of the country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But even before the neurosurgeon took a sledgehammer to the stated mission of Hud, the agency was hardly effective in rooting out discrimination. If there were any questions, they had to have been snuffed out by the housing collapse that precipitated the economy crisis of 2008 \u2013 the anniversary of which was also scarcely observed. When the dust settled, more than 240,000 African Americans had lost their homes to foreclosure because of predatory home loans they had been targeted and manipulated into taking. The story of real estate racism and the subprime loan market is an old one now, but it served as a reminder that no matter the language of the law regarding \u201cfair housing\u201d, racism in the housing market persisted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/ben-carson-housing-department-mission-statement-discrimination-inclusion\">Ben Carson's housing agency drops pledge to end housing discrimination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The destruction of the value of black housing 10 years ago has set the stage for revamped exploitative practices that view African American communities as sites of extraction instead of investment. In cities that suffered some of the greatest housing losses, like Chicago and Detroit, there has been a resurgence of \u201cland installment contract\u201d sales on homes for those whose credit won\u2019t allow them to secure conventional loans. Disproportionately elevated rates of poverty, few financially meaningful assets, and rock-bottom wealth accumulation have combined with racist assumptions in this contemporary moment to, once again, marginalize prospective black property owners.</p> <p>Across the country, African Americans are being denied mortgages at rates dramatically higher than their white peers. In Philadelphia, for instance, African Americans are almost three times more likely to be rejected for home loans than white people. As a result, the gap between black homeownership (44%) and white homeownership (69%) is enormous. The much discussed wealth disparity between African American and white families is deeply rooted in black marginalization within the housing market. In the US, where homeownership makes all the difference in terms of social and class mobility, African Americans\u2019 fraught access to this asset has put black families at a permanent disadvantage.</p> <p>And the rising costs of rent weigh heaviest on African Americans, who suffer from lower wages. Over the last year, rents have risen across the United States by 4% to an average of $1,209 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,442 for a two-bedroom apartment. In some cities, such as San Francisco, Boston, New York and Chicago, it is nearly impossible to find safe and sound apartments for these prices. As the cost of rent climbs above income, ordinary people face eviction, displacement and homelessness.</p> <p>Escalating rents can also help to constitute markets out of condemned and otherwise uninhabitable properties. In Philadelphia, hundreds of apartments have been legally designated as \u201cunfit for human habitation\u201d and yet landlords, often illegally, collect tens of thousands of dollars in rent on these dwellings. According to a Harvard study, between 2010 and 2017 prices \u201cin poor urban neighborhoods rose 50% faster than in rich neighborhoods\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/23/nowhere-for-people-to-go-who-will-survive-the-gentrification-of-atlanta\">Nowhere for people to go: who will survive the gentrification of Atlanta?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cities will often turn a blind eye in the cases of the most egregious housing abuses because they are not willing to create an alternative. Over the last two decades, tens of thousands of units of public housing have been destroyed, often on the lie that they would be replaced. But rather than replacing desperately needed public housing or developing concrete plans for refurbishing affordable housing, municipalities allow dangerous \u201clast resort\u201d housing to exist for its poorest, and often black, residents.</p> <p>In place of publicly financed and managed housing, housing vouchers that ostensibly allow holders to overcome the expense of rentals in better-resourced neighborhoods have been put forward. But renters wait for an average of 32 months to obtain vouchers in those states that still maintain waiting lists. And, with the exception of those living in Chicago, New York and Washington DC, no landlord is required to accept them. In a city like New Orleans, 99% of voucher recipients are African American and 82% percent of landlords refuse to accept vouchers. Even in cities where this practice is illegal, without a commitment and staffing to enforce anti-discrimination laws, there is very little to stop housing discrimination. The result is that poor and working-class black renters remain isolated in economically marginal neighborhoods. These are communities that have become ripe for human disposability. These are the food and job deserts where families are stranded by inadequate public transit systems and rising fuel costs. The divestment from these neighborhoods shows up in under-resourced public services and facilities like schools, hospitals, and libraries, all hemmed in by violent and abusive policing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The crises spawned by the spatial, economic and social isolation of African Americans are still generating consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While we may understand many of the roots of residential segregation, its persistence has created the perception that it is an unchanging, even permanent, fact of American life. The visual markers of a multiracial society \u2013 and the fact that racial boundaries that used to be virtually airtight have become somewhat more permeable \u2013 have, perhaps, mitigated the sense of urgency that residential segregation inspired 50 years ago. But the crises spawned by the spatial, economic and social isolation of African Americans throughout the 20th century are still generating consequences, even if we don\u2019t discuss them as such.</p> <p>Housing is central to the \u201cgood life\u201d in the United States. At the same time, America\u2019s governing bodies have abdicated a responsibility to house their residents to a private, profit-seeking sector that has played a historic role in the segregation of our cities and suburbs. The real estate industry has always relied on racism to generate profit for its stewards. It is, quite simply, why racism continues to flourish in the housing market a half-century after the Fair Housing Act was passed.</p> <p>Until we remove profitability from the equation and, instead, treat the right to safe and sound housing as a human and civil right, residential segregation will continue to thrive \u2013 and, in turn, drive up prices. The higher the costs of housing, the more those who suffer from lower wages and higher debt are forced to the margins of the market. African Americans are overrepresented in the group of people suffering from this inequality, demonstrating yet again how race is firmly linked to class in the United States.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As a new year begins and the 2020 presidential election looms closer, our political focus will start to narrow around the issues thought to be most urgent and likely to mobilize voters. One issue surely to be glossed over, if not completely ignored, is the persistence of racial segregation. Even writing it feels off-topic, like referring to an anachronism. We have become so habituated to the ingrained treads of our racial geography that they are unremarkable. When segregation is remarked upon, it is almost always in reference to the histories of public policy and private action that were necessary to the invention of \u201cblack neighborhoods\u201d or \u201cwhite suburbs\u201d. In other words, residential segregation and discrimination in the American housing market are considered historical matters. That the nefarious operations of the Federal Housing Administration have come to light and redlining has become more widely understood have not been enough to generate the urgency necessary to dismantling today\u2019s unjust housing practices. Consider the muted recognition of the 50th anniversary of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. In its time, federal fair housing, which entailed the right to be free of racial discrimination in the housing market, was hailed as the crowning achievement of the \u201crights revolution\u201d of the 1960s. But the effects of \u201cfair housing\u201d have been imperceptible in large swaths of the country, where poor and working-class African Americans live in racially segregated enclaves. The reluctant celebrations of the Fair Housing Act\u2019s milestone anniversary this past year were rooted in the basic fact that racism continues to pervade the American housing market. This reality was made worse by the selection of the underwhelming neurosurgeon Ben Carson as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Carson has characterized the formal objectives of the Fair Housing Act, including the affirmative pursuit of racially and ethnically mixed communities, as \u201csocial engineering\u201d. He has worked to undo the legally mandated responsibility of Hud to not only fight racial discrimination but to pursue integrated communities where it can. But even before the neurosurgeon took a sledgehammer to the stated mission of Hud, the agency was hardly effective in rooting out discrimination. If there were any questions, they had to have been snuffed out by the housing collapse that precipitated the economy crisis of 2008 \u2013 the anniversary of which was also scarcely observed. When the dust settled, more than 240,000 African Americans had lost their homes to foreclosure because of predatory home loans they had been targeted and manipulated into taking. The story of real estate racism and the subprime loan market is an old one now, but it served as a reminder that no matter the language of the law regarding \u201cfair housing\u201d, racism in the housing market persisted. The destruction of the value of black housing 10 years ago has set the stage for revamped exploitative practices that view African American communities as sites of extraction instead of investment. In cities that suffered some of the greatest housing losses, like Chicago and Detroit, there has been a resurgence of \u201cland installment contract\u201d sales on homes for those whose credit won\u2019t allow them to secure conventional loans. Disproportionately elevated rates of poverty, few financially meaningful assets, and rock-bottom wealth accumulation have combined with racist assumptions in this contemporary moment to, once again, marginalize prospective black property owners. Across the country, African Americans are being denied mortgages at rates dramatically higher than their white peers. In Philadelphia, for instance, African Americans are almost three times more likely to be rejected for home loans than white people. As a result, the gap between black homeownership (44%) and white homeownership (69%) is enormous. The much discussed wealth disparity between African American and white families is deeply rooted in black marginalization within the housing market. In the US, where homeownership makes all the difference in terms of social and class mobility, African Americans\u2019 fraught access to this asset has put black families at a permanent disadvantage. And the rising costs of rent weigh heaviest on African Americans, who suffer from lower wages. Over the last year, rents have risen across the United States by 4% to an average of $1,209 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,442 for a two-bedroom apartment. In some cities, such as San Francisco, Boston, New York and Chicago, it is nearly impossible to find safe and sound apartments for these prices. As the cost of rent climbs above income, ordinary people face eviction, displacement and homelessness. Escalating rents can also help to constitute markets out of condemned and otherwise uninhabitable properties. In Philadelphia, hundreds of apartments have been legally designated as \u201cunfit for human habitation\u201d and yet landlords, often illegally, collect tens of thousands of dollars in rent on these dwellings. According to a Harvard study, between 2010 and 2017 prices \u201cin poor urban neighborhoods rose 50% faster than in rich neighborhoods\u201d. Cities will often turn a blind eye in the cases of the most egregious housing abuses because they are not willing to create an alternative. Over the last two decades, tens of thousands of units of public housing have been destroyed, often on the lie that they would be replaced. But rather than replacing desperately needed public housing or developing concrete plans for refurbishing affordable housing, municipalities allow dangerous \u201clast resort\u201d housing to exist for its poorest, and often black, residents. In place of publicly financed and managed housing, housing vouchers that ostensibly allow holders to overcome the expense of rentals in better-resourced neighborhoods have been put forward. But renters wait for an average of 32 months to obtain vouchers in those states that still maintain waiting lists. And, with the exception of those living in Chicago, New York and Washington DC, no landlord is required to accept them. In a city like New Orleans, 99% of voucher recipients are African American and 82% percent of landlords refuse to accept vouchers. Even in cities where this practice is illegal, without a commitment and staffing to enforce anti-discrimination laws, there is very little to stop housing discrimination. The result is that poor and working-class black renters remain isolated in economically marginal neighborhoods. These are communities that have become ripe for human disposability. These are the food and job deserts where families are stranded by inadequate public transit systems and rising fuel costs. The divestment from these neighborhoods shows up in under-resourced public services and facilities like schools, hospitals, and libraries, all hemmed in by violent and abusive policing. While we may understand many of the roots of residential segregation, its persistence has created the perception that it is an unchanging, even permanent, fact of American life. The visual markers of a multiracial society \u2013 and the fact that racial boundaries that used to be virtually airtight have become somewhat more permeable \u2013 have, perhaps, mitigated the sense of urgency that residential segregation inspired 50 years ago. But the crises spawned by the spatial, economic and social isolation of African Americans throughout the 20th century are still generating consequences, even if we don\u2019t discuss them as such. Housing is central to the \u201cgood life\u201d in the United States. At the same time, America\u2019s governing bodies have abdicated a responsibility to house their residents to a private, profit-seeking sector that has played a historic role in the segregation of our cities and suburbs. The real estate industry has always relied on racism to generate profit for its stewards. It is, quite simply, why racism continues to flourish in the housing market a half-century after the Fair Housing Act was passed. Until we remove profitability from the equation and, instead, treat the right to safe and sound housing as a human and civil right, residential segregation will continue to thrive \u2013 and, in turn, drive up prices. The higher the costs of housing, the more those who suffer from lower wages and higher debt are forced to the margins of the market. African Americans are overrepresented in the group of people suffering from this inequality, demonstrating yet again how race is firmly linked to class in the United States.",

The Boys, most of whom had no family left, formed a de facto extended family, meeting at reunions [and] attending each other\u2019s weddings,\u201d said Rinder. Spiro and Malenicky \u201cwere friends for their whole lives\u201d until his grandfather\u2019s death in 2001, he added. Spiro, whose mother, father and sister were killed in Treblinka, is a regular visitor to schools as part of the HET\u2019s outreach programme. \u201cThe feedback I get gives me a lot of encouragement, especially when I tell them I don\u2019t hate the world because of what happened to me,\u201d he said. In the camps, the urge to survive dominated everything. Interviewed by his grandson two years ago, he said: \u201cOn a daily basis, whenever I\u2019d go in the washroom, [they] always had bodies on the floor. Very often, I saw a body lying on the floor who didn\u2019t finish their ration of bread. I felt it was my lucky day \u2013 I got hold of [the bread] and ate it. I never felt ashamed of it or sorry for the guy that was dead.\u201d Spiro was one of 270 people out of 3,000 that survived a death march from Rehmsdorf camp to Theresienstadt towards the end of the war. \u201cPeople on that march died purely and simply from starvation or being shot.\u201d He told the Guardian: \u201cI came to the conclusion a long time ago that hating people doesn\u2019t achieve anything. People are capable of doing horrendous things to each other, but that isn\u2019t overcome by yet more hate.\u201d Immediately after the war, he was wary of trusting in human nature, but now \u201cI really couldn\u2019t wish for a better ending\u201d. Spiro has been happily married for over 60 years, and has three children, nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild. \u201cI believe in life you need a little bit of luck, and I had a lot of luck when I met my wife,\u201d he said. Rinder said: \u201cHarry is completely devoid of any bitterness \u2013 on the contrary, he\u2019s full of hope and joy. Prejudice in any form is unacceptable to him, and he tells young people: \u2018The courage starts with you.\u2019 \u201cThe story of the Holocaust is more urgent than ever. We must watch against complacency. Don\u2019t think that just because we have what looks like the protections of democracy that it can\u2019t all disappear in the blink of an eye.\u201d Hearing the testimony of a survivor had enormous impact, said Martin Winstone of the HET. \u201cPeople tend to think of the Holocaust in very big numbers; it\u2019s very difficult to comprehend. Hearing one person\u2019s story brings some reality.\u201d He added: \u201cInevitably, as the number of survivors sadly diminishes, something like this webcast enables us to reach as many people as possible. It would be wonderful to send a survivor to every school, but this is a practical alternative.\u201d About 50 survivors work with the HET\u2019s outreach programme, but \u201cit\u2019s becoming more of a challenge\u201d as their numbers reduce and they get older, he said. \u201cThey want to speak to as many people as they can in the time they still have. I\u2019m in awe of the dedication they bring to this task.\u201d Holocaust Memorial Day on Sunday will be marked by a commemorative event in central London with senior politicians, dignitaries, religious leaders and survivors, and almost 11,000 more activities across the country.",

However, as a short, sharp social media experiment it is charming in its way. Just don\u2019t expect flicking through someone\u2019s dating apps to be an efficient replacement for actually going on one yourself.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: US shutdown gets personal as Pelosi blocks Sotu Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the stories you need to keep yourself informed this morning. Donald Trump says he will delay giving his State of the Union address until the US government shutdown is over as his personal standoff with Nancy Pelosi over federal funding for a border wall worsened. The Democrat House speaker told the president earlier on Wednesday that she would block him from delivering the speech scheduled for next Tuesday in the traditional surrounds of the House chamber until the government reopened. Trump later used Twitter to deny that he was considering alternative venues such as the Oval Office for the address, and would instead wait because no venue \u201ccan compete with the history, tradition and importance\u201d of the House chamber. The longest shutdown in US history has now dragged on into its second month. The partial shutdown affects about 25% of the federal government and has left 800,000 government workers without pay, affecting services such as the IRS, FBI and national parks. On Wednesday, air traffic controllers issued a stark warning about the risks posed by the shutdown to aviation safety. They said a shortage of staff thanks to a recruitment freeze meant they could not calculate when the \u201csystem might break\u201d. * * * Vaccine warning \u2013 Half of all parents with small children have seen misinformation about vaccines on social media, amid mounting concern about the anti-vaxx movement. The study by the Royal Society for Public Health finds the most common reason not to vaccinate is the fear of side-effects. It calls on social media companies to stop being a \u201cbreeding ground\u201d for misleading information and negative messaging. It comes as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, launches a government drive against antibiotic-resistant bugs in Davos, calling it a global health emergency on a par with climate change. He plans to change the way drug companies are incentivised in order to convince them to tackle the problem with \u201curgently needed\u201d new drugs. \u2018We want an end to tyranny\u2019 \u2013 Venezuela\u2019s political crisis has deepened after the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself the interim president in a dramatic effort to force out Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Addressing thousands of supporters gathered in the streets of Caracas, Guaid\u00f3 said: \u201cI swear to assume all the powers of the presidency to secure an end to the usurpation.\u201d The US immediately declared Guaid\u00f3 the country\u2019s legitimate leader and was soon followed by Canada, Brazil and Argentina. Maduro, who is widely blamed for the country\u2019s descent into economic chaos and authoritarian rule, urged his supporters to resist \u201cat all costs\u201d and accused Guaid\u00f3 of being a US puppet. As the drama unfolded in Caracas, Venezuelan exiles took to the streets from Mexico City to Hong Kong to call for Maduro to go. Albert Molina, an administrator who fled his homeland for Mexico, said people wanted \u201can end to tyranny\u201d. And here\u2019s why Guaid\u00f3 was holding a picture of Bolivar when he made his pledge. * * * Time\u2019s up \u2013 The EU\u2019s negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned Britain\u2019s warring political class that they must agree on a Brexit plan rather than focus on trying to avoid a no deal or delay the exit process. Noting Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill amendment, Barnier said opposing no deal would not stop it from happening at the end of March. \u201cWe need decisions more than we need time actually,\u201d he said, adding that Theresa May\u2019s attempts to win a time limit for the Irish border backstop would fail and that only her original Brexit withdrawal plan could work. With no deal looming, Ireland has hired an extra 400 customs officials to keep trade moving cross the border. And the CBI has ratcheted up its warnings about no deal, saying it poses a risk to the global economy. * * * Knox appeal \u2013 Amanda Knox, the American woman jailed and then cleared over the killing of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007, could see her name completely cleared today when her case is heard at the European court of human rights. She appealing against an outstanding conviction for malicious accusation on the grounds that she was denied an interpreter, assaulted by Italian police and subjected to psychological pressure while under arrest. She has already been cleared of falsifying a break-in, sexual assault, murder and defamation in a case that that created headlines around the world for years as it dragged through the Italian courts. * * * Hot deal \u2013 A pub in Australia has been forced to lock it doors after its offer of free beer for drinkers coping with a heatwave caused too many people to descend on the premises. The Red Lion in the working-class Adelaide suburb of Elizabeth said it would serve free drinks today if the temperature reached 45C. It duly did and the pub was inundated with punters. The city later saw the mercury hit 46.6C, the highest since records began as the country\u2019s south-east baked in scorching temperatures. In Tasmania scores of fires raged but high winds forced water-dumping aircraft to be grounded. Today in Focus podcast: Reality bites on no-deal frontline With less than 10 weeks to go until Britain leaves the EU and still no withdrawal deal agreed, businesses around the country are scrabbling to prepare for the worst-case scenario of a disorderly Brexit. Our reporters in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland discover that very few contingency plans are in place. Plus: Aditya Chakrabortty on why the Davos elite are running scared.

Pyne, speaking in Beijing on Thursday, confirmed Yang was being held by Chinese authorities.</p> <p>\u201cHe is being held in residential surveillance,\u201d said Pyne. \u201cWe would describe it as home detention. As Mr Yang doesn\u2019t have a home in Beijing, he is being held in a similar situation, as opposed to being held in a prison.\u201d Pyne said Yang was likely being held in Beijing.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian government is obviously concerned with the residential surveillance of Mr Yang. He is an Australian citizen, and we are seeking to provide him with consular assistance and support to ensure he is being treated fairly and transparently.\u201d</p> <p>At a press briefing on Thursday, China\u2019s foreign ministry said Yang had been detained on \u201csuspicion of endangering national security\u201d.

Pyne said he would press for access to Yang at meeting with his counterpart in Beijing, the minister of national defence, General Wei Fenghe, later on Thursday.</p> <p>Yang, a novelist and former diplomat, is one of China\u2019s most prolific commentators. He obtained a PhD at the University of Technology Sydney and became an Australian citizen in the early 2000s.

Yang, who lives in New York where he is a visiting scholar at Columbia University, was detained on 19 January after a flight from New York to Guangzhou. Yang was travelling with his wife and son. His detention could escalate into another diplomatic incident between China and an ally of the US. Two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, were detained in China last month, widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of a senior executive at Chinese telecom giant Huawei in Canada at the request of the US. Australia recently expressed concern about China\u2019s detention of two Canadians in retaliation for the arrest in Canada of a senior Huawei executive. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, said on Thursday that there is no connection between the detention of Yang and the cases of two Canadians in custody. Australian embassy officials in Beijing had an initial meeting with Chinese authorities on Thursday. Payne expressed concerns about the nature of the novelist and influential online commentator\u2019s detention. \u201cWe have requested, and we do expect, consular access at the earliest possible opportunity,\u201d Payne told reporters in Sydney. Asked if there were a connection between Yang and the Canadian cases, Payne responded: \u201cAt this stage there is no evidence of such a connection \u2026 I\u2019d be concerned if there was an indication of that.\u201d \u201cWe are calling on the Chinese authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with transparently and fairly,\u201d she said. Payne doesn\u2019t believe Yang\u2019s detention is related to an Australian government decision to shut Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE out of Australia\u2019s 5G network. \u201cI think if there were concerns to be raised, they would have been before now,\u201d she said. Yang\u2019s friend, University of Technology Sydney academic Feng Chongyi, said the writer\u2019s detention was much more serious this time compared with when he was detained in 2011 because of Beijing\u2019s current trend of \u201chostage diplomacy\u201d. \u201c [The Australian government] should be very, very firm on this because the Chinese government is behaving like terrorists,\u201d he told the Guardian. Feng has been told Yang could be facing espionage charges in Beijing and he himself has also been previously detained in China. Consular agreements between the two countries stipulate that either government must be informed within three days if a citizen is detained and consular access should be granted soon after. Pyne said Chinese officials had taken four days to notify Australia about Yang\u2019s detention. \u201cObviously that is disappointing,\u201d he said. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said he hoped there will be a breakthrough soon. \u201cIt\u2019s been a slow response from the Chinese government to talk to the Australian government,\u201d Shorten told ABC TV. \u201cThis is not the way which relations between our two countries should be conducted at all.\u201d Former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who speaks Mandarin, tweeted support for Yang. \u201cYang Hengjun is an Aus citizen just like the rest of us with equal rights and protections,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cChina has an international legal obligation under [article] 12 of our 1999 treaty for full consular access &amp; to advise what Chinese law he is alleged to have breached.\u201d PEN America, an organisation that supports writers and freedom of expression, said Yang\u2019s detention is \u201ca terrifying sign of the Chinese government\u2019s willingness to disappear writers who criticise them, regardless of nationality.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Yang would not have been seized if it weren\u2019t for his previous critical writings,\u201d spokeswoman Summer Lopez said. Yang\u2019s novel Fatal Weakness, part of a trilogy, explores espionage between China and the US, a topic he has also written about on his blog. Yang has a large Twitter following and frequently writes about issues involving China\u2019s government. He is not known for outright criticism of the party, and his most recent tweets and posts have focused on US politics, his health, or books he has read.

This is a remote, wet and often cold corner of the UK, a tough place to live and work but the biggest threat at the moment comes not in the shape of the winter storms.</p> \n<p>\u201cBrexit is what\u2019s worrying us at the moment. This is a very difficult time for farmers,\u201d said Evans, 55, who rears sheep and cattle with his wife Nicole and son Gwynfor. \u201cIt\u2019s a job to plan because nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re on the cusp of lambing just now. I can\u2019t tell you if I\u2019ll have a lucrative market for our lambs or not. You have to carry on even though you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf there is no deal it would be horrific for farmers, especially in the sheep sector. If we have tariffs of 40/50/60% we wouldn\u2019t be able to compete. We would suffer serious hardship. <a href=\"https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/prime-lamb-prices-disastrous-as-foot-and-mouth-disruption-continues\">When we had foot and mouth and the borders closed the price of lamb collapsed. </a>That\u2019s the reality. The losses to farmers and to the rural community as a whole would be huge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Only 5% of lamb produced in Wales is consumed in the country, according to <a href=\"https://hccmpw.org.uk/en\">Hybu Cig Cymru </a>\u2013 Meat Promotion Wales \u2013 and up to 40% is exported out of the UK. More than 90% of these exports are to the EU.</p> \n<p>Evans\u2019s lambs initially go to an abattoir across the hills in Llanidloes. The prime cuts \u2013 the legs and shoulders \u2013 end up on supermarket shelves in the UK. However, the European market is vital for so-called \u201ccarcass balance\u201d \u2013 the bits of lamb that are not so popular in the UK are exported. The meat from lighter lambs produced by Evans and his colleagues is also popular in Portugal and Italy.</p> \n<p>Brexit has already prompted Evans to reduce his flock \u2013 from around 400 to 370. \u201cWe\u2019ve cut down on the sheep slightly,\u201d he said. To try to compensate he has boosted the number of beef cattle he rears. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young cattle around the place,\u201d he said. The UK is a net importer of beef so Evans is calculating that the beef price may hold up. </p> \n<p>Brexit follows a difficult 12 months weather-wise for farmers such as Evans. Last March it was cold \u2013 the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/01/beast-from-east-storm-emma-uk-worst-weather-years\"> beast from east</a> bit viciously here \u2013 and was followed by a hot summer. \u201cOur spare bales went last spring. Then we had that horrendously dry summer. The grass didn\u2019t grow well, the crops were light. We\u2019ve got nothing to stockpile. We are struggling this winter for forage.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aa6cae02-c088-491e-bc0a-268e50bde275\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Welsh farming in numbers</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Only 5% of lamb produced in Wales is consumed in Wales, with up to 40% being exported outside the UK.

Three quarters of this is grassland pasture, of which 80% is \u201cLFA\u201d \u2013 less favourable area \u2013 land. This is suitable for sheep and cattle farming rather than arable.

When the corn laws were repealed by Tory Sir Robert Peel (overcoming the opposition of most of his party), it was deemed unviable to grow grain on this soggy, steep land.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we can do very well is grow grass,\u201d said Evans. \u201cThe most efficient way of using the land is to graze animals. That is the best way of producing a world-class protein.\u201d</p> \n<p>Evans voted to stay in the EU. \u201cI was an avid remainer. I\u2019m very frustrated over how things have gone.

      "bodyText": "Wyn Evans\u2019s family has farmed in the hills of Ceredigion, west Wales, for five centuries. This is a remote, wet and often cold corner of the UK, a tough place to live and work but the biggest threat at the moment comes not in the shape of the winter storms. \u201cBrexit is what\u2019s worrying us at the moment. This is a very difficult time for farmers,\u201d said Evans, 55, who rears sheep and cattle with his wife Nicole and son Gwynfor. \u201cIt\u2019s a job to plan because nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re on the cusp of lambing just now. I can\u2019t tell you if I\u2019ll have a lucrative market for our lambs or not. You have to carry on even though you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner. \u201cIf there is no deal it would be horrific for farmers, especially in the sheep sector. If we have tariffs of 40/50/60% we wouldn\u2019t be able to compete. We would suffer serious hardship. When we had foot and mouth and the borders closed the price of lamb collapsed. That\u2019s the reality. The losses to farmers and to the rural community as a whole would be huge.\u201d Only 5% of lamb produced in Wales is consumed in the country, according to Hybu Cig Cymru \u2013 Meat Promotion Wales \u2013 and up to 40% is exported out of the UK. More than 90% of these exports are to the EU. Evans\u2019s lambs initially go to an abattoir across the hills in Llanidloes. The prime cuts \u2013 the legs and shoulders \u2013 end up on supermarket shelves in the UK. However, the European market is vital for so-called \u201ccarcass balance\u201d \u2013 the bits of lamb that are not so popular in the UK are exported. The meat from lighter lambs produced by Evans and his colleagues is also popular in Portugal and Italy. Brexit has already prompted Evans to reduce his flock \u2013 from around 400 to 370. \u201cWe\u2019ve cut down on the sheep slightly,\u201d he said. To try to compensate he has boosted the number of beef cattle he rears. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young cattle around the place,\u201d he said. The UK is a net importer of beef so Evans is calculating that the beef price may hold up. Brexit follows a difficult 12 months weather-wise for farmers such as Evans. Last March it was cold \u2013 the beast from east bit viciously here \u2013 and was followed by a hot summer. \u201cOur spare bales went last spring. Then we had that horrendously dry summer. The grass didn\u2019t grow well, the crops were light. We\u2019ve got nothing to stockpile. We are struggling this winter for forage.\u201d The longevity of his family in this area, just south-east of Aberystwyth, means Evans can put Brexit and its possible impact on farming on this spot into a historical perspective. Age-old maps and records make it is clear that grain was grown here in the 19th century when the corn laws imposed tariffs on imported food. When the corn laws were repealed by Tory Sir Robert Peel (overcoming the opposition of most of his party), it was deemed unviable to grow grain on this soggy, steep land. \u201cWhat we can do very well is grow grass,\u201d said Evans. \u201cThe most efficient way of using the land is to graze animals. That is the best way of producing a world-class protein.\u201d Evans voted to stay in the EU. \u201cI was an avid remainer. I\u2019m very frustrated over how things have gone. I would have thought by now we would have had clarification. Are we going to have unfettered access to that very important market that gives my business security moving forward? We need to know. Parliament and so many individuals within it are so indecisive. Party politics has played too much of a role. We should have had a coalition, a collaboration at the start of this process.\u201d Evans, who votes Plaid Cymru or Liberal Democrat, said he had backed the doomed deal that Theresa May put before parliament. \u201cFor agriculture and manufacturing in Wales it was the best deal. It was a good job of a bad job. I\u2019ve got qualms about a second referendum. If it went the same way as the previous one, I don\u2019t know were we\u2019d go then. We\u2019d be in total chaos \u2013 ungovernable. No politician would know what to do. At the moment I like the look of a Norway plus deal. I don\u2019t know if she would get that through parliament.\u201d Evans, who is chairman of the NFU Cymru livestock board, says that if the farmers struggle, the rural economy will be harshly hit. \u201cI spend all the money from the farm within a 20-mile radius. The feed merchants, the builders, the mechanics are all local.\u201d The farm is run by the three family members but they also employ outside contractors to shear the sheep and cut hedges. \u201cThere are lot of people out there relying on the farmers,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>On a sunny seafront just south of Valencia, a tall, angular figure rounds the corner and walks towards me. It takes me a moment to recognise him: <a href=\"http://whitecube.com/artists/artist/miroslaw_balka/\">Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka</a>. He guides us towards an outdoor restaurant packed with Lycra-clad German retirees and Spanish families licking ice creams. Clad top to toe in black, hesitant and somewhat shy, he seems entirely out of place.</p> <p>\u201cWe just arrived,\u201d he says by way of explanation, trying to find a spot for his chair that exposes him to the minimum of sun. \u201cIt is still a little strange.\u201d</p> <p>Strange is the word. Of the numerous reasons it\u2019s odd to find Ba\u0142ka, arguably Poland\u2019s leading sculptor, hanging out in an off-season holiday resort, perhaps the biggest is his work. Few artists have gone so obsessively to the dark side. In 2009, he invited visitors to Tate Modern in London to plunge themselves into the abyss, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series/unilever-series-miroslaw-balka-how-it\">erecting a huge, container-like structure filled with nothing but blackness</a>. Walking inside felt like a chilly foretaste of death. Elsewhere Ba\u0142ka has excavated the bleakest sections of European history, making sculptures that channel the anguish of the Holocaust and the dull melancholy of the cold war. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/dec/21/art-miroslaw-balka\">calling cards are doubt and anxiety, guilt and grief</a>. Sun-struck Spain seems \u2013 well, all wrong.</p> <p>This January sojourn is something of an experiment, it transpires: normally I\u2019d find him in the small town of Otwock on the outskirts of Warsaw, in the unassuming home-cum-studio where he has lived and worked since childhood. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know, sometimes it is good to find a new perspective,\u201d he says, looking mistrustfully at the menu. I\u2019m still not quite convinced.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We used to think demolishing walls was a sign of progress. Now we are building them up again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve arranged to meet because Ba\u0142ka is preparing to open his first solo show in the UK for five years. Entitled <a href=\"http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/miroslaw_balka_masons_yard_2019\">Random Access Memory</a>, it promises to be as haunting as anything he has done. If you enter White Cube\u2019s space in central London, you will encounter not a series of sculptures but an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia. One gallery will be barricaded with a corrugated steel wall, penning you in to a space just a few metres square; downstairs there\u2019s another wall, even larger and more forbidding.</p> <p>The main thing you\u2019re likely to notice is that the rooms are hot. Ba\u0142ka has often inserted heating elements into his sculptures \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.alamy.com/estonia-monument-djurgarden-stockholm-sweden-scandinavia-granite-memorial-by-polish-sculptor-miroslaw-balka-to-815-of-the-victims-of-the-estonia-image179650517.html\">a monument he made to the victims of the MS Estonia ferry disaster</a> is heated to a constant 37C, the temperature of the human body \u2013 but here the aim is to make the experience sweatily uncomfortable. He explains that the temperature he has selected is 45C, warm enough to kill proteins. He smiles wryly. \u201cSo on the one side, pleasure, then also death.\u201d</p> <p>And as in previous Ba\u0142ka installations, there will be little indication about how to negotiate these walls, or what \u2013 if anything \u2013 lies beyond them. Some might think of internment camps, others of checkpoints and borders, Ba\u0142ka explains. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the promised land behind the wall, utopia, maybe it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Might there be references to Trump and Brexit too? He nods: sure. \u201cWe used to think demolishing walls was a sign of progress. Now everywhere we are building them up again. So I wanted to say we have been here before. It\u2019s a gesture of warning, in a way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"942182473bee30af82516d5b4621e57016a57557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/942182473bee30af82516d5b4621e57016a57557/0_83_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darkly disturbing \u2026 Ba\u0142ka\u2019s 2010 Turbine Hall installation evoked the dread of the Holocaust.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darkly disturbing \u2026 Ba\u0142ka\u2019s 2010 Turbine Hall installation evoked the dread of the Holocaust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the mouths of some artists this would come across as posturing, but Ba\u0142ka knows what he\u2019s talking about. Born in 1958, he grew up in a Poland where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/communism\">communism</a> felt like it would never end, and came of age when the country was under Soviet-backed martial law. <a href=\"https://culture.pl/en/artist/miroslaw-balka\">His grandfather made tombstones and his father engraved them</a>; maybe it was inevitable that he would end up as a sculptor. (Ba\u0142ka sees it differently: \u201cI chose sculpture because it was the easiest faculty to get into,\u201d he laughs.)</p> <p>His early works, made in the mid-1980s, were figurative, shot through with memories of a sternly Catholic childhood: <a href=\"http://www.arterritory.com/en/texts/interviews/4357-running_fingers_through_salt/\">a lost-looking boy in jacket and shorts taking his first communion</a>; images alluding to Christ and the saints.</p> <p>Anda Rottenberg, one of Poland\u2019s most respected critics, remembers seeing Ba\u0142ka\u2019s degree show: \u201cHis work felt so fresh and new, but it also had this extraordinary delicacy and sensitivity. It seemed to be talking about so much: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/catholicism\">Catholicism</a>, provincial Poland, his own childhood. It was hidden, but also naked.\u201d</p> <p>Somehow, though, there was something missing. Gradually Ba\u0142ka realised that the materials he was most attracted to weren\u2019t bronze and marble, but the ones lying everywhere around him \u2013 old planks and linoleum, discarded hunks of plaster, odd ends of soap, pieces of felt. The sculptures he began to assemble from the 1990s onwards were increasingly abstract. <a href=\"http://renaissancesociety.org/exhibitions/382/miroslaw-balka-366/\">Hunks of terrazzo, stained and chipped</a>. Bowls of salt, dollops of concrete and breezeblock. Sometimes these objects were so modest that, entering the gallery, <a href=\"http://artviewer.org/miroslaw-balka-at-dvir-gallery/\">it took a while to notice them</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b6e7dc65d116cd45b5e59c8fe1d05b6663c2947\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b6e7dc65d116cd45b5e59c8fe1d05b6663c2947/0_886_3744_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broken heads in Ba\u0142ka\u2019s Polish studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broken heads in Ba\u0142ka\u2019s Polish studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These pieces felt raw and sincere \u2013 they captured something of his own life, but also everyone else\u2019s. \u201cEven a simple nail has a history,\u201d he reflects. \u201cAs an artist, I hope to give these materials a new existence. Even if it\u2019s an old medicine ball, I want to give dignity.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that he was yearning for abstraction, he adds: he just became interested in absence as much as presence, the traces all of us leave behind. \u201cI am digging in the shadows, I think, if that is possible to say. These shadows are very different. Sometimes they are more personal, sometimes they are more historical.\u201d</p> <p>A subject he can\u2019t seem to escape is the Holocaust. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/15/miroslaw-balka-interview-tate-modern\">He has made repeated visits to the former concentration camps at Treblinka and Majdanek</a>, filming grainy videos of deer behind barbed wire and huts in the snow. How It Is, the Tate Modern installation with its ramp leading towards inky blackness, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/miroslaw-balkas-art-of-darkness-1839713.html\">put many in mind of the cattle trucks that led to the death camps</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe subject has stayed so long with me because it is impossible to understand,\u201d Ba\u0142ka says, pointing out that in August 1944 around 8,000 Jews from his home town were dispatched to Treblinka in a single day. \u201cIt\u2019s like a shadow memory. I\u2019m trying to understand this shadow.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c67e1eccf674b565c47383dd5d92a93f8c18e63a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c67e1eccf674b565c47383dd5d92a93f8c18e63a/0_725_5500_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No way out \u2026 Random Access Memory by Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No way out \u2026 Random Access Memory by Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rottenberg explains the context: \u201cIn Poland, silence about the Holocaust was kept for more than 40 years. I think he felt guilty on behalf of society.\u201d</p> <p>Ghosts from this era still haunt Ba\u0142ka\u2019s work, but he has been looking for ways to, if not quite exorcise them, at least broker some kind of peace. In 2014, he and a team of volunteers travelled to an abandoned village in eastern Poland and <a href=\"https://jewish-heritage-europe.eu/2014/09/01/synagogue-event-in-krynki-pl/\">spent a week clearing the site of a ruined synagogue of brambles and weeds</a>. This was a ritual cleansing: it culminated in a jet of water being sent up into the air from what had been the bema, the building\u2019s holiest place.</p> <p>It sounds beautiful, I say. He smiles quietly. \u201cYou know, I am always looking for beauty. Even if I\u2019m picking up an old plank, I want it to be beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>His works seem so endlessly multilayered: does he ever worry that people simply won\u2019t understand them? The smile becomes a grin. \u201cArt is not about understanding, it\u2019s more about feeling. If I was a mathematician, then I would want to be understood. But in art, if you don\u2019t understand, maybe it means that you are not ready yet.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years he has come increasingly to focus on the present day, and its politics. \u201cIt\u2019s not always the starting point, but the works seem more and more to have this political layer,\u201d he reflects. \u201cLike the new project in London \u2013 I didn\u2019t think about Trump or the Berlin Wall when I was making it, but it seemed to come in.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If you increase the number of poets in a country, you support the power of good</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is especially vocal about the situation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland\">Poland</a>. The ascent of the populist, fiercely anti-immigration Law and Justice party has made many worry that the country is retreating from liberal democracy and sliding into religiose rightwing authoritarianism. The day after we speak, the mayor of Gda\u0144sk, a passionate critic of the government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/13/gdansk-mayor-stabbed-on-stage-during-charity-event-in-poland\">is stabbed to death on stage during a charity concert</a>. The murder sends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/gdansk-residents-donate-blood-stabbed-mayor-pawel-adamowicz\">shockwaves through Poland</a>.</p> <p>Ba\u0142ka is full of foreboding. \u201cIt feels like the values that were worked out after 1989 are collapsing \u2013 like history can be erased, you know? Ten years ago, I couldn\u2019t imagine where we are, where Europe is, where the world is. But here we are.\u201d</p> <p>Spending a few months in Spain, exploring this small town near Valencia, makes him wonder if he and his partner really want to return: the atmosphere in Poland, with its attacks on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/freedom-of-speech\">freedom of speech</a> and the judiciary, is so toxic right now. \u201cI am not sure. But things are not good in the country at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>His art contains so much grief and sadness, I say \u2013 what about hope? Is there room for that too?

      "bodyText": "On a sunny seafront just south of Valencia, a tall, angular figure rounds the corner and walks towards me. It takes me a moment to recognise him: Miros\u0142aw Ba\u0142ka. He guides us towards an outdoor restaurant packed with Lycra-clad German retirees and Spanish families licking ice creams. Clad top to toe in black, hesitant and somewhat shy, he seems entirely out of place. \u201cWe just arrived,\u201d he says by way of explanation, trying to find a spot for his chair that exposes him to the minimum of sun. \u201cIt is still a little strange.\u201d Strange is the word. Of the numerous reasons it\u2019s odd to find Ba\u0142ka, arguably Poland\u2019s leading sculptor, hanging out in an off-season holiday resort, perhaps the biggest is his work. Few artists have gone so obsessively to the dark side. In 2009, he invited visitors to Tate Modern in London to plunge themselves into the abyss, erecting a huge, container-like structure filled with nothing but blackness. Walking inside felt like a chilly foretaste of death. Elsewhere Ba\u0142ka has excavated the bleakest sections of European history, making sculptures that channel the anguish of the Holocaust and the dull melancholy of the cold war. His calling cards are doubt and anxiety, guilt and grief. Sun-struck Spain seems \u2013 well, all wrong. This January sojourn is something of an experiment, it transpires: normally I\u2019d find him in the small town of Otwock on the outskirts of Warsaw, in the unassuming home-cum-studio where he has lived and worked since childhood. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know, sometimes it is good to find a new perspective,\u201d he says, looking mistrustfully at the menu. I\u2019m still not quite convinced. We\u2019ve arranged to meet because Ba\u0142ka is preparing to open his first solo show in the UK for five years. Entitled Random Access Memory, it promises to be as haunting as anything he has done. If you enter White Cube\u2019s space in central London, you will encounter not a series of sculptures but an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia. One gallery will be barricaded with a corrugated steel wall, penning you in to a space just a few metres square; downstairs there\u2019s another wall, even larger and more forbidding. The main thing you\u2019re likely to notice is that the rooms are hot. Ba\u0142ka has often inserted heating elements into his sculptures \u2013 a monument he made to the victims of the MS Estonia ferry disaster is heated to a constant 37C, the temperature of the human body \u2013 but here the aim is to make the experience sweatily uncomfortable. He explains that the temperature he has selected is 45C, warm enough to kill proteins. He smiles wryly. \u201cSo on the one side, pleasure, then also death.\u201d And as in previous Ba\u0142ka installations, there will be little indication about how to negotiate these walls, or what \u2013 if anything \u2013 lies beyond them. Some might think of internment camps, others of checkpoints and borders, Ba\u0142ka explains. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the promised land behind the wall, utopia, maybe it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Might there be references to Trump and Brexit too? He nods: sure. \u201cWe used to think demolishing walls was a sign of progress. Now everywhere we are building them up again. So I wanted to say we have been here before. It\u2019s a gesture of warning, in a way.\u201d In the mouths of some artists this would come across as posturing, but Ba\u0142ka knows what he\u2019s talking about. Born in 1958, he grew up in a Poland where communism felt like it would never end, and came of age when the country was under Soviet-backed martial law. His grandfather made tombstones and his father engraved them; maybe it was inevitable that he would end up as a sculptor. (Ba\u0142ka sees it differently: \u201cI chose sculpture because it was the easiest faculty to get into,\u201d he laughs.) His early works, made in the mid-1980s, were figurative, shot through with memories of a sternly Catholic childhood: a lost-looking boy in jacket and shorts taking his first communion; images alluding to Christ and the saints. Anda Rottenberg, one of Poland\u2019s most respected critics, remembers seeing Ba\u0142ka\u2019s degree show: \u201cHis work felt so fresh and new, but it also had this extraordinary delicacy and sensitivity. It seemed to be talking about so much: Catholicism, provincial Poland, his own childhood. It was hidden, but also naked.\u201d Somehow, though, there was something missing. Gradually Ba\u0142ka realised that the materials he was most attracted to weren\u2019t bronze and marble, but the ones lying everywhere around him \u2013 old planks and linoleum, discarded hunks of plaster, odd ends of soap, pieces of felt. The sculptures he began to assemble from the 1990s onwards were increasingly abstract. Hunks of terrazzo, stained and chipped. Bowls of salt, dollops of concrete and breezeblock. Sometimes these objects were so modest that, entering the gallery, it took a while to notice them. These pieces felt raw and sincere \u2013 they captured something of his own life, but also everyone else\u2019s. \u201cEven a simple nail has a history,\u201d he reflects. \u201cAs an artist, I hope to give these materials a new existence. Even if it\u2019s an old medicine ball, I want to give dignity.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that he was yearning for abstraction, he adds: he just became interested in absence as much as presence, the traces all of us leave behind. \u201cI am digging in the shadows, I think, if that is possible to say. These shadows are very different. Sometimes they are more personal, sometimes they are more historical.\u201d A subject he can\u2019t seem to escape is the Holocaust. He has made repeated visits to the former concentration camps at Treblinka and Majdanek, filming grainy videos of deer behind barbed wire and huts in the snow. How It Is, the Tate Modern installation with its ramp leading towards inky blackness, put many in mind of the cattle trucks that led to the death camps. \u201cThe subject has stayed so long with me because it is impossible to understand,\u201d Ba\u0142ka says, pointing out that in August 1944 around 8,000 Jews from his home town were dispatched to Treblinka in a single day. \u201cIt\u2019s like a shadow memory. I\u2019m trying to understand this shadow.\u201d Rottenberg explains the context: \u201cIn Poland, silence about the Holocaust was kept for more than 40 years. I think he felt guilty on behalf of society.\u201d Ghosts from this era still haunt Ba\u0142ka\u2019s work, but he has been looking for ways to, if not quite exorcise them, at least broker some kind of peace. In 2014, he and a team of volunteers travelled to an abandoned village in eastern Poland and spent a week clearing the site of a ruined synagogue of brambles and weeds. This was a ritual cleansing: it culminated in a jet of water being sent up into the air from what had been the bema, the building\u2019s holiest place. It sounds beautiful, I say. He smiles quietly. \u201cYou know, I am always looking for beauty. Even if I\u2019m picking up an old plank, I want it to be beautiful.\u201d His works seem so endlessly multilayered: does he ever worry that people simply won\u2019t understand them? The smile becomes a grin. \u201cArt is not about understanding, it\u2019s more about feeling. If I was a mathematician, then I would want to be understood. But in art, if you don\u2019t understand, maybe it means that you are not ready yet.\u201d In recent years he has come increasingly to focus on the present day, and its politics. \u201cIt\u2019s not always the starting point, but the works seem more and more to have this political layer,\u201d he reflects. \u201cLike the new project in London \u2013 I didn\u2019t think about Trump or the Berlin Wall when I was making it, but it seemed to come in.\u201d He is especially vocal about the situation in Poland. The ascent of the populist, fiercely anti-immigration Law and Justice party has made many worry that the country is retreating from liberal democracy and sliding into religiose rightwing authoritarianism. The day after we speak, the mayor of Gda\u0144sk, a passionate critic of the government, is stabbed to death on stage during a charity concert. The murder sends shockwaves through Poland. Ba\u0142ka is full of foreboding. \u201cIt feels like the values that were worked out after 1989 are collapsing \u2013 like history can be erased, you know? Ten years ago, I couldn\u2019t imagine where we are, where Europe is, where the world is. But here we are.\u201d Spending a few months in Spain, exploring this small town near Valencia, makes him wonder if he and his partner really want to return: the atmosphere in Poland, with its attacks on freedom of speech and the judiciary, is so toxic right now. \u201cI am not sure. But things are not good in the country at the moment.\u201d His art contains so much grief and sadness, I say \u2013 what about hope? Is there room for that too? He is silent for what seems like an age, then eventually locates an answer. \u201cI think that if you increase the number of poets in the country, you can support the power of good. \u201cI have to have hope,\u201d he adds, almost as an afterthought. \u201cThat\u2019s why I work.\u201d \u2022 Random Access Memory is at White Cube Mason\u2019s Yard, London, 25 January-9 March.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018I\u2019ve not been in here before,\u201d says Layton Williams as he steps into an upstairs bar at the Apollo theatre in the London\u2019s West End, where he is about to star in the hit musical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/26/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-review-fizzingly-fresh-west-end-musical\" title=\"\">Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie</a>. Our interview is ready to start but he is busy craning his neck to look out of the window to see the exact spot where his likeness will appear on the theatre\u2019s billboard overlooking Shaftesbury Avenue. \u201cOh, that\u2019s going to be my face,\u201d he says. \u201cWild.\u201d</p> \n<p>When you speak to Williams, everything is larger than life, from the 20ft picture of him that\u2019s going to adorn the Apollo to his mile-a-minute storytelling and RuPaul-like lexicon (\u201cwild\u201d and \u201ciconic\u201d feature regularly during our hour-long chat). He is part mixed-race Bury lad with an accent that has barely softened after a decade in London, part West End showman who slips into lingo you would expect to hear while watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/24/burning-down-the-house-debate-paris-is-burning\" title=\"\">Paris Is Burning</a>. He is extravagant, ebullient and infectiously enthusiastic.</p> \n<p>But you would probably forgive Williams for being jaded, even at the age of 24. He has been working in the West End since he was 12, after he won a nationwide hunt for the next Billy Elliot. Newspaper features followed, as did a TV appearance in which a cherubic Williams tried to teach Vernon Kay how to pli\u00e9 (he couldn\u2019t, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnqXblB6vNk\" title=\"\">although he did breakdance</a>). It is easy to forget how big the Billy Elliot talent hunt was in 2006. \u201cThe emotional, mental and physical demands on whichever of these kids take over as replacements, and on their families, are enormous,\u201d the casting director, Jessica Ronane, said in 2006. She estimated that she saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/23/arts.artsnews\" title=\"\">more than 4,000 potential stars as productions were being planned</a> to launch in Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany and on Broadway. And yet it very nearly didn\u2019t happen for Williams.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"972a4b657820389b222de4519108f92d7795cc85\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/972a4b657820389b222de4519108f92d7795cc85/207_724_4955_2973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Williams starring as Angel in Rent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: Williams starring as Angel in Rent in 2016, alongside Billy Cullum and Ross Hunter</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His mum spotted the advert and said they should make the short trip from Bury to Manchester. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know what an audition was,\u201d says Williams, who had been training at the Carol Godby Theatre Workshop in his hometown, <a href=\"http://www.carolgodbytheatreworkshop.co.uk/success-stories/\" title=\"\">which has produced a long-line of soap stars</a>. \u201cThere were thousands of people and I very nearly turned around because I was the only person of colour I could see. It was just white boys everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then my step-dad said: \u2018Look, we\u2019ve driven all the way here. You\u2019re going in.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>That bit of pushy parenting paid off as Williams impressed the judges with his fresh, unrefined talent. \u201cBecause I was so raw \u2013 I didn\u2019t do ballet, I didn\u2019t do tap, I had no vocal training \u2013 I was basically the Billy Elliot story. I would love to see my tapes, because they said: \u2018If you can\u2019t do the stuff then just pretend.\u2019 I was pretending to do pli\u00e9s and I just faked it until I made it and then, two years later, I was on the West End stage.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb4e9558608be3ebe70f9e3ff2065814e0c2cef2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4e9558608be3ebe70f9e3ff2065814e0c2cef2/0_168_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Layton Williams and the other winning Billy Elliots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Williams <em>(front row, third from left)</em> with the other winning Billies, with the director Stephen Daldry and actor Haydn Gwynne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SAV/FilmMagic</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What does he recall about opening night? \u201cI remember being the most nervous I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. But I was well prepped; I\u2019d been training for a year and a half and it was about halfway through the show that I started to enjoy it and say: \u2018You know what? I\u2019ve got this.\u2019 At the end of that first performance I knew that I was going to be an actor. You don\u2019t usually find your career at 12 years old, but I just stumbled across it.\u201d</p> \n<p>During his Billy Elliot run Williams was cast in Beautiful People, the sitcom based on Simon Doonan\u2019s memoirs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/07/olivia-colman-iron-lady-interview\" title=\"\">starred Olivia Colman</a>. (\u201cShe\u2019s a queen,\u201d says Williams. \u201cLiterally, she\u2019s played one queen and now she\u2019s about to play another.\u201d) But when that finished filming its first season, Williams\u2019s early career stalled and he found himself completing secondary school in Bury. The stresses and strains that the Billy Elliot casting directors had predicted actually came after the fuss had died down. \u201cI went back thinking I could fit back in,\u201d says Williams, who is gay but was yet to come out when he returned to Bury. \u201cYou can imagine. I was on TV playing a really out, basically gay young character [in Beautiful People], which didn\u2019t help my not being out. I was almost out and then I had to go back in again.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve always known. It\u2019s just been there,\u201d Williams says about his sexuality. \u201cI guess when I came to London as a 12 year old and I started working with gay people and knowing what a gay person was, and I thought: \u2018I think that\u2019s me.\u2019 And then: woooo, she\u2019s there! It was a full transformation: from wearing trackies every day to everything being pink.\u201d</p> \n<p>While in the West End, Williams had a private tutor and was in a theatreland bubble where he was free to express himself. Back in Bury, he had to deal with bullying and the fear that his two-year stint in Billy Elliot was the sum total of his acting career. \u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2018bullied\u2019 bullied, but it\u2019s like in the story with Jamie,\u201d says Williams referring to the musical, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/a-lad-in-a-frock-the-gay-teen-who-inspired-a-west-end-show\" title=\"\">based on the 2011 BBC documentary Jamie: Drag Queen at 16</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s that one boy who tries to put him down and tell him he\u2019s nowt special. And I had that in my school with one boy. He\u2019d say stuff like: \u2018You were a West End star, but you\u2019re nothing now.\u2019 He really wanted to make me feel like I was a piece of shit. And it worked. I was probably at my lowest place when I was 14 years old.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"041b7133c3ef74d0620ab80a3b312e64360a0ee8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/041b7133c3ef74d0620ab80a3b312e64360a0ee8/378_0_3018_3019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the TV comedy Bad Education, with Jack Whitehall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2012 in the TV comedy Bad Education, with Jack Whitehall.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Tiger Aspect/Jonathan Hall</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Williams remembers going round to his grandfather\u2019s house and the pair frantically trying to plot a course for his West End return. \u201cIt was a mission,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI sent emails, I sent letters. I didn\u2019t even dance for a few months. I\u2019d gone from leading West End actor and filming a TV show to not even being able to perform. I was bursting to be creative. I would ride my bike to school with my hoodie on, but inside I was this raging queen.\u201d</p> \n<p>A second season of Beautiful People and a scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy gave Williams a route back to London, and he has stayed ever since, playing some of the biggest parts in contemporary musical theatre (Angel in Bruce Guthrie\u2019s production of Rent, Simon in Bourne\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIT5bJY2o0E\" title=\"\"> Lord of the Flies</a> and Seaweed in Hairspray), as well as getting a part in Jack Whitehall\u2019s terrible-teacher comedy Bad Education. \u201cI earned the most money in my family at 12 years old,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford private school \u2013 I needed a scholarship \u2013 and Italia Conti were amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>After his experiences, Williams has become an equality campaigner. He visits schools to raise awareness of LGBT issues and bullying, and uses <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaytonWilliams?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">his big Twitter following</a> to call out homophobia and racism. Last summer, a video of Williams being removed from the Assembly festival\u2019s temporary venue in George Square during the Edinburgh fringe went viral, after he accused security staff of racially profiling him. \u201cThis is a fucking joke. Want to talk about racial profiling?

I showed them my flight details \u2013 I\u2019d only just got to Edinburgh and two weeks before that I was in Los Angeles \u2013 but they wouldn\u2019t have it. And then it hit me what was going on.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019ve not been in here before,\u201d says Layton Williams as he steps into an upstairs bar at the Apollo theatre in the London\u2019s West End, where he is about to star in the hit musical Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie. Our interview is ready to start but he is busy craning his neck to look out of the window to see the exact spot where his likeness will appear on the theatre\u2019s billboard overlooking Shaftesbury Avenue. \u201cOh, that\u2019s going to be my face,\u201d he says. \u201cWild.\u201d When you speak to Williams, everything is larger than life, from the 20ft picture of him that\u2019s going to adorn the Apollo to his mile-a-minute storytelling and RuPaul-like lexicon (\u201cwild\u201d and \u201ciconic\u201d feature regularly during our hour-long chat). He is part mixed-race Bury lad with an accent that has barely softened after a decade in London, part West End showman who slips into lingo you would expect to hear while watching Paris Is Burning. He is extravagant, ebullient and infectiously enthusiastic. But you would probably forgive Williams for being jaded, even at the age of 24. He has been working in the West End since he was 12, after he won a nationwide hunt for the next Billy Elliot. Newspaper features followed, as did a TV appearance in which a cherubic Williams tried to teach Vernon Kay how to pli\u00e9 (he couldn\u2019t, although he did breakdance). It is easy to forget how big the Billy Elliot talent hunt was in 2006. \u201cThe emotional, mental and physical demands on whichever of these kids take over as replacements, and on their families, are enormous,\u201d the casting director, Jessica Ronane, said in 2006. She estimated that she saw more than 4,000 potential stars as productions were being planned to launch in Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany and on Broadway. And yet it very nearly didn\u2019t happen for Williams. His mum spotted the advert and said they should make the short trip from Bury to Manchester. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know what an audition was,\u201d says Williams, who had been training at the Carol Godby Theatre Workshop in his hometown, which has produced a long-line of soap stars. \u201cThere were thousands of people and I very nearly turned around because I was the only person of colour I could see. It was just white boys everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then my step-dad said: \u2018Look, we\u2019ve driven all the way here. You\u2019re going in.\u2019\u201d That bit of pushy parenting paid off as Williams impressed the judges with his fresh, unrefined talent. \u201cBecause I was so raw \u2013 I didn\u2019t do ballet, I didn\u2019t do tap, I had no vocal training \u2013 I was basically the Billy Elliot story. I would love to see my tapes, because they said: \u2018If you can\u2019t do the stuff then just pretend.\u2019 I was pretending to do pli\u00e9s and I just faked it until I made it and then, two years later, I was on the West End stage.\u201d What does he recall about opening night? \u201cI remember being the most nervous I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. But I was well prepped; I\u2019d been training for a year and a half and it was about halfway through the show that I started to enjoy it and say: \u2018You know what? I\u2019ve got this.\u2019 At the end of that first performance I knew that I was going to be an actor. You don\u2019t usually find your career at 12 years old, but I just stumbled across it.\u201d During his Billy Elliot run Williams was cast in Beautiful People, the sitcom based on Simon Doonan\u2019s memoirs that starred Olivia Colman. (\u201cShe\u2019s a queen,\u201d says Williams. \u201cLiterally, she\u2019s played one queen and now she\u2019s about to play another.\u201d) But when that finished filming its first season, Williams\u2019s early career stalled and he found himself completing secondary school in Bury. The stresses and strains that the Billy Elliot casting directors had predicted actually came after the fuss had died down. \u201cI went back thinking I could fit back in,\u201d says Williams, who is gay but was yet to come out when he returned to Bury. \u201cYou can imagine. I was on TV playing a really out, basically gay young character [in Beautiful People], which didn\u2019t help my not being out. I was almost out and then I had to go back in again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always known. It\u2019s just been there,\u201d Williams says about his sexuality. \u201cI guess when I came to London as a 12 year old and I started working with gay people and knowing what a gay person was, and I thought: \u2018I think that\u2019s me.\u2019 And then: woooo, she\u2019s there! It was a full transformation: from wearing trackies every day to everything being pink.\u201d While in the West End, Williams had a private tutor and was in a theatreland bubble where he was free to express himself. Back in Bury, he had to deal with bullying and the fear that his two-year stint in Billy Elliot was the sum total of his acting career. \u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2018bullied\u2019 bullied, but it\u2019s like in the story with Jamie,\u201d says Williams referring to the musical, which is based on the 2011 BBC documentary Jamie: Drag Queen at 16. \u201cThere\u2019s that one boy who tries to put him down and tell him he\u2019s nowt special. And I had that in my school with one boy. He\u2019d say stuff like: \u2018You were a West End star, but you\u2019re nothing now.\u2019 He really wanted to make me feel like I was a piece of shit. And it worked. I was probably at my lowest place when I was 14 years old.\u201d Williams remembers going round to his grandfather\u2019s house and the pair frantically trying to plot a course for his West End return. \u201cIt was a mission,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI sent emails, I sent letters. I didn\u2019t even dance for a few months. I\u2019d gone from leading West End actor and filming a TV show to not even being able to perform. I was bursting to be creative. I would ride my bike to school with my hoodie on, but inside I was this raging queen.\u201d A second season of Beautiful People and a scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy gave Williams a route back to London, and he has stayed ever since, playing some of the biggest parts in contemporary musical theatre (Angel in Bruce Guthrie\u2019s production of Rent, Simon in Bourne\u2019s Lord of the Flies and Seaweed in Hairspray), as well as getting a part in Jack Whitehall\u2019s terrible-teacher comedy Bad Education. \u201cI earned the most money in my family at 12 years old,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford private school \u2013 I needed a scholarship \u2013 and Italia Conti were amazing.\u201d After his experiences, Williams has become an equality campaigner. He visits schools to raise awareness of LGBT issues and bullying, and uses his big Twitter following to call out homophobia and racism. Last summer, a video of Williams being removed from the Assembly festival\u2019s temporary venue in George Square during the Edinburgh fringe went viral, after he accused security staff of racially profiling him. \u201cThis is a fucking joke. Want to talk about racial profiling? Here it is in the flesh,\u201d he said in a video taken outside the venue, after he had been told to leave because he was acting \u201csuspiciously\u201d and resembled someone who had jumped the venue\u2019s fence two weeks before. \u201cThe joke is I extended my stay because I was loving Edinburgh that much I had booked a hotel and changed my flight. I should have gone home,\u201d says Williams, who was visiting the fringe for the first time. \u201cThey said I looked suspicious, so they needed to chuck me out. I showed them my flight details \u2013 I\u2019d only just got to Edinburgh and two weeks before that I was in Los Angeles \u2013 but they wouldn\u2019t have it. And then it hit me what was going on. There was no other black person in there. I called them out on it and asked them if that was the reason. Then the video happened.\u201d It was the first time anything like that had happened to Williams, but he says a mix of that experience and reading Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2019s bestselling book Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race has made him more aware of the way he is treated as a mixed-race man living in the UK. \u201cI\u2019ll sit in first class and the stewardess or steward won\u2019t have checked anyone else coming through,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThen they\u2019ll say: \u2018Sorry sir, do you have a first-class ticket. Do you know this is first class?\u2019 It\u2019s that. It\u2019s that underlying thing. I know what it is. I\u2019ll take a look around and, of course, I\u2019m the only person of colour in this carriage. I can only do the maths. Honestly, it\u2019s weird.\u201d In the West End, Williams has a network of actors of colour who support each other. \u201cWe really do stick together and we\u2019ve got each others\u2019 backs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared to speak up for what we think is right.\u201d They also like to remind Williams about his Vernon Kay interview, where Kay asks Williams if he wants to wear a tutu. \u201cObviously, inside I was loving it, but I didn\u2019t want to put it on on live TV,\u201d recalls Williams, who refused to wear it. \u201cMy friends always pull me up on it and say: \u2018Remember when you said, \u201cThat\u2019s not for me\u201d, when really it was for you?\u2019 Who am I kidding? I was living in that tutu.\u201d \u2022 Layton Williams takes over the lead in Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie at the Apollo theatre, London W1, from 28 January \u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2019.

The Chinese suspension will do little to reduce the activities of criminal syndicates who view wild tigers as a low-risk, high-gain financial option. The medicinal value of wildlife body parts in south-east Asian markets remains significant, at about $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) a year. The trade is second only to the illicit drug smuggling market, according to statistics published by Crown Ridge Tiger Sanctuary. The sanctuary lists the value of various parts of a tiger to smugglers, with eyes worth $170, a paw $1,000, and powdered tiger bone fetching $64-$168 a pound. \u201cTiger bone wine\u201d fetches up to $30,000 a case. The remains found in the cab had a potential value of $20,000. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) run a number of programmes aimed at protecting and increasing the number of tigers with a view to doubling the world\u2019s wild tiger population by 2022. They calculate that saving a single tiger and its environment protects roughly 25,000 acres of forest, which in turn sustains other wildlife and local communities. Rebecca May, WWF\u2019s Asia programme manager, said: \u201cThe ruthless criminal gangs who ensnare and kill these and other endangered species, to supply a demand for their body parts, are part of a global industry that\u2019s worth over \u00a312bn a year. \u201cThere are growing calls for change; for a seismic shift in consumer behaviour which drives this brutal trade, and for a crackdown on trafficking in wildlife parts \u2013 as well as an appreciation and realisation of the importance of big apex predators, such as the tiger, to the global ecosystem, in which we all live and depend on. \u201cThe future of wild tigers in south-east Asia remains precarious and we need strong political will to bring an end to organised crime, as the illegal trade is one of the biggest threats to tigers.\u201d Globally, only an estimated 3,900 tigers are left in the wild, a loss of more than 95% since the beginning of the 20th century.",

Now, Australia also has the best evidence plain packaging works. Government data has found a 0.5% reduction in smoking rates.

Taxes are the most effective, yet least utilized, tobacco control tool. The biggest hurdle to enacting taxes, experts say, is the industry\u2019s well-funded opposition.</p>\n    <p>Cigarette makers argue taxes fuel black market smuggling and counterfeit production. In turn, cigarette companies and their allies say increased taxes cause violence, revenue loss and lead to more harmful cigarettes. Tobacco control experts have found companies exaggerate smuggling evidence, and groups such as the Fraser Institute <a href=\"http://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/6/401\">often echo</a> those concerns.<br></p>\n    <p>In one study, an International Agency for Research in Cancer expert panel found tax avoidance does not wipe out the public health benefits of increased tobacco taxes.

      "bodyText": "The British high commission in Malaysia gave tens of thousands of pounds to a local thinktank while it argued against tobacco controls already enacted in the UK. At the same time it was funded by the British foreign office, the thinktank received substantial funding from three multinational tobacco companies. The conduct of the high commission raises questions about whether diplomats went against guidelines to \u201climit interactions\u201d with the tobacco industry, following previous criticism of diplomatic support for the tobacco industry abroad. British and American diplomatic missions funded the thinktank, the Kuala Lumpur-based Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas), while it argued against tobacco taxes and plain packaging. The UK enacted plain packaging in 2014. The news follows a Guardian analysis of free-market thinktanks around the world that have taken positions aligned with the tobacco industry. Many thinktanks argued that they recognize the risks of smoking, were independent and opposed ineffective regulation rather than all tobacco regulation. The analysis revealed at least 106 free-market thinktanks around the world took positions aligned with the tobacco industry in the past decade, accepted donations from the tobacco industry or both. Reporting by the Observer last year has also shown how how the Foreign Office championed British American Tobacco\u2019s interests abroad. A spokesperson for Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) told the Guardian: \u201cThe British high commission in Malaysia has not and does not co-finance or partner in any way with tobacco companies, or support projects which promote tobacco use. \u201cAll FCO-led programmes follow the standards set out by HM Treasury. They receive robust scrutiny to ensure that all spend represents value for money for UK taxpayers and advances the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals and our foreign policy objectives.\u201d Mary Assunta, a senior policy adviser at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (Seatca), said: \u201cIdeas jumped into tobacco control only recently and was making policy statements that echoed the tobacco industry\u2019s position. \u201cWhen a group or a consultant uses certain familiar buzz words and pushes anti-health proposals, look deeper, and you will find the link to the tobacco industry.\u201d In response to questions from the Guardian, Ideas said it followed \u201ca strict policy of editorial independence\u201d, and \u201cthus no donations influence our research and analytical outputs\u201d. \u201cLess than 15% of our annual funding from the tobacco industry,\u201d Ideas said, noting that it publicly disclosed donations by tobacco companies. \u201cIdeas is perhaps the only civil society organization in Malaysia which maintains this level of transparency.

In one example, the group\u2019s then executive director, Wan Saiful Wan Jan, wrote a column in the national newspaper the Star criticizing the Malaysian health department\u2019s push for plain packaging. \u201cI don\u2019t smoke and I get annoyed if people smoke near me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut notwithstanding my attitude towards smoking, paternalistic government behaviour is more dangerous and must be rejected when we see it.\u201d In June 2016, Seatca warned the British high commission in Malaysia that Ideas was \u201cmouthing the same arguments used by the tobacco industry in the UK\u201d.

They slept late into the afternoon, having worked a double shift the day before. When they woke up, a wave of happiness washed over them \u2013 they were in a relationship, had a job they loved at a local concert venue. Their life was good.</p> <p>By the time they roused themselves, the deadliest high school shooting in US history was already over. A 19-year-old with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle had entered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/14/florida-shooting-school-latest-news-stoneman-douglas\">Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida</a>, and opened fire. Seventeen had been killed, though Fontaine, who has no cable TV or radio, was oblivious to the tragedy.</p> <p>Then they received a text from a friend. A photo of Fontaine was flying around the internet and they were being accused of carrying out the terrible Florida shooting.</p> <p>Their immediate response was bewilderment. What shooting? Where? Fontaine was in Massachusetts, 1,500 miles away. It would take a four-hour flight to reach the school. They\u2019d only visited Florida once when they were a little boy to see Mickey Mouse.</p> <p>Fontaine, 25, describes themselves on Twitter as a \u201cnon-binary gay queer autistic commie that loves horror movies and metal!\u201d They were diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum as a child and for years has struggled with anxiety and a debilitating stammer.

The T-shirt, Fontaine protests, was a joke, a pun on Communist <em>party</em>.</p> <p>In the conspiratorial bubble of 4chan, it was but a small step from ridiculing Fontaine to casting them as the Parkland shooter. Within two hours of the massacre, the image had been reposted on the bulletin board, now saying: \u201cFlorida Shooter Was A Commie!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"adaa00ffa78f6eb1bc8211ab66aa09b395986edc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adaa00ffa78f6eb1bc8211ab66aa09b395986edc/0_80_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcel Fontaine was horrified to discover that they were accused of being the Parkland gunman.

Its \u201creporter\u201d lifted Fontaine\u2019s photo directly from 4chan and, without any attempt at verification, ran with it on the front page. \u201cShooter is a commie. Alleged photo of the suspect shows communist garb,\u201d the outlet screamed. The false rumor quickly spread from Miami to Beijing.</p> <p>Fontaine was horrified. \u201cI knew a lot about the Alex Jones fanbase \u2013 that they were radical extremists who believe every word he says, and that a lot of them hold firearms. I knew my life was at risk.\u201d</p> <p>The first death threats landed via Facebook messenger by nightfall: \u201cI hope someone throws you out of a rotary aircraft, you commie!\u201d Another made a direct reference to the concert venue that employed them. \u201cThey knew where I worked, what I did. It just got me so afraid.\u201d</p> <p>Death threats and autism spectrum conditions make poor bedfellows, and exacerbated Fontaine\u2019s condition, ramping up their anxiety, insomnia and social isolation.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to function, to cook, do basic tasks. I went days without taking a shower. I didn\u2019t want to go out, I just wanted to be with myself.\u201d Soon, they started having frequent panic attacks.</p> <p>Over the past six months, Fontaine has slowly pulled themselves back together. They are in therapy to combat the bouts of panic and sleeplessness that still trouble them. But they have become less trusting of people and freezes whenever they see someone dressed in camouflage or wearing a Make America Great Again hat. Do they read Infowars? Fontaine wonders. \u201cI get very nervous because they might recognize me and want to actually pull something out on me. Or like beat me to a pulp.\u201d</p> <p>As the anniversary of the shooting approaches, they find it hard to understand why they were singled out. \u201cIt makes me sad. This event got me to a point where I just can\u2019t be myself again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/01/conspiracy/v8/lenny.html\" data-alt=\"Lenny Pozner's six-year-old son Noah died at Sandy Hook in 2012.

A few weeks ago, \u201choaxers\u201d \u2013 as he calls conspiracy theorists \u2013 reproduced a map of his Florida neighborhood with a dropped pin marking the precise location of his apartment. It will be the eighth time in five years he will have been forced to move home as he strives to keep one step ahead of the fanatics who relentlessly hound him.</p> <p>Pozner\u2019s crime, in the eyes of conspiracy theorists, is being the father of one of the 20 children who were gunned down in the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Noah was the youngest of all victims. He had just turned six.</p> <p>Within months, conspiracy theorists, egged on by Alex Jones and Infowars, went to work. They generated thousands of web posts and a 426-page book called \u201cNobody Died at Sandy Hook\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/14/conspiracy-theories-misconceptions-rampant-politics\">Conspiracy theories are more rampant than ever. Can they be stopped?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their thesis: the shooting at the elementary school never happened. The 20 kids who died were \u201ccrisis actors\u201d. The tragedy was a con. Noah had never even existed, he was a construct of Photoshop.</p> <p>Within a year, it had reached such a pitch that Pozner knew he had to do something. \u201cI agonized about the situation for several weeks. But ultimately I felt I owed it to my son to protect his memory.\u201d He posted on his Google+ page his son\u2019s birth and death certificates and kindergarten report card.</p> <p>\u201cI was extremely naive. I believed that people were simply misinformed and that if I released proof that my child had existed, thrived, loved and was loved, and was ultimately murdered, they would understand our grief, stop harassing us, and more importantly, stop defacing photos of Noah and defaming him online.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he watched his deceased son buried a second time, under hundreds of pages of hateful web content. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one word that fits the horror of it,\u201d Pozner says. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon of the age which we\u2019re in, modern day witch-hunts. It\u2019s a form of mass delusion.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42227533195e43f5f940e53cf68dc28ef3f9d627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42227533195e43f5f940e53cf68dc28ef3f9d627/0_85_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lenny Pozner has been fighting to prove his son\u2019s existence and has moved house multiple times to escape death threats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lenny Pozner has been fighting to prove his son\u2019s existence and has moved house multiple times to escape death threats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pozner is extraordinarily controlled. His voice is flat and preternaturally calm, as though all emotion has been pummeled out of him. His apartment has the same pared-down, antiseptic quality. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten good at moving, I\u2019ve adapted to it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He left Newtown for Florida in 2013 with Noah\u2019s mother, his now former wife Veronique De La Rosa, and their two daughters in the hope of rebuilding their lives. (He asked the Guardian not to identify the town he now lives in.) He has deliveries sent to a separate address and has rented multiple postal boxes as decoys.</p> <p>The most serious of death threats came from Lucy Richards, a Florida resident who was so fervent in her belief that the Sandy Hook massacre was fake that she left messages on Pozner\u2019s cellphone saying: \u201cYou\u2019re going to die. Death is coming to you real soon, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d In June 2017, Richards was<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/08/sandy-hook-hoaxer-gets-prison-time-for-threatening-6-year-old-victims-father/?utm_term=.bee2ebf384a0\"> sentenced</a> to five months in prison, followed by a further five months under house arrest.</p> <p>Pozner sees this outpouring of hatred as a product of digital technology running ahead of society\u2019s ability to contain it. \u201cSocial media hasn\u2019t matured. We lack a segment of law enforcement specializing in it. There really is no one to help.\u201d</p> <p>But he reserves his staunchest criticism for Alex Jones, who he blames for amplifying conspiracies in the pursuit of profit. In a<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5673351-2018-04-16-Pozner-Original-Petition-File-Stamped.html\"> lawsuit</a> suing Jones for defamation for more than $1m, lawyers for Pozner and De La Rosa chronicle how Infowars baited them over many years: the shooting was \u201cstaged\u201d, a \u201cgiant hoax\u201d. The school was an elaborate film set. It was all a \u201csoap opera\u201d.</p> <p>But in targeting Pozner, Jones picked on the wrong guy. Since 2014 Pozner has made it his life\u2019s work to confront the conspiracy theorists. Through his organization the<a href=\"https://www.honr.com/\"> Honr Network</a>, Pozner has systematically challenged those who he believes cross that line, forcing moderators to delete posts. In 2018 alone, he reported 2,568 videos to YouTube and had 1,555 of those expunged.</p> <p>Pozner\u2019s lawsuit against Jones, which mirrors a<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5673455-2018-04-02-Complaint-Fontaine-v-Infowars-POP.html\"> similar legal case</a> brought by Fontaine, is making its way through a federal court in Austin, Texas. Earlier this month they received a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/families-sandy-hook-shooting-victims-win-legal-victory/story?id=60314174\">legal boost</a> when the judge granted them access to Jones\u2019s financial and marketing documents under discovery.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5673352-2018-05-28-D-s-Answer.html\">Jones denies</a> defaming anyone, though he has so far failed in having the suits dismissed on free speech grounds.</p> <p>Regarding the free speech argument, Pozner says: \u201cYou have the right to express yourself and your opinions, no matter how offensive they may be, <em>until </em>your chosen form of expression impedes my rights to be free from defamation and harassment.\u201d</p> <p>What shocks Pozner most, he says, was how alone he was when he began this fight. \u201cI was the only one standing up to the hoaxers, and other than the loss of my son that was my biggest disappointment at the time.\u201d</p> <p>At least he has brought his son\u2019s memory back to life. If you search Noah Pozner on Google you will find hundreds of articles about the boy\u2019s life and death, and virtually none of the bile from those who questioned his existence.</p> <p>By Pozner\u2019s reckoning, one in five people around the world are suggestible to conspiracy theories, and their obsessions are amplified by the crude logic of digital algorithms. \u201cThere is just no more truth, there is just what\u2019s trending on Twitter,\u201d he says. \u201cUsed to be, you had to burn books to keep people from finding out the truth, now you just have to push it to page 20 of a Google search.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/01/conspiracy/v8/paul.html\" data-alt=\"Dr Paul Offit is a vaccine scientist in Philadelphia.

His latest death threat arrived only about a month ago, when someone wrote on a forum frequented by vaccine skeptics that Offit was \u201cdead already so they might as well assassinate him\u201d.</p> <p>Offit\u2019s worldview, as a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s hospital of Philadelphia who has himself created a vaccine against rotavirus, had always revolved around the scientific method and evidence-based reality. \u201cThe assumption was that if you publish good papers in good journals, truth emerges and people abandon ill-founded beliefs.

Wakefield went on to advise parents to avoid MMR immunization for their children, spreading pandemonium across Europe and the US. In 2000, Offit decided to act, shocked that nobody was standing up for science. He set up the<a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center\"> Vaccine Education Center</a> to give the public a basic appreciation of vaccines which globally prevent up to 3m deaths each year.</p> <p>The backlash came almost immediately. It began with a flurry of emails calling him Satan, a Nazi. \u201cIt was devastating. It hurt, it always hurt, it still hurts. I never got so thick-skinned that when people assume my motives are evil it doesn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p> <p>He was stalked by a man who followed him from from one speaking engagement to the next.

The man mentioned he had young children the same age as Offit\u2019s. \u201cWe all want what\u2019s best for our children, I\u2019m sure you want what\u2019s best for your children,\u201d the man said, before going on to name Offit\u2019s kids as well as the school they attended.</p> <p>It was the one time that Offit considered dropping it all. That night, he talked to his wife, Bonnie, and offered to quit standing up for vaccines. \u201cIf Bonnie had said stop to me that night, I would have stopped.\u201d Bonnie told him to hang in there. You\u2019re doing the right thing, she said, for science, for children. You mustn\u2019t let them shut you up.</p> <p>Offit, 67, is hanging in there, sustained by two powerful motivations. The first is anger: although at least 17 major studies have found that MMR does not cause autism, conspiracy theorists continue to propound the falsehood. Offit is angry in particular at what he calls the \u201csmall group of professionals who do this as a living, the media-savvy, politically connected, lawyer-backed group\u201d of anti-vaxxers who have become all the more vocal by using the internet as an organizing tool.</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re evil, to be quite frank. I think they hurt children, they put children in harm\u2019s way and to me they have to be defeated.\u201d</p> <p>His second motivation: children. As<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/21/measles-cases-at-highest-for-20-years-in-europe-as-anti-vaccine-movement-grows\"> the Guardian reported</a> last month, anti-vaccine movements spurred on by rightwing populism are on the rise across Europe and immunization rates are plummeting as a result. The World Health Organization has included such movements \u2013 which it called \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d \u2013 among its <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019\">top 10 global health threats</a> for 2019.</p> <p>The result of this surge in conspiracy theories around vaccines is that measles outbreaks are at a 20-year high. In 2018 there were more than 60,000 European cases with 72 deaths, twice the number from the year before.</p> <p>Offit has seen at first hand what that means. One of the cases that haunts him is that of a mother who decided not to vaccinate her infant son against influenza, having read some fallacious material about the treatment.</p> <p>The little boy was brought in to the hospital and went through a progression of increasingly invasive care as his body was ravaged with flu. First the child was given an oxygen face mask, then put in a ventilator, then an oscillator and heart-lung machine, until finally he died. \u201cThe mother watched her child die in slow motion, like falling off a cliff slowly. It was very hard.\u201d</p> <p>After the boy\u2019s death, Offit asked the mother if she would be willing to talk to other parents wrestling with the decision to vaccinate as a way of preventing further tragedy. She politely declined. \u201cShe said to me she still thinks she made the right choice \u2013 the vaccine would have been more harmful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/01/conspiracy/v8/brianna.html\" data-alt=\"Brianna Wu is a video game producer who became caught up in GamerGate and received more than 300 death threats.

Hillary Clinton, so the narrative went, was masterminding a global child-trafficking ring that was holding kids as sex slaves in his basement.</p> <p>The rumor-mongering began when private emails of John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign manager, were stolen allegedly by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-the-russians-hacked-the-dnc-and-passed-its-emails-to-wikileaks/2018/07/13/af19a828-86c3-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html?utm_term=.bcfcc8d733d0\">Russian agents</a> and released through WikiLeaks. In them, Podesta mentioned his brother Tony\u2019s friend and their occasional cooking companion, Alefantis, as well as a fundraising dinner they were planning together at Comet Ping Pong.</p> <p>Soon, photos of Alefantis\u2019 godchildren were being lifted from his Instagram page and repackaged to support claims of hideous pedophilia. Conspiracy theorists were arguing that \u201cJames Alefantis\u201d was a bastardization of<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7f0bwm/james_alefantis_or_jaime_les_enfants/\"> \u201cj\u2019aime les enfant\u201d</a> (I like children) and that cheese pizza, \u201ccp\u201d for short, was a code for child pornography.</p> <p>The heinous notion that Alefantis was a pedophile working with Hillary Clinton to abuse children in the basement of his restaurant (Comet Ping Pong has no basement) hurtled around the internet. Abusive messages were posted on the restaurant\u2019s Facebook page and in Yelp reviews; one online critic claimed to have found a child\u2019s hand in his pizza.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/crisis-actors-deep-state-false-flag-the-rise-of-conspiracy-theory-code-words\">Crisis actors, deep state, false flag: the rise of conspiracy theory code words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was not until bigger beasts got involved that it became truly dangerous.

      "bodyText": "Conspiracy theories used to be seen as bizarre expressions of harmless eccentrics. Not any more. Gone are the days of outlandish theories about Roswell\u2019s UFOs, the \u201choax\u201d moon landings or grassy knolls. Instead, today\u2019s iterations have morphed into political weapons. Turbocharged by social media, they spread with astonishing speed, using death threats as currency. Together with their first cousins, fake news, they are challenging society\u2019s trust in facts. At its most toxic, this contagion poses a profound threat to democracy by damaging its bedrock: a shared commitment to truth. Their growing reach and scale is astonishing. A University of Chicago study estimated in 2014 that half of the American public consistently endorses at least one conspiracy theory. When they repeated the survey last November, the proportion had risen to 61%. The startling finding was echoed by a recent study from the University of Cambridge that found 60% of Britons are wedded to a false narrative. The trend began on obscure online forums such as the alt-right playground 4chan. Soon, media entrepreneurs realized there was money to be made \u2013 most notoriously Alex Jones, whose site Infowars feeds its millions of readers a potent diet of lurid lies (9/11 was a government hit job; the feds manipulate the weather.) Now the conspiracy theorist-in-chief sits in the White House. Donald Trump cut his political teeth on the \u201cbirther\u201d lie that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and went on to embrace climate change denial, rampant voter fraud and the discredited belief that childhood vaccines may cause autism. Amid this explosive growth, one aspect has been underappreciated: the human cost. What is the toll paid by those caught up in these falsehoods? And how are they fighting back? The Guardian talked to five people who can speak from bitter personal experience. We begin in a town we will not identify in Massachusetts where a young man, who tells his story here for the first time, was asleep in his bed. * * * Valentine\u2019s Day 2018 was Marcel Fontaine\u2019s day off. They slept late into the afternoon, having worked a double shift the day before. When they woke up, a wave of happiness washed over them \u2013 they were in a relationship, had a job they loved at a local concert venue. Their life was good. By the time they roused themselves, the deadliest high school shooting in US history was already over. A 19-year-old with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle had entered the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, and opened fire. Seventeen had been killed, though Fontaine, who has no cable TV or radio, was oblivious to the tragedy. Then they received a text from a friend. A photo of Fontaine was flying around the internet and they were being accused of carrying out the terrible Florida shooting. Their immediate response was bewilderment. What shooting? Where? Fontaine was in Massachusetts, 1,500 miles away. It would take a four-hour flight to reach the school. They\u2019d only visited Florida once when they were a little boy to see Mickey Mouse. Fontaine, 25, describes themselves on Twitter as a \u201cnon-binary gay queer autistic commie that loves horror movies and metal!\u201d They were diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum as a child and for years has struggled with anxiety and a debilitating stammer. At moments of heightened stress, they flap their hands like a bird. In short, Fontaine is a vulnerable leftwing individual who would not harm a flea, which apparently makes them perfect fodder for the sadistic mockery of 4chan, the anonymous message board that hosts alt-right activists and other extremists. A few days before the Parkland shooting, a photo of Fontaine wearing a T-shirt of Marx, Lenin, Mao and other communist luminaries dressed in party hats had been grabbed from his Instagram feed and posted by an anonymous user on 4chan, where they were promptly derided as a \u201clefty dimwit\u201d. The T-shirt, Fontaine protests, was a joke, a pun on Communist party. In the conspiratorial bubble of 4chan, it was but a small step from ridiculing Fontaine to casting them as the Parkland shooter. Within two hours of the massacre, the image had been reposted on the bulletin board, now saying: \u201cFlorida Shooter Was A Commie!\u201d From there, Alex Jones\u2019s conspiracy theory site, Infowars, leapt into the fray. Its \u201creporter\u201d lifted Fontaine\u2019s photo directly from 4chan and, without any attempt at verification, ran with it on the front page. \u201cShooter is a commie. Alleged photo of the suspect shows communist garb,\u201d the outlet screamed. The false rumor quickly spread from Miami to Beijing. Fontaine was horrified. \u201cI knew a lot about the Alex Jones fanbase \u2013 that they were radical extremists who believe every word he says, and that a lot of them hold firearms. I knew my life was at risk.\u201d The first death threats landed via Facebook messenger by nightfall: \u201cI hope someone throws you out of a rotary aircraft, you commie!\u201d Another made a direct reference to the concert venue that employed them. \u201cThey knew where I worked, what I did. It just got me so afraid.\u201d Death threats and autism spectrum conditions make poor bedfellows, and exacerbated Fontaine\u2019s condition, ramping up their anxiety, insomnia and social isolation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to function, to cook, do basic tasks. I went days without taking a shower. I didn\u2019t want to go out, I just wanted to be with myself.\u201d Soon, they started having frequent panic attacks. Over the past six months, Fontaine has slowly pulled themselves back together. They are in therapy to combat the bouts of panic and sleeplessness that still trouble them. But they have become less trusting of people and freezes whenever they see someone dressed in camouflage or wearing a Make America Great Again hat. Do they read Infowars? Fontaine wonders. \u201cI get very nervous because they might recognize me and want to actually pull something out on me. Or like beat me to a pulp.\u201d As the anniversary of the shooting approaches, they find it hard to understand why they were singled out. \u201cIt makes me sad. This event got me to a point where I just can\u2019t be myself again.\u201d * * * Lenny Pozner, 51, is preparing to pack his bags, again. A few weeks ago, \u201choaxers\u201d \u2013 as he calls conspiracy theorists \u2013 reproduced a map of his Florida neighborhood with a dropped pin marking the precise location of his apartment. It will be the eighth time in five years he will have been forced to move home as he strives to keep one step ahead of the fanatics who relentlessly hound him. Pozner\u2019s crime, in the eyes of conspiracy theorists, is being the father of one of the 20 children who were gunned down in the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Noah was the youngest of all victims. He had just turned six. Within months, conspiracy theorists, egged on by Alex Jones and Infowars, went to work. They generated thousands of web posts and a 426-page book called \u201cNobody Died at Sandy Hook\u201d. Their thesis: the shooting at the elementary school never happened. The 20 kids who died were \u201ccrisis actors\u201d. The tragedy was a con. Noah had never even existed, he was a construct of Photoshop. Within a year, it had reached such a pitch that Pozner knew he had to do something. \u201cI agonized about the situation for several weeks. But ultimately I felt I owed it to my son to protect his memory.\u201d He posted on his Google+ page his son\u2019s birth and death certificates and kindergarten report card. \u201cI was extremely naive. I believed that people were simply misinformed and that if I released proof that my child had existed, thrived, loved and was loved, and was ultimately murdered, they would understand our grief, stop harassing us, and more importantly, stop defacing photos of Noah and defaming him online.\u201d Instead, he watched his deceased son buried a second time, under hundreds of pages of hateful web content. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one word that fits the horror of it,\u201d Pozner says. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon of the age which we\u2019re in, modern day witch-hunts. It\u2019s a form of mass delusion.\u201d Pozner is extraordinarily controlled. His voice is flat and preternaturally calm, as though all emotion has been pummeled out of him. His apartment has the same pared-down, antiseptic quality. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten good at moving, I\u2019ve adapted to it,\u201d he says. He left Newtown for Florida in 2013 with Noah\u2019s mother, his now former wife Veronique De La Rosa, and their two daughters in the hope of rebuilding their lives. (He asked the Guardian not to identify the town he now lives in.) He has deliveries sent to a separate address and has rented multiple postal boxes as decoys. The most serious of death threats came from Lucy Richards, a Florida resident who was so fervent in her belief that the Sandy Hook massacre was fake that she left messages on Pozner\u2019s cellphone saying: \u201cYou\u2019re going to die. Death is coming to you real soon, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d In June 2017, Richards was sentenced to five months in prison, followed by a further five months under house arrest. Pozner sees this outpouring of hatred as a product of digital technology running ahead of society\u2019s ability to contain it. \u201cSocial media hasn\u2019t matured. We lack a segment of law enforcement specializing in it. There really is no one to help.\u201d But he reserves his staunchest criticism for Alex Jones, who he blames for amplifying conspiracies in the pursuit of profit. In a lawsuit suing Jones for defamation for more than $1m, lawyers for Pozner and De La Rosa chronicle how Infowars baited them over many years: the shooting was \u201cstaged\u201d, a \u201cgiant hoax\u201d. The school was an elaborate film set. It was all a \u201csoap opera\u201d. But in targeting Pozner, Jones picked on the wrong guy. Since 2014 Pozner has made it his life\u2019s work to confront the conspiracy theorists. Through his organization the Honr Network, Pozner has systematically challenged those who he believes cross that line, forcing moderators to delete posts. In 2018 alone, he reported 2,568 videos to YouTube and had 1,555 of those expunged. Pozner\u2019s lawsuit against Jones, which mirrors a similar legal case brought by Fontaine, is making its way through a federal court in Austin, Texas. Earlier this month they received a legal boost when the judge granted them access to Jones\u2019s financial and marketing documents under discovery. Jones denies defaming anyone, though he has so far failed in having the suits dismissed on free speech grounds. Regarding the free speech argument, Pozner says: \u201cYou have the right to express yourself and your opinions, no matter how offensive they may be, until your chosen form of expression impedes my rights to be free from defamation and harassment.\u201d What shocks Pozner most, he says, was how alone he was when he began this fight. \u201cI was the only one standing up to the hoaxers, and other than the loss of my son that was my biggest disappointment at the time.\u201d At least he has brought his son\u2019s memory back to life. If you search Noah Pozner on Google you will find hundreds of articles about the boy\u2019s life and death, and virtually none of the bile from those who questioned his existence. By Pozner\u2019s reckoning, one in five people around the world are suggestible to conspiracy theories, and their obsessions are amplified by the crude logic of digital algorithms. \u201cThere is just no more truth, there is just what\u2019s trending on Twitter,\u201d he says. \u201cUsed to be, you had to burn books to keep people from finding out the truth, now you just have to push it to page 20 of a Google search.\u201d * * * Dr Paul Offit strode into a dispute over the safety of children\u2019s vaccines in 1998. Twenty years later, he is still embroiled in it. His latest death threat arrived only about a month ago, when someone wrote on a forum frequented by vaccine skeptics that Offit was \u201cdead already so they might as well assassinate him\u201d. Offit\u2019s worldview, as a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s hospital of Philadelphia who has himself created a vaccine against rotavirus, had always revolved around the scientific method and evidence-based reality. \u201cThe assumption was that if you publish good papers in good journals, truth emerges and people abandon ill-founded beliefs. Didn\u2019t work that way.\u201d In 1998, the since-discredited British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield published a paper in medical journal the Lancet linking the MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella) to autism. Wakefield went on to advise parents to avoid MMR immunization for their children, spreading pandemonium across Europe and the US. In 2000, Offit decided to act, shocked that nobody was standing up for science. He set up the Vaccine Education Center to give the public a basic appreciation of vaccines which globally prevent up to 3m deaths each year. The backlash came almost immediately. It began with a flurry of emails calling him Satan, a Nazi. \u201cIt was devastating. It hurt, it always hurt, it still hurts. I never got so thick-skinned that when people assume my motives are evil it doesn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d He was stalked by a man who followed him from from one speaking engagement to the next. Protesters appeared outside medical meetings bearing placards with Offit\u2019s face above the word \u201cTERRORIST\u201d. A voicemail was left for him at home. The man mentioned he had young children the same age as Offit\u2019s. \u201cWe all want what\u2019s best for our children, I\u2019m sure you want what\u2019s best for your children,\u201d the man said, before going on to name Offit\u2019s kids as well as the school they attended. It was the one time that Offit considered dropping it all. That night, he talked to his wife, Bonnie, and offered to quit standing up for vaccines. \u201cIf Bonnie had said stop to me that night, I would have stopped.\u201d Bonnie told him to hang in there. You\u2019re doing the right thing, she said, for science, for children. You mustn\u2019t let them shut you up. Offit, 67, is hanging in there, sustained by two powerful motivations. The first is anger: although at least 17 major studies have found that MMR does not cause autism, conspiracy theorists continue to propound the falsehood. Offit is angry in particular at what he calls the \u201csmall group of professionals who do this as a living, the media-savvy, politically connected, lawyer-backed group\u201d of anti-vaxxers who have become all the more vocal by using the internet as an organizing tool. \u201cI think they\u2019re evil, to be quite frank. I think they hurt children, they put children in harm\u2019s way and to me they have to be defeated.\u201d His second motivation: children. As the Guardian reported last month, anti-vaccine movements spurred on by rightwing populism are on the rise across Europe and immunization rates are plummeting as a result. The World Health Organization has included such movements \u2013 which it called \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d \u2013 among its top 10 global health threats for 2019. The result of this surge in conspiracy theories around vaccines is that measles outbreaks are at a 20-year high. In 2018 there were more than 60,000 European cases with 72 deaths, twice the number from the year before. Offit has seen at first hand what that means. One of the cases that haunts him is that of a mother who decided not to vaccinate her infant son against influenza, having read some fallacious material about the treatment. The little boy was brought in to the hospital and went through a progression of increasingly invasive care as his body was ravaged with flu. First the child was given an oxygen face mask, then put in a ventilator, then an oscillator and heart-lung machine, until finally he died. \u201cThe mother watched her child die in slow motion, like falling off a cliff slowly. It was very hard.\u201d After the boy\u2019s death, Offit asked the mother if she would be willing to talk to other parents wrestling with the decision to vaccinate as a way of preventing further tragedy. She politely declined. \u201cShe said to me she still thinks she made the right choice \u2013 the vaccine would have been more harmful.\u201d * * * As a developer of video games, Brianna Wu is well placed to judge the stakes involved when someone becomes caught up in the real-world fantasy that is a conspiracy theory. To her trained eye, the chances of prevailing within the maelstrom are passingly low. \u201cIf you address the conspiracy theory head-on, you just amplify the message you are trying to disprove. If you ignore it you just get screamed at and harassed until your career is over. It\u2019s a no-win scenario,\u201d she says. Wu, 41, speaks from brutal experience. \u201cI will never forget the day it happened,\u201d she says, recalling when she tweeted a collage of comments lampooning male conspiracy theorists in her industry. \u201cMy Twitter caught on fire with all kinds of threats and nasty comments. I knew I had a choice to make: I could sit down and say nothing, or I could take a stand.\u201d She did take a stand, and by doing so, propelled herself into Gamergate, the misogynistic conspiracy theory that ran riot through 4chan, its sister imageboard 8chan, Reddit, Twitter and other social media platforms. The blow-up began in 2014 when fellow video game developer Zoe Quinn became the target of hundreds of anonymous male trolls propagating the false claim that she had sought to advance her career by having an affair with a video game journalist. The conflagration spread like wildfire, engulfing several other women in and around the gaming world. The bedlam could not have come at a worse juncture for Wu, erupting just weeks after she had launched her first video game, Revolution 60. Wu believes that women are targeted by conspiracy theorists more frequently than men, and yet they\u2019re rarely heard. \u201cThe cost of speaking out is so high for women, I understand why most decide not to. I\u2019ve heard hundreds of times over the last few years women with children saying \u2018I am afraid to speak up because I don\u2019t want my children to be targeted\u2019. That is an utterly rational position \u2013 many women are correctly scared to talk.\u201d Wu was scared, too. Her frivolous internet meme ridiculing the male trolls of Gamergate triggered an assault that continues to this day. At its peak, a woman turned up at her alma mater, the University of Mississippi, impersonating her in an attempt to acquire her college records. Someone else surreptitiously took photos of her as she went about her daily business. Wu was unaware of it until she received anonymous texts with pictures of her in coffee shops, restaurants, at the movies. An accurate floor plan of her house was assembled and published online, along with her address and pictures of her car and license plate. And then there were the death threats \u2013 up to 300 by her estimate. One message on Twitter threatened to cut off her husband\u2019s \u201ctiny Asian penis\u201d. The couple evacuated their house and took refuge with friends and in hotels. Wu now devotes her time to running for Congress from her home in Dedham, Massachusetts. She sees her candidacy as a way of pressing federal authorities to take the problem of online conspiracy theories and harassment seriously. \u201cThe FBI employs about 30,000 agents in the US. As best as I can tell there\u2019s no division that is specifically tasked with prosecuting extreme threats online \u2013 it\u2019s simply not a priority for them,\u201d she says. Wu looks back on Gamergate and is torn over its legacy for her. On the positive side, \u201cit did show me there\u2019s a toughness and resilience inside myself, it gave me almost rhinoceros-thick skin.\u201d Then she quickly corrects herself. \u201cLet\u2019s not glamorize abuse. I came to a conclusion that having to read every day about people wanting to rape or kill me did permanent damage.\u201d * * * In October 2016, a month before Trump was elected, James Alefantis hosted a party to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Comet Ping Pong, his Washington DC pizza restaurant. Within days, his establishment was under siege and he found himself at the center of the mother of all modern conspiracy theories: Pizzagate. Hillary Clinton, so the narrative went, was masterminding a global child-trafficking ring that was holding kids as sex slaves in his basement. The rumor-mongering began when private emails of John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign manager, were stolen allegedly by Russian agents and released through WikiLeaks. In them, Podesta mentioned his brother Tony\u2019s friend and their occasional cooking companion, Alefantis, as well as a fundraising dinner they were planning together at Comet Ping Pong. Soon, photos of Alefantis\u2019 godchildren were being lifted from his Instagram page and repackaged to support claims of hideous pedophilia. Conspiracy theorists were arguing that \u201cJames Alefantis\u201d was a bastardization of \u201cj\u2019aime les enfant\u201d (I like children) and that cheese pizza, \u201ccp\u201d for short, was a code for child pornography. The heinous notion that Alefantis was a pedophile working with Hillary Clinton to abuse children in the basement of his restaurant (Comet Ping Pong has no basement) hurtled around the internet. Abusive messages were posted on the restaurant\u2019s Facebook page and in Yelp reviews; one online critic claimed to have found a child\u2019s hand in his pizza. But it was not until bigger beasts got involved that it became truly dangerous. Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, retired army general Michael Flynn, fanned the flames by tweeting about Clinton\u2019s \u201csex crimes w children\u201d. Then up popped Alex Jones once more, telling his thousands of Infowars listeners that \u201csomething\u2019s going on, something\u2019s being covered up\u201d, exhorting his devotees to \u201cgo investigate it for yourself\u201d. So they did. The self-appointed \u201cinvestigators\u201d stepped out of the computer screen and began turning up at Comet Ping Pong. \u201cThere was this break into the physical world that began to happen,\u201d Alefantis recalls. \u201cPeople came into the restaurant to film or look around. They came by my house, asking neighbors questions. Suddenly you look around and you don\u2019t know who to trust.\u201d In December 2016, Edgar Welch answered Jones\u2019s call to investigate the satanic child sex ring. He drove 350 miles from North Carolina and burst into Comet Ping Pong armed with three guns. He went table to table, terrifying customers and staff, then shot into a locked closet before giving himself up to police. Six months later, he was sentenced to four years and is still behind bars in Elkton federal prison in Lisbon, Ohio. Alefantis finds it impossible to talk about that day without tearing up. For a full year after the gunman\u2019s appearance, armed guards were posted at both doors of the restaurant, which remains equipped with multiple security cameras and panic buttons. Alex Jones eventually apologized for promoting Pizzagate, and in August was barred from YouTube, Apple and Facebook and other leading social media platforms. Last week the streaming device Roku joined the ban having granted Jones and Infowars access to its content for less than one day. But for Alefantis this is too little too late. The damage has gone too deep. His extraordinary, petrifying ride has taught him a lot about the modern world. At one point, against the advice of friends, he reached out to some of his assailants and asked them why they hated him so much. \u201cI communicated with them. I realized that they also live in fear. That there\u2019s a sense of abandonment and powerlessness where young people online believe the government is conspiring against them or stealing their children which is outrageous but real for them. We have a lot of learning to do about who is disenfranchised in this country.\u201d Through it all he has held on to positive thoughts, encouraged by the support of the community of pizza lovers that rallied around in his darkest hour. \u201cIt feels at times that things are out of control, that hate is on the rise. But I now understand the power of community. It saved this place. There\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t save the rest of the country, or the world.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2019 to correct an interviewee\u2019s pronoun preference.",

It wasn\u2019t until I started to attend the birthday parties of other children, who had amazing ducks or Dolly Varden cakes from the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly Birthday Cake Book, that I realised there are cakes and then there are cakes. My lack of elaborate cakes as a child provided a life lesson: if you want to have your cake and eat it too sometimes you just have to bake it yourself. I unknowingly adopted jazz great Charlie Parker\u2019s philosophy: \u201cMaster your instrument, master the music, and then forget all that shit and just play\u201d. After a brief stint with packet mixes, I moved on to following recipes and making cakes from scratch. After that the key ingredients are courage and creative flair. My first elaborate cake was a train with carriages for my flatmates\u2019 joint birthday in 2010. I had no idea what I was doing, but managed to slather on enough coloured butter icing and sugary bling, in a somewhat decorative manner, without getting too much on the floor. The cake was a massive hit with the drunken house party crowd. Emboldened by this beginner\u2019s success, I then made a very cheeky themed cake for a departing work colleague who used to talk very loudly on the phone about horizontal recreations in an open plan office. Fortunately I escaped the wrath of HR because she wasn\u2019t offended, although some male colleagues were horrified when she started stabbing the penis cake with a butcher\u2019s knife pretending it was her ex-partner\u2019s family jewels. When I was posted to the federal parliamentary press gallery in Canberra, I sought cake inspiration from Australian politics. I made a Julia Gillard versus Kevin Rudd cake for the February 2012 Labor leadership spill, which was riddled with wobbly writing and imperfections, but at the time I thought it was pretty good. A staple of being a press gallery reporter is being locked up for six hours once a year with embargoed copies of the treasurer\u2019s budget papers.

I felt rather anxious ahead of my first lock up and I needed a creative outlet to channel my nervous energy into, so I decided to make a special cake to share with my colleagues. The cake was shaped like a dollar sign and had black icing to signify the budget was allegedly \u201cback in the black\u201d. My self-taught cake decorating skills went up a whole new level when an office baking rival, who had done a fancy cupcake making course, gave me a 101 on using fondant icing. Fondant icing is basically like play dough for adults but it can be tricky to tame. Rolling out fondant icing to cover an entire cake is the equivalent of a weights session at the gym. In 2013 I made a budget cake in the shape of a piggy bank. It starts to get cold in Canberra after Anzac day, which is problematic because it made the pink fondant icing crack horribly.

A year later I made a unicorn shaped cake because then treasurer Scott Morrison had said he wasn\u2019t selling unicorns to the public.

      "bodyText": "Little or no flow in the Darling River and a plunge from high temperatures are likely to have led to conditions that caused a catastrophic drop in oxygen levels prior to extensive fish kills at Menindee. An interim investigation by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries found the fish deaths were likely to have been caused by \u201cseveral related and compounding factors resulting in low oxygen in the river\u201d. The report also confirmed the second incident on 6 January involved the \u201cunprecedented\u201d death of \u201chundreds of thousands of fish\u201d. The report blamed \u201cthermal stratification in which a a warmer surface layer of about one metre of water sat above a cooler deeper layer (2-3m) of water with very low dissolved oxygen\u201d. \u201cThese conditions were conducive to blue-green algal blooms in the surface layers,\u201d it said. In the first incident that killed \u201ctens of thousands of fish\u201d before Christmas, rain fell on 15 December 2018 and temperatures dropped, \u201cwhich appears to have mixed the water layers, which resulted in very low dissolved oxygen throughout the water column\u201d. \u201cAnother substantial drop in air temperatures from 46C to 28C on January 4 and 5 associated with cold fronts passing through the region again caused layers of water with different dissolved oxygen levels to mix, reducing the overall dissolved oxygen available,\u201d the report said. \u201cHigh algal content in stock and domestic flow releases drawn from Lake Pamamaroo, which increased oxygen demand and consumption, further reduced dissolved oxygen available to fish.\u201d But the report also noted that stratification and subsequent changes in temperature were not enough in themselves, as otherwise there would be regular fish kills in NSW dams, where the same phenomenon occurs. The species affected were predominantly bony herring, but also included hundreds of golden perch and silver perch, as well as dozens of Murray cod, mostly large adults. The largest was 127cm long. It said the preliminary study of the ear bones, known as otoliths, taken from larger Murray cod, golden Perch and silver perch, suggest the fish were between 17 and 25 years old. \u201cFurther research will examine where they were born,\u201d the report said. The deputy premier and minister for regional NSW, John Barilaro, said the fish kill was unprecedented and a major ecological disaster. \u201cWe know there is anger and frustration following this incident but we are working hard to support far-west communities with practical measures,\u201d Barilaro said. He pointed to the six aerators the government had installed to provide small fish refuges in the Darling, which are untested as a strategy to preserve fish in a river. He also announced that the NSW Cross Border Commissioner, James McTavish, would be immediately appointed as Regional Town Water Supply Co-ordinator, to oversee the work to ensure water supply and quality in towns and communities all over NSW. \u201cThis could include the provision of funding for water carting to towns at risk of low water supply, or the provision of bottled or chilled water to schools or health care facilities in these communities,\u201d Barilaro said. University of NSW professor of environmental science Richard Kingsford, an expert on the Menindee Lakes, said the report was \u201ca good report as far as it goes\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a good scientific assessment of the proximate causes,\u201d he said. But he said the references to other fish kills during the millennium drought in the report underplayed the seriousness of these incidents. The millennium incidents had been nowhere near the scale of the recent incidents \u2013 they had involved thousands of deaths not hundreds of thousands, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what was the condition of the river, not just in the short term but longer term. \u201cThere is an absence of good data on water quality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t identify the status of blue-green algae before or after the fish kill.\u201d The report also revealed that small numbers of carp also died, but the huge deaths of native fish meant that the non-native species, which are regarded as a pest, could well become more dominant after the incidents.

      "bodyText": "Jakarta\u2019s former governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, best known as \u201cAhok\u201d, has been released from prison after serving out his controversial two-year sentence for insulting Islam. The Indonesian politician was controversially jailed in May 2017 after a court found him guilty of blasphemy for a comment he made while campaigning for re-election. Last year a movie documenting his life, \u201cA Man Called Ahok\u201d was released in Indonesian cinemas, igniting rumours he plans to resume his political career upon his release. He walked free from the high-security Mako Brimob detention facility in Depok, West Java, early Thursday morning after receiving more than three months\u2019 in remissions. Ahok \u2013 who in a recent letter from prison asked his supporters to refer to him by his initials \u201cBTP\u201d rather than his Chinese nickname \u2013 was met by outside the prison by supporters clad in red, blue and white shirts, chanting \u201cBTP, BTP, BTP\u201d. The jailing of the former governor \u2013 who an anomaly in Indonesian politics as a minority Christian and Chinese \u2013 was widely condemned by rights groups, with critics saying the sentence was a blow to religious tolerance and free speech, while others suggested the Indonesian judiciary had succumbed to mob rule. Doctored footage of Ahok\u2019s comments \u2013 which made it appear he had directly insulted the Qur\u2019an rather than the conservative Islamic clerics citing it \u2013 spread quickly in 2017, sparking huge Islamist-inspired political protests that have had a lasting impact on the politics of the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation. The straight-talking politician did not appeal against his sentence, but strangely state prosecutors did \u2013 saying it was harsher than the sentence they had recommended. But in a recent letter posted on his official Instagram account, Ahok said he would serve his time all over again. \u201cIf we could go back in time and someone asked which would you choose [Going to prison or winning the election] I would say I choose to be imprisoned at Mako to study for two years, so that I could maintain self-discipline for the rest of my life,\u201d he wrote, \u201cIf I were re-elected, I would have become more arrogant, rough, and I would have hurt people.\u201d Ahok became Jakarta\u2019s governor in April 2014, inheriting it as then-deputy governor after Joko Widodo was elected president. He lost the gubernatorial race three years later. Figures close to Ahok say he has voiced support for the re-election of Widodo in the upcoming April vote, even though the incumbent\u2019s running mate Ma\u2019ruf Amin, an elderly Islamic cleric, testified against him in the 2017 blasphemy trial. To his fans Ahok was a politician who worked hard to improve the capital, tackling corruption, revamping public space, and reducing chronic floods and traffic, but his policy of forced evictions also angered many. Often considered abrasive, in an interview with the Guardian he once jokingly referred to himself as the \u201cGodfather of Jakarta\u201d. During his time in prison Ahok has kept a low profile.",

      "bodyText": "On her first visit to Australia, tennis super-fan and editor-in-chief of US Vogue, Anna Wintour, didn\u2019t pull any punches when assessing the country\u2019s political scene. Wintour, the keynote speaker at a business lunch organised by the Australian Open, told an audience that included Liberal MP Julie Bishop: \u201cI have been alarmed by your prime minister\u2019s record on LGBTQ rights, which seems backward in all senses.\u201d Referring to government proposals (later abandoned) to allow schools to discriminate against LGBTQI students, Wintour said: \u201cThat no one can be expelled from school for their orientation should not require clarification. A government should protect its people, not make it unclear whether they will be accepted.\u201d Wintour \u2013 who delivered the speech with a bare face (her trademark sunglasses only worn later when posing for photos with guests) \u2013 also directly attacked former Australian tennis champion Margaret Court for her stance on same-sex marriage. \u201cI find that it is inconsistent with the sport for Margaret Court\u2019s name to be on a stadium that does so much to bring all people together across their differences,\u201d she said. Wintour called Court, now a religious minister, \u201ca champion on the court\u201d but said that tennis should be a \u201cmeeting point of players of all nations, preferences and backgrounds [and] should celebrate somebody who was a champion off the court as well\u201d. Wintour also said she found it inspiring to see some Australians wearing \u201cribbons in support of refugees\u201d. Wintour did not address Australia\u2019s widely condemned treatment of asylum seekers who arrive by boat. Wintour was speaking in Melbourne where she is attending the Australian Open tennis tournament. \u201cI have never felt so welcomed anywhere in my life. It is \u2018no problem\u2019, everyone keeps saying, \u2018no problem at all\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cComing from New York, where everybody talks of problems all the time, and subsists on problems as they do on coffee and noise ... I find this smooth sailing quite disconcerting.\u201d Wintour was joined on stage by her New York neighbour, Baz Luhrmann, who introduced tribute videos to the Vogue editor from tennis greats, Roger Federer and Serena Williams. Wintour confessed she missed \u201cmany\u201d fashion shows to attend tennis matches and said that a highlight of her life was when her daughter arranged for Federer to play tennis with her and her family, as a surprise.",

Meanwhile, in Western Australia, the ABC has reported that as many as 2,500 camels have been shot in the Goldfields region, as they come in from the Gibson desert to congregate around water sources on remote stations. The Central Land Council is consulting a remote community about carrying out an emergency cull of 120 horses, goats and donkeys in central Australia because the animals are in such poor health they cannot be mustered or transported. It follows the publication of shocking images that showed 40 dead horses at the dried up Apwerte Uyerreme waterhole. More than 50 more horses found at the same site had to be killed via an aerial cull last Friday. Prolonged temperatures above 42C have left the council and its residents concerned about the health of native and feral animals. \u201cHorses and other feral animals are dying of thirst and hunger because many reliable water sources, such as Apwerte Uyerreme, have dried up in the current heatwave and areas overpopulated by feral animals suffer erosion and vegetation loss,\u201d the council said on Thursday. \u201cAs horse carcasses foul water holes that native animals depend on, these too die.\u201d The council was alerted to the latest case of animal suffering in the heat on Monday and is working with traditional owners to obtain permission for an emergency cull. About 120 animals are watering at a trough near the community, which has not yet been named while the talks are ongoing.

The cases in central Australia are just two that have emerged showing the impact the extreme heat is having on large feral animals.

Feral camels are a significant problem in the Goldfields and have been known to destroy windmills in search of water. According to GNRBA\u2019s large feral herbivore management plan, which covers feral horses, donkeys and camels, more than 25,000 feral camels were culled from unallocated crown land between 2011 and 2013.

It is unprecedented.\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>\u201cDue to the shutdown, air traffic controllers, transportation security officers, safety inspectors, air marshals, federal law enforcement officers, FBI agents, and many other critical workers have been working without pay for over a month. Staffing in our air traffic control facilities is already at a 30-year low and controllers are only able to maintain the system\u2019s efficiency and capacity by working overtime, including 10-hour days and 6-day workweeks at many of our nation\u2019s busiest facilities. Due to the shutdown, the FAA has frozen hiring and shuttered its training academy, so there is no plan in effect to fill the FAA\u2019s critical staffing need. Even if the FAA were hiring, it takes two to four years to become fully facility certified and achieve Certified Professional Controller (CPC) status. Almost 20% of CPCs are eligible to retire today. There are no options to keep these professionals at work without a paycheck when they can no longer afford to support their families. When they elect to retire, the National Airspace System (NAS) will be crippled.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cThe situation is changing at a rapid pace. Major airports are already seeing security checkpoint closures, with many more potentially to follow. Safety inspectors and federal cyber security staff are not back on the job at pre-shutdown levels, and those not on furlough are working without pay. Last Saturday, TSA management announced that a growing number of officers cannot come to work due to the financial toll of the shutdown. In addition, we are not confident that system-wide analyses of safety reporting data, which is used to identify and implement corrective actions in order to reduce risks and prevent accidents is 100 percent operational due to reduced FAA resources.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cAs union leaders, we find it unconscionable that aviation professionals are being asked to work without pay and in an air safety environment that is deteriorating by the day. To avoid disruption to our aviation system, we urge Congress and the White House to take all necessary steps to end this shutdown immediately. \u201c</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c491cbce4b0a585f6e853c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-24T02:09:24.125Z\">2.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-24/republican-senator-joni-ernst-says-she-was-raped-in-college\">told Bloomberg</a> on Wednesday that she had been raped in college.</p> <p>The Iowa lawmaker came forward with her story after details from affidavits she and ex-husband Gail Ernst filed in their divorce were inadvertently made public this week, and allegations that her ex-husband had physically abused her came out.</p> <p> \u201cI didn\u2019t want to share it with anybody, and in the era of hashtag-MeToo survivors, I always believed that every person is different and they will confront their demons when they\u2019re ready,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cAnd I was not ready.\u201d</p> <p>Ernst is a high-ranking member of her party, and she had been on a shortlist to be President Trump\u2019s vice president.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, everyone. Thanks for tuning in on yet another eventful day. A quick recap of recent developments: The Venezuela saga continues, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinting that the US would not be recalling its diplomats within the next 72 hours, as Nicolas Maduro demanded after the Trump administration recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s interim president. With the government shutdown is in its 33rd day, and no end in sight, 12 protesters were arrested outside of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office. The protesters, many of whom were federal union leaders, were chanting, \u201cWe want to work!\u201d Meanwhile, union leaders for air traffic controllers, pilots, and flight attendants issued a statement expressing concern over safety during the shutdown, saying that with so many of their federal worker counterparts unsure of when they could return to work, they could not \u201ceven calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break.\u201d Lara Trump urged federal workers working without pay to \u201cstay strong\u201d through this \u201clittle bit of pain.\u201d House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters are planning a joint investigation into Deutsche Bank, which is under scrutiny for its business dealings with President Trump. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst told Bloomberg that she was both a rape and domestic abuse survivor. Air traffic controllers, pilots, and flight attendant are \u201chave a growing concern for the safety and security of our members, our airlines, and the traveling public due to the government shutdown.\u201d Late on Day 33 of the longest government shutdown in the country\u2019s history, the presidents of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the Air Line Pilots Association, and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA issued a statement that \u201cin our risk averse industry, we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. It is unprecedented.\u201d \u201cDue to the shutdown, air traffic controllers, transportation security officers, safety inspectors, air marshals, federal law enforcement officers, FBI agents, and many other critical workers have been working without pay for over a month. Staffing in our air traffic control facilities is already at a 30-year low and controllers are only able to maintain the system\u2019s efficiency and capacity by working overtime, including 10-hour days and 6-day workweeks at many of our nation\u2019s busiest facilities. Due to the shutdown, the FAA has frozen hiring and shuttered its training academy, so there is no plan in effect to fill the FAA\u2019s critical staffing need. Even if the FAA were hiring, it takes two to four years to become fully facility certified and achieve Certified Professional Controller (CPC) status. Almost 20% of CPCs are eligible to retire today. There are no options to keep these professionals at work without a paycheck when they can no longer afford to support their families. When they elect to retire, the National Airspace System (NAS) will be crippled. \u201cThe situation is changing at a rapid pace. Major airports are already seeing security checkpoint closures, with many more potentially to follow. Safety inspectors and federal cyber security staff are not back on the job at pre-shutdown levels, and those not on furlough are working without pay. Last Saturday, TSA management announced that a growing number of officers cannot come to work due to the financial toll of the shutdown. In addition, we are not confident that system-wide analyses of safety reporting data, which is used to identify and implement corrective actions in order to reduce risks and prevent accidents is 100 percent operational due to reduced FAA resources. \u201cAs union leaders, we find it unconscionable that aviation professionals are being asked to work without pay and in an air safety environment that is deteriorating by the day. To avoid disruption to our aviation system, we urge Congress and the White House to take all necessary steps to end this shutdown immediately. \u201c Republican Senator Joni Ernst told Bloomberg on Wednesday that she had been raped in college. The Iowa lawmaker came forward with her story after details from affidavits she and ex-husband Gail Ernst filed in their divorce were inadvertently made public this week, and allegations that her ex-husband had physically abused her came out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to share it with anybody, and in the era of hashtag-MeToo survivors, I always believed that every person is different and they will confront their demons when they\u2019re ready,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cAnd I was not ready.\u201d Ernst is a high-ranking member of her party, and she had been on a shortlist to be President Trump\u2019s vice president. But with everything happening with her family, she later called Trump to withdraw from consideration. She is planning on seeking reelection in 2020. \u201cPeople know my situation now,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I can do is be honest about what happened. And I can move forward.\u201d In the latest twist in the Venezuela saga, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to imply that the US would not be recalling its diplomats within the next 72 hours. Pompeo issued a statement Wednesday evening that \u201cthe United States does not consider former president Nicolas Madura to have the legal authority to break diplomatic relations with the United States or to declare our diplomats persona non grata.\u201d \u201cWe call on the Venezuelan military and security forces to continue protecting the welfare and well-being of all Venezuelan citizens, as well as US and other foreign citizens in Venezuela,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe call on all parties to refrain from measures that are inconsistent with the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the diplomatic community. The United States will take appropriate actions to hold accountable anyone who endangers the safety and security of our mission and its personnel. In a message to federal employees in the midst of the longest government shutdown in the country\u2019s history, Lara Trump, President Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law and campaign adviser, described not being able to earn a paycheck for 33 days as \u201ca little bit of pain.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be for the future of our country,\u201d she said. She urged federal workers \u201cto please stay strong.\u201d Trump spoke to BOLD TV about the shutdown, putting the blame squarely on the Democrats who \u201ckeep playing politics.\u201d Her father-in-law is fighting for \u201cwhat he knows is the right thing to do,\u201d she said. Toward the end of the 4-minute clip, BOLD founder Carrie Sheffield asked Trump, \u201cIn terms of the workers who are coming to work and not getting paid, what would you say to them?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to you, and we all get that, but this is so much bigger than any one person,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is a little bit of pain, but it\u2019s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now. I know it\u2019s hard. I know people have families, they have bills to pay, they have mortgages, they have rents that are due. But the president is trying every single day to come up with a good solution here and, the reality is, it\u2019s been something that\u2019s gone on for too long and been unaddressed: our immigration problem.\u201d On Day 33 of the shutdown, 12 protesters, some with a federal workers union, were arrested outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office. All 12 were booked on suspicion of crowding, obstructing, or incommoding outside of room 317 in the Russell Senate Office Building, according to the US Capitol Police. Activist Kristin Mink tweeted that the protesters were federal union leaders who were chanting \u201cWe want to work!\u201d and \u201cstop the shutdown!\u201d House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters are planning a joint investigation into Deutsche Bank, Politico reports. The bank is under scrutiny for not just its possible role in money laundering schemes, but for its business dealings with President Trump. According to Politico\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt: The investigation into Deutsche Bank will be one of the most closely watched probes launched by the new Democratic-controlled Congress because it could provide a glimpse into Trump\u2019s finances and his ties abroad. Waters, who has called for the president\u2019s impeachment, has vowed to follow the \u201cTrump money trail\u201d starting with Deutsche Bank. Before she became chairwoman, she asked the bank for details on its handling of Trump\u2019s accounts and involvement in Russian money laundering schemes. The bank declined her request, citing privacy issues for its customers. She now has subpoena power to get some answers. After the Trump administration recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s interim president, Nicolas Maduro ordered all US diplomats to leave the country within 72 hours. This is Vivian Ho with the west coast bureau, taking over for Sabrina Siddiqui. Buckle up, kids. It\u2019s been an interesting day. Alright folks, I\u2019m handing over the keys of the blog to my colleague Vivian Ho on the West Coast. She\u2019ll take you through the latest developments throughout the evening. To recap yet another wild day so far: Nancy Pelosi told Donald Trump he can no longer hold his State of the Union address inside the House chamber, leaving the president in search of an alternative venue Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former attorney, delayed his planned testimony before Congress due to \u2018threats\u2019 from Trump and his legal team The Trump administration has recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s interim president, prompting Nicolas Maduro to cut off all diplomatic relations with the US The government shutdown is in its 33rd day, with no end in sight Stay tuned for more! The attorneys for former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, are pushing back once again on allegations by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office that he lied to federal investigators in a violation of his plea deal. In a heavily redacted court filing filed on Wednesday, Manafort\u2019s legal team argued that his answers simply amounted to \u201ca lack of consistency\u201d. \u201cMany of these events occurred years ago, or during a high-pressure U.S. presidential campaign he managed when his time was extraordinarily limited,\u201d Manafort\u2019s defense counsel wrote, \u201cor during the difficult time that followed his departure from the 2016 presidential campaign because of the allegations leveled at him and the investigations that followed\u201d. They further added that Mueller had not provided evidence to \u201cdemonstrate any intentional falsehoods\u201d. Mueller\u2019s team detailed Manafort\u2019s alleged lies, with what they said was corresponding evidence, in a filing of their own last week. Among the most damning revelations to come from the back-and-forth between Manafort\u2019s legal team and the special counsel: that Manafort allegedly shared internal campaign polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, a business associate of his with known ties to Russian intelligence. Prosecutors allege that Manafort breached a plea agreement, struck with them in November, by lying to investigators during the course of 12 interviews. If convicted on the charge, Manafort could substantial jail time. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has blocked a bill to reopen the government ... again. For those keeping track, this is the fourth time the Kentucky Republican has refused efforts by Democrats to advance a \u2018clean\u2019 government funding bill. Democrats in the House have passed a series of bills that would reopen the government one department at a time -- none of which include any money for a border wall. McConnell has backed Donald Trump\u2019s position on the shutdown, which requires that any measure to end the shutdown include $5.7bn for a border wall. Read more in The Hill on McConnell\u2019s tactics, which have prompted protests outside his office. Donald Trump is now looking for an \u2018alternative\u2019 location from which to deliver the State of the Union, after his attempt to press on with holding the event inside the House chamber was rebuffed by Nancy Pelosi. The president is still intent on giving the speech, with some Republicans suggesting he look at the Senate chamber -- where the GOP still holds control -- as an option. Trump could also opt for another Oval Office address. Perhaps it will be the first State of the Union delivered via tweets! Certainly a Twitter thread for the ages... What appears less likely is Trump submitting his address in writing, as Pelosi suggested he do. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, he really likes the sound of his own voice. Believe it or not, Donald Trump is running out of insults. The president told reporters his State of the Union has been cancelled by Nancy Pelosi \u201cbecause she doesn\u2019t want to hear the truth\u201d. This comes shortly after Trump said his former attorney, Michael Cohen, delayed his testimony before Congress because he was \u201cthreatened of the truth\u201d. Given the polls and the latest developments in the Russia investigation, one could argue it\u2019s Trump who ought to be afraid of the truth. In any case, here\u2019s what else he had to say about Pelosi: \u201cShe\u2019s afraid of the super-left Democrats, the radical Democrats. What\u2019s going on in that party is shocking.\u201d \u201cNow Nancy Pelosi, or Nancy as I call her, she doesn\u2019t want to know the truth... I think that\u2019s a great blotch on the great country we all love.\u201d Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Wednesday he was cutting off diplomatic relations with the United States, after the Trump administration recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American country\u2019s interim president. Maduro ordered all US diplomats to leave the country within 72 hours, according to our latest report: \u201cWe are defending the right to the very existence of our Bolivarian republic,\u201d Maduro told supporters at a rally outside the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas. He urged them to resist \u201cat all costs\u201d what he called a coup attempt being orchestrated by \u201cthe coup-mongering, interventionist gringo empire\u201d and the \u201cfascist right\u201d. \u201cThey intend to govern Venezuela from Washington,\u201d Maduro shouted from the palace\u2019s people\u2019s balcony. \u201cDo you want a puppet government controlled by Washington?\u201d Hours after Michael Cohen delayed his testimony before Congress, citing Donald Trump\u2019s threats against him and his family, the president responded by stating: \u201cHe\u2019s only been threatened by the truth.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s always been threatened by the truth and he doesn\u2019t want to do that probably for me or other of his clients,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cHe has other clients also, I assume, and he doesn\u2019t want to tell the truth for me or other of his clients.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came as Cohen, his former personal attorney, canceled plans to appear before the House oversight and reform committee on 7 February. An attorney for Cohen said the decision was made following \u201congoing threats against his family\u201d by Trump and the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Top Democrats condemned what they said were \u201ccompletely legitimate concerns\u201d for the safety of Cohen and his family. \u201cEfforts to intimidate witnesses, scare their family members, or prevent them from testifying before Congress are textbook mob tactics that we condemn in the strongest terms,\u201d Elijah Cummings, the House oversight committee chairman, and Adam Schiff, the intelligence committee chief, said in a joint statement. \u201cOur nation\u2019s laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate, or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress,\u201d they added. \u201cThe President should make no statement or take any action to obstruct Congress\u2019 independent oversight and investigative efforts, including by seeking to discourage any witness from testifying in response to a duly authorized request from Congress.\u201d The Democratic chairmen nonetheless said it was \u201cnever an option\u201d for Cohen not to appear before Congress. While they stopped short of subpoenaing his testimony, Cummings and Schiff said they expected Cohen to appear before both of their committees and would remain engaged in discussions with his legal counsel. Shortly after Trump insisted he would deliver his State of the Union address next Tuesday from the US Capitol, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi formally told the president she would bar him from giving the speech inside the House chamber during the government shutdown. \u201cI am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President\u2019s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter to Trump. \u201cI look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech had been planned for 29 January. But citing security concerns amid the shutdown, Pelosi urged the president last week to postpone the event. She said Trump could otherwise deliver his speech in writing. Trump responded by canceling a congressional delegation, led by Pelosi, to Afghanistan, marking a dramatic escalation of the standoff between the two sides as the shutdown surpassed one month. The president told reporters he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by Pelosi\u2019s decision not to authorize his State of the Union address during the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame what\u2019s happening with the Democrats. They\u2019ve become radicalized,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see crime stopped, which we could very easily do on the southern border. He added of the shutdown: \u201cThis will go on for a while.\u201d The US Senate has adjourned for the day, meaning no further action is expected until Thursday when the chamber votes on two competing measures to reopen the government. To recap, Mitch McConnell scheduled a vote on two bills: One is the deal put forward by Donald Trump on Saturday, in which the president offered a temporary extension of protections for young, undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, in exchange for $5.7bn in funding for the wall. The bill would also enable immigrants from certain vulnerable countries to stay in the US, after Trump revoked their status. The second measure, backed by Democrats, would reopen the government with no strings attached. It would largely fund the departments and agencies at current levels and would not include money for the border wall. Both are expected to fall along partisan lines and ultimately fail. Cohen cited threats from Donald Trump in his decision to postpone his testimony. Democrats recently warned the president he should not intimidate witnesses after Trump repeatedly suggested Cohen\u2019s father-in-law and family should be investigated. In a Fox News interview Trump said Cohen \u201cshould give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that\u2019s the one that people want to look at\u201d, and has tweeted similar remarks. Michael Cohen has said he will not testify before Congress on 7 February due to \u201cthreats\u201d from the president. In a statement released on Wednesday Lanny Davis, Cohen\u2019s attorney, said Cohen would be willing to appear before the House Oversight Committee in the future but would not appear as planned. \u201cDue to ongoing threats against his family from President Trump and Mr Giuliani, as recently as this weekend, as well as Mr Cohen\u2019s continued cooperation with ongoing investigations, by advice of counsel, Mr Cohen\u2019s appearance will be postponed to a later date,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThis is a time where Mr Cohen had to put his family and their safety first.\u201d The White House has said it will recognize Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as president of the country, after Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim leader in a bid to force President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power. From the Guardian\u2019s Joe Parkin Daniels and Mariana Z\u00fa\u00f1iga: Before thousands of protesters in the capital Caracas, [Guaid\u00f3] raised his right hand and said he was \u201cformally assuming the responsibility of the national executive\u201d. Guaid\u00f3, the head of the opposition-run congress, has said he would be willing to assume the presidency on an interim basis with the support of the armed forces to call elections. The move was immediately welcomed by Donald Trump who called on other countries in the western hemisphere governments to recognize Guaid\u00f3 as the interim president of Venezuela. \u201cIn its role as the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people, the National Assembly invoked the country\u2019s constitution to declare Nicolas Maduro illegitimate, and the office of the presidency therefore vacant. The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law,\u201d Trump said in a statement. The move comes as tens of thousands joined marches across the country\u2019s capital in what opponents of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro hope will prove a turning point for the country\u2019s slide into authoritarianism and economic ruin. Donald Trump is insisting he will deliver his State the Union address at the House of Representatives on January 29, despite Nancy Pelosi asking the president to postpone the speech. In a letter Trump said he has been told by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service \u201cthere would be absolutely no problem regarding security\u201d should he deliver the address. Pelosi had asked Trump to delay the speech, or deliver it in writing, due to concerns the DHS and secret service would be unable to provide adequate security. The House speaker said both agencies had been \u201chamstrung\u201d by the government shutdown. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders posted Trump\u2019s letter to her Twitter account. \u201cIt would be so very sad for our country if the state of the union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!\u201d Democrats on the House oversight committee have launched an investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s use of security clearances, citing \u2018grave breaches\u2019 in the process that awards access to some of the nation\u2019s most closely guarded secrets. Elijah Cummings, the oversight committee chairman, announced the inquiry on Wednesday and penned a letter to the White House requesting a wide range of documents: The goals of this investigation are to determine why the White House and Transition Team appear to have disregarded established procedures for safeguarding classified information, evaluate the extent to which the nation\u2019s most highly guarded secrets were provided to officials who should not have had access to them, and develop reforms to remedy the flaws in current White House systems and practices. Questions over security clearances have long plagued the Trump White House: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn maintained a security clearance even after lying to the FBI about his secret conversations with the Russian ambassador to the US. Trump\u2019s former secretary Rob Porter operated on an interim security clearance despite allegations of spousal abuse. And the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was forced to revise his form three times after omitting 100 foreign contacts while applying for top-level security clearance. And that\u2019s just to name a few of the hiccups along the way. Cummings has also requested documents pertaining to former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s own internal review of the security clearance process in 2018, which according to his statement \u201cfound that 34 White House officials who had started working on the first day of the Trump administration were still working with interim security clearances as of November 2017 and that more than 130 political appointees in the Executive Office of the President were working with interim security clearances as of that date\u201d. House Democrats are preparing a counteroffer to Donald Trump\u2019s plan to end the government shutdown, according to Politico. In a bid to renew negotiations, Democrats are drafting a proposal that would reopen the Department of Homeland Security and boost border security funding. But it would not include any money for a wall along the US-Mexico border, which Trump has insisted on throughout the 33-day shutdown. The bill will likely include funding to improve technology and increase staff at certain ports of entry, with an aim to reduce the flow of illegal drugs. While the proposal is unlikely to garner support from Trump and Republicans, House Democrats said they see it as a starting point for fresh negotiations. Joe Biden was paid six figures for a speech before a conservative-leaning audience in Michigan just three weeks before the 2018 November midterm elections, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. In his remarks, the former vice president also praised a Republican congressman who went on to defeat his Democratic challenger on 6 November. The event, hosted by the Economic Club of Southwestern Michigan, saw Biden praise incumbent Republican Fred Upton as \u201cone of the finest guys I\u2019ve ever worked with\u201d. The business-centric group that hosted Biden paid him $200,000 for his appearance, including a $150,000 speaking fee and a $50,000 travel allowance. It is supported in part by an Upton family foundation. Biden is widely expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president. Biden\u2019s appearance -- casting a vulnerable Republican in a positive light ahead of the crucial midterms -- could pose challenges as he vies for approval from a more progressive Democratic base. Biden has cut a more centrist figure since leaving the office of the vice president, even as he has lobbed sharp criticisms at Donald Trump. A spokesperson for Biden said his speech was not intended as an endorsement of Upton, and stemmed instead from the congressman\u2019s role in crafting a bipartisan bill aimed at accelerating cancer research. Biden\u2019s son, Beau, died of cancer in 2015. \u201cIt was one of the few bipartisan bills passed in an otherwise deeply divided and gridlocked Congress,\u201d Biden\u2019s spokesman, Bill Russo, said in response to the NYT report. \u201cVice President Biden believes to his core that you can disagree politically on a lot and still work together in good faith on issues of common cause \u2014 like funding cancer research.\u201d Hundreds of employees at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have been granted permission to skip work, citing the financial burden of the ongoing government shutdown. As the annual US tax season gets underway, the Washington Post is reporting that IRS employees across the US are expected to be absent in what is partially a coordinated protest of the shutdown and otherwise out of \u2018financial necessity\u2019. The move comes after the Trump administration ordered IRS employees to return to return to their offices, where they had been working without pay since the partial closure of the federal government on 22 December. IRS union leaders are now warning that the absence of IRS workers could cause a delay in the processing of tax refunds, dramatically raising the stakes for the shutdown\u2019s impact on the American public. \u201cFederal employees are about to miss their second paycheck and they are growing increasingly desperate,\u201d National Treasury Employees Union President Tony Reardon said in a statement. \u201cThe suffering of thousands of middle-class working families has to end, and it has to end now.\u201d House Republicans have postponed their annual retreat due to the ongoing government shutdown. The House GOP was due to convene in West Virginia to discuss policy and strategy behind closed doors. We know this is the event you were most looking forward to, but we will surely find the strength to prevail. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is launching a legal challenge against the Trump administration in an attempt to force US prosecutors to \u201cunseal\u201d any secret charges against him. The Guardian\u2019s Owen Bowcott reports: \u201cThe legal move is an attempt to prevent Assange\u2019s extradition to the US at a time that a new Ecuadorian government has been making his stay in the central London apartment increasingly inhospitable. He has been staying in the Knightsbridge flat, which houses the embassy, since 2012 when he fled extradition proceedings at the UK\u2019s supreme court. Swedish prosecutors have since dropped their request to extradite him to Stockholm over a rape investigation. If he were to walk out on to the street, Assange is likely to face contempt of court charges for fleeing British justice. His chief fear, however, is that once arrested, the US authorities would begin fresh extradition proceedings against him alleging security offences.\u201d Assange has been residing in London\u2019s Ecuador\u2019s embassy since seeking asylum in 2012, after he came under investigation by the US government for publishing classified diplomatic cables and other secret government records. A November court filing by US prosecutors, which appeared to be submitted in error, indicated that Assange had been criminally charged by the justice department. Assange has also come under intense scrutiny for the role WikiLeaks played in publishing thousands of emails in the 2016 election that were stolen by Russian hackers from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The 2020 Democratic primary field continues to grow as Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, announced on Wednesday he will form an exploratory committee for president. Buttigieg is the seventh Democrat to throw his hat into the race to defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Although not yet known on the national level, Buttigieg has been viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party and fittingly framed his candidacy in a video announcement as ushering in a \u201cnew generation\u201d of leadership and a \u201cfresh start\u201d. \u201cThe reality is there\u2019s no going back, and there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018again\u2019 in the real world,\u201d Buttigieg says in the video. \u201cWe can\u2019t look for greatness in the past.\u201d Buttigieg was elected mayor of South Bend in 2011 at age 29, becoming the youngest mayor of a US city with at least 100,000 residents. While running for a second term, Buttigieg came out as gay and was re-elected with 80% of the vote. If successful, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major political party in the US. Following the 2016 presidential race, Buttigieg ran unsuccessfully for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee. Buttigieg previously served as a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve and is a veteran of the Afghanistan war. He joins what is expected to be a crowded and diverse Democratic field, which already includes the likes of Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, and former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro. A record number of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump\u2019s job performance amid the longest government shutdown in US history. A new poll released Wednesday by Morning Consult/Politico found that 57% of registered US voters disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency. The number is the highest disapproval rating for Trump since he took office two years ago. The survey was conducted from January 18-22, as the partial shutdown of the US government hit the one-month mark. The previous two lows for Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the poll, came during the first weekend of the shutdown, which began on 22 December, and over his response to the August 2017 violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump still has the backing of 81% of Republicans but is losing ground with the independent voters who were key to his victory in 2016, with 60% of independents now registering their disapproval of the president. Trump has insisted the American public supports his stance on the shutdown, which has left roughly 800,000 federal workers without pay. Despite several polls showing otherwise, the president has refused to back down from his demand that a bill to reopen the government including funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border. But another new survey spells more doom for Trump, showing seven in 10 Americans do not believe the issue of a border wall is worth a government shutdown. The CBS News poll found Trump\u2019s overall approval rating at just 36%, with 59% of Americans disapproving of his job performance. Tough crowd. Good morning! Sabrina Siddiqui here running the live blog today, as the US government shutdown enters its 33rd day. No signs of a breakthrough as Donald Trump hosts a series of private conversations on immigration at the White House, with the proposal he put forward to end the shutdown that has already been rejected by Democrats. The Republican-led US Senate is meanwhile debating Trump\u2019s offer and a counter-proposal by Democrats, both of which are expected to be voted down on Thursday. In other words, it\u2019s another day of dysfunction in Trump\u2019s Washington and we\u2019ll be giving you all the latest updates here. Watch this space.",

      "bodyText": "Everyone on the beach at Yarra Bay \u2013 from the adults under their umbrellas to the kids in the water watching the cargo ships \u2013 has a different reason why it should be saved. And if the current voting patterns hold, the little-known inlet on the north side of Sydney\u2019s Botany Bay will be crowned one of Australia\u2019s best beaches. Down past La Perouse, Yarra Bay is a place that not many people realise is even a beach. The name sounds more like Melbourne than Sydney. It\u2019s next to the busiest commercial port in the country. You can see a container terminal from the sand. But since last Wednesday, Yarra Bay has been topping the charts of Guardian Australia\u2019s best beaches poll. It is poised to win best metropolitan beach in New South Wales, beating Bondi and taking Coogee to the cleaners. It\u2019s all thanks to a grassroots campaign, Save Yarra Bay, that is trying to stop the beach being turned into a cruise ship terminal. In July last year, the state government chose Yarra Bay as a leading candidate to ease the pressure of the mega-ships in Sydney Harbour. \u201cIt\u2019s so secret, it\u2019s not even on those lists of secret beaches,\u201d says a local resident, Christine Kitamura. Now it has the highest number of write-in votes in any category. Down by the water, it becomes obvious why this beach is so fiercely loved and defended. It\u2019s the kind of place that should have a complex German word for how surprisingly beautiful it is. The water is an impossible, incredible blue. They filmed the last scene of Rake here (\u201cone of those days where the water is azure\u201d). The sea is still and calm and kids love it. The cooling towers and the container terminal are there. But there\u2019s something endearing about it. Like if Blade Runner was a beach. \u201cIt\u2019s very Jeffrey Smart isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Kitamura. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice it after a while.\u201d Yarra Bay has a strong Indigenous history. Some families around La Perouse have had, and continue to have, an uninterrupted connection to the land for thousands of years. The sea is home to 17 protected marine species; a colony of seals lives on the point. It\u2019s near where Captain Cook arrived in 1770, and closer still to the point where La Perouse, the eponymous French explorer, landed in 1788 and set sail a few days later, never to be seen again. In that vein, Yarra Bay today is still a place for people to access the beach who usually don\u2019t. \u201cI always say this is where the east and the west meet,\u201d says Maria Poulos, a leader of the Save the Bay campaign. \u201cPeople come in from the western suburbs, coming in from the M5. Basically it became a safe place for them after the Cronulla riots. After that, a lot of people started coming here.\u201d Trevor Walker, a local Indigenous leader, says the beach is a place that sustains his culture and the practices of his parents and grandparents. \u201cI grew up on the beach at La Perouse,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother was living at La Perouse, my father came down from the north coast and met her, and we\u2019ve been here ever since. \u201cThe water was a lot cleaner before the port was put up. We used to eat out of the ocean several times a week. If it wasn\u2019t mussels, it was crabs, oysters off the rock. Bimbalas \u2013 the blood cockles \u2013 that you can\u2019t find any more.\u201d Walker now organises cultural fishing events at Yarra Bay, catching mullet in big nets, giving the fish to children and the community, passing on knowledge to future generations. \u201cWe were practising our culture, learning about the water,\u201d he says. \u201cKids still do it these days. Usually around October, the blue swimmer crab season starts and you\u2019ll see kids out there looking for them.\u201d Out on the beach, Elfa, 53, sits under an umbrella. Her husband Bill, 62, comes out of the sea. Maria Maria by Santana starts playing from the speakers of the teenagers nearby. They came here once years ago and stopped going to any other beach. \u201cWe travel here all the way from the [western suburbs],\u201d says Elfa. \u201cWe are not locals.

Bahrain has until 8 February to submit the required documentation and then it is expected a court date will be set.</p> <p>While the Interpol red notice from Bahrain was issued on the basis of a conviction for Al-Araibi in 2014 for vandalising a police station, charges he vehemently denies and stresses were politically motivated, the footballer is adamant that Bahrain\u2019s determination to bring him back are in fact connected to public comments he made in Australia about his torture when he was in prison in Bahrain for three months in 2012.</p> <p>Speaking to international media in 2016, Al-Araibi accused one of Bahrain\u2019s most powerful figures, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa \u2013 a member of Bahrain\u2019s ruling royal family and president of Asia\u2019s governing body for football, who at the time was in the running for Fifa president \u2013 of discriminating against Shia Muslims (Al-Araibi is Shia while the ruling royal family is Sunni, divides that are starkly felt in Bahrain) and using his power to punish pro-democracy athletes who had protested against the royal family during the Arab spring in 2011.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd30553a84265f06453712a4e472cb0155cd376c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd30553a84265f06453712a4e472cb0155cd376c/0_64_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hakeem Al-Araibi (right) with Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, the president of the Asian Football Confederation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A file shot of Hakeem Al-Araibi (right) with Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, the president of the Asian Football Confederation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is nothing to do with my conviction; Bahrain wants me back to punish me because I talked to the media in 2016 about the terrible human rights and about how Sheikh Salman is a very bad man who discriminates against Shia Muslims,\u201d said Al-Araibi.</p> <p>\u201cI am so scared of being sent back to Bahrain, so scared because 100% they will arrest me, they will torture me again, possibly they will kill me.\u201d He confirmed Bahrain had made no attempt to contact him since his arrest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For two days they blindfolded me and beat me in the face and legs, telling me I would never play football again</p> <footer> <cite>Hakeem al-Araibi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Al-Araibi\u2019s fear of torture if he is deported back to Bahrain comes from a place of harrowing experience. In 2012, while he was a player for the Al Shabab football team, he was suddenly arrested on the street and taken to jail on the accusation he and his brother had vandalised a police station. The charges, he says, were \u201centirely false\u201d \u2013 he had in fact been playing league football on TV when the alleged attack happened. But he believes he was targeted due to the support his brother had given pro-democracy Arab spring protests the year before, and the fact he is a Shia Muslim.</p> <p>\u201cIt was hell for me,\u201d he said, describing prison. \u201cFor the first two days they blindfolded me and beat me in the face and legs, telling me I would never play football again. Five hours\u2019 straight many police beat me. They poured cold water over my face and back. They were not even trying to get a confession out of me and whenever I asked them: \u2018What did I do?\u2019 they would just scream \u2018shut up\u2019 and beat me more.\u201d</p> <p>After three months in jail, Al-Araibi was released on bail and was certain the case against him was so flimsy it would be dismissed. But in 2014, while playing an away game in Qatar with the Bahrain national team, he got a phone call. He, his brother and an accomplice had been found guilty of the vandalism and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His brother is currently serving the jail term in Bahrain.</p> <p>\u201cI knew I could not go back to Bahrain,\u201d Al-Araibi said.

      "bodyText": "Hakeem al-Araibi, the refugee footballer from Bahrain who was detained in Thailand while on his honeymoon, has said he is \u201closing hope\u201d and believes he will be tortured again or even killed if he is deported to Bahrain. Speaking to the Guardian from Bangkok Remand Prison, a visibly distressed Al-Araibi said he was \u201cterrified \u201d and that his fear was \u201cgetting worse every day\u201d. Al-Araibi was given asylum in Australia in 2017 after fleeing his home country where he was persecuted for his beliefs, tortured in prison and convicted on a trumped-up vandalism charge. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything in Bahrain, I didn\u2019t do anything in Thailand, I didn\u2019t do anything in Australia,\u201d said Al-Araibi. \u201cHow can they keep me locked up like this? Please help me, please. In Bahrain there are no human rights and no safety for people like me.\u201d In late November, Al-Araibi, 25, who has lived in Australia for five years, found himself at the centre of a nightmare ordeal when he and his wife arrived in Thailand for their week-long honeymoon. Prior to leaving Australia, he had called up the immigration authorities to check he was safe to travel and had been given multiple assurances he was protected and could go \u201canywhere but Bahrain\u201d. His sister back in Bahrain warned him it was a risk to travel but he had assured her: \u201cI am under Australia\u2019s protection now, they will not let anything happen to me.\u201d But touching down in Bangkok, he was immediately detained by the Thai authorities. The arrest was based on an Interpol red notice which had erroneously been issued at the request of Bahrain, contradicting Interpol\u2019s own regulations that notices will not be issued \u201cif the status of refugee or asylum-seeking has been confirmed\u201d. Despite Interpol lifting the notice on 4 December and subsequent pressure from the Australian government, Thailand \u2013 notorious for its draconian immigration policies where refugees are regularly sent back to countries where they may be in danger \u2013 made the decision to extend Al-Araibi\u2019s detention for 60 days, pending a court verdict on whether to extradite him to Bahrain. Bahrain has until 8 February to submit the required documentation and then it is expected a court date will be set. While the Interpol red notice from Bahrain was issued on the basis of a conviction for Al-Araibi in 2014 for vandalising a police station, charges he vehemently denies and stresses were politically motivated, the footballer is adamant that Bahrain\u2019s determination to bring him back are in fact connected to public comments he made in Australia about his torture when he was in prison in Bahrain for three months in 2012. Speaking to international media in 2016, Al-Araibi accused one of Bahrain\u2019s most powerful figures, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa \u2013 a member of Bahrain\u2019s ruling royal family and president of Asia\u2019s governing body for football, who at the time was in the running for Fifa president \u2013 of discriminating against Shia Muslims (Al-Araibi is Shia while the ruling royal family is Sunni, divides that are starkly felt in Bahrain) and using his power to punish pro-democracy athletes who had protested against the royal family during the Arab spring in 2011. \u201cThis is nothing to do with my conviction; Bahrain wants me back to punish me because I talked to the media in 2016 about the terrible human rights and about how Sheikh Salman is a very bad man who discriminates against Shia Muslims,\u201d said Al-Araibi. \u201cI am so scared of being sent back to Bahrain, so scared because 100% they will arrest me, they will torture me again, possibly they will kill me.\u201d He confirmed Bahrain had made no attempt to contact him since his arrest. Al-Araibi\u2019s fear of torture if he is deported back to Bahrain comes from a place of harrowing experience. In 2012, while he was a player for the Al Shabab football team, he was suddenly arrested on the street and taken to jail on the accusation he and his brother had vandalised a police station. The charges, he says, were \u201centirely false\u201d \u2013 he had in fact been playing league football on TV when the alleged attack happened. But he believes he was targeted due to the support his brother had given pro-democracy Arab spring protests the year before, and the fact he is a Shia Muslim. \u201cIt was hell for me,\u201d he said, describing prison. \u201cFor the first two days they blindfolded me and beat me in the face and legs, telling me I would never play football again. Five hours\u2019 straight many police beat me. They poured cold water over my face and back. They were not even trying to get a confession out of me and whenever I asked them: \u2018What did I do?\u2019 they would just scream \u2018shut up\u2019 and beat me more.\u201d After three months in jail, Al-Araibi was released on bail and was certain the case against him was so flimsy it would be dismissed. But in 2014, while playing an away game in Qatar with the Bahrain national team, he got a phone call. He, his brother and an accomplice had been found guilty of the vandalism and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His brother is currently serving the jail term in Bahrain. \u201cI knew I could not go back to Bahrain,\u201d Al-Araibi said. In a journey which took almost six months, he fled first to Iran, then Malaysia, then Thailand and eventually to Australia where he sought, and was later given, asylum. Since 2014, he has built a life in Melbourne, marrying his wife who he has known since he was 17, and playing semi-professional football. There is hope that the recent case of Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, an 18-year-old Saudi woman who barricaded herself in a Bangkok hotel room to prevent being deported back to Saudi Arabia, might work in Al-Arabi\u2019s favour. Following a global outpouring of support, Thailand allowed her to seek asylum in Canada rather than obliging Saudi Arabia\u2019s deportation requests. Thai authorities subsequently pledged to \u201cfollow international norms\u201d in the treatment of asylum seekers. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, told ABC radio on Wednesday her government was \u201cvery deeply concerned\u201d by Al-Araibi\u2019s ongoing detention. She noted she had met with the deputy prime minister, minister for justice and the minister for foreign affairs earlier this month in Thailand, and \u201cwe have most definitely ensured the Thai government is well aware at all levels of the great importance of this matter to Australia\u201d. Australian football teams have joined Al-Araibi\u2019s Pascoe Vale FC club in calling for his release, staging protests, wearing armbands and stopping for a minute\u2019s applause at A-League games around the country. However, Football Federation Australia \u2013 whose chair is seeking a place on the executive of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) \u2013 has been criticised for its muted efforts. The AFC\u2019s president, Sheikh Salman, has said even less. Fifa has released increasingly strong statements but has mostly directed its efforts towards the Australian and Thai governments. Football analysts and human rights groups have urged it to utilise the enormous influence it has with governments such as Bahrain, not least because Sheikh Salman is also its vice president. In its first significant response to the outcry, the Bahraini government told the Guardian last week Al-Araibi\u2019s life was not in danger, and he had only to return home and appeal his conviction because its court system was \u201cindependent and transparent\u201d in line with international standards. For Al-Araibi, languishing in jail, his thoughts are now only of his wife. \u201cI am feeling very very bad, I miss my wife so much, I can\u2019t sleep thinking about how much I miss her,\u201d he said. \u201cTo keep my sanity I just run around the prison building and every step I think about her. All I want to be is back with her, not trapped in here. \u201cWe came to Thailand just to have a week of happiness here together but I regret it so much now, I wish we had never left Australia.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On the nearly 900km of the Darling River from below the Bourke weir to just above Wentworth, farmers on remote properties are dealing with a water crisis that would usually only be experienced in third world countries. While there is some water treatment in the small towns along the river, the farmers often have no choice but to ignore the warnings about using the river water. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d says Gabie Le Lievre, a grazier whose property adjoins the Darling between Louth and Tilpa. \u201cYes, we are in a terrible drought, but this is about a basic human right. I just want clean water to bathe my children.\u201d For months there has been a red alert for for blue-green algae in the Lower Darling as the river ceased to flow and temperatures regularly topped 45C. The river has stopped running last August and the remaining waterholes have turned an ugly bright green. The river has become undrinkable, unswimmable and unsuitable for bathing. The government warnings say that, when it reaches a red alert, contact should be avoided. \u201cBlue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, are the most ancient of all photosynthetic organisms,\u201d the NSW Water website warns. \u201cSome produce poisons harmful to humans and possibly fatal to domestic animals and fish \u2013 neurotoxins and liver toxins, and skin allergens. But for families that live along the Lower Darling on properties, there is often little choice, as that is the sole source of water for their homesteads, apart from very limited rain water. Some properties have bores that can be used for stock and most have rainwater tanks. But as the drought continues, even these are running out, leading properties to truck in water from nearby towns. Chrissy Ashby is a fifth-generation grazier on the cattle property Trevallyn, 75km downstream from Tilpa, and above the Wilcannia weir. The property has 65km of river frontage to the Darling, but these days the mighty river is just a dried up riverbed with a few stagnant pools. She grew up here, so she\u2019s seen droughts before. But this time the river is so low that she and her husband, Bill, are battling to survive. There have been a couple of environmental releases that have sent a trickle down the river, but it\u2019s now just a series of stagnant green pools. Yet that is their main water supply. \u201cThe water stinks,\u201d says Chrissy. \u201cIts just terrible. It smells like rotting plants.\u201d Since the algal bloom alerts, she been reduced to washing off in a bucket of precious rain water. \u201cWhen we go into town or anywhere with a shower, we grab the opportunity to wash our hair,\u201d she says. The social isolation is compounded as well. \u201cWe are reluctant to ask people to come and stay when they would have to shower and use water,\u201d she said. For stock, they are using a mobile submersible pump to extract water from the bottom of the pools to avoid the algae. The pool they are using is only knee-deep, about half a kilometre long and 30 metres wide. It\u2019s drying up too. Some properties have sunk bores, but with the Ashbys\u2019 finances stretched and no certainty that drilling would find water during the drought, they are scrambling for other alternatives. Tanks have been ordered from Broken Hill, so they can get a tanker of water delivered under the drought relief program. Bill has also bought a solar power system and new piping, so they can extract water at more remote pools down the river and pump it to the homestead. Further down the river at Tolarno, between Menindee and Pooncarie, Lauren Blunden, the wife of the manager, is in a daily struggle to ensure her seven-month son, Will, does not come in contact with river water. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult and stressful,\u201d she said. \u201cEven before the heat came, we have been struggling to cope with the lack of water.\u201d With a red algae alert at Tolarno, Blunden is taking no chances. She uses rain water for Will\u2019s baths and to wash his clothes. She and her husband are also showering under a camp shower that uses just a few litres of rain water. They have rigged up a submersible pump and a car battery to pump water from an esky that they fill manually. But they have now reached the bottom of the rain water tank, and last week had to truck water in from Menindee. \u201cIt\u2019s bore water, so it\u2019s not the greatest water. You can\u2019t drink it, and it\u2019s got a funny smell to it, and tastes awful, but it helps with washing and doing dishes,\u201d she says. They now go to another rainwater tank with large blue water bottles to get water for Will and for drinking. The house\u2019s plumbing is connected to river water. \u201cIt smells unbelievable. It smells like poo and rotten eggs. You can\u2019t fill up the sink to wash dishes because it is just so terrible,\u201d Blunden said. \u201cNormally we would bathe in this water, but it\u2019s unbearable. It dries your skin our, makes you itchy and it can cause a lot of health issues.\u201d A neurotoxin, BMAA, has been found in rivers in NSW that have blue green algae blooms. Studies in America have linked BMAA to a three-fold higher incidence of motor neurone disease. Blunden says there is basic testing for algae but not detailed testing of water quality. The advice is simply don\u2019t use it or come in contact with it. She puts their current predicament down the the decision by the NSW government to drain the lakes twice in the last four years. \u201cIts crazy, because when they are full we have seven years\u2019 supply,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. We are basically in third world conditions with our water. And this is Australia. \u201cEveryday we think about leaving. This is our home and we love it so much, but is it worth it? What if Will gets sick?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the final day of Guardian Australia\u2019s best beaches poll. If you haven\u2019t already voted, you\u2019ve still got time. To help you think about your answer, here are some of the favourite beaches nominated by our federal representatives. Some descriptions are beautiful. Others are surprising. And they all emphasise the importance of place in our national identity. Josh Wilson, Labor MP, Western Australia Sandtrax beach, WA \u201cI love Sandtrax in North Fremantle because it sets a classic Indian Ocean beachscape against the cranes and multi-coloured container stacks of Freo Port. \u201cAt sunset on a heavy summer\u2019s day you can float out to sea and look back at the industrial geometry caught in the glow. The limestone breakwater at the south end provides shelter from the wind and makes a wave that can be small and well-shaped or just an enjoyable mess. For a terrible surfer like me it\u2019s perfect. \u201cWhen it turns hot and the easterly blows, everyone\u2019s down there for some blue-green relief. But in winter you can walk along the foam on a bright morning all by yourself. I go there year round and it always restores some peace of mind. Even though Sandtrax is an urban beach it retains the feel of a tucked-away and rough-edged piece of coast.\u201d Linda Reynolds, Liberal senator, Western Australia \u2018It\u2019s Smiths Beach in Yallingup, WA\u2019 Peter Whish-Wilson, Greens senator, Tasmania Redbill beach, Bicheno \u201cImagine a perfect white sandy beach that speaks to you as you walk, a small red rock island appearing as a mirage at its finish, the rock a penguin rookery and bird sanctuary, connected by a sandbar at low tide. \u201cImagine a place that casts the shadows of forgotten ancestors \u2013 the first Tasmanians who lived and loved here for tens of thousands of years. \u201cImagine this beach was one of the few in the country that faced north, so its frequent surf was offshore in the prevailing southerlies, the deep riptide at its rocky entrance a perfect conveyor belt for surfers on rising swells. \u201cImagine its clean turquoise water teemed with wildlife, visited by rare southern right whales, dolphins, killer whales, penguins and seals. Imagine surfing this coast, in awe of the majestic hills, tall timbers and antipodean sunsets of Douglas Aspley national park. \u201cImagine no longer \u2013 this is Redbill beach, Bicheno, my local. Just one slice of Shangri-La in our beautiful Tasmania.\u201d Terri Butler, Labor MP, Queensland Streets beach, Queensland \u201cKodak Beach, now Streets beach, is a Brisbane icon. For older locals it\u2019s a permanent reminder of the fun we all had visiting the pavilions at Expo \u201988, and of how futuristic and interesting it all seemed. For young \u2019uns it\u2019s a free, public place to swim without having to leave the city.

      "bodyText": "Holidays are over, and the nastiness of work, traffic and negotiating life in a big city are creeping back in. But sitting down to watch three episodes of Rosehaven in a row, all the troubles of urban life seem to fall away. Premiering on 30 January, season three of the Australian comedy takes viewers back to the bucolic Tasmanian town where people say hello on the main street; where the hills are green and life unfolds at a slower pace. Speaking with Guardian Australia from Melbourne, the creators and stars Luke McGregor and Celia Pacquola say they didn\u2019t anticipate how successful the show would be. \u201cI remember when we first started doing the show, I thought two [seasons], if we were lucky,\u201d McGregor says. \u201cThree is a something I hadn\u2019t even planned on.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s generally not excited enough,\u201d says Pacquola. The pair finish each other\u2019s sentences and have an easygoing camaraderie that carries over to their on-screen characters: the bubbly Emma, which sparks off McGregor\u2019s more nervy and anxious Daniel. The premise of the show is simple enough: Daniel moves back to his hometown in Tasmania to help his mother with her real-estate business. He is joined by his best friend from the mainland, Emma, who was abandoned by her husband in Bali on their honeymoon. It\u2019s a gentle comedy that focuses on the oddballs in the town, and the relatable, warm and refreshing dynamics of Emma and Daniel\u2019s friendship. Plus, there\u2019s an air of authenticity: not only do McGregor\u2019s parents run a real-estate agency in Tasmania, but Pacquola and McGregor are best friends in real life. Since its debut in 2016, the show has become hugely popular and a critical success, and has been sold into US markets via SundanceTV. (The New York Times called it \u201cCharming, gentle\u201d \u2013 \u201cbrace yourself to fall completely in love\u201d.) So what is it about Rosehaven that audiences love? \u201cPeople need stuff to watch when they hungover,\u201d says Pacquola. \u201cThe next time you are hungover, you should watch it and see if you feel better.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing to watch when you\u2019re hungover,\u201d McGregor concurs. \u201cNo one is really mean, the world doesn\u2019t get in \u2013 there\u2019s no Brexit or Donald Trump.\u201d This isolation from the big bad world has been part of its appeal with American critics. \u201cIt makes you feel like you\u2019re a million miles away in a very special place,\u201d said one review in the Washington Post. That special place is Geeveston: a tiny town, population 616 in the Huon Valley, where many of the exterior scenes are shot. \u201cGeeveston has really embraced the show \u2026 the visitors\u2019 centre has asked for life-sized cutouts of us,\u201d says McGregor.

      "bodyText": "Iranian authorities arrested more than 7,000 dissidents last year in a sweeping crackdown that led to hundreds being jailed or flogged, at least 26 protesters being killed, and nine people dying in custody amid suspicious circumstances, according to Amnesty International. Those rounded up during violent dispersals of peaceful protests in what Amnesty called \u201ca year of shame for Iran\u201d included journalists, lawyers, minority rights activists and women who protested against being forced to wear headscarves. Iranian authorities beat unarmed protesters and used live ammunition, teargas and water cannon throughout the year \u2013 particularly in January, July and August \u2013 with thousands arbitrarily arrested and detained, new figures assert. \u201c2018 will go down in history as a year of shame for Iran,\u201d said Philip Luther, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East research and advocacy director. \u201cThe staggering scale of arrests, imprisonments and flogging sentences reveal the extreme lengths the authorities have gone to in order to suppress peaceful dissent. \u201cFrom underpaid teachers to factory workers struggling to feed their families, those who have dared to demand their rights in Iran today have paid a heavy price. Throughout 2018, the Iranian authorities waged a particularly sinister crackdown against women\u2019s rights defenders. Governments which are engaged in dialogue with Iran must not stay silent while the net of repression rapidly widens.\u201d At least 112 women human rights defenders were arrested or remained in detention in Iran last year following sustained protests against compulsory veiling.
