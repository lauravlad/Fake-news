Speaking at an electric vehicle plant in the West Midlands, Johnson is due to combine touting the Conservative offering with a vehement condemnation of Labour, saying Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party would condemn the UK to the \u201cintellectual cul-de-sac of far left Corbynism\u201d. The entry of the prime minister to the full electoral fray after a relatively quiet start to his campaign comes after he starred in the Conservatives\u2019 first election broadcast, an informal walkabout chat with Johnson made for social media consumption. In the low key and occasionally awkward four-minute clip, a cameraman pursues the prime minister around the Tory campaign HQ, firing questions which range from Brexit to trivia such as whether he enjoys Marmite \u2013 he does \u2013 and that his favourite bands are the Clash and Rolling Stones. In extracts from the West Midlands speech released in advance, Johnson says: \u201cThe UK is admired and respected around the world but people are baffled by our debate on Brexit and they cannot understand how this great country can squander so much time and energy on this question and how we can be so hesitant about our future.

      "body": "<p>Two weeks after stepping down as Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow has announced that he will publish his memoirs in February next year.</p> <p>Titled Unspeakable, the book was acquired by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson after significant interest from publishers. The Guardian understands that the deal was \u201ccomfortably\u201d into six figures.</p> <p>The divisive former MP said the book would \u201cdescribe as clearly as I can what motivated me\u201d, while his publisher promised it would also include Bercow\u2019s verdicts on figures including Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May, and Boris Johnson. If his comments since stepping down are anything to go by, readers are in for an eye-opener: last week Bercow said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic\">in an interview with the Observer</a> that Cameron feels he is \u201cborn to rule\u201d and that Brexit is \u201cthe biggest mistake of this country after the war\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic\">John Bercow: \u2018I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unspeakable will also explain the ways in which Bercow, the son of a cab driver in north London, \u201chas sought to democratise the business of Parliament, using the Speakership to champion the rights of backbench MPs and hold the government to account\u201d. It will also see Bercow tackle \u201chead-on his regretted fascination with definably right-wing attitudes\u201d, and describe \u201chis inexorable march to more progressive thinking\u201d since his election as the MP for Buckingham in 1997.</p> <p>Bercow was elected Speaker of the House of Commons in June 2009. After presiding over one of the most febrile British parliaments in years, he announced this summer that he would be standing down as Speaker and MP. His prominence during the Brexit debate split European media. The Daily Mail once called him an \u201cegotistical preening popinjay [who] has shamelessly put his anti-Brexit bias before the national interest \u2013 and is a disgrace to his office\u201d, but the press in Europe reveled in his behaviour. The Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant once wrote that \u201cno one on the British island can call \u2018order, order\u2019 more beautifully than John Bercow\u201d, while Radio France Internationale named him its <a href=\"http://www.rfi.fr/emission/20190113-john-bercow-le-speaker-chambre-communes\">\u201cEuropean of the week\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI am delighted that Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson has agreed to publish my account of a life in politics,\u201d said Bercow. \u201cI made friends and enemies alike, but from start to finish I sought to do the right, rather than the convenient, thing and to be a decent public servant. The story of a rewarding and fortunate career is told in my own words, and readers can make their own assessment of a journey that I enjoyed and they will judge.\u201d</p> <p>Weidenfeld chairman Alan Samson, who acquired the memoir from Andrew Gordon of David Higham Associates, said the memoirs were \u201cboth a grippingly candid narrative of a truly eventful political life, and also a wonderfully vivid tale of how the nation has reached this point in its history\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn the last decade John has made sure that Parliament has been able to stand up to the executive by putting MPs before ministers. Whether it is by accepting urgent questions or working hard to determine that the role of parliament is more widely understood by the public, he has played a vital activist role in the government being held to account,\u201d said Samson. \u201cHis book will be a hugely entertaining primer for anyone trying to understand the nature of our democracy and the processes of modern politics in this country.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement of Bercow\u2019s book deal comes a week after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50265137\">he furiously denied claims</a> that he had demanded \u00a31m to appear on reality TV show I\u2019m a Celebrity, which he described as \u201cutterly trashy\u201d. Bercow has previously written books including Incoming Assets: Why Tories Should Change Policy on Immigration and Asylum, which was published in 2005, and Tennis Maestros: the 20 Greatest Male Tennis Players of All Time, which was published five years ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two weeks after stepping down as Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow has announced that he will publish his memoirs in February next year. Titled Unspeakable, the book was acquired by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson after significant interest from publishers. The Guardian understands that the deal was \u201ccomfortably\u201d into six figures. The divisive former MP said the book would \u201cdescribe as clearly as I can what motivated me\u201d, while his publisher promised it would also include Bercow\u2019s verdicts on figures including Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May, and Boris Johnson. If his comments since stepping down are anything to go by, readers are in for an eye-opener: last week Bercow said in an interview with the Observer that Cameron feels he is \u201cborn to rule\u201d and that Brexit is \u201cthe biggest mistake of this country after the war\u201d. Unspeakable will also explain the ways in which Bercow, the son of a cab driver in north London, \u201chas sought to democratise the business of Parliament, using the Speakership to champion the rights of backbench MPs and hold the government to account\u201d. It will also see Bercow tackle \u201chead-on his regretted fascination with definably right-wing attitudes\u201d, and describe \u201chis inexorable march to more progressive thinking\u201d since his election as the MP for Buckingham in 1997. Bercow was elected Speaker of the House of Commons in June 2009. After presiding over one of the most febrile British parliaments in years, he announced this summer that he would be standing down as Speaker and MP. His prominence during the Brexit debate split European media. The Daily Mail once called him an \u201cegotistical preening popinjay [who] has shamelessly put his anti-Brexit bias before the national interest \u2013 and is a disgrace to his office\u201d, but the press in Europe reveled in his behaviour. The Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant once wrote that \u201cno one on the British island can call \u2018order, order\u2019 more beautifully than John Bercow\u201d, while Radio France Internationale named him its \u201cEuropean of the week\u201d. \u201cI am delighted that Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson has agreed to publish my account of a life in politics,\u201d said Bercow. \u201cI made friends and enemies alike, but from start to finish I sought to do the right, rather than the convenient, thing and to be a decent public servant. The story of a rewarding and fortunate career is told in my own words, and readers can make their own assessment of a journey that I enjoyed and they will judge.\u201d Weidenfeld chairman Alan Samson, who acquired the memoir from Andrew Gordon of David Higham Associates, said the memoirs were \u201cboth a grippingly candid narrative of a truly eventful political life, and also a wonderfully vivid tale of how the nation has reached this point in its history\u201d. \u201cIn the last decade John has made sure that Parliament has been able to stand up to the executive by putting MPs before ministers. Whether it is by accepting urgent questions or working hard to determine that the role of parliament is more widely understood by the public, he has played a vital activist role in the government being held to account,\u201d said Samson. \u201cHis book will be a hugely entertaining primer for anyone trying to understand the nature of our democracy and the processes of modern politics in this country.\u201d The announcement of Bercow\u2019s book deal comes a week after he furiously denied claims that he had demanded \u00a31m to appear on reality TV show I\u2019m a Celebrity, which he described as \u201cutterly trashy\u201d. Bercow has previously written books including Incoming Assets: Why Tories Should Change Policy on Immigration and Asylum, which was published in 2005, and Tennis Maestros: the 20 Greatest Male Tennis Players of All Time, which was published five years ago.",
