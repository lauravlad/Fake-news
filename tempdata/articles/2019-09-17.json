      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has set out the four pillars of a \u201csensible\u201d Brexit deal he would negotiate with the EU, as he pledged to carry out whatever the people decide in a second EU referendum as Labour prime minister. The Labour leader set out how he would go into an election offering to negotiate a Brexit deal involving a customs union, ahead of next week\u2019s party conference where activists will launch a bid to shift the party\u2019s position towards campaigning to remain in the EU. At the annual gathering in Brighton, some members will attempt to force a conference vote on the issue, with the aim of getting a promise to campaign for remain in the party\u2019s next general election manifesto. Senior shadow cabinet figures \u2013 John McDonnell, Emily Thornberry, Tom Watson and Nick Brown \u2013 have all said they would want to campaign to stay in the bloc regardless of any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour. However, Corbyn\u2019s statement is the strongest sign yet that he will resist demands to pick a side and would opt to stay out of campaigning in a second referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, allowing him to pitch himself as the neutral referee who pledges to carry out whatever the public decides. This would help avoid the situation David Cameron found himself in as prime minister in 2016, when he resigned from No 10 after ending up on the losing side. Writing in the Guardian, Corbyn laid down a marker of his determination to seek a better Brexit deal from the EU, which the party believes it could negotiate quickly based on conversations already undertaken with Brussels. \u201cA Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU; a close single market relationship; and guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would then put that to a public vote alongside remain. I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.\u201d This would form the basis of what Corbyn describes as a \u201ccredible leave option\u201d which would be offered at a referendum against the option of remaining in the EU. Corbyn also positioned Labour as \u201cthe only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision\u201d, after the Liberal Democrats changed their position to campaigning for a revocation of article 50 in a bid to attract remain voters. He said: \u201cJohnson wants to crash out with no deal. That is something opposed by business, industry, the trade unions and most of the public \u2013 and even by the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s co-convener, Michael Gove, who said earlier this year: \u2018We didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal.\u2019 \u201cAnd now the Liberal Democrats want MPs to overturn the referendum result by revoking article 50 in a parliamentary stitch-up. It is simply undemocratic to override the decision of a majority of the voters without going back to the people. \u201cLabour is the only party determined to bring people together. Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit. Only a Labour government will put the power back into the hands of the people. Let\u2019s stop a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and let the people decide.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s decision to set out his stall in favour of negotiating a Brexit deal and then putting that to a referendum presents a challenge to conference delegates over whether to back his stance or a more pro-remain position if it comes to a vote. An effort to change Labour\u2019s Brexit position will start on Saturday in Brighton, where delegates will discuss 80 motions submitted by local parties in favour of campaigning to remain in a second referendum. After a process called \u201ccompositing\u201d, one or two motions will emerge to be voted on by the wider conference later in the week. This may end up as a battle between largely remain-supporting activists and trade unions who favour Corbyn\u2019s position, unless the two sides can agree on a compromise motion that avoids a public row. A majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible (AEP) or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour. Michael Chessum, from AEP, said: \u201cLabour has already crossed the Rubicon in promising a public vote with an option to remain. It would be utterly absurd, in those circumstances, for Labour not to campaign for remain when 90% of its members want to stay in the EU. Trying to prevent Labour from backing remain is a dead end for Corbyn \u2013 it will inevitably fail and it risks the morale of our base at at a crucial moment.\u201d Last week, Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, used a speech to argue that Labour should \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d and also seek a second Brexit referendum before a general election. The idea was swiftly rejected by Corbyn, who called it \u201cTom\u2019s view\u201d. In his article, Corbyn promised that he would back a general election as soon as Boris Johnson\u2019s threat of a no deal Brexit is avoided through an extension to article 50. The issue of Brexit is likely to dominate Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton but there will also be debate over the campaign pushing for the party to adopt a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, involving a zero carbon target by 2030 and more green jobs. Separately, the party\u2019s national executive committee met on Tuesday to agree rule changes to speed up expulsions from Labour in serious cases of wrongdoing, which will be put to a vote at conference. Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and a key Corbyn ally, won the NEC\u2019s backing to effectively abolish its 40-year-old student wing, which is dominated by the more centrist side of the party. The motion said Labour Students was not officially affiliated and should be replaced, claiming it had not paid its fees. This was disputed by Rania Ramli, its chair.

But for the supreme court to rule against the government \u2013 to side with the Scottish court of session against the English high court \u2013 would amount to a bold act of judicial assertiveness, effectively creating new law curtailing the power of the executive. It could happen, but it would not be normal.</p> <p>Here are the main points from today\u2019s hearing.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lord Keen, who was representing the government, told the court that Boris Johnson would comply with any declaration it made.</strong> The fact that he felt the need to say this is evidence of the extent to which trust in the government to comply with constitutional norms is breaking down. As advocate general for Scotland, Keen is a member of the government, as well as a QC. He told the court:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If this court finds that the advice of the prime minister [to the Queen saying parliament should be prorogued] was unlawful, the prime minister will take all necessary steps to comply with any declaration made by the court.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when asked if that meant parliament would definitely reconvene, Keen said it would be up to the PM to decide. He also refused to rule out the PM requesting a second prorogation, saying again that this would be a matter for Boris Johnson, or the \u201cdecision maker\u201d, as he called him. And when asked if Johnson would allow parliament to meet and pass new emergency legislation if it wanted, in the event of the government losing, Keen replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It must be for the decision maker to consider the declaration made by the court and to ensure that he proceeds lawfully thereafter.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>The court was told that Boris Johnson had abused his power to prorogue parliament more than any PM in the last 50 years. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/17/brexit-latest-news-supreme-court-minister-refuses-to-rule-out-boris-johnson-suspending-parliament-again-ahead-of-supreme-court-hearing-live-news?page=with:block-5d80abdb8f08f30dc5bbcd2c#block-5d80abdb8f08f30dc5bbcd2c\">10.50am.)</a> Addressing the court on behalf on behalf of Gina Miller, Pannick said that the government had failed to explain why the prorogation needed to be so long.

According to <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8589#fullreport\">a Commons library note (pdf)</a>, this is what happened next.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parliament was first prorogued by commission on 13 September 1948 and a King\u2019s speech was delivered on 14 September 1948. The Commons had ten sitting days (the Lords only five) before parliament was again prorogued by commission on 25 October 1948. A further King\u2019s speech was made on 26 October 1948. </p> <p>The period of prorogation in those instances was unusually short by the standards of the UK parliament (being just one day on both occasions). The second Parliament Act eventually received royal assent in December 1949, just over two years after it first passed second reading in the House of Commons.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Lady Hale</strong> questions this example, saying that this case involve prorogation being used to enforce the will of parliament, not to frustrate it.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T14:13:05.308Z\">at 3.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d80e3298f08f30dc5bbcf92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T13:45:13.988Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth Jo Swinson has just started her leader\u2019s speech.</p> <p>There is a live feed here.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32PvwpAgXg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m32PvwpAgXg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Jo Swinson\u2019s speech to Lib Dem conference</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d80e0c68f08f30dc5bbcf72\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T13:44:04.333Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Keen says the power to prorogue parliament is not there just to allow a Queen\u2019s speech.</p> <p>He says Lord Pannick did not mention <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/30-31/81/contents\">the Prorogation Act 1867</a>.</p> <p>And he says there are times when prorogation has taken place for political purposes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d80dd848f0834740f3bcce1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T13:32:37.008Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM will take 'necessary steps' to comply with any declaration from supreme court, court told</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Keen says he will not accept that the Scottish court of session had the right to declare prorogation null and void.</p> <p>For reference, this is what the Scottish court said in its summary of its judgment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The court will accordingly make an order declaring that the prime minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect. </p> </blockquote> <p>Keen says William IV was the last monarch to prorogue parliament in person.</p> <p>Now it is done by a royal commission.</p> <p>He says, under the Bill of Rights, the courts do not have the right to question proceedings in parliament.</p> <p>He says the Scottish court ruling saying prorogation is null and void must be rejected.</p> <p>And he says the PM \u201cwill take all necessary steps to comply with any declaration of the courts\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Lady Hale </strong>says the question of whether prorogation is actually a proceeding of parliament is a matter for the court to decide.

He only quotes briefly from what it says - the judges have the whole thing in their bundle - but here is a passage summarising Elliott\u2019s argument.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Far from requiring the court to determine whether the duration is excessive, the issue in <em>Cherry </em>and <em>Miller (No 2)</em> requires the court only to determine whether, to begin with, prorogation was undertaken for a purpose that was legally impermissible because it lies outside the range of purposes for which the power can lawfully be deployed. This is a crisp question of constitutional law concerning the <em>scope </em>of the discretionary power to prorogue, as distinct from a question about whether discretion has been lawfully exercised. Such a question of law, about the scope of the executive\u2019s legal powers, is manifestly one that lies within the field of matters with which courts can properly deal.</p> <p>The result is that to approach <em>Cherry </em>and <em>Miller (No 2) </em>in terms of whether the courts can stretch the bounds of justiciability in a way that facilitates judicial scrutiny of the exercise of the prorogation prerogative is misconceived. It is misconceived because the legal issue at stake is not one upon which the non-justiciability doctrine can properly bite. That doctrine is concerned with limiting judicial involvement in the evaluation of the exercise of governmental powers whose use is capable of giving rise to questions that are unsuited, under the separation of powers, to analysis by courts on legal grounds. The justiciability doctrine is, however, logically incapable of biting upon questions about whether a given power exists and, if so, what its legal boundaries are. Questions about the purposes for which legal powers can and cannot lawfully be used are legal questions about the scope of such powers. It is questions of precisely that nature which are raised by the <em>Miller (No 2) </em>and <em>Cherry</em> cases. Consequently, the non-justiciability doctrine has no relevant application \u2014 and the suggestion by the divisional court that the \u201cpolitical\u201d nature of the issue shields it from judicial review is entirely wide of the mark. Whether the supreme court will be prepared to treat the matters before it as justiciable remains to be seen, but there is no good legal reason for treating them as non-justiciable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d80c1d28f0834740f3bcbed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T11:24:51.861Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pannick is turning to the third of his three main arguments, relating to justiciability.

This is what that paragraph says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parliament has a second equally important function, namely that of holding the executive to account. The policies and actions of the government are subject to scrutiny in parliament by members of parliament. The United Kingdom operates by a system of representative democracy, and it is members of parliament, representing the interests of their constituents and the wider interests of the country, who are responsible for ensuring that the executive operates in the national interest. In particular, parliament is responsible for ensuring that the policies of the executive are properly considered in a democratic body, and that the actions of the executive are subject to critical scrutiny, with representatives of the government reporting on and explaining those actions. In this way parliament performs the fundamental role of protecting the country from the arbitrary exercise or abuse of executive power. The importance of the latter function is obvious, both in the abstract and in the light of the events during the 17th century that gave rise to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T11:12:38.877Z\">at 12.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d80bc368f0834740f3bcbab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T10:58:53.200Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pannick is still addressing the argument that a power can only be used for its proper purpose.</p> <p>He says, in constitutional terms, ministers are the junior partner.

Reference is made to the fact that the legislative programme for the present session of parliament is nearly at an end, which would provide a valid reason for starting a new session. No attempt is made, however, to explain why a prorogation of five weeks is necessary at a time of acute national controversy. The critical complaint about the prorogation is not the fact that it occurred; short prorogation is regularly used to start new parliamentary sessions. The complaint rather relates to the length of the period during which parliament is to be prorogued, without any power to resume sitting during that period.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T10:12:37.538Z\">at 11.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d80ad4d8f08f9df5bdd5dec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-17T09:55:25.666Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pannick now reads out the quote.

But that is what he was doing on the Today programme when he refused to rule out Boris Johnson suspending parliament for a second time before the Brexit deadline on 31 October. Asked if it was even \u201cremotely conceivable\u201d that Johnson might suspend (prorogue, to use the technical term) parliament again (MPs are due to return on 14 October), Buckland did not say no. Instead he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you know, it feels in politics, Harold Wilson said a week is a long time in politics, it seems like an hour is a long time in politics at the moment. For me to sit here and imagine what might happen at the end of October, I think, is idle. What I do know is, if we are able to, we will have a Queen\u2019s speech in mid-October, there will be debate during that time, and a vote as well, perhaps a series of votes.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday, Johnson himself also refused to rule out suspending parliament again when asked directly to do so.</p> <p>Joe Moor, who was the director of legislative affairs at Downing Street when Theresa May was prime minister, explained in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/14/boris-johnson-could-still-force-prorogation-second-time1/\">an article in the Sunday Telegraph two days ago (paywall)</a>, that if the government wins the supreme court case starting today, it would be possible for Johnson to suspend parliament again after it returns on 14 October, at least until 6 November. It would have to be sitting on those two days because of an amendment passed to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act, Moor explained.</p> <p>All of which is why today\u2019s supreme court hearing is so important.</p> <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Owen Bowcott</strong>\u2019s overnight preview story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/16/supreme-court-to-hear-claims-suspension-of-parliament-is-unlawful\">Supreme court to hear claims suspension of parliament is unlawful</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is his analysis of the issues at stake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/16/supreme-court-hearing-on-suspension-of-parliament-key-issues\">Supreme court hearing on suspension of parliament \u2013 key issues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a live feed of the hearing, so I will be covering it in detail.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us this evening, so here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events. The big story was in the supreme court. Here\u2019s a comprehensive summary of those proceedings. Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has said she does not know whether or not Boris Johnson really believes in Brexit. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in [Johnson\u2019s] heart. I don\u2019t know whether he desperately believes in Brexit or he doesn\u2019t believe in Brexit and I\u2019m not going to pretend that I do. But I think people can tell if politicians are basically telling the truth or not and if they can tell if they mean what they say. The prime minister and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, discussed Saudi Arabia, Iran and Brexit in talks this morning. No 10 said they discussed efforts to find a new Brexit deal. And, if you\u2019d like to read more, my colleague Owen Bowcott has the full story: Here are some more details on those comments from Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, who has said the EU is yet to see any written UK proposals for a new Brexit deal. There is an obligation on the party looking for change to come up with solutions that can deal with the consequences of what they are asking for. If that question can\u2019t be answered, we will not have a deal. If the current position from the UK side is that the backstop needs to be removed then it is a perfectly reasonable request by us to say that creates huge problems and how are you going to solve it and what are you going to replace it with? Asked when the public would be informed of where and when checks on the border would take place, he said: First of all, we won\u2019t sign up to any agreement that requires checks with the UK in terms of a permanent trading relationship linked to Brexit. Coveney said any checks would be a \u201ctemporary, emergency measure\u201d to protect Ireland\u2019s place in the single market. He added he would have clarity on the location of the checks before Britain leaves the EU on 31 October. The response to a no-deal Brexit will be checks somewhere. I don\u2019t think they will be near the border. It is not all bad new for Boris Johnson at the moment. According to some new polling from YouGov, his favourability ratings are slightly higher than they were when be became prime minister. Rather, he is slightly less unpopular, because his net score is still negative. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, had frank discussions with the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, outlining the consequences of dropping the backstop over dinner last night. After addressing the cabinet in Dublin again today on Brexit planning, Coveney told reporters: The risk of a no-deal Brexit remains significant as the political situation in London continues to be very uncertain. We and the EU, as underlined by Michel Barnier when I spoke to him yesterday and President Juncker after his meeting with Prime Minister Johnson, are open to a deal. But it must achieve the aims of the backstop through a legally operable solution. We await written proposals from the UK side. We haven\u2019t seen any written proposals to date. He said that if the UK wanted the backstop dropped, it was reasonable that Ireland would spell out the problems with that, especially as it took more than two years of talks to reach that original deal. Just because Boris Johnson says the backstop needs to go does not mean everybody else will respond positively to that because there are consequences. The supreme court prorogation hearing will go on for three days. After day one, who\u2019s winning? I have quoted a couple of commentators brave enough to express a view (see 2.18pm and 4.12pm) but, honestly, no one knows. That is not just because trying to assess how it\u2019s going by following the interventions does not always work. (See 4.35pm) It is because the judges will assess the appeal to a large extent on the quality of the arguments in the paperwork, and most of that is not available to viewers, and did not get aired in court. On the basis of what we did hear, Lord Keen, who was representing the government, was probably less compelling than his opponent, Lord Pannick. But for the supreme court to rule against the government \u2013 to side with the Scottish court of session against the English high court \u2013 would amount to a bold act of judicial assertiveness, effectively creating new law curtailing the power of the executive. It could happen, but it would not be normal. Here are the main points from today\u2019s hearing. Lord Keen, who was representing the government, told the court that Boris Johnson would comply with any declaration it made. The fact that he felt the need to say this is evidence of the extent to which trust in the government to comply with constitutional norms is breaking down. As advocate general for Scotland, Keen is a member of the government, as well as a QC. He told the court: If this court finds that the advice of the prime minister [to the Queen saying parliament should be prorogued] was unlawful, the prime minister will take all necessary steps to comply with any declaration made by the court. But when asked if that meant parliament would definitely reconvene, Keen said it would be up to the PM to decide. He also refused to rule out the PM requesting a second prorogation, saying again that this would be a matter for Boris Johnson, or the \u201cdecision maker\u201d, as he called him. And when asked if Johnson would allow parliament to meet and pass new emergency legislation if it wanted, in the event of the government losing, Keen replied: It must be for the decision maker to consider the declaration made by the court and to ensure that he proceeds lawfully thereafter. The court was told that Boris Johnson had abused his power to prorogue parliament more than any PM in the last 50 years. (See 10.50am.) Addressing the court on behalf on behalf of Gina Miller, Pannick said that the government had failed to explain why the prorogation needed to be so long. And he suggested that Johnson\u2019s refusal to provide the court with a witness statement suggested he had not been telling the truth about his motives for prorogation. Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s story about this morning\u2019s proceedings. And this is from the barrister and legal commentator Adam Wagner. During the morning of today\u2019s supreme court hearing, the live stream on the court\u2019s website was accessed 4.4m times \u2013 with 2.8m stream requests being logged in the hour before the 1pm break for lunch, PA Media reports. Typically, the live streaming service is accessed about 20,000 times a month. The European commission has renewed its call for the UK to come up with proposals for an alternative to the backstop. This is what its spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, told a briefing in Strasbourg earlier. We are still waiting for concrete proposals from the UK side. Both sides have stated that they want to have a deal. A no-deal Brexit is in nobody\u2019s interests so clearly there is the willingness to arrive to a solution. But, again, I think we have recalled that it\u2019s now the UK\u2019s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement that are necessary in order to move the discussions forward. Here is one view on the proceedings, from the lawyer and legal commentator Carl Gardner. Keen is winding up now. He says the Scottish judgment should be rejected. And, even if the supreme court endorses what it decides, he says the point about the prorogation currently being null and of no effect (see 2.32pm) should be struck out. And he says he will discuss with Lord Pannick what form of words could be used in any written undertaking by the PM that he will abide by the court\u2019s decision. (See 2.32pm.) And that\u2019s it. The hearing is over for today. I will post a summary soon. Keen says the Scottish court was proceeding on the basis of a misunderstanding of how parliament operates. Making the same point a few minutes ago, he said the Scottish judgment said parliament could reconvene itself at any time during an adjournment. But it cannot, Keen said. During an adjournment, parliament can only be recalled if the government asks for that, he said. Keen quotes from the Scottish court judgment. He reads out this passage. Although the planned prorogation would be 34 days, the expected conference recess of three weeks would mean that only one to three days would be lost in the week commencing 9 September and four in the week commencing 7 October. That makes a total of seven days, Keen says. But he says elsewhere in the judgment the Scottish court says the prorogation amounted to five weeks. He says the five weeks claim is wrong. This passage shows we are only talking about seven days, he says. A judge asks why seven days were needed. Keen does not answer the question directly. Why not seven days, he asks? He says there is no set number of days. Keen says he does not see how the Scottish court could produce an inference of improper motive on the basis of the evidence available to it. A judge asks why the prorogation had to last for five weeks. Keen says that was because it covered the party conference season. He says actually only seven sitting days are being lost. He says the Scottish court, the inner house of the court of session, made a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d in assessing the significance of the length of prorogation. Another judge asks about a Spectator article written by Nikki da Costa on 29 June. It was headlined: \u201cWill parliament be able to stop the next PM leaving without a deal?\u201d The article refers to prorogation as a \u201cnuclear option\u201d. He asks Keen if he is happy for this to be taken in to account. Keen says, when she wrote the article, she was a private individual, not director of legislative affairs at No 10. He says the court could look at all sorts of speculation. But it should consider the evidence submitted by the government, which explains the reasons for what happened, he says. (See 3.32pm.) Keen now quotes from what Boris Johnson said in response to what Nikki da Costa put to him in her memo. (See 3.32pm.) Johnson replied: The whole September session is a rigmarole introduced to show the public that MPs were earning their crust. So I don\u2019t see anything especially shocking about this proposition. Keen says there was correspondence between the government and Gina Miller\u2019s team about the production of documents for the court. He says the government legal department sent a letter saying the documents it had submitted, contemporaneous documents sent to the PM, explained the thinking for prorogation. In the letter, the government lawyers said they had nothing further to add. He says the documents that were produced, quite exceptionally, included a cabinet minute. He quotes from one of the documents \u2013 a memo from Nikki da Costa, director of legislative affairs, to the PM. He reads this out. The current session is the longest since records began, and all bills announced as part of the last Queen\u2019s speech have now received royal assent, or are paused awaiting carry over into the next session: this makes it increasingly difficult to fill parliamentary time with anything other than general debates. As a new prime minister, there is an expectation that you will set out a refreshed domestic programme and it would be natural to do so when the house returns in the autumn. As the first week\u2019s business in September has already been announced, I recommend dedicating the second to wash-up on bills such as R&amp;R [restoration and renewals]. We would then prorogue sometime between the end of Monday 9th September and Thursday 12th September, allowing for the long-standing conference recess, and return on Monday 14th October with the state opening of parliament. A judge asks if the reference to bills being carried over shows that prorogation was being considered at this point. The memo was dated 15 August. Keen says that, at this point after such a long session, it would be normal to think of what is coming next. Keen is now addressing what the Scottish court of session said about Boris Johnson\u2019s motives for prorogation. (This might be the hardest issue for him to address. The government\u2019s claim that it had nothing to do with limiting the opportunities available to MPs to block Brexit is not widely believed.) Keen refers to what Lord Carloway, the lord president of the court of session in Scotland, said in his judgment (pdf) about prorogation. Carloway said \u201cdecisions which are made on the basis of legitimate political considerations alone are not justiciable\u201d. But that raises the questions as to what political considerations are not legitimate, Keen says. He says the Scottish court did not answer this. Back in the supreme court Lord Keen says parliament anticipated this autumn that it would be adjourned after the September sitting. That is why it passed the Benn act quickly, he suggests. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about Jo Swinson\u2019s speech at the Lib Dem conference. Swinson is still speaking, but the text has been released to reporters in advance. In the supreme court Keen runs through various previous examples of prorogation. And he mentions the prorogation in 1948, which was for a party political purpose. That prorogation took place when the Parliament Act allowed the House of Lords to block a bill for two sessions of parliament. At the time the Attlee government wanted to amend this. A bill to amend the act had already been defeated once in the Lords. According to a Commons library note (pdf), this is what happened next. Parliament was first prorogued by commission on 13 September 1948 and a King\u2019s speech was delivered on 14 September 1948. The Commons had ten sitting days (the Lords only five) before parliament was again prorogued by commission on 25 October 1948. A further King\u2019s speech was made on 26 October 1948. The period of prorogation in those instances was unusually short by the standards of the UK parliament (being just one day on both occasions). The second Parliament Act eventually received royal assent in December 1949, just over two years after it first passed second reading in the House of Commons. Lady Hale questions this example, saying that this case involve prorogation being used to enforce the will of parliament, not to frustrate it. At the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth Jo Swinson has just started her leader\u2019s speech. There is a live feed here. Keen says the power to prorogue parliament is not there just to allow a Queen\u2019s speech. He says Lord Pannick did not mention the Prorogation Act 1867. And he says there are times when prorogation has taken place for political purposes. Keen says he will not accept that the Scottish court of session had the right to declare prorogation null and void. For reference, this is what the Scottish court said in its summary of its judgment: The court will accordingly make an order declaring that the prime minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect. Keen says William IV was the last monarch to prorogue parliament in person. Now it is done by a royal commission. He says, under the Bill of Rights, the courts do not have the right to question proceedings in parliament. He says the Scottish court ruling saying prorogation is null and void must be rejected. And he says the PM \u201cwill take all necessary steps to comply with any declaration of the courts\u201d. Lady Hale says the question of whether prorogation is actually a proceeding of parliament is a matter for the court to decide. The fact that the royal commission sits in parliament does not make it a proceeding in parliament, in terms of the Bill of Rights. Another judge, Lord Kerr, asks what would happen if the supreme court finds against the government. Keen says he has given \u201ca clear undertaking that the prime minister will respond by all necessary means\u201d to the supreme court\u2019s decision. That would mean parliament sitting again, he implies. Kerr goes again. But is it possible the PM could prorogue parliament again? Keen says he is not able to answer that. That would be a decision for the PM, he suggests. He repeats the assurance he is able to give. If the court finds that the advice of the PM to the Queen about prorogation was unlawful, \u201cthe prime minister will take the necessary steps to comply with any declaration made by it\u201d. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth Keen says the Scottish court accepted that the principle of non-justiciability does apply. What is at stake is whether the decision to prorogue is justiciable. Keen starts by saying he agrees with the inner house of the court of session about this case not hinging on any particular aspect of Scots law. He says in this case the relevant constitution law applies to the UK as a whole. Back in the supreme court the afternoon proceedings are starting. Lord Keen QC, the advocate general for Scotland, is speaking now for the UK government. He is asking the court to reject the judgment of the inner court of Scotland\u2019s court of session. Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has said she does not know whether or not Boris Johnson really believes in Brexit. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Lorraine, asked about David Cameron\u2019s claim that Johnson only joined the leave campaign to further his own career, she said: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in [Johnson\u2019s] heart. I don\u2019t know whether he desperately believes in Brexit or he doesn\u2019t believe in Brexit and I\u2019m not going to pretend that I do. But I think people can tell if politicians are basically telling the truth or not and if they can tell if they mean what they say. Davidson said that one of the reasons she quit as Scottish Tory leader was because she found it hard to reconcile her political view that, in the light of the referendum result, Brexit should go ahead with her personal opposition to leaving the EU. She also said she did not know why Johnson has prorogued parliament for so long. Asked about this, she said: I think it was done in a bad way but the idea that a prime minister doesn\u2019t suspend parliament in order to bring forward a Queen\u2019s speech and a legislative agenda \u2013 up until recently that happened almost every year. I was quite close to David Cameron and Theresa May, I\u2019m not close to Boris Johnson, I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019ve ever been part of his inner circle \u2013 I haven\u2019t \u2013 so I don\u2019t know why the government chose to do that and that\u2019s one of the things the judges are going to be deciding, and what the Scottish case looked at. Sir Edward Leigh, the veteran Conservative, has sent an email to MPs explaining why they should vote for him as next Speaker. He would treat them as grown-ups, he says. I would be strictly impartial and deaf to any partisan influence. I would, in quiet dignity, dress, and demeanour, model myself on the present Lord Speaker. We should treat MPs as grown-ups and let them know when they will be called at the beginning of debates. The Speaker must always be scrupulously fair and polite to colleagues, speaking only to effect and briefly and submerge his personality into the role. I would want to be a Speaker who seeks to unite the house in robust scrutiny. A Speaker who speaks only to good and powerful effect and who is the calm, self-effacing voice of the house. Leigh also says he would be in favour of abolishing September sittings \u2013 which might get him Boris Johnson\u2019s vote, in view of the fact Johnson thinks these are an unnecessary \u201cgirly swot\u201d initiative. Wake Up and Vote, a campaign that tried to increase the youth turnout in the EU referendum, has been fined \u00a31,800 by the Electoral Commission for not submitting a full spending return. It said that it spend \u00a366,383 during the campaign. But it also jointly funded an advertising campaign with DDB UK, which cost a total of \u00a375,813, and under electoral rules it should have including the joint spending in its own campaign spending return. Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s story about the opening of the supreme court prorogation case. And this is how it starts. Boris Johnson\u2019s motive for proroguing the Commons for five weeks was \u201cto silence parliament for that period\u201d, the supreme court has been told at the opening of an emergency appeal. The prime minister\u2019s extended suspension of debate was carried out for an \u201cimproper purpose\u201d in order to \u201cavoid the risk of parliament undermining the policies of his executive\u201d, said Lord Pannick QC, who was representing the businesswoman and legal campaigner Gina Miller. Before the arguments formally began in central London, Lady Hale, the president of the supreme court, said it was facing \u201cserious and difficult questions\u201d. That was evidenced, she said, \u201cby the fact that three senior judges in Scotland have reached a different conclusion to three senior judges in England and Wales\u201d. Boris Johnson spoke to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, this morning, Downing Street has said. They spoke about Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also about Brexit. According to Number 10, this is what was said on that topic. On Brexit, the prime minister reiterated that the UK and the EU have agreed to accelerate efforts to reach a deal without the backstop which the UK parliament could support, and that we would work with energy and determination to achieve this ahead of Brexit on 31 October. Number 10 said Johnson and Merkel would speak again at the UN general assembly in New York next week. Pannick says, if this issue is not justiciable, people have to ask what might happen if another PM were to prorogue parliament for six months or for a year. And he says it is no good referring to Dicey for guidance on this because he was writing in another era. And Dicey said something like that would be most unconstitutional. Pannick says this is a legal question. And legal questions are for the courts to determine. He says the only remedy he is seeking is a declaration that the PM\u2019s advice was unlawful. He says the government, in its submission, says the PM will comply with the declaration of the court. Pannick concludes by apologising for over-running his time by a few minutes, eating into the time available for lunch. And now the court adjourns until 2pm. Pannick says it is more difficult to apply a Padfield principle to a prerogative power than to a statutory power. But it is still possible, he says. And he says there is an important principle at stake - whether the exercise of such a power frustrates the purposes for which such a power applies. In the supreme court Pannick is winding up. These are from the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani and the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the supreme court case was mentioned by Boris Johnson during this morning\u2019s cabinet meeting. \u201cHe mentioned the fact that the court case was ongoing and that we are confident in our arguments,\u201d the spokesman said. As the Press Association reports, asked whether Johnson should either give evidence or submit an affidavit to the court, the spokesman said: I am not going to comment on an ongoing court case. The way court cases begin is that one side will set out their position and then there will be a response for the government. The court is the right forum for this to take place. Pannick says the PM cannot have discretion as to the depth of the powers he enjoys. Lady Arden says the Fixed-term Parliaments Act allows for prorogation. Pannick says he is not challenging the power of the government to prorogue. But, given the junior role of the executive, he is arguing that it is implicit in the power of the executive that it will not remove the power of scrutiny other than for a legitimate purpose. He says ending one session and starting another is a legitimate purpose. But he says it is not proper to prorogue for so long as to frustrate scrutiny. He says in this case prorogation had the effect of \u201cfrustrating the constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty and supremacy over the executive\u201d. Lord Hodge asks if obtaining political advantage automatically makes a motive improper. Pannick says if the purpose is to prevent scrutiny by the executive, then the purpose is improper. But he says there is nothing wrong with proroguing just to have a Queen\u2019s speech. Pannick quotes from this blog by Prof Mark Elliott, professor of public law the the University of Cambridge. He only quotes briefly from what it says - the judges have the whole thing in their bundle - but here is a passage summarising Elliott\u2019s argument. Far from requiring the court to determine whether the duration is excessive, the issue in Cherry and Miller (No 2) requires the court only to determine whether, to begin with, prorogation was undertaken for a purpose that was legally impermissible because it lies outside the range of purposes for which the power can lawfully be deployed. This is a crisp question of constitutional law concerning the scope of the discretionary power to prorogue, as distinct from a question about whether discretion has been lawfully exercised. Such a question of law, about the scope of the executive\u2019s legal powers, is manifestly one that lies within the field of matters with which courts can properly deal. The result is that to approach Cherry and Miller (No 2) in terms of whether the courts can stretch the bounds of justiciability in a way that facilitates judicial scrutiny of the exercise of the prorogation prerogative is misconceived. It is misconceived because the legal issue at stake is not one upon which the non-justiciability doctrine can properly bite. That doctrine is concerned with limiting judicial involvement in the evaluation of the exercise of governmental powers whose use is capable of giving rise to questions that are unsuited, under the separation of powers, to analysis by courts on legal grounds. The justiciability doctrine is, however, logically incapable of biting upon questions about whether a given power exists and, if so, what its legal boundaries are. Questions about the purposes for which legal powers can and cannot lawfully be used are legal questions about the scope of such powers. It is questions of precisely that nature which are raised by the Miller (No 2) and Cherry cases. Consequently, the non-justiciability doctrine has no relevant application \u2014 and the suggestion by the divisional court that the \u201cpolitical\u201d nature of the issue shields it from judicial review is entirely wide of the mark. Whether the supreme court will be prepared to treat the matters before it as justiciable remains to be seen, but there is no good legal reason for treating them as non-justiciable. Pannick is turning to the third of his three main arguments, relating to justiciability. (See 10.41am.) This is probably the most important aspect of this case. If Pannick cannot convince the supreme court that the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue was justiciable, it will throw out the case, as the high court in London did. Pannick says examples of long prorogations given by the other side in this case relate to the first half of the 20th century, when conditions were very different. A judge puts it to Pannick that, if parliament wanted to hold the government to account in September, it could have held a no-confidence vote. Pannick says the executive is answerable to parliament on matters of politics, and answerable to the courts on matters of law. He says whether or not parliament wanted to hold a no-confidence vote in September is not relevant to the legality of what the PM did. Pannick describes prorogation as a \u201cpre-emptive strike\u201d that \u201ctakes parliament out of the game\u201d for the whole period of prorogation. He says the sovereignty of parliament is the principle underlying the whole constitution. But the PM\u2019s prorogation sought to undermine this sovereignty, he says. Pannick says the junior body in the constitution, the executive, cannot remove the power of the senior partner, parliament, to do its job, particularly when that job is scrutinising the executive. Pannick refers the court to what Lord Drummond Young said about the role of parliament in paragraph 99 of the Scottish judgment (pdf). This is what that paragraph says: Parliament has a second equally important function, namely that of holding the executive to account. The policies and actions of the government are subject to scrutiny in parliament by members of parliament. The United Kingdom operates by a system of representative democracy, and it is members of parliament, representing the interests of their constituents and the wider interests of the country, who are responsible for ensuring that the executive operates in the national interest. In particular, parliament is responsible for ensuring that the policies of the executive are properly considered in a democratic body, and that the actions of the executive are subject to critical scrutiny, with representatives of the government reporting on and explaining those actions. In this way parliament performs the fundamental role of protecting the country from the arbitrary exercise or abuse of executive power. The importance of the latter function is obvious, both in the abstract and in the light of the events during the 17th century that gave rise to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Pannick is still addressing the argument that a power can only be used for its proper purpose. He says, in constitutional terms, ministers are the junior partner. Parliament is the senior partner, he says. Back to the supreme court, and this is from David Allen Green, the FT\u2019s legal commentator. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani. Turning away from the supreme court for a moment, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, has been asked to explain to MPs the differences between Operation Yellowhammer documents. As the Press Association reports, Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, said the papers the committee received described a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d, whereas a version obtained by the Sunday Times was called a \u201cbase scenario\u201d. He urged Gove to share further documents about no-deal preparations with parliament. In a letter to Gove, Benn wrote: I would be grateful if you could explain why the document we received is entitled the \u2018reasonable worst case scenario\u2019, whereas it has been reported that a very similar if not identical version obtained by the Sunday Times was entitled the \u2018base scenario\u2019. Could you set out and explain any difference between the two documents. Benn also called on Gove to release papers, which he had told the committee he would, about revised assessments for a no-deal Brexit. Here is the text of Benn\u2019s letter. Benn could also have asked Gove why he described the Operation Yellowhammer assessment last week as a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d, when Boris Johnson, in his article in the Daily Telegraph yesterday (paywall), described it as \u201ca very worst case scenario\u201d. That implies something different. Lady Hale asks which bills were lost during prorogation. Pannick says he will find out. (There is a list here, on the parliament website. Look for the government bills in the 2017-19 session that did not get royal assent, If they did get royal assent, that is indicated by the purple circle with RA on it.) UPDATE: There is a good BBC article on the bills that were lost here. Pannick says the five-week prorogation meant parliament could not legislate during this period, and it could not ask questions of ministers during this period, or hold debates. A judge asked if there was any evidence that questions could not be asked. Pannick says that is how parliament operates; there are no questions during prorogation. He refers the court to a House of Commons briefing paper (pdf). And he reads out this extract from it. During prorogation parliament does not meet. This means that legislation cannot be considered or introduced by MPs and peers. Debates in the chambers or in Westminster Hall are not held, written and oral parliamentary questions cannot be asked, and committees do not carry out their usual business of inquiries and evidence-taking. This temporary suspension of activity is not normally significant, as a new session typically begins shortly thereafter. For a longer prorogation, however, this suspension of activity weakens the ability of parliamentarians to hold the government to account. From the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani Pannick is now addressing his second main argument - that it is \u201celementary in public law\u201d that a power can only be used for its proper purpose. He says this principle goes back to the 17th century. And he says this was backed up by a House of Lords judgment in 1968 - the Padfield case. Pannick says this judgment said ministers should not use powers under an act of parliaement to frustrate the purposes of the act. During the day I will be beefing up some of the earlier posts with direct quotes from the Press Association wires. If you want to read them, you may need to refresh the page. Pannick is summing up the first of his three main arguments. (See 10.41am.) He says the PM would not have gone for such a long prorogation if it had not been for his desire to frustrate parliament. This was an \u201cimproper motive\u201d, he says. Pannick says this case \u201ccries out\u201d for an answer from the PM in the form of a witness statement as to why he prorogued parliament. He says, without a witness statement, the court should infer that the desire to frustrate parliament was a factor in prorogation, he says. The courts in addition should be prepared in the circumstances to draw an inference from the absence of any evidence on the government\u2019s side by way of a witness statement. We submit that on all the material the court should conclude that, but for the prime minister\u2019s wish to avoid parliamentary control, he would not have recommended to Her Majesty a prorogation for a period of longer than five weeks, but he would have recommended a substantially shorter period ... as had occurred on every occasion ... in the last 40 years. Pannick says the PM has not made a witness statement giving his reasons for proroguing parliament. He refused, even though his motives were key to this case. Pannick says if the PM had provided a witness statement he would have been open to cross-examination. The production of a witness statement from the prime minister, or indeed anyone else, setting out the reasons for advising on a prorogation as long as five weeks would have had legal consequences. The legal consequences of such a witness statement would have been, almost inevitably, an application to cross-examine. The legal consequences would be that it would be a contempt of court, of course, for such a witness statement not to tell the truth. Our submission is that the documents [before the court] pose more questions than they answer, as the inner house [of the court of session in Scotland] has pointed out, and in any event the production of those documents is no substitute for evidence from the prime minister or someone on his behalf stating to the court in terms why he thought prorogation for the exceptionally long period of five weeks. Pannick says he wants to bring up two additional pieces of evidence that back up the idea that the PM prorogued parliament to frustrate it. He quotes from an interview Boris Johnson gave to Sky News after the prorogation announcement in which he said: The best way to leave with a deal is if our friends and partners over the channel don\u2019t think that Brexit can be blocked by parliament. And Pannick quotes from a BBC interview in which Johnson made the same point. Pannick says he is not interested in whether Johnson was right. He is citing these quotes as evidence of the PM\u2019s motive for proroguing parliament. Pannick says he has finished his introduction. Now he is turning to his first main argument \u2013 the facts of this case. (See 10.41am.) This is the argument that prorogation was designed to frustrate parliament. He says he backs the arguments made by the court of sessions on this. In particular, he refers the judges to this passage from the Scottish judgment. Here is an excerpt from one of the paragraphs in the judgment (pdf) that Pannick refers to. In neither the memorandum nor the prime minister\u2019s comments is any actual reason for the prorogation given other than a desire to begin a new session of parliament with, as is customary, a Queen\u2019s speech in which the government\u2019s legislative programme is set out. Reference is made to the fact that the legislative programme for the present session of parliament is nearly at an end, which would provide a valid reason for starting a new session. No attempt is made, however, to explain why a prorogation of five weeks is necessary at a time of acute national controversy. The critical complaint about the prorogation is not the fact that it occurred; short prorogation is regularly used to start new parliamentary sessions. The complaint rather relates to the length of the period during which parliament is to be prorogued, without any power to resume sitting during that period. Pannick now reads out the quote. Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Today progamme that the Queen had no discretion over prorogation. She had to do as the government advised, Rees-Mogg says. Pannick says he is making no criticism of the Queen in these proceedings. Pannick is now trying to find a quote from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, on the Today programme. But the judges cannot find it in their bundle of court documents, not all of which seem to be marked up in the same way. Pannick quotes paragraph 77 from the government\u2019s case (pdf). It says: There is no authority (domestic or decided in any country operating a Westminster system of government) which supports the proposition that the exercise of a power to prorogue the legislature is amenable to judicial review. Pannick says his case is that what the government is doing is exceptional. He says: No prime minister has abused his power in the manner in which we allege in at least the last 50 years. Pannick says the government has also argued that parliament did sit in September, and will sit again on 14 October. And during the September sitting it legislated, the government has argued (implying that prorogation did not frustrate parliament). But Pannick says it is not for the court to argue what parliament might or might not do when it is sitting. If the PM acted for an improper motive, it is not open to him to say now that his fear was mistaken. He says parliament may wish to impose further obligations on the period up to the EU summit in October. The issues in these proceedings are \u201cvery far from academic\u201d, he says. Pannick says the government has argued that there are legislative provisions that relate to parliamentary sittings, such as the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. He says these provisions do not invalidate the point that parliament should not be prorogued for an improper motive. Pannick turns to three arguments advanced by the government. The government is arguing that there are no legal rules relating to prorogation, only conventions. Pannick says he is not arguing that prorogation has to last for a maximum amount of time. He says what matters here is intention. And in this case the length of the prorogation suggests that the PM\u2019s motive was to \u201csilence parliament\u201d during this period. Lord Pannick QC is now speaking. He is speaking on behalf of Gina Miller. He says he wants to make three main arguments. First, he says, he is arguing that the prime minister opted for a five-week prorogation to limit the opportunity of parliament to frustrate his government\u2019s policies. Second, he says, he is arguing that it is \u201celementary in public law\u201d that a power can only be used for its proper purpose. That applies to prerogative powers as well, he says. He says for the executive to use a prerogative power to evade the scrutiny of parliament stands the principles of constitutional law on its head. He says he will argue that the government is arguing the \u201cconstitutional novelty\u201d that the powers of the legislature to scrutinise the executive are subject to powers exercised by the executive. And, third, he says, he will argue that the high court was wrong to argue that the decision to prorogue was not justiciable (subject to adjudication by the courts). He says he is not arguing how long prorogation should be. Lady Hale, the president of the supreme court, starts. She says this is a difficult case because senior judges in England and Scotland have reached different conclusions. She says this case will not decide how and when the UK leaves the EU. She says these appeals have been heard at very short notice. As usual, these proceedings are being live-streamed so that anybody who wishes to do so... can watch the arguments as they unfold. This is a very important aspect of open justice and we hope that it will enable many people to understand what these appeals are all about and, just as importantly, what they are not about. The 11 supreme court judges hearing the case are now taking their seats. That means all but one of the 12 judges on the court are here - an indication of how important this case is seen. The supreme court hearing is about to start. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. You can tell the supreme court hearing is important because David Dimbleby has turned up. According to the Press Association, the broadcasting veteran has been speaking to those queuing to get into the court hearing. Dimbleby told PA: I lived through Suez, the miners\u2019 strike, I lived through the poll tax debate and the trouble then. I lived through the Iraq demonstrations - I\u2019ve never seen the country so divided as this ... The prime minister is accused of lying to the Queen \u2013 let\u2019s put it bluntly \u2013 and getting parliament suspended without good reason and that\u2019s big potatoes, it has to be. To make sense of any court hearing, you need to have the relevant paperwork to hand. Here is a guide to the background information you need to make sense of today\u2019s proceedings. A good starting point is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s guide to the issues at stake. Judgments from the lower courts Courts in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already ruled on prorogation and Brexit. Last week the Scottish court of session ruled that prorogation was unlawful. What is really at issue today is whether the supreme court backs this decision or overturns it. Here is a summary of the Scottish judgment. And here is the 68-page full judgment (pdf). But the high court in London rejected a very similar claim, on the grounds that prorogation was a political matter and that it was not for the courts to decide whether or not it was proper. Here is a summary of that high court judgment (pdf). And here is the full judgment (pdf). On Thursday, the high court in Belfast also found in favour of the government, but on a challenge claiming a no-deal Brexit would breach the Good Friday agreement. You can read that judgment here (pdf), but it is not central to the supreme court case. Timetable ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has posted on Twitter a guide to what will be happening when during the three-day supreme court hearing. There is a bit more detail on the court sittings page on the supreme court\u2019s website. Written submissions The supreme court has also published the written submissions from the parties. Here is the 25-page one from Gina Miller (pdf). Here is the 93-page one from Joanna Cherry (pdf). Here is the 46-page one for the prime minister and the advocate general for Scotland (pdf). A revived Stormont assembly could be part of the Brexit solution, the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has said. In Dublin, where he met the deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, and a delegation from Sinn F\u00e9in, Smith was asked if Stormont would have a say on regulatory alignment on both sides of the border if Brexit talks collapsed. He replied: I think it would be very helpful if the assembly was back up and running. I think there are opportunities through the consent mechanisms from the Good Friday agreement and I think the assembly and executive up and running could be part of that. However, he declined to say whether the mechanism would require consensus from Stormont or a majority vote, which raises concerns that the Democratic Unionist party could block regulatory alignment. He went on: I think you are now drawing me into an area which I am not responsible for. The Brexit negotiations are being led by the prime minister. The Irish government has said a veto for any Stormont party would not be acceptable to the EU. It has also warned that a deal centring on agri-food alignment only would be doomed to failure as it only accounts for 30% of border trade and does not address other political and cultural issues in the backstop. Joanna Cherry, the Scottish National party MP who led the legal challenge against prorogation at the Scottish court of session, told BBC Radio Scotland this morning she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about winning at the supreme court. She said: I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that [the Scottish ruling] will stand. I think that Scotland\u2019s supreme court reached the right decision here for the right reasons and I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that at least a majority of the UK supreme court justices will follow. I think Scotland does have a unique constitutional tradition but I think the way in which Scotland\u2019s supreme court decided this case could easily be followed by the UK supreme court. And I think the heart of the matter was set out very well by Lord Drummond Young in Scotland when he said it\u2019s not the job of the courts to subject government to political scrutiny, that\u2019s the job of parliament, but where government prevents parliament from doing that job of scrutiny, the courts can step in to make sure that parliamentary democracy is restored. I think that\u2019s the heart of the Scottish judgment and I think that sets out the constitutional position as it should be and as I believe it is across the UK and that\u2019s why I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that the UK judges will follow the Scottish courts. Gina Miller, the businesswoman and campaigner who brought one of the cases being decided by the supreme court, has issued this statement ahead of today\u2019s hearing. As with my first case, my supreme court case is about pushing back against what is clearly a dramatic overreach of executive power. This is an issue that cuts across the political divides \u2013 and the arguments about the EU \u2013 and it has united remainers and leavers and people of all political complexions and none in opposition to it. The precedent [Boris] Johnson will set \u2013 if this is allowed to stand \u2013 is terrifying: any prime minister trying to push through a policy that is unpopular in the House and in the country at large would from now on simply be able to resort to prorogation. No one could ever have envisaged it being used in this way: this is a classic power grab. The reason given for the prorogation was patently untrue and, since then, the refusal to come clean or provide any of the disclosures we have asked for has compounded the deception. It is my view \u2013 and the view of a great many others \u2013 that Mr Johnson has gone too far and put our parliamentary sovereignty and democracy in grave danger by his actions. Here are some pictures from outside the supreme court. Given the wider context, Downing Street might have thought twice before deciding today was the day to send Robert Buckland, the attorney general, out into the studios to promote a plan for longer jail sentences for people who break the law. But that is what he was doing on the Today programme when he refused to rule out Boris Johnson suspending parliament for a second time before the Brexit deadline on 31 October. Asked if it was even \u201cremotely conceivable\u201d that Johnson might suspend (prorogue, to use the technical term) parliament again (MPs are due to return on 14 October), Buckland did not say no. Instead he replied: Well, you know, it feels in politics, Harold Wilson said a week is a long time in politics, it seems like an hour is a long time in politics at the moment. For me to sit here and imagine what might happen at the end of October, I think, is idle. What I do know is, if we are able to, we will have a Queen\u2019s speech in mid-October, there will be debate during that time, and a vote as well, perhaps a series of votes. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday, Johnson himself also refused to rule out suspending parliament again when asked directly to do so. Joe Moor, who was the director of legislative affairs at Downing Street when Theresa May was prime minister, explained in an article in the Sunday Telegraph two days ago (paywall), that if the government wins the supreme court case starting today, it would be possible for Johnson to suspend parliament again after it returns on 14 October, at least until 6 November. It would have to be sitting on those two days because of an amendment passed to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act, Moor explained. All of which is why today\u2019s supreme court hearing is so important. Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s overnight preview story. And here is his analysis of the issues at stake. There is a live feed of the hearing, so I will be covering it in detail. Undoubtedly it is likely to be heavy going \u2013 the supreme court is not the Old Bailey, and if you are not interested in arcane points of constitutional law, it might be a day to tune into the Lib Dem conference instead \u2013 but this is a case that could reset the boundaries between parliament and the executive, and curtail or expand Johnson\u2019s Brexit options, so it is clearly of the utmost importance. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 10.30am: The supreme court begins the three-day hearing to decide whether Johnson\u2019s lengthy suspension (prorogation, to use the technical term) of parliament was unlawful. 2.10pm: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, winds up her party conference with her keynote speech. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will mostly be focusing on the supreme court hearing. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The Liberal Democrats\u2019 policy offers a welcome return to representative democracy, and an end to the mania for referenda. Let the people decide, yes, but in a general election. Christopher Fryer London \u2022 \u201cThe Lib Dems \u2026 home to Keynes and Beveridge?\u201d No, I don\u2019t think so. The Liberal Democrats party came into existence in 1989. Its only taste of power since then would have Keynes and Beveridge turning in their graves. Colin Challen Scarborough \u2022 The Lib Dems are often stereotyped as wishy-washy fence-sitters, but we have been consistent as the pro-remain party from the beginning. Everyone knows that. If we came to power on that manifesto it would be a clear mandate to put an end to Brexit by revoking article 50. Stephanie Bailey Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset \u2022 Seeing my suggestions for Labour (Letters, 10 September) \u2013 general election, no referendum, back remain \u2013 cynically taken over by the Liberal Democrats, I think I prefer Labour\u2019s honest \u201cmuddle\u201d after all!

An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit negotiators have so far only presented the EU with a draft of the withdrawal agreement with the backstop scrubbed out, UK government sources have confirmed. In a move that has caused tensions with EU leaders, Johnson\u2019s team are refusing to put forward a written proposal to Brussels at this stage for fear it will be rejected out of hand or publicly rubbished. Instead, they want to wait until almost the last minute before the October summit before presenting a plan to the EU, with just two weeks before the UK is due to leave the bloc. The UK government source said the two sides had debated alternatives to the backstop in written discussion documents \u2013 such as an all-Ireland regulatory zone and customs checks away from the border \u2013 but they would not be putting forward a legal text to the EU at this stage. There have been reports that David Frost, the UK\u2019s lead negotiator, is keeping a plan locked safe in his briefcase but the wording has not been shared with Brussels. Frustration with the UK\u2019s approach broke into the open on Monday as Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, gave a press conference next to an empty podium following a meeting with Johnson, who refused to take part because of loud protests nearby. Bettel said the UK government needed to put on paper an alternative to the Irish backstop, and appeared to suggest that party political considerations might be standing in the way. \u201cI told him: \u2018I hear a lot but I don\u2019t read a lot.\u2019 If they want to discuss anything we need to have it written [down] \u2026 Don\u2019t put the blame on us because they don\u2019t know how to get out of the situation they put themselves in,\u201d Bettel said. As the chaotic scenes were played out, the European commission issued a statement disclosing that its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had told the prime minister it was his responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions and that \u201csuch proposals have not yet been made\u201d. Johnson has brushed off the Luxembourg incident with a claim that he is still working towards a deal and believes EU leaders will want to strike an agreement because they have had a \u201cbellyful\u201d of Brexit. He spoke to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on Tuesday morning, agreeing to have further discussions with her in New York at the UN general assembly next week. There are only three days left until the end of the 30-day deadline Merkel gave Johnson last month to come up with alternative solutions to remove the need for a backstop, which Eurosceptics in parliament refuse to vote for because it could keep the UK indefinitely in a customs union. Johnson is also likely to meet Donald Tusk, the European council president, at the UN conference and No 10 hopes that some progress towards a deal could be made at that summit. However, many in Brussels are sceptical there is enough time left to do a deal. It is just one month before the crucial EU summit on 17 October, where Johnson hopes to secure a deal, and six weeks before the UK is due to leave on 31 October unless it requests an extension. Johnson is mandated by the UK parliament to seek a three-month extension if he does not strike a Brexit deal by then. He has insisted he will not do this but has not set out how he would avoid such an outcome. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, refused on Tuesday to rule out a second prorogation as part of No 10\u2019s tactics to achieve a no-deal Brexit. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the current suspension of parliament could happen again, Buckland said: \u201cHarold Wilson said a week is a long time in politics. It seems like an hour is a long time in politics at the moment. \u201cFor me to sit here and imagine what might happen at the end of October, I think, is idle. What I do know, if we are able to, we will have a Queen\u2019s speech in mid-October, there will be debate during that time and a vote as well, and perhaps a series of votes. \u201cParliament has already shown its power. It had a week in September where it made pretty significant legislation. I think the idea that somehow parliament has been prevented from having its voice doesn\u2019t seem to be borne out by events, frankly.\u201d",

For there is nothing inevitable about them becoming casualties of Brexit, even now; in any sensibly negotiated deal to leave, their rights could be protected, and so could those of EU citizens here. Their chronic anxiety is a direct consequence of Johnson\u2019s decision to put no deal \u2013 and with it no visible safety net \u2013 back on the table. Some may simply choose to come home to Britain, but for others it won\u2019t be that easy. Those who married EU citizens worry about whether their partners would be allowed in, or whether families would be separated at the border. And all of them are trying to make decisions in the dark, still unsure whether in six weeks\u2019 time they will be facing utter chaos, a smooth transition period with their rights intact, or just another extension and more uncertainty. In the circumstances, the scandal isn\u2019t that a handful of protesters spoilt Johnson\u2019s press conference, or that Bettel\u2019s handling of it was ungracious. It\u2019s that not enough people are listening to what these protesters were actually trying to say. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

You can also catch our latest Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories Plot twists galore, but \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 nothing you might describe as actual progress. A Scottish appeal court ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful \u2013 but did not order MPs to return. The government was forced to release its secret Operation Yellowhammer \u201cplanning assumptions\u201d for a no-deal Brexit, which warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain\u2019s streets. Johnson continued to insist \u201chuge progress\u201d was being made \u2013 although No 10 played down hopes of a breakthrough involving an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture which it thinks could help replace the backstop, and Michel Barnier said there were \u201cno grounds\u201d for formally re-opening talks. Increasingly alarmed at the possibility that the PM might try to break the law by forcing a no deal, however, a cross-party group of MPs looked at bringing back a version of Theresa May\u2019s deal, plus a vote on a second referendum, in late October. And the outgoing Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, warned that he was prepared to rip up the parliamentary rulebook to stop any illegal attempt by the prime minister to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Johnson did, at least, meet the outgoing president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. It did not go well. Before heading to Luxembourg, the PM compared himself to the Incredible Hulk, throwing off the shackles of the EU. Despite EU officials repeatedly insisting they had seen no concrete British proposals whatsoever on alternatives to the backstop, the foreign secretary, Domic Raab, said the bloc had heard enough and was indulging in \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d. Johnson told Juncker the UK would not ask for a further Brexit extension and would not accept one if the EU offered it \u2013 nor would it request any extension to the EU transition period beyond December 2020 if he got a Brexit deal. Unfortunately, the PM was then humiliated by his Luxembourg counterpart, Xavier Bettel, who went ahead with a planned joint press conference that Johnson dodged because of protesters \u2013 and savaged Johnson\u2019s Brexit approach. All eyes, meanwhile, are on 11 supreme court judges who this week will hear the politically charged claim that the PM acted unlawfully in advising the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks in order to stifle debate over the Brexit crisis. Some people worry that if the government wins, Johnson may even decide to suspend parliament for a second time when it returns on 14 October. What next Who knows? But four main scenarios seem to present themselves: Unlikely as it may seem, Johnson could still get a deal, probably based around a border in the Irish sea. He would find getting it through parliament very hard, but perhaps not impossible, helped maybe by Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies. He could decide to break his promise, request an extension and then immediately demand an election, counting on a fiercely anti-EU, people-versus-parliament campaign to see him through. He could, theoretically at least, go for no deal on 31 October, testing or even ignoring the law. Early elections would follow, with the PM trusting that with Brexit delivered, the Brexit party would be no more \u2013 and that no deal would not be too catastrophic. Or he could resign or be pushed out. Rather than the divisive Jeremy Corbyn, a more neutral figure (Ken Clarke?) might then head up a temporary government whose sole purpose would be to ask the EU for an extension, with elections to follow. Best of the rest EU citizens feel safer in Scotland than in England, report says. David Cameron: Johnson said leave campaign would lose minutes before backing it. Brexit uncertainty triggers first September fall in house prices since 2010. Britain is facing its most prolonged investment slump in 17 years. Only half of UK universities are ready for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 study. Labour members to push for anti-Brexit stance at conference. Five things we learned from David Cameron\u2019s memoir. Nicky Morgan says she would vote to remain in the EU in a second referendum. Hopes of a clean break with the EU are nonsense, says ex-Brexit official. Criminal gangs will cash in on no-deal Brexit, police warn. MPs condemn \u2018misleading\u2019 no-deal Brexit publicity campaign. Anti-Brexiters file new legal challenge to force article 50 extension. Retailers: fruit, vegetables and wine will be scarce and costly under no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson says it is \u2018absolutely\u2019 not true he misled Queen over prorogation. Lib Dems pledge to revoke Brexit without referendum. Top comment In the Guardian, Matthew d\u2019Ancona says Boris Johnson\u2019s invocation of the Incredible Hulk was apt \u2013 his behaviour is monstrous: During the leadership contest, Johnson said that the chances of no deal were a \u201cmillion to one against\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The supreme court hearing into whether Boris Johnson unlawfully shut down parliament is likely to rule against the prime minister, the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has said. Eleven judges are due to begin a hearing on Tuesday at the court in central London that Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks in the run-up to Brexit was not constitutional and stifled debate. \u201cI think the supreme court is highly likely, or certainly, let\u2019s put it this way, equally likely to follow in the direction of the highest court in Scotland,\u201d the Labour peer told the Radio 4 Today programme before the hearing. A case heard in Scotland on 11 September brought by 75 opposition MPs and peers found that the prime minister had acted unlawfully. Another case heard in the high court of England and Wales deemed the issue \u201cpolitical\u201d and non-justiciable. Appeals to both decisions will be heard by the supreme court with a decision due on Thursday. Before the hearing scores of protesters opposing the suspension of parliament gathered outside the supreme court. Among the demonstrators was a man carrying a sign describing himself as \u201cThe Incredible Sulk\u201d in reference to Johnson comparing himself to the Marvel comic character Hulk. Others carried signs declaring: \u201cDefend Democracy,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Silence Our MP,\u201d \u201cReopen Parliament\u201d and \u201cThey Misled The Queen.\u201d Lady Chakrabarti said: \u201cThere are two issues here. The first is the technical issue of justiciable \u2013 is the court entitled to be referee when there\u2019s a dispute of this kind between parliament and government? \u201cOnce you\u2019ve dealt with that hurdle you go on to decide whether on the facts of this case, Boris Johnson and his chums were abusive. Whether they abused their prerogative power, to suspend parliament, to shut it down in this way.\u201d The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told the BBC he backed prorogation and the government would argue in court that it was a \u201cproper course\u201d to take. In an attempt to distance himself from a Downing Street source who cast doubt on the Scottish judiciary\u2019s independence, he lavished praise on the country\u2019s judges. Buckland said: \u201cThey are world-class. They are world-leading. Let them do their job. And I want to make sure whatever the decision is of the supreme court, we will respect the robust independence of our judiciary.\u201d Asked if he would respect the result, after Johnson and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, both said they would want to review any decision that went against them, Buckland said: \u201cThe principle of respecting the independence of our judiciary is one that runs right through our system and we must do that in this instance.\u201d The former supreme court justice Jonathan Sumption told BBC Newsnight he thought the government ought to win but suggested judges might be outraged at Johnson\u2019s approach.

She also rubbished the shift by the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, to back stopping Brexit entirely by revoking article 50, describing it as illiberal and adding that she was dumbfounded a pressure group idea had become party policy.
