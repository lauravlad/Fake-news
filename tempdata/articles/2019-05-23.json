An analysis of her options</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For the last 24 hours the dominant story at Westminster has been about how Theresa May is under increasing pressure to resign. But quite what is meant by resign is not always clear (sometimes even to those people calling for it). It is worth clarifying the options, not least because that helps to shed light on what may, or may not, happen when May meets Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, to discuss her future tomorrow.</p> <p>First, it is important to remember that <strong>May has two important jobs</strong>; she is leader of the Conservative party and prime minister. The two, of course, are connected, but the current talk is about May resigning as Tory leader, triggering a leadership contest which would result in a new leader being elected who would then replace her as prime minister.</p> <p>Theoretically May could resign as prime minister immediately. But prime ministers are not meant to resign until it is obvious who the Queen should appoint as a successor and, although there has been some talk of David Lidington taking over as an interim prime minister, there is no such job constitutionally, it is almost impossible to see what purpose this would serve, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeWParker/status/1131560363147833346\">the idea is being discounted in government circles.</a></p> <p>And, second, to place the current events in context, you need to recall that <strong>we have already had three resignation-related announcements from May already.</strong></p> <p>1) In December last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/12/theresa-may-defeats-leadership-challenge-by-83-votes\"><strong>May announced that she would resign before the general election due in 2022.</strong> </a>She made the promise to Tories in private to help boost her chances in a no-confidence ballot, which she subsequently won. Whether she would resign ahead of the election if it took place before 2022 was left unresolved.</p> <p>2) In March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/theresa-may-to-resign-before-next-phase-of-brexit\"><strong>May announced that she would resign before the next phase of the Brexit negotiation started.</strong></a> She delivered the pledge, again at a private meeting of Tory MPs, ahead of the third vote on her Brexit deal. It was taken to mean she would go by the summer, assuming her deal was passed. What would happen if her deal was not passed was left unresolved, although subsequently the Conservative 1922 Committee said she needed to clarify this.</p> <p>3) Last week, at her meeting with the executive of the 1922 Committee, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/16/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-1922-faces-showdown-with-1922-committee-over-timetable-for-her-resignation-live-news?page=with:block-5cdd6c6d8f08ea3978d87d4b#block-5cdd6c6d8f08ea3978d87d4b\">May agreed to set a date for her departure after the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab),</a> </strong>which at that point the government was saying would take place on Friday 7 June at the latest. She did not say what the date would be, but the implication was that it would be soon after that 7 June deadline.</p> <p>So, what are<strong> her options for tomorrow. </strong>Assuming that she is not going to do something very drastic, like resign immediately as prime minister, there are three obvious options.</p> <p>1) She could announce that she is resigning as Conservative leader with immediate effect. This would not stop her serving as prime minister, but it would mean the Conservative party establishment \u2013 the 1922 Committee and the Conservative party board \u2013 would be able to set the timetable for the leadership contest. The key point about this is that May would no longer be in charge of determining when she left office because that would be whenever the contest ended.</p> <p>2) She could announce that she intended to quit by a specific date in the future; ie, she could draft a post-dated resignation letter. In practice this would have much the same impact \u2013 the Conservative party would be able to start drawing up the timetable for the contest \u2013 but this would leave May with the option of changing her mind in the future. To be plausible she would probably have to commit to going by about Monday 10 June <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1131313196046925824\">(one date set as a possible deadline),</a> but Tories might be worried about the prospect of her going back on her promise.</p> <p>3) She could set a deadline for making a firm announcement. Given May\u2019s habit of postponing difficult decisions, you can see why this might appeal. But this would just be a deadline for a deadline, and little more than what she agreed with the 1922 Committee last week. It is hard to see how the committee would view this acceptable, and this would probably trigger a new no-confidence vote. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/23/european-elections-uk-goes-to-the-poll-as-pressure-continues-on-may-to-resign-live-news?page=with:block-5ce66eae8f08ad67f1a7f882#block-5ce66eae8f08ad67f1a7f882\">11.02am.)</a></p> <p>As I write, it is not obvious what May will do \u2013 which might be a symptom of journalistic uselessness, but which might also be because those around her do not know because May herself is not sure or hasn\u2019t decided.</p> <p>It is also the case that May\u2019s fate is tied up with the fate of the Wab. If she thinks she can resurrect it, she will be reluctant to fire the starting gun on the leadership contest. If she can\u2019t, there is no good reason to postpone the inevitable.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-23T16:22:16.232Z\">at 5.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ce6b8628f0807b455f86f91\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-23T15:13:38.056Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Cat Smith</strong>, the shadow minister for voter engagement, has said the government is to blame for EU nationals having problems voting.

They want her to resign as Conservative party leader, so that the party can start the leadership contest. It is widely agreed that she will stay as PM until the party has elected a new leader, which would not be until the end of July at the earliest. As prime minister, she cannot resign until she is in a position to tell the Queen who she should appoint as a successor.</p> <p> (Well, in theory she could, but it would not be the done thing ...)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-23T09:15:30.817Z\">at 10.15am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ce662848f08ad67f1a7f7df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-23T09:06:37.038Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was no sign of Andrea Leadsom outside her Westminster home on Thursday morning, the Press Association reports.

      "bodyText": "Britons have been voting in European elections that were never expected to happen in the United Kingdom because the UK was supposed to be out of the EU by now. Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit party is expected to win by a huge margin, in a result that will probably over-shadow other considerations in the forthcoming leadership contest, but the results will not be out until Sunday night. Opposition parties have condemned the way some EU nationals have been prevented from voting because of administrative errors by councils. (See 4.13pm, 5.11pm and 5.50pm.) Theresa May will agree tomorrow to the Conservative leadership contest to choose her successor starting on Monday 10 June, ITV\u2019s Robert Peston is reporting. That\u2019s all from me for tonight - and until Monday 3 June. I\u2019ll be away over half-term. Colleagues will be looking after the blog tomorrow, on Sunday night and next week. Thanks for the comments. This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. So it\u2019s option 2. (See 4.42pm.) The Lib Dems have also joined those criticising the way some EU nationals have been prevented from voting. This is from their home affairs spokesman, Sir Ed Davey. It is an utter disgrace that so many EU citizens have been unable to vote in these historic elections. This feels like a deliberate attempt by the Conservatives to silence the voices of our fellow Europeans. Here are some lines on Theresa May\u2019s meetings earlier with Sajid Javid, the home secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, both of whom have difficulty supporting the EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab). They are from my colleague Rowena Mason, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby and the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. On the general issue of EU citizens being denied a vote today, Joanna Cherry, SNP spokesperson for justice and home affairs, said she was shocked and saddened by the \u201cdistress\u201d of EU citizens denied a vote today. I have been shocked, but sadly not surprised, by the reports coming in from across the country of electors being told they cannot take part in today\u2019s vote. Along with other parliamentary colleagues I have been warning the government about this since they faced up the fact that the UK would need to contest these elections. Yesterday at PMQs I asked prime minister to user her office to sort this out and make sure the UC1 form was available at polling stations. Her high-handed and dismissive response was typical of the Tory government\u2019s approach to the rights of EU citizens. It is particularly egregious to hear of some Irish citizens who do not need to complete this form at all being are also turned away today as well. This process has gone badly wrong. There is no escaping \u201cMr Stop Brexit\u201d, aka the campaigner Steve Bray ... The German couple who were denied a vote in the European parliament elections at the polling station this morning despite sending in their paperwork to register three weeks ago (see 12.47pm) have been contacted by Tower Hamlets council to tell them they can vote, after all. In an extraordinary development the London borough council checked the CCTV footage at their offices for 2 May, the day Kat Sellner and Moritz Valero said they handed in their forms. They have spent the last two days trying to persuade the council that it was their mistake that they had not received a ballot paper. When they arrived at the polling station on the Isle of Dogs this morning they found their name was crossed off and were put in touch with the council again who told their paperwork didn\u2019t arrive until 16 May, two weeks after the deadline. In a phone call videoed by the Guardian they insisted again that was a council mistake and they would not be \u201csilenced\u201d. They warned they would make a freedom of information request for CCTV footage of 2 May. Six hours later Tower Hamlets said they had phoned them with the \u201cgood news\u201d. They had checked the CCTV footage and agreed that it was their mistake and told them could vote. SNP MP Joanna Cherry who asked Theresa May yesterday over the general administrative failings to ensure EU citizens could vote today said it was a \u201cgrave and serious error\u201d in electoral procedures. She said May had been \u201cdismissive\u201d when she had asked her to ensure EU citizens could vote but she would not be letting the matter rest. This is from Simon Cox, an immigration lawyer, for anyone who thinks their name has been left off the electoral role through a council error. Theresa May arrived to vote at a polling station in Sonning, Berkshire, shortly after 4pm. Although she stopped to say hello to schoolchildren in the playground next to Sonning C of E Primary school, Theresa May was rather less communicative with reporters and she kept a tight-lipped smile when asked by members of the press whether she was losing her grip on ministers. After voting the PM and husband, Philip May, quickly strode back to a waiting car. For the last 24 hours the dominant story at Westminster has been about how Theresa May is under increasing pressure to resign. But quite what is meant by resign is not always clear (sometimes even to those people calling for it). It is worth clarifying the options, not least because that helps to shed light on what may, or may not, happen when May meets Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, to discuss her future tomorrow. First, it is important to remember that May has two important jobs; she is leader of the Conservative party and prime minister. The two, of course, are connected, but the current talk is about May resigning as Tory leader, triggering a leadership contest which would result in a new leader being elected who would then replace her as prime minister. Theoretically May could resign as prime minister immediately. But prime ministers are not meant to resign until it is obvious who the Queen should appoint as a successor and, although there has been some talk of David Lidington taking over as an interim prime minister, there is no such job constitutionally, it is almost impossible to see what purpose this would serve, and the idea is being discounted in government circles. And, second, to place the current events in context, you need to recall that we have already had three resignation-related announcements from May already. 1) In December last year May announced that she would resign before the general election due in 2022. She made the promise to Tories in private to help boost her chances in a no-confidence ballot, which she subsequently won. Whether she would resign ahead of the election if it took place before 2022 was left unresolved. 2) In March May announced that she would resign before the next phase of the Brexit negotiation started. She delivered the pledge, again at a private meeting of Tory MPs, ahead of the third vote on her Brexit deal. It was taken to mean she would go by the summer, assuming her deal was passed. What would happen if her deal was not passed was left unresolved, although subsequently the Conservative 1922 Committee said she needed to clarify this. 3) Last week, at her meeting with the executive of the 1922 Committee, May agreed to set a date for her departure after the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab), which at that point the government was saying would take place on Friday 7 June at the latest. She did not say what the date would be, but the implication was that it would be soon after that 7 June deadline. So, what are her options for tomorrow. Assuming that she is not going to do something very drastic, like resign immediately as prime minister, there are three obvious options. 1) She could announce that she is resigning as Conservative leader with immediate effect. This would not stop her serving as prime minister, but it would mean the Conservative party establishment \u2013 the 1922 Committee and the Conservative party board \u2013 would be able to set the timetable for the leadership contest. The key point about this is that May would no longer be in charge of determining when she left office because that would be whenever the contest ended. 2) She could announce that she intended to quit by a specific date in the future; ie, she could draft a post-dated resignation letter. In practice this would have much the same impact \u2013 the Conservative party would be able to start drawing up the timetable for the contest \u2013 but this would leave May with the option of changing her mind in the future. To be plausible she would probably have to commit to going by about Monday 10 June (one date set as a possible deadline), but Tories might be worried about the prospect of her going back on her promise. 3) She could set a deadline for making a firm announcement. Given May\u2019s habit of postponing difficult decisions, you can see why this might appeal. But this would just be a deadline for a deadline, and little more than what she agreed with the 1922 Committee last week. It is hard to see how the committee would view this acceptable, and this would probably trigger a new no-confidence vote. (See 11.02am.) As I write, it is not obvious what May will do \u2013 which might be a symptom of journalistic uselessness, but which might also be because those around her do not know because May herself is not sure or hasn\u2019t decided. It is also the case that May\u2019s fate is tied up with the fate of the Wab. If she thinks she can resurrect it, she will be reluctant to fire the starting gun on the leadership contest. If she can\u2019t, there is no good reason to postpone the inevitable. Cat Smith, the shadow minister for voter engagement, has said the government is to blame for EU nationals having problems voting. In a statement she said: We repeatedly warned the government that European citizens living in the UK would be denied their right to vote because of its incompetent approach to Brexit. From day one, the Tories have buried their heads in the sand about these elections, even at the eleventh hour when it was clear that the government\u2019s botched Brexit deal would not pass. This has caused havoc for electoral administrators tasked with delivering a national poll with extremely short notice. Labour pointed out on multiple occasions that EU citizens needed more time to return their declaration forms to ensure they can exercise their democratic right to vote. The government is solely to blame for this chaos. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, says it it outrageous that EU nationals are being denied the right to vote. Here is a variant on #dogsatpollingstations. This is from the3million, the campaign representing EU nationals in the UK, for any EU nationals who have been denied a vote today. Gavin Williamson, the former defence secretary, has formally announced that he is backing Boris Johnson for next Conservative leader. He told his local paper, the Express &amp; Star: I think he\u2019s the best candidate. He\u2019s the one who can deliver change for both the Conservative Party and the country. I will be enthusiastically backing him and very much hope I can play a small role in making sure that his name is the one that the party chooses as leader. The bottom line is that the only person who can deliver Brexit and defeat Labour is Boris Johnson. The reference to playing \u201ca small role\u201d in the Johnson campaign will provoke wry smile in Tory circles. Williamson was not a great success as defence secretary, but he was rated as a chief whip and some people regard him as the best backroom fixer/organiser in the Conservative party. He played a leading role in Theresa May\u2019s campaign in 2016. His endorsement will be valuable to Johnson, not just because of the skills he can bring to the campaign, but because he is seen as someone with a track record for hitching up with the winning candidate. After Williamson, other Tories may feel more inclined to join the bandwagon too. Michael Gove, the Brexiter environment secretary, has been tweeting his support for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, the lead Conservative candidate in the south east region. Gove says Hannan has done more than anyone \u201cto ensure the UK becomes an independent nation again\u201d (which may come as a surprise to anyone who thought it wasn\u2019t an independent nation). An army veteran in his 80s acting as a teller for the Brexit party had a milkshake thrown over him outside a polling station in Aldershot, the Telegraph reports. The broadcaster Piers Morgan is among those speaking up for him on Twitter. It wouldn\u2019t be a proper election without #dogsatpollingstations. Here is a selection that have caught my eye. Here is the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart commenting on the government\u2019s announcement that it cannot confirm that the EU withdrawal agreement bill second reading will go ahead in the first week of June. (See 11.22am.) He said: The decision to shelve the damaging withdrawal agreement bill has confirmed beyond any doubt that this Tory government is in a state of paralysis, completely dysfunctional and unable to get on with the day job. Rather than seeking a way to end the Brexit impasse, the Tories have instead kicked the can further down the road. This is the final humiliation for Theresa May, who surely cannot remain in office much longer. Theresa May has bowed to pressure from backbenchers and cabinet ministers and abandoned plans to publish her controversial EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab) tomorrow. She triggered a ferocious backlash in her party on Tuesday when she announced that the bill would include plans to give MPs a vote on holding a second referendum and on a temporary customs union, and this has intensified calls for her to announce that she will resign. Yesterday No 10 said the bill would be published on Friday, and that it would get its second reading vote in the week beginning Monday 3 June. But today the government announced that publication has been delayed until the first week of June, and a minister had to admit that it is now possible that the second reading won\u2019t take place that week after all. (See 11.22am.) The news has heightened speculation that the bill will eventually be abandoned, although May is in talks with cabinet colleagues about whether it could be rescued via a rewrite. The fate of the bill is inextricably linked to her survival as prime minister because last week she agreed with the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee to postpone any announcement about when she will stand down until after the bill\u2019s second reading. Any decision to kill the bill would leave her with no excuse not to resign as Conservative leader immediately, triggering the leadership contest that will choose her successor as PM. May has appointed Mel Stride as leader of the Commons in a mini reshuffle prompted by the resignation yesterday of Andrea Leadsom. (See 1.18pm.) Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested that the UK is drifting towards another Brexit extension in October as he criticised MPs for prioritising the prime minister\u2019s removal over finding agreement on a Brexit deal. A disturbing picture is emerging of EU citizens in the UK being denied their democratic right to vote in the European parliament elections taking place today because of administrative errors by local councils. Boris Johnson lied when he repeatedly claimed during the 2016 referendum on EU membership that the UK sent \u00a3350m a week to Brussels, lawyers attempting to launch a private prosecution of the MP have told a court. Peter Hain, the Labour peer who used parliamentary privilege to accuse Sir Philip Green of being an abusive bully, has said he did so after hearing \u201chorrible\u201d claims of repeated sexual assaults resulting in hundreds of grievance cases. Theresa May has left Downing Street and is heading for her Maidenhead constituency, the Press Association reports. The appointment of Mel Stride to the cabinet, as the new leader of the Commons, will be seen as a discreet boost to Michael Gove, the environment secretary, who is a candidate to succeed Theresa May. Stride has reportedly been campaigning on behalf of Gove although, according to a recent report in the Sunday Times (paywall), he has been so discreet about it that some MPs got the impression he was running himself. Here is an extract from a story Gabriel Pogrund and Tim Shipman wrote earlier this year. Mel Stride, a Treasury minister, has hosted dinners at his home in recent weeks during which he has made the case for Gove, gathering a cadre of supporters from different wings of the party should he decide to run. The role of Stride, who runs the Deep Blue group of traditional Tories, as a cheerleader for Gove was so shrouded in secrecy that some MPs believed he was running for leader himself. Stride further muddied the waters by hosting a dinner a week ago on behalf of the leadership team of Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary. Downing Street has just announced Mel Stride, the Treasury minister, will become leader of the Commons. Jesse Norman, the transport minister, will replace Stride as financial secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general. Michael Ellis, a culture minister, replaces Norman as transport minister. And Rebecca Pow joins the government, replacing Ellis as culture minister. Margaritis Schinas, the European commission\u2019s chief spokesman, has posted a tweet saying that a video promoted by a pro-unionist Twitter account from Northern Ireland contains a quote falsely attributed to Martin Selmayr, the secretary general of the EU Commission. The video claims Selmayr said Northern Ireland was \u201cthe price to pay for Brexit\u201d. Selmary has denied saying that, and Schinas said the claim was being \u201cspread maliciously\u201d. The Twitter account has no name attached to it and just describes itself as \u201cpromoting the positive benefits of NI\u2019s membership of the UK\u201d. During an urgent question in the Commons earlier Caroline Dinenage, the care minister, apologised on behalf of the NHS for the abuse of people with learning disabilities and autism at the specialist hospital Whorlton Hall. The abuses were exposed in a harrowing report by an undercover reporter working for the BBC\u2019s Panorama which has led to a police investigation, 16 staff being suspended and the hospital being closed. Dinenage said: On behalf of the health and care system, I am deeply sorry that this has happened. She said the actions revealed by the Panorama programme were \u201cquite simply appalling\u201d and that the government would look at whether criminality was involved, whether the regulatory framework was working and whether oversight was fit for purpose. She told MPs: Where it is essential that somebody has to be supported at distance from their home, we will make sure that those arrangements are supervised. We won\u2019t tolerate having people out of sight and out of mind. Where someone with a learning disability or an autistic person has to be an inpatient out of area, they will be now visited every six weeks if they are a child or every eight weeks if they are an adult. There are a lot of reports on social media of EU nationals being denied a vote in today\u2019s European elections. EU nationals can vote in the UK in European elections. They have to register, like UK nationals. But they also have to fill in a form, known as the UC1 or EC6 form, saying they will only be voting in the UK, and not in other EU countries. Local authorities have to process these forms. But, as my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reported on Tuesday, there have been reports that in some areas this has not been happening properly. Lisa has met EU nationals today being denied the right to vote and she has asked people with similar stories to get in touch. The pro-European campaigner Gina Miller is also asking people affected to get in touch. And on Twitter some people are sharing their experiences using the hashtag #DeniedMyVote. Here is an example, from Agata Patyna, a barrister. The Evening Standard has more examples here. Margot James, the digital minister, has said Theresa May is being hounded out of office. Speaking to the Press Association after an event in London, she said: It\u2019s all very regrettable but she\u2019s being hounded out of office because parliament will not make a decision and the parties just have an inability to compromise. But in the end there\u2019s got to be a compromise. Theresa May is due to appoint a new leader of the Commons today, Number 10 has said. This is what Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, said in the chamber earlier about the government\u2019s decision not to publish the EU withdrawal agreement bill tomorrow. (See 11.22am.) She said: Yesterday the prime minister told the house that the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill would be in the week commencing June 3rd, now we hear it\u2019s not, so in less than 24 hours the prime minister has broken her word. This is yet another broken promise by the prime minister on Brexit. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman told journalists at the morning lobby briefing that Theresa May would be meeting cabinet colleagues to discuss the EU withdrawal agreement bill today, the Press Association reports. \u201cThe prime minister is listening to her colleagues about the bill and will be having further discussions,\u201d he said. He could not say when the bill would be published and refused to be drawn on speculation about May\u2019s future as PM. The spokesman also confirmed that US president Donald Trump\u2019s state visit would go ahead in June. And these are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner. In response to a question from Labour\u2019s Valerie Vaz, Mark Spencer, the government whip, has just clarified two points about the EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab). Spencer said the Wab would now be published in the week beginning Monday 3 June. That is the second time this week it has been postponed. Yesterday morning Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said it would be published later that day. Then, in the afternoon, Theresa May said it would be published tomorrow. Spencer\u2019s admission that publication has been postponed until June will increase suspicions that, in practice, it will never be published at all. May is under huge pressure to abandon the bill because it is so unpopular with backbenchers and ministers, and seems doomed to defeat. Spencer said that the government was hoping to hold the second reading debate of the Wab on Friday 7 June but that it could not get announcement yet because it could not get agreement through \u201cthe usual channels\u201d. That implies Labour are refusing to agree to get the Commons to sit on Friday when it was meant to be in recess. Mark Spencer, a government whip, is now announcing the government business in the Commons. He has just announced the business for the week beginning Monday 3 June. Although Downing Street has said the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab) would take place that week, and Tory MPs were told yesterday that that would happen on Friday 7 June, Spencer did not include the Wab in the list of business for that week. And he said the house would not be sitting on the Friday. He said the government would \u201cupdate the house on the publication and introduction of the withdrawal agreement bill on our return from the Whit Sunday recess [on Tuesday 4 June]\u201d. That implies the Wab will not be published tomorrow, as Theresa May said it would. Ministers have shelved their plans to debate the EU withdrawal agreement bill in the first week of June. The second reading debate was not included in the list of business announced by the government for next week. That does not mean it definitely will not take place, but it does mean the government is not able to confirm it now. The government appears to have abandoned plans to publish the bill tomorrow. An earlier post said that Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, has said the committee will hold a no-confidence vote in Theresa May if she does not announce a resignation date tomorrow. Sorry. That was my mistake. The quote was from Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the 1922 Committee. He told the Press Association this morning that when he meets Theresa May tomorrow, he will expect her to give a timetable for her departure. And she could announce her decision to quit tomorrow, Brady said. He told PA: I want her to give a timetable for when she will go. I think this blank denial from Number 10 today may be a smokescreen because she does not want to influence the outcome of the European elections. Maybe she will still quit tomorrow. Asked what would happen if the PM did not announce a resignation date, Clifton-Brown said: I think there will be overwhelming pressure for the 22 to change the rules and hold a ballot on confidence in the prime minister. Here\u2019s Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby on the current state of play in No 10, and whether or not the EU withdrawal agreement bill will ever see the light of day. We\u2019re in a situation at the moment where the fact that a cabinet minister says they are not resigning counts as news - or, at least, something noteworthy. Michael Gove, the Brexiter environment secretary, is not quitting, the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith reports. At the Nato event where he was speaking this morning, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, also refused to say what he would be telling Theresa May today about the EU withdrawal agreement bill. This is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. It is understood that he is one of several cabinet ministers raising concerns about the bill, and in particular about the provision in it for a vote on a second referendum. Theresa May will still be PM when President Trump visits the week after next, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has said. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment. This is not a surprise, but it is probably worth clarifying. Those in the Conservative party who want Theresa May to resign now are not asking for her to leave office immediately. They want her to resign as Conservative party leader, so that the party can start the leadership contest. It is widely agreed that she will stay as PM until the party has elected a new leader, which would not be until the end of July at the earliest. As prime minister, she cannot resign until she is in a position to tell the Queen who she should appoint as a successor. (Well, in theory she could, but it would not be the done thing ...) There was no sign of Andrea Leadsom outside her Westminster home on Thursday morning, the Press Association reports. Her husband, Ben Leadsom, stopped on his bicycle to tell reporters: \u201cIt was a tough day yesterday, but she\u2019s happy she made the right decision.\u201d He said he could not comment when asked whether the MP for South Northamptonshire would run for leadership of the Conservative party. If you want information about the candidates in your area, or where you can vote, the Who Can I Vote For? website is helpful. This is from the Tory MP Sir David Evennett. What has changed for Theresa May in the last 24 hours or so is that MPs in the mainstream of the party, who have generally been supportive of her up to now, have joined those calling for her to resign. Evennett is a good example. He voted remain in the 2016 referendum and, although he voted against May\u2019s deal in the first Commons vote, he supported it in the second two. He is not someone who has been publicly speaking out against her in the past. Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, is reportedly one of the cabinet ministers who has told Theresa May she is unhappy about the plan to include a provision for a vote on a second referendum in the EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab). This morning, asked about this, she told reporters: I have given my advice to No 10 and today I am going to be getting on with my job which is to keep the country safe and look after our armed forces. This is from Labour whips, an official account. This refers to a report that Paul Maynard, a government whip, told Theresa May during a private meeting that her Brexit strategy risked destroying the Conservative party. Usual request for an election day: if you are posting a comment below the line (BTL), please do not tell us how you voted. Under the Representation of the People Act 1983, it is an offence to publish, while the polls are still open, any information about how people have voted based on \u201cinformation given by voters after they have voted\u201d. This law is designed to stop on-day polling influencing the results, but the lawyers say it covers comments from individuals too, and so please desist. (But if you were to tell us that you expect party X to do very well, that would not be a problem.) Britons have started voting in the European elections. The polling stations opened about two hours ago and, as usual, they will stay open until 10pm. But, because most other EU countries do not vote until Sunday, the votes will not be counted until Sunday night. These are elections, of course, that were never meant to happen, because the UK was supposed to leave the EU in March. But despite being unwanted and unexpected, the results could be more consequential than the results of any other European elections in the UK\u2019s history. According to opinion polls, Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party is on course to a win by a huge margin - much more than the two points by which Ukip, which he was then leading, beat Labour in 2014. And some polls have the Tories heading for fifth place. At the very least this is bound to have a considerable influence on what happens in the forthcoming Conservative leadership contest, although Farage claims he could even tear down the two-party political system. The fact that Britain is voting will give Theresa May some respite from the intensifying calls for her resignation - mainly because, while polls are open, there are limits to what broadcasters can report. But that does not meant the pressure is going away. As we report in our overnight story (see below), following the resignation of Andrea Leadsom, May is under pressure to make an announcement about the timing of her departure imminently. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.05am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, speaks at a Nato cyber defence conference. 10.30am: Business statement in the Commons. Normally Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, would be giving it, but following her resignation Mark Spencer, a whip, is due to take her place. 3.30pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, speaks at a King\u2019s Fund conference. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "A Labour peer who used parliamentary privilege to accuse Sir Philip Green of being an abusive bully has said he did so after hearing \u201chorrible\u201d claims of repeated sexual assaults resulting in hundreds of grievance cases. Peter Hain told the House of Lords on Thursday that one alleged victim claimed the retail tycoon had shouted \u201cgo to psychologists\u201d at staff who questioned his behaviour. A company lawyer working for one of Green\u2019s firms was accused of lying to the alleged victim, according to Hain. His latest disclosures came during a debate about the use of parliamentary privilege \u2013 which allows MPs and peers to speak in parliament without fear of legal action \u2013 and the obligation under the rule of law to obey court orders. The debate was prompted by Hain\u2019s decision in October to name Green, who had secured an injunction preventing details of the case from being revealed. Green has denied all accusations of wrongdoing. It comes the day after Green\u2019s Arcadia Group confirmed plans to close 23 stores. Hain\u2019s intervention followed days of speculation over a mystery businessman described by the Daily Telegraph as being the subject of multiple sexual harassment and bullying allegations. Hain, who was a cabinet minister under Tony Blair, told peers he would reveal what he was told by one alleged victim of Green who had \u201cpleaded\u201d that he be named. \u201cI quote: \u2018He was touching and repeatedly slapping women staff\u2019s bottoms, grabbing thighs and touching legs. Hundreds of grievance cases were raised with HR [human resources]. The company lawyer who interviewed me then lied. Sir Philip screamed and shouted at staff to go to psychologists,\u2019\u201d Hain said. The former anti-apartheid campaigner was criticised at the time for naming Green, as some lawyers and legal experts said it was an abuse of parliamentary privilege, although he was backed by many MPs. Hain claimed that the alleged victim said those who took their complaints to an employment tribunal ended up settling after signing non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Hain said the woman told him: \u201cSome were worn down with spiralling legal costs costing them a fortune. He broke some in the end. It was horrible \u2026 He is still doing exactly the same thing. It is rife, it happened all the time. I saw him grab the breasts of others. This has gone on for a long time.\u201d He told peers he was acting against Green\u2019s alleged behaviour and the misuse of NDAs. \u201cMy motive was to stand up for ordinary employees against a very powerful and wealthy boss who, as described to me, seemed to think he was above the rules of decent respectful behaviour,\u201d he said. The former supreme court justice Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood told fellow peers that in his original decision to use parliamentary privilege to name Green, Hain \u201cacted wrongly\u201d and parliament should try to prevent such an \u201cabuse\u201d recurring. He said of Hain\u2019s actions: \u201cI regard his statement as a misuse, indeed, I would suggest, a clear abuse, of privilege.\u201d Green said it was outrageous for Hain to have named him. He repeated that \u201cto the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations\u201d. It later emerged that Hain was a paid adviser to Gordon Dadds, the law firm instructed by the Daily Telegraph in its attempts to name Green. Green also criticised Hain for not revealing his links to the law firm. Hain told the Observer in February he took the decision to name Green \u201cin my personal capacity as an independent member of the House of Lords.

      "bodyText": "Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested that the UK is drifting towards another Brexit extension in October as he criticised MPs for prioritising the prime minister\u2019s removal over finding agreement on a Brexit deal. With May appearing on the brink of resignation, the European commission president spoke of his admiration for her resilience and his disdain for the attempts to remove her. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like in the British debate is it seems more important to replace the prime minister than to find an agreement among themselves,\u201d Juncker said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThis is a woman who knows how to do things but she is unable to succeed in doing things. I like her very much; she is a tough person.\u201d Junker told CNN that he was \u201cfed up\u201d with the ongoing impasse but suggested that Brussels was resigned to a further request to extend the UK\u2019s membership this autumn. The UK has until 31 October to agree a deal, leave without an agreement or seek a further extension of the article 50 negotiating period. Juncker said: \u201cI hope they will agree among themselves, and they will leave [the EU] by the end of October ... I think it\u2019s their patriotic duty to get an agreement. \u201cI am getting fed up because we are [just] waiting for the next extension.\u201d The commission president added that it was not about the \u201cidentity of the next prime minister; it\u2019s about the withdrawal agreement\u201d. The commission president\u2019s backing is unlikely to dissuade many Conservative cabinet ministers and MPs from seeking to force the prime minister out of office. Following the resignation of the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, on Wednesday, May\u2019s hold on power looked weaker than ever before. With the EU refusing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, Juncker suggested that there was little to be gained in changing the country\u2019s leadership. One of the stated reasons for Leadsom\u2019s resignation was May\u2019s offer to facilitate a vote in the Commons on a potential second referendum. Juncker struck a sceptical note when asked whether he agreed with Donald Tusk, his counterpart in the European council, that the UK should hold a second Brexit vote. He said: \u201cI would like to say yes to a second referendum, but the result might not be any different. We are observers in a British stadium \u2013 it\u2019s up for them to decide.\u201d As leader of the House of Commons, Leadsom had been expected to give details on Thursday of the withdrawal agreement bill. But she claimed in her resignation letter that she could not sign up to facilitating another referendum. In her response, May denied that this was her intention. \u201cI do not agree with you that the deal which we have negotiated with the European Union means that the United Kingdom will not become a sovereign country,\u201d May wrote. May said that any bill was likely to attract an amendment seeking to bring a second referendum about. \u201cThat is why at cabinet yesterday we agreed to bring the bill forward and allow those MPs who want another referendum to put their case,\u201d the prime minister said.",

But <strong>J</strong><strong>ulian Smith,</strong> the chief whip, told the executive of the 1922 Committee that May was not going to quit this evening.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, has arranged to meet May on Friday, where it is thought he will tell May how little support she has in the party and how MPs are pushing for the leadership contest to start now.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>May is under intense pressure from MPs in her party to cancel the vote on the Wab, scheduled for Friday 7 June.</strong> Cabinet ministers are among those who want the vote to be abandoned, and some of them \u2013 including Sajid Javid, David Mundell and Jeremy Hunt \u2013 have been asking to meet her to express their concerns. May has been resisting. The two issues \u2013 May\u2019s resignation and the fate of the Wab \u2013 are linked because May has previously agreed to arrange a timetable for her departure after the second reading of the Wab. If the government were to abandon the Wab, she would have no reason not to announce her resignation now. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Some Conservatives have been urging the 1922 Committee to change the rules that currently prevent a fresh no confidence vote in May before December \u2013 12 months after the last one.</strong> May\u2019s critics would like to be able to hold a new vote now. It has been reported that there is now a majority on the executive of the 1922 Committee in favour of changing the rules.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street has rejected claims that the government has abandoned its plan to publish the Wab on Friday. </strong>But publication will depend on whether or not, by Friday, May still plans to press ahead with holding a vote on the Wab on Friday 7 June or whether by then she has been persuaded to drop it. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>May now looks likely to announce her resignation as some point in the fortnight between Friday 24 May and Friday 7 June. </strong>It could come this Friday, following her meeting with Brady (perhaps in response to a threat by Brady to schedule a no confidence vote if she does not). Or it could come very soon after the Wab second reading vote, which the government is widely expected to lose. Announcing her resignation would not involve May leaving No 10 immediately; it is expected she would stay in office until a new leader were elected. But if the contest were to start now, it would be easier for the party to install a new leader before the summer recess \u2013 an important consideration for MPs, who want the new leader to have as much time as possible to address Brexit before the end of October, when the UK is due to leave the EU.</li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me.</p> <p>If there are further updates, a colleague will be taking over.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-22T18:17:03.223Z\">at 7.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ce58a6f8f08cb61833741d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-22T17:46:34.558Z\">6.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After the 1922 Committee meeting the Tory Brexiter <strong>Steve Baker </strong>said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister will be campaigning for the European elections and on Friday she will meet Sir Graham.

Cabinet ministers are among those who want the vote to be abandoned, and some of them \u2013 including Sajid Javid, David Mundell and Jeremy Hunt \u2013 have been asking to meet her to express their concerns.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>May is also facing escalating pressure from MPs in her party to announce her resignation now.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The two issues are linked because May has previously agreed to arrange a timetable for her departure after the second reading of the Wab.</strong> If the government were to abandon the Wab, she would have no reason not to announce her resignation now. Announcing her resignation would not involve her leaving No 10 immediately; it is expected she would stay in office until a new leader were elected. But if the contest were to start now, it would be easier for the party to install a new leader before the summer recess.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>May has reportedly been refusing to meet cabinet ministers this afternoon to discuss their concerns about the Wab, and Julian Smith, the chief whip, told the executive of the 1922 Committee in a very short meeting that she would not be announcing her resignation tonight.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The executive of the 1922 Committee has been meeting just now to decide whether to change party rules to allow an immediate no confidence vote in May. </strong>Under current rules this must wait until December \u2013 12 months after the last vote. Recently the executive voted 9-7 against changing the rules, but is thought there is now a majority in favour of rewriting them.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Tory backbenchers have just now gone into a meeting of the main 1922 Committee to hear what the executive is recommending.</strong></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-22T18:18:32.801Z\">at 7.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ce582688f08cb618337417a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-22T17:10:13.063Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From ITV\u2019s <strong>Paul Brand</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1131245187236278272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Iain Duncan Smith says he thinks President Trump now likely to pull his visit, as that week could well be the week of a leadership challenge to May.</p>&mdash; Paul Brand (@PaulBrandITV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1131245187236278272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ce581888f0807b455f8655a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-22T17:06:44.527Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From Sky\u2019s<strong> Kate McCann</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KateEMcCann/status/1131243792437272576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Source says chief whip told 1922 executive that the PM isn\u2019t going anywhere.

Sturgeon retaliated by describing Davidson\u2019s \u201cgrovelling loyalty\u201d to May and how \u201cheartbreaking\u201d it must be that the prime minister had yesterday \u201ctorpedoed her pitch on the EU elections\u201d - Scottish Tory EU election leaflets have prominently proclaimed \u201cno more referendums\u201d, then May came out with the exact opposite yesterday.</p> <p>Then things got dirty. Sturgeon accused Davidson of lacking principle on Brexit, adding that she was even \u201ccosying up to Boris Johnson\u201d after being previously \u2013 and very publicly \u2013 hostile to him.

To her credit, Theresa May has endured far longer than most people expected after she bungled the 2017 general election - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/george-osborne-says-theresa-may-is-a-dead-woman-walking\">George Osborne\u2019s prediction about her being a \u201cdead woman walking\u201d almost two years ago</a> turned out to be wrong - but now, particularly in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/may-offers-mps-vote-on-second-referendum-in-new-brexit-deal\"> the light of the dismal reception her \u201cNew Brexit Deal\u201d is getting</a>, her premiership seems to be on its deathbed.</p> <p>This became evidence when <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the environment secretary, was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. Gove is the cabinet\u2019s most accomplished media performer, and Downing Street normally send him out when the stakes are particularly high. He was the minister who summed up for the government in the no-confidence vote in January, when he praised May handsomely. But today even Gove was struggling to pretend all was well.</p> <p>There were three lines that particularly stood out.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Gove suggested that the government might abandon the planned vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill. </strong>He said the bill was being published today, and the government has already said it will get its second reading in the week beginning 3 June. But many Tories think there is no point in having a vote if the government is going to lose and Gove was evasive on whether the vote would take place. When <strong>Mishal Husain</strong> asked if the government was still going ahead with the vote, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been a lot of \u2018sturm und drang\u2019, a lot of summer lightning, of the course of the last 24 hours. But I think it is important that we all take a little bit of time and step back. Because ultimately we have three choices: we can either choose to leave the European Union with a deal, we can leave the European Union without a deal or we can stay in the European Union ...</p> </blockquote> <p>Husain pointed out that Gove had not answered the question. For a second time he dodged it as he used his answer to criticise Labour. Later in the interview Husain tried again. She said Gove still had not said if the vote was going ahead. He replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that we will reflect over the course of the next few days on how people look at the proposition that has been put forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>So it might not happen, Husain said. Gove replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, I think there has to be a vote of on a withdrawal agreement implementation bill because one thing that we know is that, without a withdrawal agreement implementation bill, you can\u2019t leave the European Union without a deal.</p> <p>Rather than saying anything precipitate, I think that everyone should take an opportunity to reflect on what the prime minister will say later today and to look at the bill.</p> </blockquote> <p>What was significant about this is that Gove was talking about a possible future vote on <em>a</em> withdrawal agreement bill, not on <em>the</em> withdrawal agreement bill.

      "bodyText": "Andrea Leadsom, former leader of the House of Commons, resigned from government today. In a letter to Theresa May, she said \u201cI no longer believe that our approach will deliver on the referendum result\u201d. Outlining four main reasons for her decision to quit, Leadsom added how she no longer \u201cbelieves that we will be a truly sovereign United Kingdom through the deal that is now proposed.\u201d Leadsom later told reporters saying she disagreed with the Withdrawal Agreement Bill\u2019s new elements. Theresa May responded with a letter. May said she was \u201csorry\u201d to lose someone of her \u201cpassion, drive and sincerity\u201d, but disagreed with her comments about the Governments Brexit approach. May wrote: \u201cI do not agree with you that the deal which we have negotiated with the European Union means that the United Kingdom will not become a sovereign country.\u201d A source in the 1992 Committee of Conservative backbenchers said the executive had voted tonight on whether to allow a new confidence vote that could oust Theresa May from premiership. The votes are now sealed in an envelope, and would only be opened if May fails to resign by 10 June. There was speculation that May could announce her resignation as early as this Friday 24 May when she will meet Sir Graham Brady, chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, BBC reports. Meanwhile, violent clashes broke out following a Tommy Robinson protest in Salford this evening. They were seen throwing bricks and eggs at anti-racist campaigners and police officers at the scene. Two arrests were made. And that\u2019s it for the night, thanks. Further developments in Josh Halliday\u2019s story reported earlier tonight about the Tommy Robinson protest in Salford. Police have confirmed they made two arrests following the trouble at a Tommy Robinson rally in Salford earlier. Greater Manchester Police said: \u201cPolice arrested two people during a disturbance following a planned event in Lower Broughton, Salford. \u201cTwo people were arrested on suspicion of assault and public order offences. Enquiries are ongoing.\u201d There is now widespread speculation Theresa May could announce her date of departure as early as Friday when she is due to meet Sir Graham Brady, chair of the backbench 1922 Committee. The BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg tweets: Speaking to reporters after her resignation, Leadsom said she could not support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill\u2019s new elements. She said: \u201cI have been supporting Brexit totally for the last three years and I just couldn\u2019t as Leader of the Commons, with responsibility for legislation, stand up at Business Questions tomorrow and announce a Bill that I just think has elements I cannot support that aren\u2019t Brexit.\u201d Leadsom added: \u201cI have been determined to deliver Brexit and I am just worried that this Bill with its new elements in it would not do that. It\u2019s been a really tough day.\u201d My colleague Heather Stewart tells me that a source in the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers said the executive had agreed in principle on a rule change that could allow May to be toppled: but had then placed the decision in a sealed envelope. The source said it would not be opened, unless May fails to signal her intention to step aside as Tory leader by 10 June - though she would be expected to remain as prime minister while a leadership contest was held. Here is the letter in full: May said she was \u201csorry\u201d to receive Leadsom\u2019s resignation letter, writing in reply that she was \u201cgrateful for the support you have given over the last three years\u201d in working to deliver Brexit. Thanking Leadsom for her work, May said she disagreed with the assessment Leadsom gave about the government\u2019s approach now. May wrote: \u201cI do not agree with you that the deal which we have negotiated with the European Union means that the United Kingdom will not become a sovereign country. \u201cIf the deal is passed, the UK will leave the European Union. We will leave its Common Agricultural Policy and its Common Fisheries Policy. \u201cWe will end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and make our own laws in Westminster and our devolved parliaments. \u201cWe will stop sending vast annual sums of taxpayers\u2019 money to the EU, and spend it on our priorities instead \u2013 such as our National Health Service and our children\u2019s schools.\u201d Mrs May said she agreed that a second referendum would be divisive, but said the Government was not proposing to hold one. She wrote: \u201cI continue to believe that the arguments against a second referendum are strong and compelling, and will continue to oppose one.\u201d The PM said she also did not recognise what Mrs Leadsom said about decision-making in Government. \u201cIndeed, through your own work chairing the Parliamentary Business and Legislation committee of Cabinet, you have been an important part of ensuring that Brexit-related legislative proposals are properly scrutinised, and the whole Cabinet have listened to the assessments you have given at Cabinet meetings,\u201d Mrs May said. \u201cI have valued the frank and productive discussions we have had over the last three years. \u201cAs you say, there are important elections tomorrow, and many Conservatives are working in a challenging environment to support our excellent candidates. \u201cI am sorry to lose someone of your passion, drive and sincerity from HM Government in this way.\u201d Protestors threw eggs at police and were heard shouting \u201cScum! Scum!\u201d after Tommy Robinson rally in Salford Meanwhile, my colleague Josh Halliday has this report from a Tommy Robinson rally in Salford that has descended into violence. Police have made arrests after anti-racism campaigners were pelted with bricks and eggs following a Tommy Robinson campaign rally in Salford. Three anti-racism activists suffered bruising and cuts after they were hit by rocks. Trouble flared when objects were thrown at a group of about 50 counter-protesters who were being escorted away from the event by police. The Guardian saw a boy and a man being arrested as about 30 police officers struggled to contain the disorder. Nahella Ashraf, the chair of Stand Up to Racism in Manchester, said bricks were thrown at their campaigners by youngsters as they were being led away. Eggs and sticks were also thrown at police officers. The trouble flared shortly after Robinson\u2019s final campaign rally ahead of the European parliamentary elections on Thursday. The anti-racism activists were briefly held in a car park by police before they were escorted away down a housing estate in Lower Broughton, when they were pelted with objects. Nahella Ashraf, chair of Stand Up to Racism in Manchester, said: \u201cAs activists left the SUTR rally we were attacked by a large group of Tommy Robinson supporters throwing, eggs, bricks and bottles.\u201d She said she saw some of the supporters make the nazi Sieg Heil salute. Ashraf added: \u201cTommy Robinson is a fascist and has no place in mainstream politics. \u201cWe urge everyone to use their vote to ensure he does not get elected as an MEP.\u201d May did not tell her team about Leadsom\u2019s resignation according to a Downing Street source, the BBC is reporting. Fellow Conservative Party MPs have described Andrea Leadsom\u2019s decision to leave the Government due to its Brexit approach as \u201cabsolutely the right thing to do\u201d, while a Labour MP wished her well. Scottish Tory Ross Thomson tweeted: Another Conservative MP, Chris Heaton-Harris, tweeted: Labour MP Jess Phillips said she liked Leadsom and commended her work in helping to introduce proxy voting for MPs. Phillips tweeted: In a statement posted to his party\u2019s website, Labour chairman Ian Lavery said the resignation of Leadsom shows \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s authority is shot and her time is up\u201d. \u201cWhile the Tories are ripping themselves apart, our country is in crisis. The Government has made a catastrophic mess of the Brexit negotiations, our steel industry is under threat and universal credit is pushing people into poverty. \u201cFor the sake of the country, Theresa May needs to go, and we need an immediate general election.\u201d Conservative MP Craig Tracey appeared to mock the situation and tweeted: No 10 has responded. A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cAndrea Leadsom has served with distinction and great ability as a member of the government, and the prime minister is grateful for all of her work. We are disappointed that she has chosen to resign, and the prime minister remains focused on delivering the Brexit people voted for.\u201d Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson criticised Andrea Leadsom\u2019s decision to step down on the eve of the European elections, calling it a \u201cslap in the face\u201d for her colleagues. He tweeted: \u201cI accept that she may want to go but to do it the night before an election looks odd. \u201cIt\u2019s also a slap in the face to Tory party members who are working hard to get their candidates elected tomorrow.\u201d Commentators are pointing out the irony that it may be a resignation by Andrea Leadsom, who stood aside to let Theresa May take the Tory leadership in summer 2016, which may eventually lead to the prime minister\u2019s downfall. Leadsom\u2019s is the 36th ministerial resignation under May\u2019s watch. Leadsom, a former Tory leadership candidate in 2016, outlined four reasons for her decision in her letter. She said: \u201c1. I do not believe that we will be a truly sovereign United Kingdom through the deal that is now proposed; \u201c2. I have always maintained that a second referendum would be dangerously divisive, and I do not support the government willingly facilitating such a concession. It would also risk undermining our union which is something I passionately want to see strengthened; \u201c3. There has been such a breakdown of government processes that recent Brexit-related legislative proposals have not been properly scrutinised or approved by cabinet members; \u201c4. The tolerance to those in cabinet who have advocated policies contrary to the government\u2019s position has led to a complete breakdown of collective responsibility.\u201d Explaining the timing of her decision to resign on the eve of polling day in the European elections, Leadsom said: \u201cI considered carefully the timing of this decision, but I cannot fulfil my duty as leader of the house tomorrow, to announce a bill with new elements that I fundamentally oppose. \u201cI fully respect the integrity, resolution and determination that you have shown during your time as prime minister. \u201cNo one has wanted you to succeed more than I have, but I do now urge you to make the right decisions in the interests of the country, this government and our party.\u201d Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom has resigned, saying in a letter to Theresa May \u201cI no longer believe that our approach will deliver on the referendum result\u201d. Theresa May has seen off an attempt by some Tory MPs to get her to announce a timetable for her departure tonight. Her decision yesterday to announce that her EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab) will include giving MPs votes on a second referendum and on a temporary customs union has infuriated many Conservatives \u2013 including many in her cabinet, and MPs who have not previously demanded her resignation \u2013 and this afternoon the atmosphere at Westminster was febrile, with rumours that she could announce her resignation tonight. But Julian Smith, the chief whip, told the executive of the 1922 Committee that May was not going to quit this evening. Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, has arranged to meet May on Friday, where it is thought he will tell May how little support she has in the party and how MPs are pushing for the leadership contest to start now. May is under intense pressure from MPs in her party to cancel the vote on the Wab, scheduled for Friday 7 June. Cabinet ministers are among those who want the vote to be abandoned, and some of them \u2013 including Sajid Javid, David Mundell and Jeremy Hunt \u2013 have been asking to meet her to express their concerns. May has been resisting. The two issues \u2013 May\u2019s resignation and the fate of the Wab \u2013 are linked because May has previously agreed to arrange a timetable for her departure after the second reading of the Wab. If the government were to abandon the Wab, she would have no reason not to announce her resignation now. Some Conservatives have been urging the 1922 Committee to change the rules that currently prevent a fresh no confidence vote in May before December \u2013 12 months after the last one. May\u2019s critics would like to be able to hold a new vote now. It has been reported that there is now a majority on the executive of the 1922 Committee in favour of changing the rules. Downing Street has rejected claims that the government has abandoned its plan to publish the Wab on Friday. But publication will depend on whether or not, by Friday, May still plans to press ahead with holding a vote on the Wab on Friday 7 June or whether by then she has been persuaded to drop it. May now looks likely to announce her resignation as some point in the fortnight between Friday 24 May and Friday 7 June. It could come this Friday, following her meeting with Brady (perhaps in response to a threat by Brady to schedule a no confidence vote if she does not). Or it could come very soon after the Wab second reading vote, which the government is widely expected to lose. Announcing her resignation would not involve May leaving No 10 immediately; it is expected she would stay in office until a new leader were elected. But if the contest were to start now, it would be easier for the party to install a new leader before the summer recess \u2013 an important consideration for MPs, who want the new leader to have as much time as possible to address Brexit before the end of October, when the UK is due to leave the EU. That\u2019s all from me. If there are further updates, a colleague will be taking over. After the 1922 Committee meeting the Tory Brexiter Steve Baker said: The prime minister will be campaigning for the European elections and on Friday she will meet Sir Graham. Obviously they will discuss matters of interest. It\u2019s very much going to depend on the result of the elections and I\u2019m sure [the media] will be able to give us a flavour. People are rather impatient, but equally most colleagues do appreciate this is a very difficult time for everyone. Baker is wrong about the media being able to give people a \u201cflavour\u201d of the election results on Friday. The votes are not counted until Sunday, and there won\u2019t be an exit poll either. This is from the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman. My colleague Heather Stewart says No 10 are saying the withdrawal agreement bill will be published on Friday \u2013 despite claims to the contrary. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth The full meeting of the 1922 Committee was over very quickly. These are from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. The withdrawal agreement bill won\u2019t now be published on Friday, the BBC is reporting. Theresa May is \u201cis not going anywhere until after the European parliamentary elections\u201d, a No 10 source says. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, is going to meet Theresa May on Friday, MPs have been told. Brady met her last week, when the two agreed that they would meet after the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill to agree a timetable for the Tory leadership contest. What they did not agree is what would happen if that second reading debate was cancelled. The crisis is still fluid, but here is a summary of what we know so far. Theresa May\u2019s decision yesterday to announce that her EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab) will include giving MPs votes on a second referendum and on a temporary customs union has infuriated many Conservatives \u2013 including those who voted for her agreement in the last debate, at the end of March. May is now under intense pressure from MPs in her party to cancel the vote on the bill, scheduled for Friday 7 June. Cabinet ministers are among those who want the vote to be abandoned, and some of them \u2013 including Sajid Javid, David Mundell and Jeremy Hunt \u2013 have been asking to meet her to express their concerns. May is also facing escalating pressure from MPs in her party to announce her resignation now. The two issues are linked because May has previously agreed to arrange a timetable for her departure after the second reading of the Wab. If the government were to abandon the Wab, she would have no reason not to announce her resignation now. Announcing her resignation would not involve her leaving No 10 immediately; it is expected she would stay in office until a new leader were elected. But if the contest were to start now, it would be easier for the party to install a new leader before the summer recess. May has reportedly been refusing to meet cabinet ministers this afternoon to discuss their concerns about the Wab, and Julian Smith, the chief whip, told the executive of the 1922 Committee in a very short meeting that she would not be announcing her resignation tonight. The executive of the 1922 Committee has been meeting just now to decide whether to change party rules to allow an immediate no confidence vote in May. Under current rules this must wait until December \u2013 12 months after the last vote. Recently the executive voted 9-7 against changing the rules, but is thought there is now a majority in favour of rewriting them. Tory backbenchers have just now gone into a meeting of the main 1922 Committee to hear what the executive is recommending. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From Sky\u2019s Kate McCann More on May\u2019s future and the 1922 Committee. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh And Theresa May is not the only party leader today pulling up the metaphorical drawbridge to keep out her enemies. According to this Sun story, which must win the award for headline of the day, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has been \u201ctrapped on [his] Brexit bus due to people armed with milkshakes\u201d. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Julian Smith, the chief whip, left his meeting with the 1922 Committee\u2019s executive after just two minutes or so. This is from Sky\u2019s Kate McCann. Sky\u2019s Jon Craig says a majority of members of the 1922 Committee\u2019s executive now favour changing the rules to allow a no confidence vote in May. Under the current rules another vote is not allowed until December \u2013 12 months after the last one. Recently the executive discussed changing the rules but voted 9-7 against a change. Julian Smith, the chief whip, has arrived to meet the executive of the 1922 Committee. These are from the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins. The Conservatives are not the only party with a leadership crisis tonight, it seems. This is from Channel 4 News\u2019 Cathy Newman. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. The Conservative 1922 Committee, which all Tory backbenchers can attend, began a meeting earlier. That meeting has now been adjourned until 6pm to allow the executive of the committee to meet Julian Smith, the chief whip. As the meeting broke up, it emerged that members were told that the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill is scheduled for Friday 7 June. ERG deputy chair Mark Francois told journalists: \u201cI bet \u00a350 for Help for Heroes that the second reading of the Wab will never ever happen.\u201d From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford From my colleague Heather Stewart In Scotland FMQs has been moved from its usual Thursday midday slot to Wednesday afternoon to accommodate EU election day purdah and perhaps something about the skewiff time affected the participants, because the exchanges between Nicola Sturgeon and Ruth Davidson this week were blistering. Davidson, the Conservative leader, immediately went in on the attack, accusing Sturgeon of demanding a re-run of \u201cnot one but two\u201d referendum results, while Sturgeon mocked Theresa May\u2019s \u201cchange of heart on second referendums\u201d, referring to her offer of a vote on a second EU poll yesterday. Davidson said that Sturgeon\u2019s intention was to \u201cdemand more referendums until people are brow beaten into giving her the result she wants\u201d. Sturgeon retaliated by describing Davidson\u2019s \u201cgrovelling loyalty\u201d to May and how \u201cheartbreaking\u201d it must be that the prime minister had yesterday \u201ctorpedoed her pitch on the EU elections\u201d - Scottish Tory EU election leaflets have prominently proclaimed \u201cno more referendums\u201d, then May came out with the exact opposite yesterday. Then things got dirty. Sturgeon accused Davidson of lacking principle on Brexit, adding that she was even \u201ccosying up to Boris Johnson\u201d after being previously \u2013 and very publicly \u2013 hostile to him. (It\u2019s true that the Scottish Tories have pulled back from a wholesale \u2018stop Boris\u2019 position, not least because they can see an even worse prospect on the horizon, name of Dominic Raab). To this, Davidson shot back with a sharpness that seemed to take both women by surprise: I\u2019ve never had any trouble standing up to the alpha males in my party. I wonder if she can say the same. This very pointed reference to Alex Salmond and his forthcoming trial for sexual offences, which has been off-limits in the chamber for obvious legal reasons, drew some sharp intakes of breath. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn It is definitely the chief whip meeting the executive of the 1922 Committee at 5.30pm, not the PM. Here is more on that meeting. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield. Tim Loughton, a Brexiter but not one with a record of agitating against Theresa May, has submitted a letter to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, saying Theresa May needs to go now. He posted this on Twitter earlier. And he told BBC News a few minutes ago that this is the first time in his 22-year career as an MP that he has called for a no confidence vote in the leader. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby The Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat says Theresa May has now \u201crun out of road\u201d and that it\u2019s time for a change. This is from ITV\u2019s Phil Hornby. Stephen Crabb, the former work and pensions secretary who is a mainstream Conservative and who has voted for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal on all three occasions, is saying Theresa May should resign as soon as possible, the BBC is reporting. From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges \u201cNo plans ... at this stage\u201d normally means something is in the pipeline. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has hinted the Liberal Democrat\u2019s executive will begin work on finding his successor as early as next week after confirming he planned to resign soon after the European election. Cable was in Edinburgh on Wednesday for the final campaign push before tomorrow\u2019s European election, with his party in an intense three-way battle between the Tories, the Lib Dems and the Scottish Greens for the sixth and final Scottish regional seat. Asked by the Guardian whether he had agreed with the party a firm date for his resignation and a timetable for selecting his successor, he said: I have made a final decision that we will get a new leader in the summer ... I wanted to get through tomorrow [first]. Pressed on whether there were clear dates in mind, such as the end of this parliamentary session or the end of the summer recess, he said: Yes, there will be a new leader before the end of the summer recess. That\u2019s what we\u2019re planning to achieve: orderly succession, good candidates. The party will accept a timetable. I\u2019m just focusing on the next 48 hours then we\u2019ll talk to the party about how to organise the timetable. Senior Scottish Lib Dems believe Jo Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, will immediately throw her hat in the ring and is likely to up against Ed Davey, the MP for Kingston and Surbiton. The new leader will then have the task of working out whether to agree to a coalition or a looser working agreement with Change UK, its faltering rival for centre ground votes. Julian Smith, the chief whip, has come out of Number 10, Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti reports. At the afternoon Downing Street lobby briefing Theresa May\u2019s spokesman insisted ministers had signed up to her proposals over a second referendum at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. He said: There was discussion at cabinet on these matters. The PM summed up in the usual way. She set out she would be giving a speech later on. The speech reflects the position that was agreed yesterday. Asked to confirm that ministers specifically approved the idea of holding a vote on a second referendum, the spokesman said: I\u2019m not going to get into that level of detail on cabinet discussion. But there was a discussion at cabinet. The speech represented the agreed way forward. The Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner has a good summary of where we are. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh This is from Sky\u2019s Jon Craig. I pass this on as evidence of what is coming out of the Westminster rumour mill. It is also important to remember that the rumour mill is not always reliable. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has joined what seems to be the nascent cabinet revolt against Theresa May, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports. My colleague Peter Walker has just posted these from the afternoon Downing Street lobby briefing. From BrexitCentral\u2019s Jonathan Isaby From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn The executive of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee is meeting now. This is from the BBC\u2019s Jessica Parker. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn has an explanation for why Brexiter cabinet ministers are angry with what was in Theresa May\u2019s speech yesterday. There is an important distinction. Agreeing to hold a vote on a second referendum is a very limited concession. In fact, given that the opposition could table a second referendum amendment anyway that would probably be put to a vote, you can argue that as an offer it is almost meaningless. But in her speech yesterday May said, if MPs voted for a second referendum, the government would implement the legislation necessary for it to happen. That is a much firmer commitment, because a single vote on an amendment to legislation would probably on its own not be enough to make a referendum happen. Normally you would need a referendum bill, which would only become law if a government allowed time for it to be passed. David Campbell Bannerman, a Conservative MEP, posted this on Twitter this morning, saying the Tory leadership contest rules should be changed to allow a vote of no confidence in Theresa May now. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Sir Vince Cable has insisted Liberal Democrat MEPs will make the climate emergency a top priority after his lead candidate in Scotland rejected Green calls to phase-out North Sea oil. The Lib Dems and Scottish Greens are battling for the last remain votes of the contest as they vie to take the sixth Scottish region European seat from the Tories, whose support has plunged in the wake of the Brexit party\u2019s late surge in Scotland. Both the Lib Dems and Greens are fighting to attract Labour voters who are abandoning Labour over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s pro-Brexit stance. That came to a head earlier this week in an STV elections hustings in a clash between Sheila Ritchie, an Aberdeen-based solicitor who is the Lib Dems\u2019 lead candidate, and Maggie Chapman, the lead Green candidate. Ritchie said the Scottish Greens\u2019 stance on closing down North Sea oil fields \u201ctomorrow\u201d would lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the north east of Scotland. \u201cWhat would you have them do? They can\u2019t all work in sustainable forestry,\u201d Ritchie asked Chapman. Speaking in a final campaign event in central Edinburgh today, Chapman said Labour and floating remain voters were backing the Greens because of its unequivocal stance on the climate crisis. She said voters brought the climate crisis up on the doorstep: The Greens in Scotland and across the continent are the only parties with a real plan to tackle climate change; we know that climate breakdown is the greatest threat that we face at the moment and we absolutely need a coherent and concerted effort to tackle the climate crisis, and our green new deal is that plan. There is no point in stopping Brexit for stopping Brexit\u2019s sake, it has to be for something \u2026 It\u2019s stopping Brexit and then what? We\u2019re interested in the \u2018and then what?\u2019 Speaking to reporters close by about an hour later, Cable insisted his party supported that agenda and Ritchie would be expected to back the party\u2019s position that the climate emergency was real and needed action. He said: As far as Sheila Ritchie\u2019s concern with North Sea oil, we\u2019ve to decarbonise the economy. But as we decarbonise it, there will be a continuing need for oil and gas and it\u2019s better it comes from Scottish oil fields than the Middle East. We need to phase out the use of oil and gas. The Lib Dems are fully signed up to the idea of recognising the climate emergency. I want that to be the top priority of our MEPs when they get elected, including Sheila, but in the meantime, until oil and gas disappears, Scotland is an important supplier. That turned out to be a shorter and rather less intense parliamentary occasion than we were expecting, but that was primarily because the really important political discussions at Westminster are taking place outside the chamber this afternoon - and they don\u2019t seem to involve Theresa May. In the past Conservative MPs would have sat through the whole thing, but today they had better things to do - towards the end, the government benches were almost empty (see 2.11pm) - and May did not even have the usual phalanx of senior cabinet support on the front bench. Power seems to be ebbing away from her rapidly. Here are the main points. Theresa May has failed to quell the backlash against her so-called \u201cNew Brexit Deal\u201d. She spent about an hour and a half in the Commons defending the plan she outlined in her speech yesterday, but the reception she received was mostly negative, with even some of her supporters urging her to consider postponing the vote. (Eg, Nicky Morgan at 1.33pm.) There was no evidence in anything said by MPs to suggest that she can reverse the growing opposition to her bill amongst Conservatives. What was equally telling was that many Tories stayed away, or left earlier. It felt as if she is no longer seen as even particularly relevant. May insisted that the second reading vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill would go ahead in the first week of June. This morning Michael Gove, the environment secretary, suggested the vote might get shelved. (See 9.26am.) But when Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter, asked if the vote was still going ahead as planned, May said: We\u2019ve already made the government\u2019s position clear in relation to this; the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill will be brought to the house after the whitsun recess. Downing Street later said this meant the vote would be in the week beginning 3 June. In a subsequent exchange May also said she was \u201clooking forward\u201d to voting for the bill. May said the bill would be published on Friday. Gove said this morning it would be published today, but May implied in her opening statement it could not be published until after the European elections because of purdah rules (which stop politically sensitive government material being published during election campaigns) - even though in recent days Number 10 has said purdah rules would not prevent the bill\u2019s publication before the elections. May acknowledged she would not be prime minister for much longer. In her statement, she said: Mr Speaker, in time another prime minister will be standing at this despatch box. She told MPs they had a duty to \u201ctake decisions, not to duck them\u201d. She said: If we are going to deliver Brexit in this parliament we are going to have to pass a withdrawal agreement bill. And we will not do so without holding votes on the issues that have divided us the most \u2013 that includes votes on customs arrangements and on a second referendum. We can pretend otherwise and carry on arguing and getting nowhere. But in the end our job in this House is to take decisions, not to duck them. She refused to commit to giving Tory MPs a free vote in the proposed vote on alternative customs plans. (See 2pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has called for a general election, saying May no longer has the authority to deliver Brexit. In his response to May, he said: Our country needs leadership to bring us together. However, this prime minister is not the person to do this. Throughout the last 3 years, she has made no attempt to unite the country. She has been focused only on keeping her divided party together. It hasn\u2019t worked. And now her time has now run out. She no longer has the authority to offer a compromise and cannot deliver. That is why it is time for a general election to break the Brexit deadlock and give the country a say. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar This is from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole. And this is from the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford From my colleague Heather Stewart From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford The PM\u2019s statement is now over. I will post a summary shortly. My colleague Heather Stewart may have been in touch with the same source. This is from the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman. From the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Labour\u2019s Geraint Davies asks if May agrees any deal could only be publicly sustainable if backed by a confirmatory vote. May says she does not accept that. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem MP, says at least eight cabinet ministers who want May\u2019s job would accept a no-deal Brexit. Why would they, given everything she knows about how bad it would be? May says Brake can leave the Conservatives to choose their new leader. This is from the Tory MP Michael Fabricant. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall May says it is not possible to revoke article 50, and then trigger it again. \u201cOnce you revoke, you revoke,\u201d she says. Peter Kyle, the Labour MP pushing for a confirmatory referendum, asks May to confirm that she will be willing to accept further changes to her bill. He says a confirmatory referendum should be in the bill. May welcomes his relatively positive tone. She stresses her commitment to allowing MPs a vote on whether to hold a second referendum. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, asks if May is going through this \u201cfolderol\u201d because she really believes in it, or just for show. May says she would be not putting up with all this hostility if she did not believe in it. John Bercow, the Speaker, says Rees-Mogg has used a word probably never used before in this parliament. Someone (Ed Davey?) says that is because Rees-Mogg is now represented by a Lib Dem council. UPDATE: A reader has been in touch to say the word has been used in parliament before. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman asks what May would say to constituents who want to have another chance to vote on Brexit now we know what it involves. May says, to have a vote on a Brexit deal, parliament needs to approve a deal. Labour\u2019s Helen Goodman asks if May will offer Tory MPs a free vote on customs arrangements. May says whipping decisions will be taken when whips can see the options on the table. May refused to commit to giving Tory MPs a free vote in the proposed vote on alternative customs plans. George Osborne, the Evening Standard editor, former chancellor and Tory opponent of the PM\u2019s, says a cabinet coup against May is underway. This is how the Evening Standard story starts. Cabinet ministers were this afternoon discussing sending a delegation to tell Theresa May she should resign after botching her \u201clast chance\u201d at a Brexit deal. At least four ministers were said to be in talks about calling time on the prime minister after her attempt to get cross-party backing for a new plan hit a wall of opposition. Labour\u2019s Caroline Flint says all MPs should be mindful of the results of the European elections. If MPs do not pass the deal, the only alternative will be to leave without one, she says. She urges MPs to give the bill \u201cdue consideration\u201d. (Flint was one of the five Labour MPs who backed May\u2019s deal in the last vote.) Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP, says, now May\u2019s days of \u201csneering\u201d at the elected representatives of Scotland are almost at an end, will she accept her successor needs a different approach. May says Cherry has a responsibility in the votes she casts. If she does not want no-deal, she should back a deal, May says. She says the SNP should accept the decision of the British people. Richard Graham, a Tory, asks May if she agrees that a no-deal Brexit could lead to the break-up of the UK. May says she has serious concerns about this. Chuka Umunna, the Change UK MP, asks what will happen if a new PM takes over at the end of October, when there is no time to request a further extension. So will she request on in the September recess? May says she wants MPs to pass the deal. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, says he uncertainty needs to stop. MPs need to stop opposing plans just because they don\u2019t get their preference. What happens if MPs say no again? May says Ford is right. If MPs vote down the bill, there will be a choice between no-deal and no Brexit. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, asks how May can guarantee a people\u2019s vote when she cannot even put it on the face of the bill. May says she has a different view on a second referendum. But it will be for MPs to decide. Richard Drax, a Conservative, says May said it was for MPs to decide on a customs union and a second referendum. That\u2019s wrong. The country decided in the referendum, he says. He also says she was wrong to say the decision not to leave on 29 March was not her fault. But it was the cabinet\u2019s decision, she says. May says he has been trying to leave the EU. She is looking forward to voting a fourth time that way. But, sadly, opposition MPs and some Tories opposed her. May says she is \u201clooking forward\u201d to the vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, says he remembers fighting a Labour seat with May in the 1992 general election. She was resilient in the face of a tough electorate. But he says Tory MPs are even more opposed to her now than voters in North West Durham were then. Alistair Burt, the Conservative pro-European and former minister, says he will be supporting the deal. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From the Times\u2019 Sam Coates Owen Paterson, the Tory Brexiter, asks if the EU has agreed to any legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. May says the EU has been clear it will not change the withdrawal agreement. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says May talks about a new deal. But the deal has not changed, he says. Will May confirm that there is no obligation on the EU to accept alternative arrangements for the Irish border? May says the EU has committed to working with the UK to ensure those alternative arrangements are ready by the end of 2020. Nicky Morgan, a Tory pro-European, says she will probably vote for the bill. But she urges May not to put it to a vote in early June. The consequences of it being voted down would be very serious, she says. She says more time should be set aside for compromise. May says some people say she has compromised too far. Others says, not enough. At some point MPs have to take a decision, she says. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper asks if the cabinet has ruled out a long-term customs union being part of the future partnership with the EU. May says what matters to manufacturing industry is having frictionless trade at the border. That plan is already in the political declaration, she says. Sir Bill Cash, a Tory Brexiter, asks how May can be sure the UK will leave the EU by 31 July if the bill is passed. May says she has been discussing with the business managers how long it would take to pass the bill. She says the bill could pass in time for the UK to leave on 31 July. Sir John Redwood, a Tory Brexiter, asks what May says to those voters who think the UK should have left in March without a deal. May says the government wanted to leave on 29 March. But the opposition and some others blocked that. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says a vote for the SNP is a vote to stop Brexit and stop this \u201ceconomic madness\u201d. It is time for the PM to go, he says. \u201cWill you do it?\u201d May says a vote for the SNP would be a vote to betray democracy. People asked the Commons to deliver Brexit. The question is how we do that. MPs should have that debate, and stop ducking the issues. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter, asks if May can confirm that the EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab) will be put to a vote. May says the government has made the position clear. The bill will be brought back in the first week of June. May confirms that the vote on her bill will go ahead in early June. May is responding to Corbyn. She says he made his position clear. He wants everyone else to compromise by accepting his plans. He is not willing to compromise himself. On free votes, she says the Conservatives gave their MPs a free vote during the previous indicative votes. On that basis, a second referendum was rejected. She says Labour\u2019s Brexit plan would make it even harder for the UK to take action to protect British Steel. Corbyn complains about state aid rules, she says. But Labour\u2019s plan for a softer Brexit would keep the UK bound by them, she says. Turning to British Steel, Corbyn says the government must be willing to step in and take a public stake, to protect jobs. But the government is instead prioritising a trade deal with the US, which would lead to chlorinated chicken coming to the UK. On workers\u2019 rights, the PM is not offering dynamic alignment. And, on the environment, the government is only offering a toothless regulator, not binding measures to protect environmental standards. On a second referendum, he asks if May will give her MPs a free vote. If she really thinks her deal is a good one, she should not be afraid of putting it to confirmatory vote. He says Brexit has divided society, and led to too many important issues being ignored. The country needs leadership. But this prime minister is not the person to do that. She has made no effort to keep the country together. She has focused on her party. But that has not worked. Her time has run out. It is time for a general election. Corbyn calls for general election, saying May\u2019s time has run out. Corbyn says the technology needed to implement the customs plan in the Chequers proposal simply does not exist. He says Labour\u2019s plan for a permanent customs union is better. Jeremy Corbyn is responding to May. He says everything in May\u2019s statement was in the speech she gave yesterday - which was not given in parliament, even thought it as all about seeking common ground in parliament. May says \u201cin time\u201d another PM will be standing here. But while she is here, she has a duty to be clear with MPs about the facts. In the end, \u201cour job in this house is to take decisions, not duck them\u201d. May acknowledges she will soon be replaced as PM. She says MPs have a duty \u201cto take decisions, not duck them\u201d. May says, if the bill is rejected, all that will be left will be deadlock and division. This morning Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said the EU withdrawal agreement bill would be published today. But May has just said it will be published on Friday. She said it could not be published before then because of the European elections and purdah rules. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh May is summarising the 10-point offer she announced yesterday. Here is the text of the speech May gave yesterday. The 10-minute rule bill comes later, so Theresa May is making her statement now. From the i\u2019s Nigel Morris From the Mirror\u2019s Ben Glaze Johnny Mercer, a Conservative and former solider, asks May to confirm that she does not see any equivalence between terrorists and members of the armed forces. May says it should be obvious that that is not what she wants. But Mercer is proposing such an equivalence. Any amnesty would have to apply across the board. It would have to apply to servicemen and women and terrorists. She will not allow that, she says. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry says some EU citizens will not be able to vote in the European elections because, with the elections taking place at the last moment, councils did not have the time to send out forms for people to sign saying they would not be voting elsewhere. Will May make sure those forms are available at polling stations? May says, if MPs had voted for her deal, the elections would not be taking place. Mark Francois, a Tory, says he has a question for May from a Northern Ireland veteran. In 1972 he killed an IRA gunman who was about to kill one of his colleagues. He is watching these proceeding from the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. He asked Francois to ask this: \u2018I was commended for my service, and I killed a terrorist under order. The IRA have letters of comfort. Why are you pandering to the IRA?\u2019 What is your answer? May pays tribute to the man\u2019s service. It is not the case that the terrorists have an amnesty. Evidence of criminal activity will be investigated. It is important to have a fair and just system. At the moment is it not operating fairly. She says she does not want an amnesty for terrorists. The current system needs to change. That will happen. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says the victims of historical abuse in Northern Ireland have been waiting for more than two years for compensation. Some of them are now dying. Will May ensure action get taken immediately? May says she understands the concerns about this. People call this historical abuse. But, for victims, it is not historical. If the Northern Ireland executive were in place, it could address this. Labour\u2019s Marsha De Cordova asks about the damning report about poverty in the UK from the UN rapporteur Philip Alston. (See 10.17am.) She asks about reports that the DWP is spending money on misleading adverts promoting universal credit. May says, under UC, people will be able to keep more of the money that they earn. Philip Lee, a Conservative, says the Brexit party seems on course to win the European elections. That could mean 6m or 7m people voting for a no-deal Brexit. But other people who voted leave do not want that. So will May commit to a second referendum? May says she has not changed her view on a second referendum. The issue for MPs is whether or not they back her deal. Labour\u2019s Laura Smith asks about pay for carers while they are providing sleep-in cover. May says the government has had to address this as a result of a court case. And it will be bringing forward plans to reform social care. Owen Paterson, the Tory former Northern Ireland secetary, says May did not answer Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s point. Former servicemen want an assurance they won\u2019t be prosecuted unless there is new evidence. May says the problem is that, all the processes that have been followed in Northern Ireland so far have been flawed. Labour\u2019s Mike Amesbury says, now May is about to move house, will she address the leasehold scandal soon. May says the government is about to publish its plans to review leasehold laws soon. Maria Caulfield, a Conservative, asks if May will do all she can to restore devolution in Northern Ireland before the end of this year. May says she does want to see devolved government in Northern Ireland restored. Charles Walker, a Conservative, says most MPs want more money for schools, health and transport etc. Isn\u2019t the best way to do this to vote for a Brexit deal, to unlock spending? May says Walker is right. There is pent-up investment that will become available when Brexit is resolve. There will be a \u201cdeal dividend\u201d, she says. Iain Duncan Smith, a Tory, says he served in Northern Ireland. He was a friend of Robert Nairac, the officer abducted and killed. May mentioned an amnesty. But Duncan Smith says former servicemen and women are not asking for an amnesty, just a fair and just system. May says she wants a fair and just approach to legacy investigations. But at the moment there is a disproportionate emphasis on cases involves the armed forces. The government is reviewing this. Stephen Morgan, a Labour MP, mentions the D-Day celebrations in Portsmouth, which he represents. He asks why UK coroners don\u2019t record suicide rates for ex-servicemen and women, as they do in other countries. May says she will write to Morgan about this. Alistair Burt, a Conservative, asks about Yemen, and a report about the theft of aid in Houthi-controlled areas. May says it is incumbent on everyone to make sure the aid reaches those who need it most. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar The SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan says parents have to travel abroad, and break the law, or spent a lot of money privately to access medicinal cannabis for their children in this country. May says these are difficult cases, and she sympathises with parents. The government has changed the law, and doctors can prescribe these medicines where there is clinical benefit. But it should be for doctors to make those decisions, she says. From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman Shipman is referring to the pizza club. See 11.50am. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, asks May to accept her new Brexit plan is \u201ca fantasy\u201d. May says MPs need to vote for a deal. Blackford says May should look at the benches behind her. She is fooling no one. Her party does not want the deal, Scotland does not want it, and pro-Brexit Labour does not want it either. May says people should vote Conservative in tomorrow\u2019s elections. Ranil Jayawardena, a Conservative, asks if it is true, as the Sunday papers reported, that May opposed a statute of limitations for members of the armed forces in Northern Ireland. May says Jayawardena should not believe everything he reads in the papers. But any amnesty in Northern Ireland would have to apply to terrorists too. She says she will not accept that. Corbyn says this government has squandered what it inherited, like Sure Start. The Department for Education\u2019s funding chief told school leaders recently their budgets were not generous. He turns to creative industries. Why have the arts born the brunt of these cuts? Music and art are being cut. May says she wants to look at what Labour left. Unemployment higher than when it came in, the biggest peacetime deficit, and a not from the chief secretary to the Treasury saying there was no money left. Corbyn says a survey shows nine out of 10 schools have cut spending on the arts. Will the artists of tomorrow only come from state schools? May is denying the incontrovertible evidence of the experts and unions when she says money is there. Vital public services have been cut to fund tax cuts for the few. Is there a more damaging policy than cutting funding for education? May says the richest have paid more tax under the Conservatives every year than they did under Labour. What matters is the quality of education. Labour oppose phonics and oppose Sats. Standards are lower in Wales. If Labour were in power in London, it would be more of the same. Corbyn says May does not seem to be aware of the crisis facing education. Has per pupil funding risen or fallen since 2010? May says the government is giving every area more money for every school. Corbyn says a Labour government would properly fund schools. And a Labour government would not use a phrase like fair funding for cuts. Last year May said austerity was over. He quotes Maria, a teacher in an under-funded school, who asked when the government would stop making false claims about government funding. May says every area is getting more money for every school. She says, under Labour, more money was spend on debt interest than on education. Jeremy Corbyn also marks the anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack, and he pays tribute to the work of the emergency services. He says he wants to express his \u201coutrage\u201d about the way the government has failed the steel industry. There will be a statement later, he accepts. Why are schools having to close early on Fridays? On steel, May says the government is exploring all potential solutions. But it can only act within the law. It would be unlawful to provide a loan on terms demanded by the company. She says the chancellor has agreed an indemnity for the official receiver to ensure staff can still be paid. On schools, May says the government is putting record money into education. Corbyn says some schools are closing early on Fridays. And more than 1,000 schools are using crowdfunding to pay for things like pencils. Why, if they are getting record funding? May says the government is putting record money per pupil into every school. She says record rates of disadvantaged young people are going to university. Antoinette Sandbach, a Conservative, asks about an energy-saving initiative. May says the government is committed to improving energy efficiency in a set number of homes by 2030. John Woodcock, the independent MP, says May may not have long left in power, but she can act against chemical weapons. Inspectors are investigating an alleged chlorine attack by Bashar al-Assad in Syria. May says the government is monitoring this. If it was a chemical weapons attack, the UK will respond appropriately. Theresa May says today marks two years from the \u201ccowardly and sickly\u201d Manchester Arena attack. From the SNP\u2019s Neil Gray Another cabinet minister, Damian Hinds, the education secretary, has been unable to confirm that the vote on the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill will definitely take place in the first week of June. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Matt Honeycombe-Foster. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. PMQs is starting soon. Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner says this could be May\u2019s last PMQs - although it is hard to see why because what Tory MPs want is for May to announce her resignation, and the start of a leadership contest now, not for her to go immediately leaving a caretaker leader (David Lidington?) to run the country for the next few weeks until the leadership election is over. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg The \u201cpizza club\u201d are, broadly, the cabinet ministers who voted leave in the referendum - so-called because, at an initial meeting some time ago in Andrea Leadsom\u2019s office in the Commons, pizza was served. And this is from Nick Boles, who now sits as an independent MP having left the Conservatives. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Oops. My colleague Martin Belam has been looking at Facebook adverts for the European elections, and he has found that Change UK has been running some saying the party is campaigning to \u201cremain in the UK\u201d. Martin says they have spent at least \u00a3700 on those adverts. From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford In his Telegraph debate with the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed that a big win for his party in the European elections tomorrow would bring down Theresa May - and possibly Jeremy Corbyn too. He also said a victory on that scale would kill off the prospects of a second referendum. He said: If we get a big win for the Brexit party, we\u2019ll kill of all thoughts of a second referendum, because Vince\u2019s side will realise they simply can\u2019t win it. And I also think that, if these opinion polls we\u2019re looking at this morning are anything like right, we\u2019ll get rid of Mrs May incredibly quickly. We may even see the end of Jeremy Corbyn too. Farage was referring to the lastest YouGov poll for the Times, which shows his party widening its lead. Here are the figures. Here is a chart showing the trend. And here is an extract from Matthew Smith\u2019s write-up for YouGov. The final YouGov/Times European parliament voting intention survey before the election finds the Brexit party continuing to dominate with 37% of the vote, having been on 35% in last week\u2019s survey. The Lib Dems tighten their grip on second place, holding a six-point lead over third-placed Labour. Close to one in five people now say they intend to vote for the Lib Dems (19%, from 16% last week) compared to 13% for Labour (from 15%). In fact the Green party is now snapping at Labour\u2019s heels for third place, being only one point behind on 12% (having been on 10% last week). The Conservatives now sit in a distant fifth place, with just 7% of people planning to back the Tories (from 10% last week). Change UK are now on 4% (from 5%), votes for UKIP stand at 3% (unchanged), and voting intention for all other parties stands at 6%. It is worth pointing out that YouGov are unusual amongst pollsters in putting Labour below the Lib Dems in this contest. Other pollsters have Labour ahead of the Lib Dems, sometimes by a wide margin. The website What UK Thinks has a chart featuring all Euro elections polling (last updated at the end of last week.) The results of the European elections will be counted on Sunday night. The Brexit party seems to be on course for a big victory, but there will be a lot of interest in whether the combined no-deal Brexit vote (the Brexit party and Ukip) outnumbers the combined second referendum vote (the Lib Dems, the Greens, Change UK, the SNP and Plaid Cymru). All the poll suggests that this contest will be close. ConservativeHome, the website for Conservative activists which is widely read by party members, is saying Theresa May should quit as soon as possible. Here is an extract from an article by its editor, the former Tory MP Paul Goodman. The 1922 Committee executive meets today. It has already pointed the prime minister towards the exit door. It should now take her gently by the arm, and steer her through it as soon as possible. A new leader should be in place by the end of this parliamentary session. The Conservative party is in a wretched place this morning. The vultures are circling overhead. Here are some Twitter despatches giving an insight into the state of play. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From my colleague Heather Stewart From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes This is from my colleague Graeme Wearden. As my colleague Robert Booth reports, Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, has published his final report on povery in the UK. It compares Conservative welfare policies to the creation of 19th-century workhouses and warns that unless austerity is ended, the UK\u2019s poorest people face lives that are \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d. There is a link to the full text of the 21-page report here (pdf). The report is not about Brexit, but it does say Brexit will probably have a \u201cmajor adverse impact\u201d on the poor. It says: If Brexit proceeds, it is likely to have a major adverse impact on the most vulnerable. But it also suggests Brexit could be an opportunity. Brexit presents an opportunity to reimagine what the United Kingdom stands for. Legislative recognition of social rights should be a central part of that reimagining. And social inclusion, rather than increasing marginalisation of the working poor and those unable to work, should be the guiding principle of social policy. Alex Wickham at BuzzFeed is keeping a tally of the Conservative MPs who say they will vote against the EU withdrawal agreement bill (Wab) at second reading (assuming there is a vote - see 9.26am). Some 34 Conservatives voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal in the third and last vote. According to Wickham, another 35 backbenchers have joined them in the rebel camp, taking the total number who will vote against the Wab to 69. Two pro-European peers have announced that they are voting Lib Dem in the European elections, even though they sit in the House of Lords representing other parties. This is from Andrew Cooper, a former director of strategy for David Cameron in Downing Street. In response, the Tories said Cooper would lose the party whip. A party spokesman said: Publicly endorsing the candidates of another party is not compatible with taking the Conservative whip in Parliament. As a result, the chief whip in the House of Lords has informed Lord Cooper of Windrush that he will have the Conservative whip suspended. This will be reviewed if he is willing to support Conservative candidates at future elections. And these are from Michael Cashman, the former actor and former MEP, who until today was a Labour peer. Here is some Twitter comment on the Michael Gove Today interview. From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From the Guardian\u2019s Paul Johnson From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall In 2016, during the Conservative leadership contest, Michael Gove famously declared that, on the basis of his experience as Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign manager, he had concluded that Johnson was not fit to be prime minister. Now Gove has a different view. Asked about the prospect of a Johnson premiership, he said: My view is that Boris served as foreign secretary with distinction. I enjoyed working with him. I have huge admiration for him ... Boris Johnson is a Conservative of flair, elan, distinction and intellect. I think Boris will make his case and it\u2019s important that we give him the chance to make his case. Gove did not go as far as endorsing Johnson for leader, but that was not surprising because he is expected to declare his candidature himself. All political leaders see their careers come to an end and often the end is wretched, because they are forced out through failure or unpopularity. To her credit, Theresa May has endured far longer than most people expected after she bungled the 2017 general election - George Osborne\u2019s prediction about her being a \u201cdead woman walking\u201d almost two years ago turned out to be wrong - but now, particularly in the light of the dismal reception her \u201cNew Brexit Deal\u201d is getting, her premiership seems to be on its deathbed. This became evidence when Michael Gove, the environment secretary, was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. Gove is the cabinet\u2019s most accomplished media performer, and Downing Street normally send him out when the stakes are particularly high. He was the minister who summed up for the government in the no-confidence vote in January, when he praised May handsomely. But today even Gove was struggling to pretend all was well. There were three lines that particularly stood out. Gove suggested that the government might abandon the planned vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill. He said the bill was being published today, and the government has already said it will get its second reading in the week beginning 3 June. But many Tories think there is no point in having a vote if the government is going to lose and Gove was evasive on whether the vote would take place. When Mishal Husain asked if the government was still going ahead with the vote, he replied: There has been a lot of \u2018sturm und drang\u2019, a lot of summer lightning, of the course of the last 24 hours. But I think it is important that we all take a little bit of time and step back. Because ultimately we have three choices: we can either choose to leave the European Union with a deal, we can leave the European Union without a deal or we can stay in the European Union ... Husain pointed out that Gove had not answered the question. For a second time he dodged it as he used his answer to criticise Labour. Later in the interview Husain tried again. She said Gove still had not said if the vote was going ahead. He replied: I think that we will reflect over the course of the next few days on how people look at the proposition that has been put forward. So it might not happen, Husain said. Gove replied: No, I think there has to be a vote of on a withdrawal agreement implementation bill because one thing that we know is that, without a withdrawal agreement implementation bill, you can\u2019t leave the European Union without a deal. Rather than saying anything precipitate, I think that everyone should take an opportunity to reflect on what the prime minister will say later today and to look at the bill. What was significant about this is that Gove was talking about a possible future vote on a withdrawal agreement bill, not on the withdrawal agreement bill. He was implying the vote could be delayed until a new PM drafts new legislation. Gove implied that the EU withdrawal agreement bill might have to be rewritten. Gove did not challenge suggestions that it was time for May to stand down. Asked if May should stay in post, he replied: I think the most important thing we can do is reflect on all the options in front of us. I can understand the strong feelings - I have strong feelings - on leaving the European Union that have been aired and articulated over the course of the last 24 hours. Husain said the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee might tried to force her out after the European elections and she asked if May would still be prime minister on Tuesday next week. At first Gove dodged the question, saying that as a cabinet minster he was not involved in 1922 Committee decision. When Husain pointed out that he was not even willing to say May would still be PM on Tuesday, he replied: Oh, I think the prime minister will be prime minister next Tuesday, yes. But, when asked for how long May would stay in office, Gove said that May had already, in a \u201cgracious and self-sacrificing\u201d way, agreed to stand down. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, gives a speech to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 9am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, and Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, take part in a Euro elections debate organised by the Telegraph. It is being streamed online here. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 1pm: May makes a statement to MPs about her so-called \u201cNew Brexit Deal\u201d. At some point today the government is also publishing its EU withdrawal agreement bill. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I will be mostly focusing on Brexit and May\u2019s future as PM. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",
