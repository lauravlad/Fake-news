After Flaks\u2019 video went viral, the Liberal Democrats wrote to media regulator Ofcom to complain about the BBC\u2019s decision to remove the laughter from the lunchtime bulletin.

A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThis clip from the BBC\u2019s Question Time special, which was played in full on the News at Ten on Friday evening and on other outlets, was shortened for timing reasons on Saturday\u2019s lunchtime bulletin, to edit out a repetitious phrase from Boris Johnson. \u201cHowever, in doing so we also edited out laughter from the audience. Although there was absolutely no intention to mislead, we accept that this was a mistake on our part, as it didn\u2019t reflect the full reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s answer. We did not alter the soundtrack or image in any way apart from this edit, contrary to some claims on social media.\u201d",

Blair said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No-deal Brexit is not off the table. It is slap bang in the middle of it and if they mean their manifesto commitment to no extension past 2020, it is the probable outcome. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Blair implied that people should vote tactically for remain candidates. But he did not formally endorse any non-Labour candidates, and he confirmed that he would be voting Labour himself. Alastair Campbell, his former spin doctor, was expelled for Labour for saying he voted Lib Dem in the European elections, but Blair sounded determined to stay a member of the party so that he can participate in the debate about its post-Corbyn future that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddbab268f080fd59fb16d6a#block-5ddbab268f080fd59fb16d6a\">he suggested might start quite soon.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Liberal Democrats have sought to make Boris Johnson\u2019s character flaws an election issue, with Chuka Umunna, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, saying that </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddbc68e8f083aa6d578ab26#block-5ddbc68e8f083aa6d578ab26\"><strong>Johnson\u2019s record of lying and using racist and bigoted language makes him unfit to be PM.</strong> </a>Umunna used the argument in a speech in which he argued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/chuka-umunna-attacks-boris-johnson-for-following-the-trump-playbook\">a win for Johnson would be victory for Trump-style, rightwing nationalist populism.</a> The reception Johnson has received on some visits, and the response he encountered on Question Time on Friday, suggest that for some voters his integrity is a critical election issue. But that does not necessarily mean that the Lib Dems, or anyone else, will be able to use arguments like this to shift opinion within the next two and a half weeks. <strong>Andrew Gimson</strong>, author of biography of Johnson, has argued that attacks on Johnson\u2019s probity are likely to fail because<a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2019/11/johnsons-critics-will-get-nowhere-by-calling-him-a-liar.html\"> \u201cvoters can allow \u2013 or not \u2013 for a candidate\u2019s frailties, and may prefer to be led by a prime minister who does not pose as a pillar of rectitude\u201d.</a> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has dismissed criticism that his manifesto promise to deliver 50,000 more nurses is bogus because this figure includes staff being retained,</strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddc03238f087b800b620dd7#block-5ddc03238f087b800b620dd7\"> saying without government action there would be 50,000 fewer nurses.</a> </strong>Speaking at the launch of the Welsh Conservative election manifesto, he claimed that Wales was closer to China than New Zealand is. Showing uncharacteristic concern for factual accuracy when making an outlandish claim in an off-the-cuff speech, he asked someone to check that this was true. He was told it was true.

Asked by reporters if the pledge was nothing more than sleight of hand, he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me absolutely clear these are 50,000 more nurses. If we weren\u2019t doing this we would have 50,000 fewer nurses.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A pledge in the UK Tory manifesto to recruit 50,000 nurses on Sunday unravelled as it became clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/will-a-conservative-government-deliver-50000-more-nurses\">many of these would not actually be new but would include those who had been retained.</a></p> \n  <p>In Wrexham Johnson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The risk is that if we hadn\u2019t taken the action we are taking then those nurses who would otherwise not have been retained will be retrained. That is a breakthrough.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The prime minister also insisted that new, profitable markets would open up for Welsh farmers after Brexit. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will make sure we open up new markets for Welsh lamb. Why should New Zealand be supplying huge quantities of lamb to China when as far as I know Wales is closer to Chinas than New Zealand is?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He then got a Tory supporter in the audience to google whether Wales was in fact close to China.</p> \n  <p>Many farmers are terrified that a hard Brexit will lead to soaring tariffs. Johnson said: \u201cPeople are yearning, aching to get Brexit done.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He described incompetently shearing a sheep at the Royal Wales Winter Show but said as the ewe looked up at him with \u201cimploring eyes\u201d he consoled himself with the idea that at least he wasn\u2019t fleecing the country, as he said Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would if they got into power.</p> \n  <p>Johnson said the Tories would protect Welsh steel workers and would tackle congestion at the notorious Brynglas Tunnels on the M4 in south Wales, which he compared to the blocked up nostrils of a Welsh dragon.</p> \n  <p>He rejected the notion that the Tories should be ashamed of the impact austerity has had on Wales, arguing the Conservatives had to run the economy sensibly following Labour mismanagement, but said Wales could look forward to an \u201cinfrastructure revolution\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Earlier the Tory leader at the Welsh assembly, Paul Davies, described the Labour-led Welsh government as a \u201cCorbynite\u201d one and attacked its record on health and education.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3627943dc3a8ca0a9bac003e1f4d3b0798b20fcf\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3627943dc3a8ca0a9bac003e1f4d3b0798b20fcf/0_71_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at the launch of the Conservative party Welsh manifesto in Wrexham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at the launch of the Conservative party Welsh manifesto in Wrexham.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddbfb448f080fd59fb170ac\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-25T16:35:29.158Z\">4.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tactical voting could cut Johnson's majority to zero, says Gina Miller</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the light of what happened in recent elections many of those active in politics are wary of relying too much on opinion polls. But it was hard for opposition parties to read yesterday\u2019s papers without some sense of despair. The Observer reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/tories-renewed-poll-boost-brexit-party-candidates-pull-out-opinium-observer\">a poll giving the Tories a 19-point lead. </a>The Sunday Times <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tory-manifesto-boris-pledges-not-to-raise-your-taxes-xnwt2x332\">in its splash (paywall)</a> reported on a Datapraxis analysis, based on 270,000 voter interviews by YouGov, suggesting \u201cthe Conservatives are on course to win 349 seats, enough for a majority of 48.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But today <strong>Gina Miller</strong>, the anti-Brexit campaigner who is running a tactical voting campaign, Remain United, has urged fellow remainers not to despair. In a statement she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>People are getting despondent when they read the headlines forgetting that in 2017, the 15% lead was supposed to translate to a 100+ seat majority for Mrs May.

It is not the most insightful book about Churchill, but Johnson clearly identifies with the great war leader and there are many passages in the book that read as self-referential. The chapter on how Churchill crafted his own image is a good example. Here is an extract on Churchill\u2019s approach to photo opportunities.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All his life [Churchill] had been a showman, an extrovert, theatrical, comical: there is a photo of him dressed for a fancy-dress ball at Sandhurst \u2013 meticulously made up, with carefully applied white face paint, as Pierrot the Clown.</p> \n   <p>He knew how to project his personality, and the war called for someone who could create an image of himself \u2013 decisive, combative, but also cheery and encouraging \u2013 in the minds of the people ...</p> \n   <p>With his ludicrous hats and rompers and cigars and excess alcohol, he contrived physically to represent the central idea of his own political philosophy: the inalienable right of the British people to live their lives in freedom, to do their own thing.</p> \n   <p>You only had to look at Churchill, and see the vital difference between his way of life and the ghastly seriousness and uniformity and pomposity of the Nazis. Never forget: Hitler was a teetotaller, a deformity that accounts for much misery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson wrote that in 2014, long before he ever imagined he would be fighting an election campaign against Jeremy Corbyn, who also happens to be teetotal.

Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the manifesto was so empty that it would be thin for a budget let alone a multi-year programme for government. It means Johnson would undoubtedly come up with other plans for taxes, social care, and other big issues that are not in the manifesto. But in reality, a lot of a new Tory government\u2019s time is still going to be spent on sorting out Brexit, including aiming for a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What plans have the Conservative party to eliminate people\u2019s reliance on food banks and when will they be gone? Anonymous, retired civil servant, East Yorkshire</em></p> \n  <p>There is no mention of food banks or eliminating their use in the Tory manifesto. The prime minister was asked about this by an audience member at Friday night\u2019s Question Time debate. He said: \u201cOf course we want to deal with not just the expression of poverty but also the causes of poverty. And that means dealing with educational standing.

Speaking at the launch of his party\u2019s manifesto at a further education college in Wrexham, Drakeford said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I believe that when the history of our times is written, this general election will stand as a moment of profound and lasting change \u2013 a time when our nation, our economy, our public services and our planet set out on a different course.</p> \n   <p>The destructive policies of the UK Conservative government have left our communities damaged, our economy one of the most unequal in Europe and the UK ill-prepared for the climate emergency it now faces. This election is the chance to put that right.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Drakeford said that many of the radical policies that the UK Labour party wanted to introduce in England had already been implemented in Wales, such as free prescriptions; free school breakfasts, free hospital parking, the abolition of right to buy, keeping guards on trains and banning fracking.</p> \n  <p>He said UK Labour\u2019s plans to end austerity would mean a \u00a33.4bn increase to Wales\u2019 annual budget. The party promised to revive the stalled Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project, work with people on the island of Anglesey to \u201cmaximise its potential for new nuclear energy\u201d and invest in railways.</p> \n  <p>On Brexit, Drakeford made it clear that the Welsh Labour government would campaign \u201cunapologetically, unreservedly and enthusiastically to remain\u201d. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Three years on from the 2016 EU referendum we understand so much more about how Wales is uniquely exposed to a hardline Boris Johnson Brexit, about the devastation it would do to our manufacturing industry, about the protections it would shear from working people. About the damage it would do to individuals, business and communities the length and the breadth of Wales.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He ended his speech by quoting Aneurin Bevan, who said: \u201cPrivate charity can never be a substitute for organised justice.\u201d Drakeford added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That is, at root, the choice at stake in this election.

It should be an issue in a general election when you are talking about giving somebody the keys to No 10 for another five years.</p> \n   <p>And so, clearly, I do not believe he is fit to be prime minister.

That probably won\u2019t worry the respective party leaderships very much; Tory Brexiters and Labour Corbynites are both united in their scorn for Blair and much of what he represents, and they tend to believe that any criticism from the former PM ends up being counterproductive. Maybe with some audiences it is, but Blair can still present a political argument with a clarity that very few others can match.</p> \n  <p>At one point quite recently it was assumed that Blair was hoping a new centrist party might emerge to challenge Labour. But the demise of Change UK may have killed that off as an aspiration for the foreseeable future, and one of the interesting features of the Q&amp;A was Blair\u2019s confirmation that he wants to stay in the Labour party to contribute to the debate he expects it to be having about its post-Corbyn future after the election.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from the speech and Q&amp;A.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Blair accused both the Conservatives and Labour of peddling \u201cfantasies\u201d to voters in the election campaign.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddb9bee8f087b800b62099e#block-5ddb9bee8f087b800b62099e\"> 9.17am</a>.) He also said in that Q&amp;A that as a result he did not think it would be good for the country for either main party to win a majority.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Both as majority governments pose a risk. It\u2019s just that the chances I think of Labour doing that are - if the polls are right - negligible ...

But Blair said a trade deal within this timeframe would only be acceptable if the UK agreed to stay aligned to the single market \u2013 an option Johnson has ruled out. (See <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddb9c568f080fd59fb16d11#block-5ddb9c568f080fd59fb16d11\">9.21am</a>.)

This is an argument that Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon have also been making forcefully.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said a no-deal Brexit was now a \u201cprobable outcome\u201d if Johnson was telling the truth about not being willing to extend the Brexit transition.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/25/general-election-corbyn-to-make-big-housing-pledge-as-tories-set-low-spending-bar-live?page=with:block-5ddb95658f083aa6d578a982#block-5ddb95658f083aa6d578a982\"> 8.57am</a>.) In the Q&amp;A he also said he did not think Tory Brexiters understood how damaging a no-deal Brexit would be. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Within the Conservative cabinet there are people who are ardent Brexiters. They are perfectly content if Britain goes out without a deal and trades on WTO terms. Now, I think a lot of them have no idea what WTO terms really mean.

There is one general election but 650 mini-elections and each one matters.</p> \n   <p>There are good, solid mainstream, independent-minded MPs and candidates in both parties.

Blair said as a former party leader he was in a special category, and he implied that he thought it was important to remain as a party member (he would get thrown out if he publicly backed a candidate from another party) because he wanted to have a say in the party\u2019s post-Corbyn future. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019ve said why I\u2019ve got to vote Labour - one thing, by the way, there will be an enormous debate I feel coming in the Labour party at a certain point and it\u2019s important \u2013 I\u2019m in a particular position, there\u2019s one of me. But I can understand why the people I know in the same constituency as me who will be voting for Chuka Umunna.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he thought the chances of an outright Labour majority were \u201cnegligible\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said British politics was chaotic, crazy and \u201cutterly dysfunctional\u201d.</strong> He said this could end up causing \u201cserious economic and social damage\u201d to the UK.

When it was put to him that strengthening protections for tenants might make landlords less willing to rent, he said that in Germany regulation of this market was stronger, but the size of the rental market was also much bigger.</p> \n  <p>Healey was also asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/labour-fifty-eight-billion-pound-pledge-women-pension-age-trap\">why Labour was now committed to spending \u00a358bn compensating women who lost out from the sharp increase in the state pension age. </a>This plan was not in Labour\u2019s manifesto, and the cost was not included in the costings document that was published alongside the manifesto. Labour says it will raise the \u00a358bn from borrowing.</p> \n  <p>When it was put to Healey that this plan contravened Labour\u2019s promise to borrow only to invest, he said this was not normal government spending.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair, the former prime minister and the last Labour leader to win a general election, has given a withering assessment of both main parties in his first significant intervention of the campaign. Describing British politics as chaotic, crazy and \u201cutterly dysfunctional\u201d, he said that both main parties were \u201cpeddling fantasies\u201d, and that he did not want either of them to form a majority government. He was particularly critical of Boris Johnson, saying that he had no chance of negotiating a Canada-style trade deal with the EU before the end of next year and that if Johnson was telling the truth about not being willing to extend the Brexit transition (admittedly, quite a big if, given Johnson\u2019s record when it comes to Brexit extensions), then a no-deal Brexit was the \u201cprobable outcome\u201d. Blair said: No-deal Brexit is not off the table. It is slap bang in the middle of it and if they mean their manifesto commitment to no extension past 2020, it is the probable outcome. Blair implied that people should vote tactically for remain candidates. But he did not formally endorse any non-Labour candidates, and he confirmed that he would be voting Labour himself. Alastair Campbell, his former spin doctor, was expelled for Labour for saying he voted Lib Dem in the European elections, but Blair sounded determined to stay a member of the party so that he can participate in the debate about its post-Corbyn future that he suggested might start quite soon. The Liberal Democrats have sought to make Boris Johnson\u2019s character flaws an election issue, with Chuka Umunna, the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, saying that Johnson\u2019s record of lying and using racist and bigoted language makes him unfit to be PM. Umunna used the argument in a speech in which he argued a win for Johnson would be victory for Trump-style, rightwing nationalist populism. The reception Johnson has received on some visits, and the response he encountered on Question Time on Friday, suggest that for some voters his integrity is a critical election issue. But that does not necessarily mean that the Lib Dems, or anyone else, will be able to use arguments like this to shift opinion within the next two and a half weeks. Andrew Gimson, author of biography of Johnson, has argued that attacks on Johnson\u2019s probity are likely to fail because \u201cvoters can allow \u2013 or not \u2013 for a candidate\u2019s frailties, and may prefer to be led by a prime minister who does not pose as a pillar of rectitude\u201d. Boris Johnson has dismissed criticism that his manifesto promise to deliver 50,000 more nurses is bogus because this figure includes staff being retained, saying without government action there would be 50,000 fewer nurses. Speaking at the launch of the Welsh Conservative election manifesto, he claimed that Wales was closer to China than New Zealand is. Showing uncharacteristic concern for factual accuracy when making an outlandish claim in an off-the-cuff speech, he asked someone to check that this was true. He was told it was true. However, as various people have pointed out on Twitter, he was missing the point. Rather, he was missing two points. A poll for ITV and Cardiff University has shown Labour up nine points in Wales since the start of the month. Over the same period the Conservatives are up four points, the poll suggests. The government has announced plans for a slimmed-down Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday 19 December, as Boris Johnson has said he would want to push through his Brexit bill as soon as possible if he wins a majority. Stormzy has thrown his support behind the Labour party and called on people to register to vote to \u201cend austerity, rebuild our communities and take back the means to change our lives for the better\u201d. He did so in a letter to the Guardian which you can read here. That\u2019s all from us for tonight. Thanks for the comments. The Scottish Greens have proposed controls over executive pay, a four-day working week and trials of a universal basic income, arguing that wealth inequality increases climate emissions. Although it is thin on detail, the party\u2019s Westminster manifesto proposes a pay cap to limit salaries for public sector chief executives to 10 times that of the lowest paid, and moves to cap executive pay in the private sector; a new wealth tax on the richest !% and a land value tax to replace council tax. It says: Our vision is to ensure everyone earns enough to allow us to phase in a four-day working week, shifting our society away from excessive working hours and towards one that values community action, caring and learning. The Scottish Greens, who are independent of the Green party in England and Wales, are a co-signatory of the \u201cgreen new deal\u201d championed by its sister party but there are subtle differences in approach. The Scottish Greens are pressing for North Sea oil fields to be shut down, but they do not share the Green party\u2019s call for carbon emissions target of net zero by 2030. Instead their manifesto adopts the less ambitious stance the Scottish Greens took at Holyrood calling for an 80% cut by 2030. The Greens in England and Wales want to introduce a universal basic income of \u00a389 a week for adults; the Scottish party only wants further trials to see if it works. Devolution of significant areas in domestic policy to Holyrood, including over education, transport, health and the environment, strips out many policies an English party would set out in detail for a Westminster election. But on many headline UK-level topics \u2013 backing remain if there is a second EU referendum, introducing proportional representation for Westminster and abolishing the Lords - the two parties\u2019 stances are the same. While the Scottish Greens benefit from PR in Scottish parliament elections, holding six seats at Holyrood, unlike the English Greens the Scottish party has never had an MP elected. The latest Westminster polls in Scotland suggest that will not change on 12 December: the Scottish Greens are polling at around 4% nationwide. Boris Johnson was challenged about his claim that a Conservative government would deliver 50,000 more nurses as he launched the Welsh Tories\u2019 manifesto at Wrexham racecourse. Asked by reporters if the pledge was nothing more than sleight of hand, he said: Let me absolutely clear these are 50,000 more nurses. If we weren\u2019t doing this we would have 50,000 fewer nurses. A pledge in the UK Tory manifesto to recruit 50,000 nurses on Sunday unravelled as it became clear that many of these would not actually be new but would include those who had been retained. In Wrexham Johnson said: The risk is that if we hadn\u2019t taken the action we are taking then those nurses who would otherwise not have been retained will be retrained. That is a breakthrough. The prime minister also insisted that new, profitable markets would open up for Welsh farmers after Brexit. He said: We will make sure we open up new markets for Welsh lamb. Why should New Zealand be supplying huge quantities of lamb to China when as far as I know Wales is closer to Chinas than New Zealand is? He then got a Tory supporter in the audience to google whether Wales was in fact close to China. Many farmers are terrified that a hard Brexit will lead to soaring tariffs. Johnson said: \u201cPeople are yearning, aching to get Brexit done.\u201d He described incompetently shearing a sheep at the Royal Wales Winter Show but said as the ewe looked up at him with \u201cimploring eyes\u201d he consoled himself with the idea that at least he wasn\u2019t fleecing the country, as he said Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would if they got into power. Johnson said the Tories would protect Welsh steel workers and would tackle congestion at the notorious Brynglas Tunnels on the M4 in south Wales, which he compared to the blocked up nostrils of a Welsh dragon. He rejected the notion that the Tories should be ashamed of the impact austerity has had on Wales, arguing the Conservatives had to run the economy sensibly following Labour mismanagement, but said Wales could look forward to an \u201cinfrastructure revolution\u201d. Earlier the Tory leader at the Welsh assembly, Paul Davies, described the Labour-led Welsh government as a \u201cCorbynite\u201d one and attacked its record on health and education. In the light of what happened in recent elections many of those active in politics are wary of relying too much on opinion polls. But it was hard for opposition parties to read yesterday\u2019s papers without some sense of despair. The Observer reported on a poll giving the Tories a 19-point lead. The Sunday Times in its splash (paywall) reported on a Datapraxis analysis, based on 270,000 voter interviews by YouGov, suggesting \u201cthe Conservatives are on course to win 349 seats, enough for a majority of 48.\u201d But today Gina Miller, the anti-Brexit campaigner who is running a tactical voting campaign, Remain United, has urged fellow remainers not to despair. In a statement she said: People are getting despondent when they read the headlines forgetting that in 2017, the 15% lead was supposed to translate to a 100+ seat majority for Mrs May. Remain United\u2019s data points to a Boris Johnson majority of 70 seats, but this could shrink to zero with pro-remain smart tactical voting, as it did in 2017. Remain United has a website giving advice on how to vote tactically on a constituency by constituency basis. It is here. Its recommendations get updated as new polling figures come in. To make life complicated, this is one of at least five websites giving advice on tactical voting. The others include. The People\u2019s Vote one The Best for Britain one The tactical.vote one The tacticalvote one If this makes it all sound confusing, the blogger Jon Worth has written a useful post explaining where these five sites differ in their recommendations and offering further guidance. Tactical.vote also has the equivalent of a price comparison website - a table explaining what all five sites recommend on a constituency by constituency basis. Tomorrow is the deadline for registering to vote. If you are not registered, there are details of how to do it here. Here\u2019s John Lennon, from beyond the grave, joining those saying it\u2019s a good idea. Boris Johnson is not giving many formal speeches during the election campaign, and he is not spending much time either taking questions from journalists. But he is frequently posing for pictures, often giving the impression that he is clowning around, and he was at it again today, at the Royal Welsh Winter Show. There is a video version too. For an understanding of why Johnson thinks all this matters, it is worth reading the closest thing he has ever written to an autobiography \u2013 his book about Winston Churchill, called The Churchill Factor. It is not the most insightful book about Churchill, but Johnson clearly identifies with the great war leader and there are many passages in the book that read as self-referential. The chapter on how Churchill crafted his own image is a good example. Here is an extract on Churchill\u2019s approach to photo opportunities. All his life [Churchill] had been a showman, an extrovert, theatrical, comical: there is a photo of him dressed for a fancy-dress ball at Sandhurst \u2013 meticulously made up, with carefully applied white face paint, as Pierrot the Clown. He knew how to project his personality, and the war called for someone who could create an image of himself \u2013 decisive, combative, but also cheery and encouraging \u2013 in the minds of the people ... With his ludicrous hats and rompers and cigars and excess alcohol, he contrived physically to represent the central idea of his own political philosophy: the inalienable right of the British people to live their lives in freedom, to do their own thing. You only had to look at Churchill, and see the vital difference between his way of life and the ghastly seriousness and uniformity and pomposity of the Nazis. Never forget: Hitler was a teetotaller, a deformity that accounts for much misery. Johnson wrote that in 2014, long before he ever imagined he would be fighting an election campaign against Jeremy Corbyn, who also happens to be teetotal. But so is Johnson himself at the moment; he claims to have given up alcohol until Brexit is delivered. Boris Johnson is giving a speech in Wales. It is mostly a standard stump speech, but Johnson has just said that Wales is closer to China than New Zealand is. Expressing an uncharacteristic concern for factual accuracy, he asked someone in the audience to check that this claim was actually true. It was, he was told. He was making a point about export opportunities after Brexit. After a few minutes, Sky News abandoned their live coverage, so if there were any more gems, I\u2019ve missed them. But a colleague is at the event and will be sending me some copy later. Ian Taylor, who was Conservative MP for Esher and Walton until 2010 and who was a prominent pro-European in the party, is backing the Lib Dem candidate in his old constituency, Monica Harding, and not his Tory successor, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary. Taylor has explained why in an open letter to his old constituents. He says a hung parliament could lead to a second referendum, and that that could lead to a remain vote, which he says would be best for the country. Harding has welcomed Taylor\u2019s endorsement. Raab had a majority of more than 23,000 at the last election. But yesterday a report in the Sunday Times (paywall) claimed that he was one of seven prominent Tory Brexiters at risk of losing their seats, according to one polling analysis. The Scottish Greens have said it would be a mistake for a Scottish independence referendum to be delayed until after a Brexit transition period. As PA Media reports, speaking at the party\u2019s manifesto launch in Glasgow, co-leader Patrick Harvie said a second independence referendum should take in 2020 if Brexit goes ahead in January. Explaining his position, which is the same as the SNP\u2019s on the timing of a second independence referendum, Harvie said: If [Brexit] isn\u2019t stopped, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to say that on that timescale, that transition timescale when every other country in Europe has a say on our future, when the UK has a say on our future, Scotland should also have a say in its own future. If Scotland was to vote for independence within that timescale, then you have the option of ensuring that our transition to EU membership as an independent country can be smoothed. I think it would be a mistake to leave it until after that transition period had ended. So it\u2019s an entirely reasonable ask. I do think, however, and I want to stress this, Brexit can be stopped, should be stopped and we absolutely commit to ensuring that Green voices will advocate for the public to have the final say on any withdrawal agreement that any UK government wants to promote. Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed date for the Queen\u2019s speech (see 12.43pm) would fall on the day the monarch usually departs for her festive break at Sandringham, the Press Association reports. The Queen, 93, often travels to her Norfolk estate on the Thursday before Christmas, having hosted a family lunch for the royals at Buckingham Palace that week. This is from Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader seeking re-election in Chingford and Woodford Green. His Labour opponent, Faiza Shaheen, has condemned the attack. Next up will be the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart. She will be answering any questions you may have about the Labour party\u2019s manifesto, campaign and policies at 12.30pm on Wednesday. You can ask your question via our form here. Q: Does the manifesto mention whether the Conservatives support reform of the Gender Recognition Act to allow self-identification of gender \u2013 as the Lib Dems and Labour do? By the way what happened to the results of the 2018 consultation on this reform? Anonymous, London Johnson\u2019s government has downgraded reform of the Gender Recognition Act as a priority, although it denies that it has been dropped altogether. There is no mention of either transgender rights or self-identification in the manifesto. Q: Boris\u2019s agreement: when do we see it and can parliament scrutinise, amend and agree it \u2013 or will they? Mike Humphrey, retired, Glasgow The new withdrawal agreement and political declaration is published here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration. If Boris Johnson is returned with a majority, he will attempt to rush some or all of it through parliament after a Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday 19 December. MPs will probably have limited time to debate it but all Tory candidates have signed up to supporting the text as it stands so would be certain to vote it through at the earliest opportunity. Q: Have they outlined any details of how their Australian-style points-based immigration policy will work. Robert Greasley, 63, retired police officer, Volkringhausen, Germany In the party\u2019s manifesto, the document said the new system would prioritise those who 1) Have a good grasp of English 2) Have been law-abiding citizens in their own countries 3) Have good education and qualifications. It also said \u201cmost people coming into the country will need a clear job offer\u201d. It does not explain how it would work to bring over family members to live in the UK, but says it would equalise the system for EU and non-EU citizens so the best guess is that the rules applying to the rest of the world would apply to family members from the EU. Q: Do they intend to maintain the marriage allowance? That is the \u00a3250 from the transferable tax allowance if one partner has income below the tax threshold? D, Wales The Conservatives made no mention of the marriage tax allowance, suggesting they would maintain it but changes can be made at any fiscal event. Both Labour and the Lib Dems have said they would axe it. Q: There has been no or little mention of Leveson two? Has this been dropped by all the parties? Anonymous, Pudsey The Tories have said they will drop Leveson two and \u201crepeal section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2014, which seeks to coerce the press\u201d. That is the clause that would force newspapers to pay both sides\u2019 costs when losing or winning defamation and privacy cases if they have not signed up to a royal charter-approved regulator. Labour says it would \u201caddress misconduct and the unresolved failures of corporate governance raised by the second stage of the abandoned Leveson inquiry\u201d. Q: Would it be of any use in the outside toilet, either for wiping, or blocking the door draughts? Chris, 71, retired headmaster, Bury St Edmunds It is quite a shiny document, so not great for absorption. But might be more useful under a door or propping up a table leg. Only 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the Tory manifesto. Send them into us here. Q: Is there five-years\u2019 worth of action in there? Is there a perception about where the Tories intend on going, as a country? Anonymous, SW Scotland Definitely not \u2013 although the manifesto does commit to repealing the Fixed-term Parliamenta Act, so it might not be five years until the next election. Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the manifesto was so empty that it would be thin for a budget let alone a multi-year programme for government. It means Johnson would undoubtedly come up with other plans for taxes, social care, and other big issues that are not in the manifesto. But in reality, a lot of a new Tory government\u2019s time is still going to be spent on sorting out Brexit, including aiming for a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020. Q: What plans have the Conservative party to eliminate people\u2019s reliance on food banks and when will they be gone? Anonymous, retired civil servant, East Yorkshire There is no mention of food banks or eliminating their use in the Tory manifesto. The prime minister was asked about this by an audience member at Friday night\u2019s Question Time debate. He said: \u201cOf course we want to deal with not just the expression of poverty but also the causes of poverty. And that means dealing with educational standing. It means spreading ambition and hope around the country by investing in education and investing in social services.\u201d Q: Does the Tory manifesto promise to address the Waspi women\u2019s pension issue and if so what measures are envisaged and at what cost? Anonymous, Carlisle No there is no promise to the Waspi women in the manifesto, unlike Labour\u2019s promise to compensate them with \u00a358bn for the rise in their pension age. Boris Johnson has said: \u201cWe have looked at it and looked at it and I would love to magic you a solution but it is very expensive to come up with the solution that you want.\u201d And this is what Jeremy Corbyn said in response to Tony Blair\u2019s claim that Labour and the Conservatives are both peddling \u201cfantasies\u201d. (See 11.27am.) Corbyn replied: I simply invite all those who are looking at it to recognise what we have put forward is a sensible, costed plan of how we can improve public services and life opportunities in this country, and develop an economy for the futures at the same time as meeting our net zero requirements for environmental sustainability. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in Derbyshire this morning when asked if his \u00a358bn promise to pay compensation to the so-called Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women meant Labour was breaking its promise to borrow only to invest. He replied: It\u2019s a moral debt we owe to these women and, had the court case gone the other way, or another court case goes against the government, the government would have to pay, the government is obliged to pay ... What we\u2019re saying is we will pay it. Here are some more of your questions answered: Q: Has the Tory manifesto been clearly costed and when will it be released for public scrutiny? I would like to read it as I don\u2019t trust the accuracy and completeness of media coverage, or sadly promises made by our current prime minister, as he has proven time and again that he lacks integrity. Anonymous, Eastbourne It is available here: https://vote.conservatives.com/our-plan Q: Has it been independently costed? Anonymous, London The Tory manifesto has been costed but not independently. Q: On BBC Question Time, Boris Johnson appeared to be wearing a \u2018hearing aid\u2019 in his right ear. If he was, presumably this was so that someone could speak to him, perhaps give him the answers. Do you know anything about this? Or was it fake news? Robert, Retired NHS surgeon, Dungannon I\u2019m afraid this was a false rumour. Johnson has a slightly unusual looking right ear that sometimes reflects the light in an odd way. There was definitely no earpiece. Some of you have been sending in your questions about the Tory manifesto. I will be answering them until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: As the proposed increase in national insurance allowance will not be of benefit to pensioners, are there any tax incentives to encourage older people to vote for the Conservatives? Anonymous, Lancashire Not really. There is the so-called triple lock that guarantees that the basic state pension will rise by a minimum of either 2.5%, the rate of inflation or average earnings growth, whichever is largest. But there is not much else and no pledge to restore free TV licences for over-75s. Q: What\u2019s happened to the national insurance threshold increase promised by Johnson? William, Portugal This was promised in the Tory manifesto. The party is saying it will raise it to \u00a39,500 next year \u2013 amounting to a tax cut of around \u00a385 per household. A longer term raising of the threshold to \u00a312,500 is planned amounting to \u00a3500 but there is no word on when this will actually happen. Q: Why couldn\u2019t Boris give a straight answer to the Guardian\u2019s question regarding factcheck? Jay, 47, Hertfordshire It can only mean he does not want to criticise the Tory fake fact-check stunt because he knows very well what the problem was and accusations are. He was asked a similar question off-camera last week, so it was obfuscation to say that he hadn\u2019t been paying attention. The Welsh Labour leader and first minister, Mark Drakeford, has described this as the most important general election since 1945. Speaking at the launch of his party\u2019s manifesto at a further education college in Wrexham, Drakeford said: I believe that when the history of our times is written, this general election will stand as a moment of profound and lasting change \u2013 a time when our nation, our economy, our public services and our planet set out on a different course. The destructive policies of the UK Conservative government have left our communities damaged, our economy one of the most unequal in Europe and the UK ill-prepared for the climate emergency it now faces. This election is the chance to put that right. Drakeford said that many of the radical policies that the UK Labour party wanted to introduce in England had already been implemented in Wales, such as free prescriptions; free school breakfasts, free hospital parking, the abolition of right to buy, keeping guards on trains and banning fracking. He said UK Labour\u2019s plans to end austerity would mean a \u00a33.4bn increase to Wales\u2019 annual budget. The party promised to revive the stalled Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project, work with people on the island of Anglesey to \u201cmaximise its potential for new nuclear energy\u201d and invest in railways. On Brexit, Drakeford made it clear that the Welsh Labour government would campaign \u201cunapologetically, unreservedly and enthusiastically to remain\u201d. He said: Three years on from the 2016 EU referendum we understand so much more about how Wales is uniquely exposed to a hardline Boris Johnson Brexit, about the devastation it would do to our manufacturing industry, about the protections it would shear from working people. About the damage it would do to individuals, business and communities the length and the breadth of Wales. He ended his speech by quoting Aneurin Bevan, who said: \u201cPrivate charity can never be a substitute for organised justice.\u201d Drakeford added: That is, at root, the choice at stake in this election. A future where those whose needs are greatest will have to rely on the cold charity of Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg. Or our view of a kinder, stronger and more sustainable UK under Labour where our people, our nation and our planet is strengthened through fairness, equality and respect. The government has announced plans for a slimmed down Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday 19 December, as Boris Johnson has said he would want to push through his Brexit bill as soon as possible if he wins a majority. Preparations are being made for a curtailed process that cuts down on ceremony, in case Johnson is the new prime minister and wants to push ahead with a second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill before Christmas recess. The election is due to happen on 12 December and the results will emerge through the early hours of Friday 13 December. Parliament will then resume on Tuesday 16 December and then there would be the election of the new Speaker and several days of new MPs being sworn in. A Queen\u2019s speech would need to take place after that to allow legislation to brought forward, with the first and second readings of the Brexit bill possibly happening that week. A government spokesman said: The new parliament will be summoned to meet on Tuesday 17 December, when the business will be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of members. Should this prime minister return, the state opening of parliament and the Queen\u2019s speech will follow on Thursday 19 December. The state opening of parliament will take place with reduced ceremonial elements, as was the case following the early general election in 2017. This is due both to the early general election and the proximity of the state opening to Christmas. If there is a change of government following the election it is anticipated that the Queen\u2019s speech would be in January on a more usual timetable; but this would be a matter for the incoming administration. Q: Where will the 50,000 nurses come from? Robert Footman, Hong Kong Boris Johnson\u2019s nurse numbers are as follows: 12,500 from abroad, 14,000 from the undergraduate route and 5,000 nurse apprentices. That leaves 18,500 who are not new nurses but nurses would otherwise have left and have been retained in the profession by various incentives. The Tories argue improving retention rates is a way of boosting nurse numbers but Labour say the headline 50,000 figure is fake. Q: Much has been made of increases to public spending to the tune of \u00a32.9bn including 50,000 nurses. With no increases in taxes or national insurance who will this be paid for? Gareth Jenkins, Pwllheli, north Wales The biggest tranche of cash for this comes from a decision to postpone a cut in corporation tax, which Johnson claims will raise \u00a36bn. Tories have in the past argued corporation tax cuts don\u2019t cost any money but Johnson has acknowledged this is not really the case. Q: Can you really trust them to deliver any of this \u2013 even the ones that appear to be socially responsible like extra nurses? Brian Robinson, 65, Bristol That is something voters are going to have to grapple with. But Johnson\u2019s record on keeping pledges has not been great even in his short time as prime minister (leaving the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d by 31 October, tax cuts for higher earners). I\u2019m Rowena Mason, deputy political editor of the Guardian, and will be answering your questions about the Tory manifesto today. I have written about Westminster politics for eight years, covering three elections and two referendums. During this election, I have been tracking the Tories since Boris Johnson\u2019s first stump speech in Birmingham and was at the party\u2019s manifesto launch in Telford on Sunday. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. The Chuka Umunna Q&amp;A is now over. This is what Umunna said in response to the question from my colleague Peter Walker about whether he thought Boris Johnson was fit to be prime minister. Umunna replied: I am worried that you can say and do the things that Boris Johnson has done and for people to simply dismiss it as a factor that is priced in in this general election. I am alarmed that somebody can spew out the range of prejudice that has flowed from his mouth during his time in public office, and lie again and again and again, and it should not be an issue in a general election. It should be an issue in a general election when you are talking about giving somebody the keys to No 10 for another five years. And so, clearly, I do not believe he is fit to be prime minister. And if you look at the things he has said and done in his behaviour, which follows the Donald Trump playbook, that should disqualify him from being able to be in office in my view. And it is a perfectly legitimate point for us to be making in this general election campaign. Umunna did not give examples of Johnson lying in his examples, but there is at least one website devoted to false and misleading things Johnson has said. For examples of Johnson\u2019s displaying prejudice, the BBC\u2019s Fiona Bruce came out with a list on Question Time on Friday. Q: Do you believe your friend Tony Blair when he says he will not be voting for you personally? (See 11.27am.) Do you think he is telling the truth? Umunna says he did not see the Blair speech. He says he accepts Blair\u2019s point about how Blair is in a special position personally. But Umunna says he thinks Blair was saying other people in the Cities of London and Westminster would be voting for him. Q: Have you been surprised by the extent to which the Lib Dem vote is being squeezed? No, says Umunna. He says this is his first election as a Lib Dem. But older hands in the party tell him they are not surprised. Umunna says he thinks there will be more tactical voting during this election than in any election since 1997. Q: You did not mention revoking article 50. Have the Lib Dems abandoned this as a plan? No, says Umunna. He says it is still the case that, if they won a majority of MPs, they would revoke article 50. But the party is also campaigning for a people\u2019s vote. And, unlike Labour, all Lib Dem MPs would be campaigning for remain. Chuka Umunna is now taking questions at the end of his speech. Q: Was it a mistake for the Lib Dems to start the campaign by saying that Jo Swinson could end up being PM? Umunna says he does not accept that. It is the Lib Dems\u2019 job to fight every seat with the intention of trying to win. It would be strange if they said anything else, he says. He says it will be for the voters to decide how many MPs the Lib Dems get. Q: Do you think Boris Johnson is fit to be PM? Umunna says he is worried that Johnson can do what he does, and it is treated as if it is \u201cpriced in\u201d. He says he is worried that Johnson can \u201clie again and again and again\u201d, and spew out racist language in his career, and that this is not a general election issue. Here are some of the main lines from Chuka Umunna\u2019s speech, from the text released by the Lib Dems in advance. Umunna, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, said Britain could become a \u201cvassal state\u201d of the US under Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. He said: From my own contacts with the US government, it is clear a high price will be demanded and close alignment with US rules and regulation demanded \u2013 we risk becoming a vassal state of the US if Boris Johnson gets a majority. Leave the EU and the UK under Johnson will become President Trump\u2019s poodle. That is what is at stake at this election. Umunna said Johnson was as populist and rightwing as Donald Trump. He said: In his words and deeds [Trump] has been unafraid to engage in bigoted, racist, sexist, and Islamophobic behaviour, lie and break the law. All the same criticisms apply to the UK\u2019s prime minister who is following the Trump playbook and has become part of this global network of populist, right-wing, authoritarian nationalists. Giving Johnson a majority is to give carte blanche to this type of politics in the UK \u2013 something which should worry us all. Umunna confirmed the Liberal Democrats were committed to spending 2% of GDP on defence. As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. Today at 12.30pm, the deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, will answer your questions about the Tory manifesto, campaign and policies, just how realistic the pledges are and what they might mean for you. You can ask your question via our form here. Chuka Umunna, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, is giving a speech on foreign policy. There is a live feed here. Tony Blair was critical of both main parties in his speech and Q&amp;A this morning. That probably won\u2019t worry the respective party leaderships very much; Tory Brexiters and Labour Corbynites are both united in their scorn for Blair and much of what he represents, and they tend to believe that any criticism from the former PM ends up being counterproductive. Maybe with some audiences it is, but Blair can still present a political argument with a clarity that very few others can match. At one point quite recently it was assumed that Blair was hoping a new centrist party might emerge to challenge Labour. But the demise of Change UK may have killed that off as an aspiration for the foreseeable future, and one of the interesting features of the Q&amp;A was Blair\u2019s confirmation that he wants to stay in the Labour party to contribute to the debate he expects it to be having about its post-Corbyn future after the election. Here are the main points from the speech and Q&amp;A. Blair accused both the Conservatives and Labour of peddling \u201cfantasies\u201d to voters in the election campaign. (See 9.17am.) He also said in that Q&amp;A that as a result he did not think it would be good for the country for either main party to win a majority. Both as majority governments pose a risk. It\u2019s just that the chances I think of Labour doing that are - if the polls are right - negligible ... I don\u2019t think a majority government of either side is a good thing. He said there was no chance of Boris Johnson being able to negotiate a Canada-style trade deal with the EU before the end of next year. Johnson claims that this will be possible, and he says he will not extend the Brexit transition period. But Blair said a trade deal within this timeframe would only be acceptable if the UK agreed to stay aligned to the single market \u2013 an option Johnson has ruled out. (See 9.21am.) Blair said trade talks with the EU could in fact go on for years under the Tories. (See 9.22am.) This is an argument that Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon have also been making forcefully. He said a no-deal Brexit was now a \u201cprobable outcome\u201d if Johnson was telling the truth about not being willing to extend the Brexit transition. (See 8.57am.) In the Q&amp;A he also said he did not think Tory Brexiters understood how damaging a no-deal Brexit would be. He said: Within the Conservative cabinet there are people who are ardent Brexiters. They are perfectly content if Britain goes out without a deal and trades on WTO terms. Now, I think a lot of them have no idea what WTO terms really mean. And, by the way, when you talk to people in the WTO about what it means, you can see \u2013 it\u2019s a risk no serious person would take with the country\u2019s economy. He described what Labour was proposing as \u201ca revolution\u201d and implied its promises were unrealistic. (See 9.23am.) He implied that he backed tactical voting against Brexiter candidates. In his speech he said: We should look at this election seat by seat. There is one general election but 650 mini-elections and each one matters. There are good, solid mainstream, independent-minded MPs and candidates in both parties. Like many, I have been campaigning for great Labour candidates because we know parliament will be poorer without them. I am sure the same is true of the Conservative party and there are those who were expelled for their moderation also standing. The Lib Dems can\u2019t form a government; but they can play an important role in who does govern. And in his Q&amp;A he said: There will be constituencies in which the Labour party has no chance of winning and in those constituencies - if I wasn\u2019t me as it were and I was just an ordinary or a floating voter - in those constituencies yeah I\u2019d want to [vote tactically]. But he said he would be voting Labour himself - even though he understood why people in his constituency, the Cities of London and Westminster, would be voting for the Lib Dem candidate Chuka Umunna. Blair said as a former party leader he was in a special category, and he implied that he thought it was important to remain as a party member (he would get thrown out if he publicly backed a candidate from another party) because he wanted to have a say in the party\u2019s post-Corbyn future. He said: I\u2019ve said why I\u2019ve got to vote Labour - one thing, by the way, there will be an enormous debate I feel coming in the Labour party at a certain point and it\u2019s important \u2013 I\u2019m in a particular position, there\u2019s one of me. But I can understand why the people I know in the same constituency as me who will be voting for Chuka Umunna. He said that he thought the chances of an outright Labour majority were \u201cnegligible\u201d. He said British politics was chaotic, crazy and \u201cutterly dysfunctional\u201d. He said this could end up causing \u201cserious economic and social damage\u201d to the UK. (See 9.08am.) He said Britain needed to \u201cup the quality\u201d of its political discourse. In the Q&amp;A he said: One of the things, when this election is over, alongside everything is, is we\u2019ve got to up the quality of political discourse because, if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to end up with these populist waves. And what does populism do in the end? Essentially, it rides the anger. And it\u2019s actually born of pessimism. Because when you\u2019re pessimistic, you look for people to blame. On a visit to Derbyshire this morning Jeremy Corbyn met a group of Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaigners to promote the Labour plan to spend \u00a358bn to compensate them. He told them: I\u2019m very proud that we\u2019ve got that clearly in our manifesto and I\u2019ll be very proud to go into government and say: \u2018This is the policy on which we\u2019ve been elected and this is the policy that will now be carried out to right the wrong and the injustice that\u2019s been done to all of you.\u2019 I will do absolutely everything I can to make sure we win the election on December 12 and put that pledge into practice. People understand the injustice that\u2019s been done to you and the need for the country as a whole to accept the moral responsibility for putting it right. Blair is wrapping up now. He says, whatever happens, Britain is a great country. He recalls a visit to an African country recently. The president told him he was sorry for what was happening in Britain. Q: Is it getting harder and harder to stay optimistic. What are the chances this will go your way? Blair says he is naturally optimistic. But he is not sure he still is. He is worried, he says. Some days he thinks this problem will blow itself out. Other days he thinks the problems are really deep. I\u2019m clinging to optimism. But we need to think deeply as a country, he says. He says he does not think the country can go on like this for long without \u201csevere damage\u201d. People are less deferential, which is good. And they want a say, which is good. But people have to share responsibility. When this is over, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to up the quality of political discourse\u201d, he says. He says what populism does is \u201cride the anger\u201d. He says he is passionate about technology because he thinks that is an essential part of what a modern political agenda looks like. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. Q: Where is Labour facing the most difficulties? Blair says it is probably in the seats with electorates seen as working class. He says his successor in Sedgefield is facing a tough election. But when he was MP there, the Labour vote was very solid. He says when he first used to canvass there in 1983, based on his experience in London, he would knock on doors and ask people if he could count on their vote for Labour. He says people used to be offended by that; they would think he was questioning their loyalty to Labour. He says in some ways it is good that people are not as tribal as they used to be. But it has created problems for Labour, he says. Q: Is Jeremy Corbyn a fit and proper person to become prime minister? Blair says he will choose his words carefully. His differences with Corbyn are well documented, and his views have not changed. But he thinks there is a \u201cpretty negligible\u201d chance of Corbyn winning a majority. Q: You make a distinction between extremists and moderates. Where do the SNP fit in? Blair says he does not agree with the Scottish National party on Scottish independence, but he does not see them as extremists. UPDATE: Here is Blair\u2019s reply in full. I don\u2019t think campaigning for an independent Scotland is extreme. I just don\u2019t agree with it. I think the United Kingdom is stronger if we\u2019re all together, I think Scotland is better off inside the UK. But, you know, Brexit has put it back on the table again. This part of the other problem, I\u2019m afraid, is that you\u2019ve got a situation with Northern Ireland which is very tricky if the Johnson deal goes forward. You\u2019ve got a situation where obviously the Scottish nationalists now have an additional dimension to their argument. I still don\u2019t agree with it, but, you know, they\u2019re going to be saying: \u2018You\u2019ve allowed Northern Ireland to stay inside the single market, why aren\u2019t we allowed to, we also voted heavily against Brexit?\u2019 Q: What are the prospects of a trade deal with the US? Blair says trade deals are like \u201creform\u201d. Politicians always say they are in favour of both. But when it comes to the details, that is a different matter. He says anything happening in UK-US trade talks would impact on trade talks with the EU. And he says, any trade deal would have to pass Congress. He suggests he does not think that is likely. I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath on a United States trade deal. I think it\u2019s going to be really difficult. Blair is now taking questions from the audience. Q: Do you think a government of national unity is still possible? Yes, says Blair. He thinks that is a possibility. Q: If the Tories get a majority, will you give up fighting Brexit? Blair says, if the Tories get a majority and the UK leaves on 31 January, we are going to have to make it work. But he says at that point there will still be an argument to be had about Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. Blair says some in the Tory cabinet would support a WTO Brexit (ie, a no-deal Brexit, with the UK trading on World Trade Organisation terms). He says he does not think they understand what it would be like. He has spoken to the WTO about this, he says. He says no serious person would advocate this for the UK. More from the Blair Q&amp;A - from the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul and HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh Tony Blair is now taking questions from Alex Threlfall from Reuters. Blair said that he would be voting Labour at the election. He said the Lib Dem Chuka Umunna is a candidate in the constituency where he lives (Cities of London and Westminster). Blair said he understood why people might want to vote for Umunna, but he said his position as a former Labour leader meant that he was in a special position. He implied that he thought it was important for him to remain in the Labour party (he would be thrown out if he publicly backed a candidate for another party) because he wanted a say in what would happen to the party next. Blair ended his speech by saying he expects the next parliament to agree to a second referendum at some point. Once we acknowledge all the above, and vote accordingly, yes untying the knot will take longer. The new parliament will be obliged to let the country decide Brexit on its merits, in a referendum, whether in the light of what we now know, we want to proceed with exit from Europe and if so, on what basis. And then we will have a fresh election to decide who governs. This is counterintuitive. It will be resisted with all the force that the extremes can muster \u2013 extremes whose narrative runs through much of our present politics and media, reinforced by the scourge of social media, but the alternative is a choice between two risks whose consequences we live with for a long time. He also said he hoped that at some point in the future someone would rebuild \u201cthe sensible mainstream\u201d in British politics. This is a moment to set aside the fatigue; to understand we\u2019re taking a decision not just about a government but about a future. So, we should think deeply. Then, at some later point, and not too later, we must set about the urgent task of reconstructing the sensible mainstream of British politics. Otherwise, this laboratory experiment in populism running riot will end very badly for our nation. Blair said he had been campaigning for \u201cgreat Labour candidates\u201d. There are good, solid mainstream, independent-minded MPs and candidates in both parties. Like many, I have been campaigning for great Labour candidates because we know parliament will be poorer without them. I am sure the same is true of the Conservative party and there are those who were expelled for their moderation also standing. Blair also criticised Labour\u2019s platform. The Labour party manifesto is heralded by its leadership as the most radical ever. This is true. It promises a revolution; and if implemented it would indeed amount to one. I won\u2019t go through the list of spending pledges, but they\u2019re combined with renationalisation, repeal of union laws, new taxes on business, taking parts of a company\u2019s shareholding into government mandated funds, a stack of new corporate and private sector regulation, and virtually every demand that any pressure group has ever submitted chucked in for good measure. The problem with revolutions is never how they begin but how they end. Meanwhile we have a policy debate devoid of rational analysis of the real challenges facing modern developed countries: the technological revolution; reform of the public realm as well as investment in it; and the rising power of China which is the biggest geo-political shift of modern western history. Blair highlighted further problems with a Canada-style trade deal. On Canada, I learnt two things. First, the Europeans, faced now with a Johnson government, regard the Canada deal as a problematic analogy for the British deal. Trade with Britain is roughly six times that with Canada and whereas Canada is the other side of a large ocean, Britain is next door, geographically and physically linked. They are not going to allow a Brexiteer-led British government to establish a competitor with access to their market but undermining their rules. Second, despite being agreed 18 months ago, the Canada deal is not yet ratified and indeed is now facing considerable problems in various European legislatures. Should any of them block such ratification, the deal falls. The risk is obvious once this is understood. We will be back in the exact, same argument as we had over Ireland. One side of the Conservative party will be demanding we leave without a deal if Europe refuses the access we want; the other will be wanting to compromise to get that access. This could last for years. Starting with the Conservatives, Blair argues that there is no chance of Boris Johnson being able to negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020, as he claims. Brexit isn\u2019t over on 12 December, nor even on 31 January next year. We immediately begin the new phase of Brexit negotiation. Only this time, we are negotiating the future relationship of Britain with Europe, not simply the Irish border question, and without the leverage which comes from still being a member of the EU, since, legally, we will have left the union and are in the transition period supposed to last up to the end of 2020. What has become apparent in the last weeks, is that this negotiation has no chance of being concluded in that transition period. None. Except in circumstances where, as Boris Johnson effectively did in respect of Northern Ireland, we concede that Britain stays in the trading system of Europe, the single market. It is belief that this might happen which motivated Nigel Farage to threaten to stand against the Conservative party. But more likely is that a Conservative government will be obliged to go for the hard Brexit, ie, a third-country FTA [free trade agreement], like Canada, with divergence around tax, regulation and trade. This is what ministers who are pro-Brexit are already saying and the position Boris Johnson recently praised in the US. If this is so, this negotiation is going to be horrible. I have spoken to many people in Europe over the past few weeks. Not a single person believes that there is any prospect of Britain reaching agreement with Europe on this timeline if its position is divergence on rule-making. On the contrary, they assert that Europe would be vigilant to ensure there was no \u2018unfair competition\u2019, particularly around tax and regulation. Blair says both main parties in the election are peddling fantasies. The truth is: the public aren\u2019t convinced either main party deserve to win this election outright. They\u2019re peddling two sets of fantasies; and both, as majority governments, pose a risk it would be unwise for the country to take. Blair says there is \u201cunprecedented volatility\u201d in the electorate. The result is an election where, despite the headline polls, there is unprecedented volatility and indecision, born both of uncertainty in the electorate as to what they want, and uncertainty as to how on earth they get it. Blair says populism has become a feature of British politics, on the right and on the left. In June 2016 Britain was a \u201creasonably successful and influential power\u201d, he says. Now \u201cwe\u2019re a mess\u201d, he says. Our politics is utterly dysfunctional. As proof, in the latest instalment of such dysfunction, we have a Brexit general election; and in December to boot. Blair repeats an argument he has made many times before \u2013 that it was a mistake to use a general election to resolve Brexit. (He would have preferred a second referendum.) He says both main parties are campaigning on the basis that the alternative would be worse. The Conservatives calculate that they can force people to elect them, despite worry over Brexit, because Jeremy Corbyn is the alternative. The Labour party leadership calculate they can combine traditional Labour support around issues like the NHS, with remain voters who hate Brexit, despite fear about the Labour Leader. In other words, both parties want to win on the basis that whatever your dislike of what they\u2019re offering, the alternative is worse. And not forgetting the Lib Dems who, because of all this, thought they could turn a general election into a byelection. Tony Blair is starting his speech at the Reuters Newsmaker event now. He says British politics is crazy and chaotic. Britain is home to a unique political experiment. We are testing \u2013 hopefully not to destruction \u2013 whether it is possible for a major developed nation to turn its politics into chaos and survive without serious economic and social damage to its essential fabric. Round the world where political leaders are gathered, there is often a conversation about whose politics is crazier. I agree that right now the competition is fierce. But I still believe British politics is unfortunately ahead of the pack. Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, is about to make his first proper intervention during the election campaign in a speech at a Reuters Newsmaker event. According to extracts released in advance, he will say that Boris Johnson\u2019s claim about being able to get Brexit done by the end of January is a \u201cfantasy\u201d. He will say: The Conservative party say vote Tory and Brexit will be done; it will be over. They even add \u2013 do it and we can get back to dealing with the important issues. The cheek is quite breathtaking. So, having visited this debacle upon us, which has distracted us from those big issues for over three years, they now use the distraction as a reason for doing Brexit, not abandoning it. But it appeals. It is, however, a fantasy. Brexit isn\u2019t over on 12 December, nor even on 31 January next year. We immediately begin the new phase of Brexit negotiation. Blair will also say that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is back on the table because Johnson says he would not agree to extending the Brexit transition beyond the end of next year. Many trade experts think agreeing a UK-EU trade deal before then will not be possible. Blair will say: Yet though Brexit is a distraction, it is also the vital determinant of the nation\u2019s future. It remains the single most important decision since 1945. Because of its effect on the economy, it impacts every one of the non-Brexit promises the parties are making. Doing it matters. How it is done matters. And exhaustion is not the frame of mind in which to do it. No-deal Brexit is not off the table. It is slap bang in the middle of it. When people hear the phrase no deal, they often think we just mean failure to agree; which in Brexiteer language means we haven\u2019t surrendered. What it really means is throwing our economy off a cliff and hoping it finds a parachute on the way down. It is a risk no responsible leader would take. Yet we may be about to empower a leader \u2013 Boris Johnson \u2013 to take such a risk. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, has just been on the Today programme talking about Labour\u2019s plans to protect renters. Echoing arguments he used in his earlier interview (see 7.39am), he said that this was a market that was \u201cclearly failing\u201d and that tighter rules were required. When it was put to him that strengthening protections for tenants might make landlords less willing to rent, he said that in Germany regulation of this market was stronger, but the size of the rental market was also much bigger. Healey was also asked why Labour was now committed to spending \u00a358bn compensating women who lost out from the sharp increase in the state pension age. This plan was not in Labour\u2019s manifesto, and the cost was not included in the costings document that was published alongside the manifesto. Labour says it will raise the \u00a358bn from borrowing. When it was put to Healey that this plan contravened Labour\u2019s promise to borrow only to invest, he said this was not normal government spending. It was a \u201cone-off compensation payment\u201d, he said. He said even if the Conservatives won the election, they might end up having to pay compensation like this if they lose a legal challenge. UPDATE: A reader has been in touch to say that there is a reference in the Labour manifesto (pdf) to compensating the Waspi women. That\u2019s true. What was not in the manifesto was the scale of the commitment, or the cost. For the record, this is what the manifesto says: Under the Tories, 400,000 pensioners have been pushed into poverty and a generation of women born in the 1950s have had their pension age changed without fair notification. This betrayal left millions of women with no time to make alternative plans \u2013 with sometimes devastating personal consequences. Labour recognises this injustice, and will work with these women to design a system of recompense for the losses and insecurity they have suffered. Nicky Morgan has defended the Conservative manifesto for what critics have termed a lack of ambition and content, saying voters wanted to see \u201crealistic policies\u201d. The culture secretary was sent out on the important post-manifesto launch broadcast round, even though she is herself not standing as an MP. Morgan said last month she was not contesting her Loughborough seat again for family reasons. Asked on BBC1\u2019s Breakfast programme about the seemingly limited approach of the manifesto, she said: I think what people do want to see from the parties, on the doorstep, is realistic policies \u2013 identifying what their priorities are but also being realistic and responsible about how we are going to pay for it. She defended Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to avoid difficult and potentially politically tricky decisions on long-term social care, saying a consensus approach was needed. \u201cSocial care is a long-term issue that could only be resolved by getting different parties together to reach a consensus on how that happens,\u201d she said. She did, however, readily concede that the 50,000 \u201cnew\u201d nurses initially billed in the manifesto included elements such as better retention of existing staff. Morgan said the number would be reached over 10 years \u2013 some reports said her Tory party handlers meant her to say five years. She said: \u201cThe commitment is 50,000 more nurses. By the end of 10 years there will be 50,000 more nurses in the NHS than there are now. And you\u2019re absolutely right to say this will happen in a variety of different ways.\u201d Amid reports of a major U-turn, she added that the Tories \u201cgot rid\u201d of the nursing bursary because it was putting a cap on the places available for people wanting to go into the profession. What we\u2019re bringing back, or introducing, is a maintenance grant. People understand we will make changes. And I know, as a minister, you make a decision and then actually you see what happens, you actually make the decision, you then have to rework that or to do something a bit different to deal with that issue. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has described the \u201cthe lack of significant policy action\u201d within the Conservative manifesto as \u201cremarkable\u201d and would \u201cbake in\u201d the day-to-day budget cuts of the last decade. Questioned over whether she thought the IFS analysis was damning, the outgoing parliamentarian said: The IFS also confirm there is more money going into public spending and I think they say the age of austerity is over. People want realistic promises identifying what their priorities are. But also being responsible about how we are going to pay for it. So yes, there is a stark contrast between the Conservative position of managing our economy well, setting out clearly how we are going to pay for things, and the Labour party position which is just we\u2019ll spray money around. On Labour\u2019s promise to give backdated pension payments to almost 4 million women, Morgan said: \u201cIts a very difficult situation, but its also very expensive to resolve. There isn\u2019t the money available.\u201d The Conservative party has pledged to allocate an extra \u00a31bn in funding each year for the ailing social care sector while guaranteeing that no one should have to sell their home to pay for care. In its manifesto, the party pledges to \u201cbuild a cross-party consensus\u201d on how it should be funded in the long term. However, Sally Warren, the director of policy at the King\u2019s Fund, has said the pledge is \u201ca couple of billion pounds short a year\u201d of what the sector needs. The former director of social care policy at the Department of Health told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: The money we\u2019ve seen from the Conservatives yesterday is not going to be enough to continue to meet demographic pressures as our population ages over the next five years. So the money isn\u2019t enough and all the money would be doing would be to continue funding the current system, and that current system is widely seen to be very unfair for people who need to use it, and it has been struggling to be able to have enough funding to deliver high quality care. We do need a fundamental reform of the system. The Conservatives have been promising a green paper for more than two and a half years. That green paper could have started a process of seeking consensus and they haven\u2019t yet published such green paper. On how big the gap between the Tories\u2019 promise and the amount needed to help the sector, Warren added: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a couple of billion pounds short a year.\u201d Meanwhile, Andrew Dilnot, former chair of the Commission on Funding of Care and Support, has said he believes cross-party legislation on social care \u201ccan be done\u201d. Also speaking to the Today programme, he said: \u201cI think the main difficulty here is that politicians, for reasons I don\u2019t fully understand, just have found it hard to get something across the line here.\u201d He added that since 1997 all parties have found it hard to get social care legislation through. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that there is enough energy around this now and that there is a real commitment to getting a cross-party consensus \u2026 As I say, I think that can be done, it does just require political will.\u201d But he sounded a note of caution: \u201cUntil we find a better way of getting money to local authorities for this, we will have a challenge.\u201d There\u2019s further reaction to Labour\u2019s proposals, as outlined earlier by the party\u2019s shadow housing minister, John Healey . Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: For decades renters have had to live with the fear of being evicted from their home for no reason, with damaging consequences particularly for families with children and the elderly. This election marks a major step forward in the battle to secure basic protections for those who rent, as Labour and the Conservatives have made clear that they will scrap this outrageous practice, and give renters the security and stability they deserve.\u201d However, the Residential Landlords Association has claimed Labour\u2019s plans would cause \u201ca serious rental housing crisis\u201d. David Smith, policy director for the landlords\u2019 organisation, said: These proposals have not been thought through. We have been at the forefront of wanting to drive criminal landlords out of the market, but to place such ill-thought out burdens on the majority of good landlords would lead to a serious rental housing crisis, which would only hurt tenants as they struggle to find a place to live. The sector does not need new obligations, but better enforcement of those that already exist. We hope that should Labour come to power they will work with us to bring in proposals that would better protect tenants against criminal landlords whilst still encouraging good landlords to invest in the supply that is needed to meet demand. Meanwhile, the Residential Landlords Association has welcomed the Conservative party\u2019s housing policy proposals. Its policy director, David Smith, said: We agree that the system for repossessing properties is in need of reform and support the Conservatives\u2019 proposals to [strengthen] the possession rights of good landlords. It is vital that the reforms are got right. At present it can take over five months for a landlord to repossess a property through the courts in legitimate circumstances. We will be keen to work with ministers to establish a new system of repossession rights and the establishment of a dedicated housing court to ensure good landlords and tenants can secure justice swiftly in the minority of cases where something goes wrong. It is disappointing that there is no mention of reversing some of the tax changes hitting landlords which have resulted in a drop in investment in the market making it more difficult for tenants to find the housing they want. Longer tenancies for tenants will be meaningless without landlords entering and staying in the market long term. You can read more on the Tories\u2019 policies here: People buying fridge freezers have greater consumer rights than private renters, Labour\u2019s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, has said as he promises more rights for renters. The party is proposing independent yearly checks on properties, inspecting things such as gas, electricity and damp, along with the introduction of rent increases capped at inflation as part of a charter of rights for private renters The Residential Landlords Association have warned it could drive their members out of the business, but Healey said the purpose of the reforms and introduction of \u201ctougher sanctions\u201d was to drive bad landlords out of the business. He told BBC Breakfast: For too long, certainly over the past decade, the government has allowed rogue landlords to flourish and so its time to make the market fairer for renters and for the government to act. Questioned over whether Labour would overcomplicate the market, Healey said: We have more rights as consumers when we rent a car or buy a fridge-freezer, we have more protections as consumers in other markets. When one-in-four rental properties in this country aren\u2019t even decent, they\u2019re damp, in disrepair, some are unsafe, these are standards we can\u2019t allow to go on for longer. This is about making all properties and all landlords operate to the standards that most already do. They are standards which are commonplace in other countries. There\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to do this. Healey added that Labour\u2019s plans to compensate millions of women who lost out on years of state pensions would be a \u201cone-off compensation payment\u201d paid for from government contingency funds. \u201cThis rights a historic injustice,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had been planning for retirement and had it disrupted at no notice.\u201d The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has criticised Labour\u2019s promise to compensate more than 3 million women who lost out on years of state pension payments when their retirement age was raised after the party announced the plan late on Saturday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Paul Johnson said the policy\u2019s estimated cost of \u00a358bn is \u201ca very, very large sum of money indeed\u201d and claimed Labour would need higher tax rises than those already slated to cover it. I think there are two interesting things about that \u2013 one is the sheer scale of it, and of course it immediately breaks the promises they made in their manifesto just last week only to borrow to invest. So, they would need even more than their \u00a380bn tax rises if they wanted to cover that. The other, I suppose, is just a statement of priorities or decisive lack of priorities, because there\u2019s so much money for so many things, but they\u2019re not finding money, for example, to reverse the welfare cuts for genuinely poor people of working wage. Whilst some of these Waspi women really have suffered hardship as a result of not realising that this pension age increase is happening, although it was announced back in the early 1990s, many of them are actually quite well off. Larry Elliott has this assessment of the Conservative manifesto. Take no chances. Make no mistakes. Maintain strict message discipline. Like a football team two up with 20 minutes to play, the Conservatives think the only way they can lose the election is if they throw it away. The contrast between the manifesto launched by Boris Johnson and Labour\u2019s last week was marked. Behind in the polls and with only three weeks to go before election day, Jeremy Corbyn has gambled that voters are ready for radicalism. In sporting terms, he has thrown on three strikers as subs and sent his centre half up from the back in the hope of getting back in the game. The prime minister, by contrast, is seeking to run down the clock until 12 December, relying on the fact that his \u201cget Brexit done\u201d line has cut through. Things started to go pear-shaped for Theresa May in 2017 when her manifesto plans for social care were dubbed a \u201cdementia tax\u201d. This time, the Conservatives have said the answer is to build a long-term, cross-party consensus. Johnson\u2019s pitch throughout the campaign has been that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will unleash a wave of pent-up investment and, by ending the uncertainty, lead to faster economic growth. But there is no guarantee that this will happen, particularly since even if Brexit does go ahead on 31 January, the rest of 2020 will be spent trying to conclude a trade deal with the EU before the transition period ends. The forecasts for growth and borrowing that will be provided by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility for the budget that will take place once the election is over will not make pretty reading. So while Johnson was upbeat at the manifesto launch, the document itself was a much more cautious affair. The papers on the Tory manifesto Jeremy Corbyn will be in the East Midlands today talking about the housing crisis, as Labour prepares to announce a plan to compel property developers to meet the costs of building at least 50,000 discounted homes as part of a package of measures to help renters and first-time buyers. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, has drawn up proposals to allow local authorities to use the planning process to force developers to build a certain number of properties to be earmarked for local first-time buyers. These would be sold at a discount of up to 50% on the local market rate, with the size of the reduction dependent on the gap between earnings and house prices in the local area \u2013 and the local authority could choose to target them at key workers such as nurses or teachers. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s politics news. Yesterday the Tories launched their election manifesto. You\u2019d be forgiven for having missed it, indeed that might have been the point, coming out, as it did, on a Sunday afternoon, but we\u2019ve got a full wrap of what it contained and reaction to it. John Crace suggests the Conservatives may have been employing a \u201ctake out the trash day\u201d strategy, by launching their manifesto on a Sunday, \u201ca day when almost everyone would either be watching football, Sir David Attenborough or Countryfile\u201d. Crace writes the Tories managed to deliver \u201ca manifesto with almost nothing in it\u201d. The plan is conspicuous for its lack of eye-catching policies, with Larry Elliott writing that Johnson is \u201cseeking to run down the clock\u201d with a \u201ccautious, tepid manifesto\u201d. One thing it does tell us is the stark difference between the public spending plans outlined by the two parties, with Johnson promising to fork out \u00a32.9bn more a year against the \u00a383bn outlined by Jeremy Corbyn. Among the headline promises is that the Conservatives would deliver 50,000 nurses, a line that we have factchecked and found somewhat wanting.",

But Labour\u2019s new policy initiatives are not quite so dramatic by international standards. Even if all of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s promises are implemented, the role of the state in the UK will still be smaller than in European countries like Sweden, Norway and France. Britain\u2019s social fabric has been worn thin to breaking point by almost a decade of savage austerity. For instance, millions now depend on food banks to make ends meet, including many in full-time work. Voters will choose between the practical benefits of Corbyn\u2019s offer to start building a more just society and the undoubted emotional appeal of Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.

Richard McIlwraith Godalming, Surrey \u2022 Two articles in one edition (20 November) reminded me why the Guardian is so inspiring: \u201cMeet the new altruists\u201d, which interviewed people giving business services for free to disadvantaged people, and the article on the amazing Copenhagen children\u2019s home. Both were a great antidote to toxic election politics. Angela Ford Cullompton, Devon \u2022 Apparently Lenny Bernstein pronounced his name \u201cBernsteen\u201d until he wished to be thought of as a more serious musician, whereupon he became Leonard Bernstein, to rhyme with Rubinstein (Letters, 22 November). Gillian Bassett Great Barford, Bedfordshire \u2022 In the printed version of Aretha Franklin\u2019s greatest songs (G2, 22 November) there was no sign of I Say A Little Prayer \u2013 her biggest hit as a solo performer!

      "bodyText": "Nicky Morgan has defended Boris Johnson over his decision to shelve plans to overhaul social care funding in the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto launch. The Tories have pledged to allocate an extra \u00a31bn a year for the social care sector as part of a cautious manifesto, while guaranteeing that no one should have to sell their home to meet the costs. But it falls short of Johnson\u2019s rallying cry on the steps of Downing Street when he took office, claiming \u201cwe will fix the crisis in social care once and for all \u2026 with a clear plan we have prepared\u201d. Theresa May was forced into a U-turn when her 2017 manifesto social care plan was labelled a \u201cdementia tax\u201d, and Johnson has now committed only to saying the party will \u201cbuild a cross-party consensus\u201d on how it should be funded in the long term. Sir Andrew Dilnot, the former chair of the commission on funding of care and support, said the Tory plans were \u201cvery vague\u201d. And the head of a thinktank has said Johnson\u2019s pledge is too little to plug the gap needed to cater for the country\u2019s ageing population. However, Nicky Morgan, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS), defended Johnson\u2019s strategy. \u201cThere\u2019s a very clear three-point plan that\u2019s the \u00a31bn extra every year, the need to build a cross-party consensus \u2013 because social care is a long-term, complex issue \u2013 But also a very clear statement, as the prime minister set out in the Question Time debate last week, that no one should have to sell their own home to pay for their care,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Asked about Johnson\u2019s previous claim to have a plan \u201calready prepared\u201d, Morgan said: \u201cThere has been work going on but it\u2019s not at a stage yet in order to be launched. I think actually what you see overall in the manifesto, and I think quite right because the second part of our campaign is about unleashing Britain\u2019s potential, but it\u2019s about saying we\u2019re going to do this in a responsible, one-nation way. We\u2019re not going to make lots of unfunded, uncosted promises.\u201d Pressed again on why Johnson claimed he would fix the problem four months ago with a \u201cclear plan\u201d but has not included it in the manifesto, Morgan said the previous government had been working on the issue, of which the prime minister may have been aware, but \u201cit\u2019s not there in a form to be included in the manifesto\u201d. Johnson has also faced scrutiny over the party\u2019s pledge to deliver 50,000 more nurses \u2013 it has emerged that nearly 20,000 of that number include existing staff who would be encouraged to remain, or those who had left being encouraged to return. Dilnot told Today the Conservatives\u2019 social care plans were \u201creally not very specific\u201d, adding: \u201cFour months ago we had the prime minister standing on the steps of Downing Street saying he would fix the crisis in social care once and for all with \u2018a clear plan we have prepared\u2019.

On how big the gap is between the Tories\u2019 promise of an extra \u00a31bn a year over the next five years and the amount that is needed to help the sector, Warren added: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a couple of billion pounds short a year.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The battle lines over public spending for the election have been drawn after Boris Johnson set out a Conservative plan to spend just \u00a32.9bn more a year against the \u00a383bn outlined by Jeremy Corbyn.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/boris-johnson-launches-conservative-manifesto-with-50000-nurses-pledge\">Launching his manifesto in Telford in the West Midlands</a>, the prime minister said his aims were not just to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d but to \u201clevel up across the country\u201d by improving schools, hospitals and the police.</p> \n<p>However, his extra spending was revealed as modest by a costings document published alongside the slim 60-page manifesto. It said an additional \u00a31.5bn would be spent on public services next year, \u00a32.8bn the year after and \u00a32.9bn in 2022 and 2023.</p> \n<p>The scale of spending ambitions between the two parties is now stark: for every pound the Conservatives have pledged to spend by the end of the next parliament, Labour has promised \u00a328.</p> \n<p>And shortly after the document was published \u2013 with key pledges on 50,000 new nurses, a commitment to ending the Brexit transition by 2020, and a \u00a32bn pothole fund \u2013 experts highlighted the paucity of big spending pledges. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the reality of the document contrasted with the prime minister\u2019s rhetoric about wanting to improve public services.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were notable for the scale of their ambitions, the Conservative one is not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a single budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable.\u201d</p> \n<p>The \u00a383bn a year promised by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would cover Labour priorities such as a huge increase in NHS funding, the scrapping of tuition fees, an expansion of free childcare and further school funding.</p> \n<p>With two and a half weeks to go before polling day, Johnson released a restrained document that contained relatively little new policy and omitted several key pledges from his leadership campaign, including promised tax cuts for higher earners and any concrete solution to social care.</p> \n<p>The slimmed-down document appeared intended to minimise controversy, a response from Tory strategists to the disastrous launch that led to the evaporation of Theresa May\u2019s poll lead in 2017. But the lack of big-ticket items could prove a hard sell for activists on the doorstep.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s most eye-catching new pledge in the manifesto \u2013 to deliver 50,000 nurses in the NHS \u2013 also began to unravel shortly after the launch. Tory sources confirmed that it counted 18,500 nurses already working whom the party say would be \u201cretained\u201d and would otherwise have left the profession.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cFirst we had Johnson\u2019s fake 40 new hospitals now we have his fake 50,000 extra nurses.\u201d Conservative sources responded by saying Ashworth has previously complained about a retention crisis in nursing and should support measures to keep nurses in the profession.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-24T16:00:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Party manifesto spending pledges\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-24T16:00:15/embed.html\">Party manifesto spending pledges</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of the major policies that were confirmed in the Tory manifesto include:</p> \n<p>\u2022 A promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT.</p> \n<p>\u2022 A pledge to increase police officer numbers by 20,000.</p> \n<p>\u2022 A rise in the national insurance threshold to \u00a39,500 next year with an ultimate ambition of \u00a312,500.</p> \n<p>\u2022 An extra \u00a32bn to fix potholes in roads.</p> \n<p>\u2022 A commitment to not extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Ending car-parking charges for the terminally ill and NHS staff on night shifts.</p> \n<p>\u2022 An expansion of free childcare to parents of three- and four-year-olds in the school holidays.</p> \n<p>\u2022 An end to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/13/fixed-term-parliaments-explained\">Fixed-term Parliament Act</a>.</p> \n<p>The most notable absence was the lack of a plan solve the black hole in social care funding beyond an extra \u00a31bn a year and an aim to seek cross-party consensus. A promise that no one should have to lose their house to pay for care in old age was designed to head off the difficulties Theresa May had with her social care policy in 2017, which was branded a \u201cdementia tax\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive at the Health Foundation, said<strong> </strong>the lack of any clear policy on social care was a \u201cshameful omission for a party that\u2019s been in power for nearly a decade\u201d.</p> \n<p>Paul Johnson said some big spending had been announced in September but \u201ctaken at face value today\u2019s manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, that\u2019s it\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cHealth and school spending will continue to rise. Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in.\u201d </p> \n<p>Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, had a similar verdict, saying the gap between the party\u2019s spending plans was huge.</p> \n<p>\u201cAusterity will end whoever wins this election, given previously announced increases to public service spending and Conservative manifesto plans for up to \u00a320bn of infrastructure spend. However, the country still faces a very big choice on the size of the state it wants in this election,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cConservative plans for a \u00a33bn increase in current spending contrast with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/24/labours-spending-plans-arent-especially-unusual-just-look-at-sweden\">Labour\u2019s proposed \u00a383bn increase</a> \u2013 which has increased to \u00a395bn following today\u2019s Waspi [Women Against State Pension Inequality] pledge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pressed about the contrast in the scale of Tory and Labour spending plans, Boris Johnson said he was ambitious about improving public services but it was \u201ctrue that we are doing it in a sensible way\u201d.</p> \n<p>On capital spending, the Conservatives said they would loosen their fiscal rules to allow more borrowing for infrastructure projects, such as roads and flood defences, and research and development. The Tories plan capital spend of \u00a33.2bn next year, rising to \u00a38bn by the end of the next parliament.</p> \n<p>Taking questions after the manifesto launch, Johnson floundered as he was pressed twice on whether he can be trusted, given that last week\u2019s debate audience laughed at him over the issue and the Conservative party has been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/tories-tweet-anti-labour-posts-under-factcheckuk-brand\">masquerading as a fact-checking service on Twitter</a>.</p> \n<p>Asked if the fake factcheck service had undermined trust in the Conservative party, Johnson rambled and wrongly claimed that Labour had done a similar thing. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that the Twittersphere is not really my province. But what I can say is that I\u2019m informed that Labour have some sort of operation, which is very similar to this but I haven\u2019t followed this Twitter stuff with perhaps the attention that you would like. I will apprise myself of the detail of this.\u201d</p>",

Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the reality of the document contrasted with the prime minister\u2019s rhetoric about wanting to improve public services. \u201cIf the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were notable for the scale of their ambitions, the Conservative one is not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a single budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable.\u201d The \u00a383bn a year promised by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would cover Labour priorities such as a huge increase in NHS funding, the scrapping of tuition fees, an expansion of free childcare and further school funding. With two and a half weeks to go before polling day, Johnson released a restrained document that contained relatively little new policy and omitted several key pledges from his leadership campaign, including promised tax cuts for higher earners and any concrete solution to social care. The slimmed-down document appeared intended to minimise controversy, a response from Tory strategists to the disastrous launch that led to the evaporation of Theresa May\u2019s poll lead in 2017. But the lack of big-ticket items could prove a hard sell for activists on the doorstep. Johnson\u2019s most eye-catching new pledge in the manifesto \u2013 to deliver 50,000 nurses in the NHS \u2013 also began to unravel shortly after the launch. Tory sources confirmed that it counted 18,500 nurses already working whom the party say would be \u201cretained\u201d and would otherwise have left the profession. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cFirst we had Johnson\u2019s fake 40 new hospitals now we have his fake 50,000 extra nurses.\u201d Conservative sources responded by saying Ashworth has previously complained about a retention crisis in nursing and should support measures to keep nurses in the profession. Some of the major policies that were confirmed in the Tory manifesto include: \u2022 A promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. \u2022 A pledge to increase police officer numbers by 20,000. \u2022 A rise in the national insurance threshold to \u00a39,500 next year with an ultimate ambition of \u00a312,500. \u2022 An extra \u00a32bn to fix potholes in roads. \u2022 A commitment to not extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. \u2022 Ending car-parking charges for the terminally ill and NHS staff on night shifts. \u2022 An expansion of free childcare to parents of three- and four-year-olds in the school holidays. \u2022 An end to the Fixed-term Parliament Act. The most notable absence was the lack of a plan solve the black hole in social care funding beyond an extra \u00a31bn a year and an aim to seek cross-party consensus. A promise that no one should have to lose their house to pay for care in old age was designed to head off the difficulties Theresa May had with her social care policy in 2017, which was branded a \u201cdementia tax\u201d. Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive at the Health Foundation, said the lack of any clear policy on social care was a \u201cshameful omission for a party that\u2019s been in power for nearly a decade\u201d. Paul Johnson said some big spending had been announced in September but \u201ctaken at face value today\u2019s manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, that\u2019s it\u201d. He added: \u201cHealth and school spending will continue to rise. Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in.\u201d Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, had a similar verdict, saying the gap between the party\u2019s spending plans was huge. \u201cAusterity will end whoever wins this election, given previously announced increases to public service spending and Conservative manifesto plans for up to \u00a320bn of infrastructure spend. However, the country still faces a very big choice on the size of the state it wants in this election,\u201d he said. \u201cConservative plans for a \u00a33bn increase in current spending contrast with Labour\u2019s proposed \u00a383bn increase \u2013 which has increased to \u00a395bn following today\u2019s Waspi [Women Against State Pension Inequality] pledge.\u201d Pressed about the contrast in the scale of Tory and Labour spending plans, Boris Johnson said he was ambitious about improving public services but it was \u201ctrue that we are doing it in a sensible way\u201d. On capital spending, the Conservatives said they would loosen their fiscal rules to allow more borrowing for infrastructure projects, such as roads and flood defences, and research and development. The Tories plan capital spend of \u00a33.2bn next year, rising to \u00a38bn by the end of the next parliament. Taking questions after the manifesto launch, Johnson floundered as he was pressed twice on whether he can be trusted, given that last week\u2019s debate audience laughed at him over the issue and the Conservative party has been criticised for masquerading as a fact-checking service on Twitter. Asked if the fake factcheck service had undermined trust in the Conservative party, Johnson rambled and wrongly claimed that Labour had done a similar thing. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that the Twittersphere is not really my province. But what I can say is that I\u2019m informed that Labour have some sort of operation, which is very similar to this but I haven\u2019t followed this Twitter stuff with perhaps the attention that you would like. I will apprise myself of the detail of this.\u201d",

Philip Rycroft, the former permanent secretary of the Department for Exiting the EU, told the Guardian: \u201cObviously it\u2019s going to be a huge negotiation, probably four or five times bigger than the withdrawal agreement negotiation<strong> </strong>and will absorb a huge amount of government effort.\u201d </p> <p>Trade is a top priority for both sides. Rycroft, who oversaw post-Brexit planning at DexEU ahead of the original 29 March deadline, said the government had already done a huge amount of work. Some on the EU side wonder whether it will be enough. Lotta Nymann-Lindegren, a former diplomat, who followed Brexit for the Finnish government, said: \u201cThe discrepancy between the two sides will be bigger in phase two because the United Kingdom has not negotiated any trade agreements in the past 40 years or so.\u201d That \u201cexperience gap\u201d will be \u201ca challenge for the negotiations that will influence how fast we can go\u201d, she added.</p> <h2>Deadlines</h2> <p>On Brexit day, the countdown clocks will reset to a new deadline. If the UK leaves on 31 January, only 11 months remain to hammer out the basics of the future relationship. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, told the Guardian that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/michel-barnier-tells-uk-ignore-eu-regulatory-standards-at-your-peril\">it would be possible to negotiate a basic free-trade deal in that time</a>.</p> <p>In private, Brussels is much more sceptical. \u201cNot in my wildest dreams would I imagine that a possibility,\u201d one senior EU diplomat said of the 11-month timetable, citing the difficulties of agreeing a zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal if the UK seeks to diverge from EU standards on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.</p> <p>To woo Nigel Farage and Brexit party voters, the prime minister insists that he can negotiate the deal in 11 months, with no extension of the transition period. Labour wants a back-up plan and is pressing to avoid <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-50109643/keir-starmer-brexit-deal-a-trap-door-to-no-deal\">\u201cthe trap door to no deal\u201d</a> on 31 December 2020. Under the transition, the UK remains part of the EU single market and customs union, without decision-making power or representation. The government has until 1 July 2020 to agree with the EU a one-off extension of the transition period, until the end of 2021 or 2022.</p> <p>If the next government seeks to extend the transition, it could soon run into trouble. Aside from a potential political backlash against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/02/word-of-the-week-steven-poole-vassal\">\u201cvassalage\u201d</a> and the inevitable extra payments to the EU budget that come with a longer transition, a decision on extension risks becoming hostage to a deal on fisheries.</p> <p>The two sides want to agree future fishing quotas by 1 July 2020. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, once described fisheries as \u201ca lever\u201d in the future negotiations \u2013 a sign of how seriously EU governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/12/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-fish-eu-trawlers-set-new-course-post-brexit\">treat this small, but politically-sensitive industry</a>. EU diplomats do not exclude that a fisheries deal may be a quid pro quo for extending the transition. \u201cGiven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/25/michel-barnier-eu-brexit-extension-boris-johnson-election\">how France acts now</a>, it\u2019s very likely that they will be a difficult partner,\u201d another senior diplomat told the Guardian.</p> <h2>It\u2019s much more than trade</h2> <p>Both sides want to prioritise security, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/10/brexit-could-bring-back-bad-old-days-of-costa-del-warns-mep\">a replacement for the European arrest warrant</a> and access to crime-fighting databases that are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/europol-chief-says-brexit-would-harm-uk-crime-fighting\"> used every day by British police</a>. While negotiators share the same goal, the terrain is strewn with political minefields, such as Brussels\u2019 insistence that database access is linked to EU rules on data protection and the oversight of the European court of justice, or Germany\u2019s constitutional ban on extraditing its nationals to non-EU countries.</p> <p>Beyond trade and security, there is <strong>\u2026 </strong>everything else. The political declaration agreed between Boris Johnson and the EU reveals what lies beneath the tip of the iceberg. The two sides want agreements or cooperation on aviation, carbon pricing, anti-money laundering, illegal migration, data protection, sanctions on rogue states, and much more.</p> <h2>The EU</h2> <p>The next Brexit chapter could be more testing for the EU. During phase one, the 27 had a shared interest in seeing the UK pay the Brexit bill and protect the rights of their nationals in the UK. Under phase two, their goals diverge somewhat: \u201cThe interests of the EU side are more diverse, whether [they focus on] industrial produce, whether it is the labour force they provide, whether it is fisheries,\u201d suggests Nymann-Lindegren. Other Brussels sources are more optimistic about maintaining unity, suggesting that member states will be united against any attempt by the European commission\u2019s trade department to run the British talks in secret.</p> <h2>What about schools and hospitals?</h2> <p>While British officials are racking up Eurostar miles, the main parties hope to return to the traditional domestic agenda on public services. But political time and capital will be spent on creating a new immigration system, laws on farming and fishing, competition and industry. Before the referendum, British sources predicted Brexit could dominate the annual Queen\u2019s speech for several years after the vote. Under the withdrawal act bill, 46 years of EU law will be copy-pasted on to the UK statute book.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt would be very odd if the conclusion of all of that is we are not going to do anything about it,\u201d Rycroft said. \u201cIt rather obviates the point of coming out.\u201d</p> <p>Just as the laws are repatriated, so are the controversies, especially over issues such as farm subsidies, GM crops or state aid. An extra layer of complexity will be tussles between Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast (if the Stormont assembly sits) over who gets to repatriate powers from the EU.</p> <h2>Looking for Global Britain</h2> <p>So far, the government has managed to negotiate 18 \u201ccontinuity\u201d deals covering 48 countries and 8% of UK trade, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47213842\">according to the BBC</a>. But these deals simply rollover existing agreements the UK enjoys as an EU member. For Brexiters, the prize is new trade deals, although the government\u2019s own analysis <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/will-uk-benefit-independent-trade-policy\">shows that gains will be marginal</a> at best. Looking at these \u201cspeculative\u201d gains in the middle distance, the UK\u2019s former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, has said: \u201cThere is just an immense volume of technical work, even to aim to stand still, not roll backwards, in the next few years.\u201d</p> <h2>Hard choices</h2> <p>The saga of withdrawal has obscured the debate on what Brexit means. EU officials worry that there is no British consensus on the post-Brexit future: whether it is a distant Canada-style free trade deal favoured by Boris Johnson, or the closer ties sought by Labour. Without consensus at Westminster, negotiations in Brussels could soon get stuck again. \u201cThe UK needs to have a majority for a vision of Brexit,\u201d the senior diplomat said. \u201cOtherwise we face the same problem. They need to know what their aim is.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/trump-says-johnson-and-farage-could-form-unstoppable-force\">Donald Trump\u2019s verbal grenade lobbed into the British campaign</a> was a reminder that the UK has a choice: to follow European standards or embrace US regulatory norms. It is the chlorinated chicken conundrum: if the UK chooses to allow imports of US chlorine-washed chicken (and other produce) it will face much tighter controls on the food it can export to the EU, as well as price pressure on British farmers. There is no middle way between regulatory superpowers.</p> <p>Those unanswered questions are why those who were involved in withdrawal hope that Brexit will be at the centre of the campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think the public is ready for [phase two],\u201d Rycroft said. He hopes that politicians \u201cwill level up with the public and give them a clear intention of what is coming down the track, because this story is by no means at an end\u201d.</p>",
