In findings that critics have described as deeply worrying, data from eight of the country\u2019s biggest forces shows the scale of the use of stop and search, which more than doubled from 15,557 instances in March 2017 to 33,022 in March 2019. In 2018, eight major forces recorded 214,240 stop and searches, a rise from 178,318 in 2017. The Metropolitan police, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands police were behind the surge. Critics say stop-and-search powers disproportionately target black people and undermine community relations. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, enhanced section 60 powers in March this year, giving police officers more scope to stop and search people without reasonable suspicion in an attempt to combat knife crime. The frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, Boris Johnson, has repeatedly pledged to boost police powers to execute stop and searches in an effort to beat knife crime.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The backbencher did not give details of his proposed amendment, but it is understood it would force the government to make an oral statement to the Commons in October on progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive \u2013 a move that would stop the new prime minister proroguing parliament for September and October, to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit.

      "body": "<p>With just <a href=\"https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12131.doc.htm\">11 years left to prevent irreversible damage</a> caused by the climate emergency, there are still options to wean the world\u2019s economy off its reliance on fossil fuels. However, anything less than putting Britain on a war footing will not be enough.</p> <p>The government response so far has been timid. Theresa May introduced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\">net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050</a>, but there are reasons why the Conservatives haven\u2019t gone further: her party is hard-wired to fail. Clinging to a belief in the power of free markets, it neglects the fact that to decarbonise the economy greater investment from the state is required.</p> <p>Free-market advocates detest big government. But faced with the scale of the challenge, only government has the weapons powerful enough to tackle the crisis. So far May and her allies have been held back by their unswerving belief in the market economy and the mobilisation of private capital.</p> <p>Political will can be transformative. The government\u2019s independent committee on climate change has a target for spending of 1-2% of GDP by 2050 on greening the UK economy, for both the public and private sector. But faced with the gathering crisis climate activists are starting to push for greater government investment.</p> <p>Doubling the UK\u2019s investment rate \u2013 with the bulk coming from the state \u2013 in green infrastructure, technologies and industry should create millions of good jobs and build low-carbon wealth. State funding will be required to support people working in industries incompatible with a green future, such as mining, oil and gas, heavy industry and energy-intensive transport. When the state invests, the private sector is encouraged to raise its investment alongside these efforts.</p> <p>Last week, the government launched a half-hearted attempt to encourage more financing of green projects using market-based solutions. It might show that the Tories are moving in the right direction, but their plans came straight from the neoliberal playbook.</p> <p>Ministers announced with aplomb that companies listed on the London Stock Exchange would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/firms-climate-impact-on-profits-treasury\">forced to disclose their risks from climate change by 2022</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Tinkering at the margins of an economic model driving environmental breakdown is guaranteed to deepen the climate emergency</p> <footer> <cite>Mathew Lawrence, Common Wealth</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If only investors knew the scale of the risks, they would price them accordingly \u2013 penalising those with carbon exposure and rewarding those without.</p> <p>It is undoubtedly a positive step. Every little helps. But Tesco shouldn\u2019t need to tell investors it would lose money if the world goes up in smoke.

      "bodyText": "With just 11 years left to prevent irreversible damage caused by the climate emergency, there are still options to wean the world\u2019s economy off its reliance on fossil fuels. However, anything less than putting Britain on a war footing will not be enough. The government response so far has been timid. Theresa May introduced a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050, but there are reasons why the Conservatives haven\u2019t gone further: her party is hard-wired to fail. Clinging to a belief in the power of free markets, it neglects the fact that to decarbonise the economy greater investment from the state is required. Free-market advocates detest big government. But faced with the scale of the challenge, only government has the weapons powerful enough to tackle the crisis. So far May and her allies have been held back by their unswerving belief in the market economy and the mobilisation of private capital. Political will can be transformative. The government\u2019s independent committee on climate change has a target for spending of 1-2% of GDP by 2050 on greening the UK economy, for both the public and private sector. But faced with the gathering crisis climate activists are starting to push for greater government investment. Doubling the UK\u2019s investment rate \u2013 with the bulk coming from the state \u2013 in green infrastructure, technologies and industry should create millions of good jobs and build low-carbon wealth. State funding will be required to support people working in industries incompatible with a green future, such as mining, oil and gas, heavy industry and energy-intensive transport. When the state invests, the private sector is encouraged to raise its investment alongside these efforts. Last week, the government launched a half-hearted attempt to encourage more financing of green projects using market-based solutions. It might show that the Tories are moving in the right direction, but their plans came straight from the neoliberal playbook. Ministers announced with aplomb that companies listed on the London Stock Exchange would be forced to disclose their risks from climate change by 2022. If only investors knew the scale of the risks, they would price them accordingly \u2013 penalising those with carbon exposure and rewarding those without. It is undoubtedly a positive step. Every little helps. But Tesco shouldn\u2019t need to tell investors it would lose money if the world goes up in smoke. News of melting glaciers, vanishing biodiversity and extreme weather events is telling enough. On the left there is more momentum. John McDonnell has argued for the forcible ejection of companies from the stock exchange that do not have a plan for tackling climate change. Labour would create a sustainable investment board, supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a \u00a3250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. Climate activists are angling for a mass government mobilisation equivalent to Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, which lifted America from the morass of the Great Depression. In an attempt to outline a roadmap to a Green New Deal in Britain, the left-leaning thinktank Common Wealth is this week launching a bundle of papers. There will be six policy reports in total over July that will add up to a guide to turbocharging the low-carbon economy, while supporting communities through the transition. Mathew Lawrence, its director, argues that to finance the transition the largest ever peacetime mobilisation of resources will be required. \u201cTinkering at the margins of an economic model driving environmental breakdown is guaranteed to deepen the climate emergency,\u201d he says. Markets on their own cannot drive a society-wide reorganisation of production and consumption at the pace and scale required. \u201cWe need a government-led process of economic restructuring,\u201d he said. Among the measures are proposals to retool the financial system. A report will say that the green investment bank \u2013 sold off under Tory free-market dogma \u2013 should be brought back under state control. The Bank of England could adjust financial stability rules to penalise commercial banks for holding brown assets on their balance sheets, while promoting more green lending. There can be no economic stability in a climate emergency. The foundations of our prosperity came close to tumbling down in the 2008 financial crisis. Brexit threatens our future living standards. But global heating stands to surpass them all. So far the UK is lagging behind. Ministers might talk about a bright new future of electric vehicles, with encouraging news that Jaguar Land Rover plans to build its electric XJ car in Britain. But its target of 2040 for ending petrol and diesel car sales would mean polluting cars still being sold in Britain a full decade after irreversible damage to the planet could be complete.

Boris Johnson: \u201cVoting Tory will cause your wife to have bigger breasts.\u201d Dad (enchanting a studio audience with tales of a \u201cvery well endowed\u201d assistant): \u201cWhat a pair of knockers!\u201d Supposing, at this advanced stage in the political catastrophe, there remains any doubt about Boris Johnson\u2019s instincts when choosing between Johnsonism and the national interest, one also notes that the person who raised him, currently campaigning for a BackBoris Brexit, is simultaneously being quoted against it, by pro-Remain Best for Britain (\u201cBritain benefits from environmental legislation and funding\u201d). That the BBC was invaluable, with its serial platforms and tribute programmes, in conjuring up Boris Johnson, has become as obvious as it is irreversible. You might think that one such horror, however inadvertently created, is enough. Stanley Johnson\u2019s priorities and accomplishments appear, on examination, to be identical to, and therefore as basic as, his son\u2019s. Unlike hapless G20 leaders waylaid by Ivanka, our broadcasters don\u2019t \u2013 yet \u2013 have to act interested. * Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",
