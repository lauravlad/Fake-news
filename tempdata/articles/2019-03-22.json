May must start her gruelling week on Monday by making a statement to MPs on Brexit, before facing an amendable motion on the way forward.

However, it is understood Lidington told MPs he did not want to put \u201cunicorn\u201d options to parliament \u2013 and in turn was urged to rule out several options including revocation, as well as a Canada-style agreement, which MPs regard as unrealistic without the Irish backstop.

      "body": "<p>Sixteen years ago, Tony Blair watched a million people march past Downing Street, imploring him not to join US president George W Bush in invading Iraq. Mr Blair, in the words of one writer this week, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/20/uk-politicians-ignore-mass-public-protests-peril-theresa-may-tony-blair\" title=\"\">concluded, catastrophically, that they were a million of the misguided</a>\u201d. It was Mr Blair who turned out to be misguided. The march against the Iraq war was a turning point in Mr Blair\u2019s political career, and one that he never recovered from. Unlike Mr Blair, Theresa May is not in the pomp of her premiership. Given the Brexit cliffhanger at Westminster, her fall from power promises to be far steeper and more sudden. But when these momentous times are reviewed, few events will possess such an importance as the people out on the streets of London on Saturday for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/20/peoples-vote-march-200-coaches-heading-to-london-organisers-say\" title=\"\">People\u2019s Vote march</a>. Unless a bolt of inspiration strikes, Mrs May will make the same mistake her predecessor made: ignoring a mass public protest on the defining issue of the day.</p> <p>This is not because what happens in parliament or Brussels is unimportant. Far from it. Mrs May\u2019s tone-deaf approach to politics has been repeatedly exposed in these arenas, leading to her executive power ebbing away. She finally went rogue on Wednesday with probably the single most stupid televised <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-brexit-20-march-2019\" title=\"\">speech</a> ever made from behind a Downing Street lectern by a sitting prime minister. She had the audacity to tell the public that \u201cI am on your side\u201d. The march will remind her that she is not and rebut her repeated invocation of them in defence of an unpopular policy. The public, for Mrs May, meant some people and not others. Mrs May\u2019s language this week set out explicitly to undermine her parliamentary opposition. Yet it is the government of Mrs May \u2013 not lawmakers \u2013 which has failed the people over Brexit. Encounters with dissenting opinion, all too often for Mrs May over Brexit, are framed as a grim struggles \u2013 to be ground away by her obstinacy. Any attempt to understand the referendum vote in a different way has, under Mrs May\u2019s leadership, been characterised as a defamation of her one true Brexit.</p> <p>Except it was never that. The June 2016 referendum was not meant to be a full stop in a conversation about politics in this country. The People\u2019s Vote march will show that a higher ideal of democracy exists \u2013 that everyone can participate in shaping their own life and their community\u2019s. Like the <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584\" title=\"\">online petition to revoke article 50</a> and cancel Brexit, the march will demonstrate that Mrs May cannot define the public; that voters have a will and opinions of their own. It is no coincidence that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\" title=\"\">the right of the people peaceably to assemble</a>\u201d is listed in the first amendment of the US constitution, and that along with the freedom of the press, of speech and of religion, is considered critical to democracy. The effectiveness of protest can be measured by its impact on the public, the media, MPs and government. But it will also have a profound impact on the protesters \u2013 that they are no longer an audience but a force. This would undoubtedly be a good thing.</p> <p>What distinguishes a march\u2019s power from a carnival is that it ought to bring clarity to a debate. For the march\u2019s organisers the question is Brexit; <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/put-it-to-the-people-march-in-london-in-support-of-peoples-vote-1-5945376\" title=\"\">and their answer is a referendum to overturn it</a>, although not all marchers might agree. The process will be ultimately decided by arguments in parliament. An acceptable resolution of Brexit is impossible while the country lacks the political leadership to explain a moment to a country that does not understand it. Mrs May\u2019s lack of human empathy has helped hole her deal twice. If it is allowed to be put before MPs next week, her deal will fail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/22/brexit-latest-news-eu-summit-extend-delay-article-50-eu-says-uk-will-leave-in-three-weeks-with-no-deal-unless-mps-back-agreement-or-decide-plan-b-politics-live?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with:block-5c94c672e4b0a5422e6398c0#block-5c94c672e4b0a5422e6398c0\" title=\"\">again</a>. That no one is keen to own Brexit underlines its toxicity. Mrs May could get Labour votes by softening her deal with a customs union, but that hazards a Tory schism. If Jeremy Corbyn pushed Brexit through then he would risk alienating his remainer base. Europe\u2019s leaders have given Britain until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/22/brexit-latest-news-eu-summit-extend-delay-article-50-eu-says-uk-will-leave-in-three-weeks-with-no-deal-unless-mps-back-agreement-or-decide-plan-b-politics-live?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with:block-5c94caeae4b0a5422e6398ff#block-5c94caeae4b0a5422e6398ff\" title=\"\">22 May</a> to work out how to proceed. Brexit is unlikely to be resolved by then. The EU and Britain will need time to rethink. Time bought by marchers in central London.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sixteen years ago, Tony Blair watched a million people march past Downing Street, imploring him not to join US president George W Bush in invading Iraq. Mr Blair, in the words of one writer this week, \u201cconcluded, catastrophically, that they were a million of the misguided\u201d. It was Mr Blair who turned out to be misguided. The march against the Iraq war was a turning point in Mr Blair\u2019s political career, and one that he never recovered from. Unlike Mr Blair, Theresa May is not in the pomp of her premiership. Given the Brexit cliffhanger at Westminster, her fall from power promises to be far steeper and more sudden. But when these momentous times are reviewed, few events will possess such an importance as the people out on the streets of London on Saturday for the People\u2019s Vote march. Unless a bolt of inspiration strikes, Mrs May will make the same mistake her predecessor made: ignoring a mass public protest on the defining issue of the day. This is not because what happens in parliament or Brussels is unimportant. Far from it. Mrs May\u2019s tone-deaf approach to politics has been repeatedly exposed in these arenas, leading to her executive power ebbing away. She finally went rogue on Wednesday with probably the single most stupid televised speech ever made from behind a Downing Street lectern by a sitting prime minister. She had the audacity to tell the public that \u201cI am on your side\u201d. The march will remind her that she is not and rebut her repeated invocation of them in defence of an unpopular policy. The public, for Mrs May, meant some people and not others. Mrs May\u2019s language this week set out explicitly to undermine her parliamentary opposition. Yet it is the government of Mrs May \u2013 not lawmakers \u2013 which has failed the people over Brexit. Encounters with dissenting opinion, all too often for Mrs May over Brexit, are framed as a grim struggles \u2013 to be ground away by her obstinacy. Any attempt to understand the referendum vote in a different way has, under Mrs May\u2019s leadership, been characterised as a defamation of her one true Brexit. Except it was never that. The June 2016 referendum was not meant to be a full stop in a conversation about politics in this country. The People\u2019s Vote march will show that a higher ideal of democracy exists \u2013 that everyone can participate in shaping their own life and their community\u2019s. Like the online petition to revoke article 50 and cancel Brexit, the march will demonstrate that Mrs May cannot define the public; that voters have a will and opinions of their own. It is no coincidence that \u201cthe right of the people peaceably to assemble\u201d is listed in the first amendment of the US constitution, and that along with the freedom of the press, of speech and of religion, is considered critical to democracy. The effectiveness of protest can be measured by its impact on the public, the media, MPs and government. But it will also have a profound impact on the protesters \u2013 that they are no longer an audience but a force. This would undoubtedly be a good thing. What distinguishes a march\u2019s power from a carnival is that it ought to bring clarity to a debate. For the march\u2019s organisers the question is Brexit; and their answer is a referendum to overturn it, although not all marchers might agree. The process will be ultimately decided by arguments in parliament. An acceptable resolution of Brexit is impossible while the country lacks the political leadership to explain a moment to a country that does not understand it. Mrs May\u2019s lack of human empathy has helped hole her deal twice. If it is allowed to be put before MPs next week, her deal will fail again. That no one is keen to own Brexit underlines its toxicity. Mrs May could get Labour votes by softening her deal with a customs union, but that hazards a Tory schism. If Jeremy Corbyn pushed Brexit through then he would risk alienating his remainer base. Europe\u2019s leaders have given Britain until 22 May to work out how to proceed. Brexit is unlikely to be resolved by then. The EU and Britain will need time to rethink. Time bought by marchers in central London.",

They contain a message from the EU direct to the House of Commons. In crude terms: piss or get off the pot. If you want to leave with a deal, vote for the damned deal. If you are foolish enough to leave without a deal, do not blame us. Have a couple more weeks to think about it. But if you want something else, a referendum or a softer Brexit, work it out soon. And then send someone who isn\u2019t May to talk to us about it.</p> \n   <p>EU leaders cannot say explicitly that they no longer want to deal with the current prime minister. Urging regime change is beyond the pale of normal diplomacy among democratic states. But there is no effort to conceal the frustration in May or the evacuation of confidence in her as a negotiating partner. The one thing everyone in Brussels, Berlin and Paris had most wanted to avoid from an article 50 extension was giving May a licence to carry on behaving as she has done for what feels like an eternity. They could no longer tolerate the hollow shell of a prime minister shuttling back and forth between Tory hardliners demanding fantasy Brexits and Brussels negotiators who trade in realities.</p> \n   <p>There is a difference between patience with the prime minister and readiness to help her country navigate through its current crisis. There are still stores of goodwill available for Britain in Brussels, but they cannot be unlocked by May.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is the full article.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/22/eu-mps-theresa-may-finished-brexit\">The EU knows it, so do our own MPs \u2013 Theresa May is finished | Rafael Behr</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c94ab4ce4b0e8eadf7822c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-22T09:33:14.362Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Commons is sitting today, and we will start with an urgent question on the EU summit.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/1109023036131418112\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3 UQs: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtpennycook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mtpennycook</a> <br>asking for a statement on the extension to A50 agreed at the European Council<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmilyThornberry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EmilyThornberry</a> asking for a statement on the UNHRC\u2019s Inquiry into the 2018 deaths on the Gaza border<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LouHaigh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LouHaigh</a> asking for a statement on the Emergency Knife Crime Summit</p>\u2014 Labour Whips (@labourwhips) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/1109023036131418112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 22, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c94a9e9e4b0a5422e639780\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-22T09:29:32.937Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This provides a good overview too.

If you are catching up after last night, this is what you need to know.</p> \n  <p>Theresa May went to Brussels yesterday requesting an extension of article 50 - ie, a delay in Brexit - from 29 March (next Friday) until 30 June. Her request was turned down, and instead the EU27 agreed an alternative revised Brexit schedule.</p> \n  <p>There are now three key dates in the diary.</p> \n  <p><strong>Friday 29 March (the end of next week): </strong>If MPs approve the withdrawal agreement by the end of next week, the EU will delay Brexit until Wednesday 22 May \u2013 the day before the European elections. This would give the UK time to pass the legislation needed for Brexit. After that, the transition would kick in, meaning UK/EU relations would in practice remain much the same until the end of 2020.</p> \n  <p><strong>Friday 12 April (three weeks today): </strong>This is now the new effective deadline. If MPs do not pass May\u2019s deal next week, Brexit will be delayed until 12 April to allow the UK to come up with \u201ca way forward\u201d. If the UK does agree a \u201cplan B\u201d acceptable to the EU, there could be a further article 50 extension. But if that does not happen, the UK will leave with no transition - ie, there will be a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wednesday 22 May: </strong>This is the last possible date for the UK to stay in the EU unless it agrees to participate in the European elections. But any decision about taking part in the European elections would have to be taken much earlier, which is why 12 April is the new effective deadline for a decision.</p> \n  <p>May plans to put her deal to a vote in the Commons again next week, but few observers think it has much chance of passing. The new EU timetable means that if MPs are serious about taking control of the process and agreeing a new Brexit plan they have three weeks in which to do it. (Quite how that might happen, though, is not at all clear - see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/21/brexit-latest-news-eu-summit-article-50-extension-theresa-may-appeal-to-nation-backfires-as-mps-accuse-her-of-stoking-hate-politics-live?page=with:block-5c936edfe4b0e8eadf781779#block-5c936edfe4b0e8eadf781779\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/21/brexit-latest-news-eu-summit-article-50-extension-theresa-may-appeal-to-nation-backfires-as-mps-accuse-her-of-stoking-hate-politics-live?page=with:block-5c93b294e4b0480f6c0234aa#block-5c93b294e4b0480f6c0234aa\">here.)</a></p> \n  <p>Here is our overnight story about events in Brussels.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/21/mays-appeal-falls-flat-as-eu-seizes-control-of-brexit-date\">May's appeal falls flat as EU seizes control of Brexit date</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here are the three key texts from last night.<br></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/03/21/european-council-art-50-conclusions-21-march-2019/\">The conclusions setting out what the EU27 agreed on Brexit.</a></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/03/21/remarks-by-president-donald-tusk-after-the-european-council-meeting-art-50/\">The statement from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, explaining them.</a></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-eu-council-21-march-2019\">Theresa May\u2019s statement setting out her response.</a></p> \n  <p>Today we will be focusing on reaction.

Tusk said that until April 12 \u201canything is possible - a deal, a long extension, if the United Kingdom decided to rethink its strategy, or revoking Article 50, which is a prerogative of the UK government\u201d. The future of Brexit is in the hands of our British friends. As the EU, we are prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. As you know, hope dies last. Business secretary Greg Clark has joined the many MPs who have criticised Theresa May for her speech from No 10 on Wednesday night, in which she blamed MPs for the Brexit crisis. The DUP has accused Theresa May of being \u201cfar too willing to capitulate\u201d to the EU and criticised her for blaming MPs for the Brexit crisis in her speech on Wednesday. The party played down prospects that it could be persuaded to vote for May\u2019s deal next week, saying \u201cnothing has changed as far as the withdrawal agreement is concerned\u201d. German chancellor Angela Merkel has given a press conference in which she said she wanted to see what results any indicative votes in the Commons produced and that She said the EU would have a duty to consider any new plans from the UK. French president Emmanuel Macron gave a press conference a short time later, in which he said Brexit showed what happened when there was a conflict between direct democracy and representative democracy. He repeated his claim that \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201clies\u201d were partly to blame for the referendum result. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks very much for all the comments! Guardian investigations editor, Nick Hopkins, has been passed a confidential Cabinet Office document that warns of a \u201ccritical three-month phase\u201d after leaving the EU during which the whole planning operation could be overwhelmed. The classified document sets out the command and control structures in Whitehall for coping with a no-deal departure and says government departments will have to firefight most problems for themselves \u2013 or risk a collapse of \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d, the name for cross-government planning for a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThe \u2026 structure will quickly fall if too many decisions are unnecessarily escalated to the top levels that could have reasonably been dealt with internally \u2026\u201d the document says. It also concedes there are \u201clikely to be unforeseen issues and impacts\u201d of a no-deal Brexit that Operation Yellowhammer has been unable to predict. Tony Blair has given an interview to the Week In Westminster on BBC Radio 4 (which will be broadcast tomorrow at 11am). He said: The most difficult thing for MPs will be: do they try and do these indicative votes fast and get a conclusion by 12th April? I personally would not do that, but I think they\u2019ll be under huge pressure to do it. It would be better if we took a longer time to do it and Europe will give us a longer time. Really what I\u2019m saying is\u2026 it would be better if you had a debate that happened in less of an atmosphere of frenzy. On the formation of The Independent Group, he said the two parties needed to \u201cwake up\u201d. It\u2019s a warning to the main parties: there\u2019s a limit to your self-indulgence. You carry on like this, you leave this big open space of land that\u2019s fertile and you leave it open politically\u2026 those people who are the frontiersmen and women who\u2019ve gone into that space are going to be joined by others if the two parties don\u2019t wake up. Nicky Morgan, former education secretary and Conservative backbencher, has been talking to the Press Association. She will vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal next week. I think there should be a third meaningful vote next week. It\u2019s important to see and important to know whether this withdrawal agreement can finally get over the line. I will vote for it and I will carry on voting for it, because I think having that agreement in place is the best way to avoid a no-deal outcome, and it gets us on to talking about phase two, the future relationship. But I have to say I am less confident it will go through after the events this week: asking for an extension, the prime minister\u2019s statement on Wednesday night. We\u2019re all very good at saying what we want our Brexit to look like, and that\u2019s not all going to be achievable, and there is a public mood of \u2018get on with it\u2019. But unfortunately the tone of the statement was ill-judged, and I think it did push people back into their positions, when they were starting to think about whether they could compromise further, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wise move for a prime minister to pit parliament versus the people, because we are all representatives of our constituents. She added that Theresa May\u2019s position going forward was \u201cvery difficult\u201d. There is no doubt that Conservative MPs have told, whether it\u2019s Downing Street or the Whip\u2019s Office or Graham Brady, that they want her to go. Given that no-deal is taken off the table, she\u2019s had to apply for an extension to Article 50, we\u2019re not leaving on March 29, and particularly if the third meaningful vote isn\u2019t approved, I think that makes her position very difficult. I think what the EU is then looking for is then a change of strategy, and it would be very difficult for the person who has been in charge of one strategy with very hard red lines to move to another strategy. Very difficult - not impossible, but I don\u2019t see any sign that that is what she would want to do. Here\u2019s something I\u2019m sure we can all relate to from the Guardian\u2019s health policy editor, Denis Campbell. Brexit has left two in five Britons feeling powerless, angry or worried, with large numbers of both Leavers and Remainers affected by such feelings, according to new polling. In addition, 21% said they have felt anxious as a result of Brexit over the last year, 17% have experienced \u201chigh levels of stress\u201d and 12% have had trouble sleeping. The findings emerged from a poll of 1,823 adults which pollsters YouGov carried out online for the Mental Health Foundation thinktank between 12 and 13 March. It was weighted to reflect opinion UK-wide. In all 43% said Brexit had left them feeling powerless, 39% said angry and 38% said worried. That equates to about 20m adults feeling each of those emotions. However, while 59% of Remainers have felt powerless, fewer Leavers \u2013 34% \u2013 have done so. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from our poll that the political environment, as a result of Brexit, is having an effect on millions of people\u2019s wellbeing\u201d, said Mark Rowland, the foundation\u2019s chief executive. Three in ten Londoners have suffered Brexit-induced anxiety over the last year \u2013 more than in any other region, and much higher than the national average of 21%. A fifth (19%) of the population have had a disagreement with a family member or partner due to Brexit. This is interesting, from Sky News\u2019s political editor Faisal Islam. It\u2019s Frances Perraudin here, taking over from Andrew Sparrow. Labour has tabled an amendment to Monday\u2019s government motion that would instruct the government to provide sufficient parliamentary time next week for MPs to find a majority for an approach to break the Brexit deadlock. The amendment reads: This House notes the Government\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement and Framework for the Future Relationship has been defeated for a second time; further notes the alternative proposals being proposed across this House including HM Opposition\u2019s plan, Common Market 2.0, for a customs union, and for a public vote, and calls on the Government to provide sufficient parliamentary time this week for this House to find a majority for a different approach. Jeremy Corbyn said: Theresa May\u2019s damaging deal has been overwhelmingly rejected twice by parliament, and she cannot keep bringing it back unchanged. Her insistence on ploughing on with her botched and failed deal, while threatening MPs, is pushing the country to the brink. Following a series of meetings with MPs from all parties, EU leaders, businesses and trade unions, I am convinced that a sensible alternative deal can be agreed by parliament, be negotiated with the EU and bring the public together, whether they voted leave or remain. It\u2019s time for parliament to take control of the Brexit process from this failed prime minister, and end the chaos and confusion created by the government\u2019s divisions and incompetence. I answered a series of procedural questions affecting what might happen next earlier, at 12.19pm. I did some yesterday too, here and here. Here are some more worth addressing. When will the government find out if John Bercow will allow the third meaningful vote? The motion would have to go down on the order paper the day before the vote, and at that point the clerks, under orders from John Bercow, would have to rule on whether it was allowed. So, at the latest, the day before. Could MPs be allowed a secret vote? I haven\u2019t heard this suggestion. It would certainly produce an interesting result, and I suppose MPs could theoretically change their own standing orders to allow a secret ballot (they changed the rules about 10 years ago and started electing the speaker by secret ballot, instead of openly), but this would take the Commons back more than 300 years, to the era when it operated as a secret club and its proceedings were confidential, and it would destroy a fundamental principle of democratic politics - that elected representatives should be accountable for how they vote in parliament. Even Jacob Rees-Mogg would probably draw the line at that. What happens if indicative votes produce a result May does not like? Good question. In fact, over the next two weeks or so, this may become the key question. As I explained yesterday - see the first answer here, and the third answer here - if the PM is determined not to do something, it is hard to see how parliament can force her hand. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Frances Perraudin is taking over now. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has insisted that the government will go ahead with the plans for indicative votes in the Commons next week which were promised by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, at the end of last week. Lidington was quite specific, but on Wednesday this week, when Theresa May seemed to rule out a long article 50 extension (which might be necessary if MPs were to opt for a plan B), MPs started to suspect that she would shelve the plan. Asked about indicative votes at PMQs, May sounded distinctly unenthusiastic. But Clark has told the BBC they will go ahead. Asked if the government would support backbench amendments calling for indicative votes (see 3.05pm), he said there was no need, because the government was doing this anyway. He said: Every minister when they speak at the dispatch box speaks on behalf of the government. The commitment that the government has made seems to me very clear, that the government will provide that. So there\u2019s no reason why the government should be forced to do something that it is committed to do anyway. I filed some lines from Emmanuel Macron\u2019s press conference earlier. (See 3.10pm.) Here are some more. Macron, the French president, said EU leaders rejected the idea of holding an emergency summit next week because they did not want to get the blame for a no-deal Brexit. He refused to say what he thought the chances were of MPs passing Theresa May\u2019s deal. He said Brexit showed what happened when there was a conflict between direct democracy and representative democracy. And he repeated his claim that \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201clies\u201d were partly to blame for the referendum result. He said France was prepared for a no-deal Brexit. Nigel Dodds, the DUP deputy leader, has released a statement about the EU summit. Even by DUP standards, it is unusually harsh. The DUP has accused Theresa May of being \u201cfar too willing to capitulate\u201d to the EU. (This is exactly the same as the argument made by Tory Brexiters like Boris Johnson [eg, here], although it is not true to say that the EU always compromises at the last minute in negotiations. David Cameron, the last PM to conduct a major negotiation with the EU, found quite the opposite when he was renegotiating the terms of the UK\u2019s membership.) The DUP has criticised May for blaming MPs for the Brexit crisis in her speech on Wednesday. It has played down prospects that it could be persuaded to vote for May\u2019s deal next week, saying \u201cnothing has changed as far as the withdrawal agreement is concerned\u201d. Here is the full text of the statement from Dodds. The prime minister missed an opportunity at the EU Council to put forward proposals which could have improved the prospects of an acceptable withdrawal agreement and help unite the country. That failure is all the more disappointing and inexcusable given the clear divisions and arguments which became evident amongst EU member states when faced with outcomes they don\u2019t like. As we have always said, negotiations with the EU inevitably go down to the wire and the government has been far too willing to capitulate before securing the necessary changes which would get an agreement through the House of Commons. The government has consistently settled for inferior compromises when they didn\u2019t need to and when there was, and is, more negotiating with the EU to be done. Lectures by the prime minister putting the blame on others cannot disguise the responsibility her government bears for the current debacle and the fact that her agreement has been twice overwhelmingly rejected in parliament. The prime minister has now agreed with the EU to kick the can down the road for another two weeks and humiliatingly revoke her oft-stated pledge that the UK would leave the EU on 29th March. Nothing has changed as far as the withdrawal agreement is concerned. Nothing fundamentally turns on the formal ratification of documents which the attorney general has already said do not change the risk of the UK being trapped in the backstop. The DUP has been very clear throughout that we want a deal which delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the UK and for the EU as well. But it must be a deal that protects the Union. That remains our abiding principle. We will not accept any deal which poses a long term risk to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is holding a post-summit press conference now. Macron says it is up to the UK to find a solution to Brexit. He says Brexit is an illustration of what can go wrong when a country leaves the EU with no plan. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper says she and other MPs are backing this amendment before the Commons Brexit debate on Monday that would instruct the government to take account of the results of any indicative votes. The Commons is due to hold a debate on Brexit on Monday. But this will not be the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d debate on the deal. Under the EU Withdrawal Act, if MPs vote against the withdrawal agreement, the government is obliged to hold a follow-up debate. The Monday debate will be the one triggered by the vote against the deal last week. The more significant \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d is due later in the week. I have beefed up the post at 2.18pm with highlights from Angela Merkel\u2019s press conference. You may need to refresh the page to get the new material to appear. Asked about the fact that the EU dealt with China and the UK at this summit, and any similarities, Tusk says he cannot think of them in the same way. The UK is still part of the EU family, he says. To me, the UK is still a member of our family, not a rival. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Back to the Tusk/Juncker press conference. Q: [From Sky\u2019s Mark Stone] You seem almost giddy at the result you came up with on Brexit last night. But haven\u2019t you just kicked the can down the road, and isn\u2019t the risk of a no-deal Brexit still high? Juncker says: The road the can has in perspective is a very short one. Tusk says this is not really a question for them. They think they have got the best possible deal. But everything is in the hands of the British now. I think you know my position. I am more pro-British than you, I think. Here is some more from Angela Merkel\u2019s press conference. Merkel said this summit would not be Theresa May\u2019s last. She said she wanted to see what results any indicative votes in the Commons produced. She said the fact MPs have voted against a no-deal Brexit was \u201cpositive\u201d. She said the EU would have a duty to consider any new plans from the UK. She said Theresa May had put a lot of work into defending British interests. She said she assumed parliament would take some notice of the e-petition calling for article 50 to be revoked. Juncker is speaking now. He says the summit also talked about China. It was easier talking about China than the UK, he says. Not that it is joining the EU, he says. But it is not leaving either. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, are holding their press conference now. Tusk starts by referring to the non-Brexit aspects of the summit. He says today the EU formalised the Brexit decisions taken last night. He says he is \u201creally happy\u201d about this development. It means until 12 April anything is possible. He says he continues to hope for the best. As I said yesterday, it means that until April 12, anything is possible - a deal, a long extension, if the United Kingdom decided to rethink its strategy, or revoking Article 50, which is a prerogative of the UK government. The future of Brexit is in the hands of our British friends. As the EU, we are prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. As you know, hope dies last. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is holding a press conference now. This is a potentially interesting spot from Graeme Cowie, a Commons clerk specialising in Brexit. Of course, for Tory MPs, it is the withdrawal agreement that they most object to, because it contains the backstop. But Labour\u2019s objections to the PM\u2019s deal, as set out last month in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to Theresa May with five demands for Brexit, are much more focused on issues covered by the political declaration. In Brussels the EU summit is now wrapping up. The main press conference will take place at around 2pm UK time. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents Conservatives pushing for a harder Brexit, has described the prospect of MPs having to hold indicative votes to work out what to do next as \u201cnational humiliation\u201d. And fellow Tory Brexiter Marcus Fysh has described the possible plan described by Sky News for indicative votes on seven options (see 1.25pm) as \u201cludicrous\u201d. And Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has just been tweeting about tomorrow\u2019s march. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has said that several Labour frontbenchers have confirmed they will be taking part in its Put it to the People march in London on Saturday. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, will be there too. In a statement he said: Brexit is a complete and utter mess. We\u2019re now days away from falling off a cliff edge with catastrophic consequences. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time to take this out of the hands of politicians and put it back to the people. I\u2019ll be marching on Saturday with people from every part of our country \u2013 from every walk of life - to demand that the British people get the final say. The march will go from Park Lane to Parliament Square, where there will be a rally which will be addressed by speakers including Lord Heseltine, the Conservative former deputy prime minister, and Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister. The Labour frontbenchers committed to joining the march include: Clive Lewis, Rosena Allin-Khan, Marsha De Cordova, Luke Pollard, Rachael Maskell, and Steve Reed. These are from Sky\u2019s Kate McCann. Greg Clark, the remain-voting business secretary, has joined the many MPs who have criticised Theresa May for what she said in her speech from No 10 on Wednesday night, saying MPs were to blame for the Brexit crisis. Compared to what others have said (May has been accused of fuelling hate, and putting MPs at risk), his comments are relatively mild. But in normal circumstances a mid-ranking cabinet minister would never be so critical about his boss in public. Clark made his comment in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast (which is always worth a listen, by the way). Clark said: It is understandable, given the sense of frustration she had that people weren\u2019t coming together, but it clearly wasn\u2019t a great success. I don\u2019t think it was helpful in resolving the matter. But, listen, none of us is infallible, and even prime ministers sometimes don\u2019t get the tone quite right. I think this is a time for us all to come together, to find common ground, and to do what it takes to resolve this matter. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston thinks the UK will leave the EU without a deal on 12 April. He makes a good case for that on a blog here. Here\u2019s an extract: To be clear, though, the EU\u2019s leaders can\u2019t and won\u2019t say no if we insist on fighting them. But they would hate it and would say yes with the heaviest of hearts. What matters more than anything therefore is that in the three weeks of breathing space EU leaders have given us - JUST THREE WEEKS - UK party leaders, ministers, senior politicians, MPs have to do what they have singularly failed to in the more than 1,000 days since Brexit, which is to co-operate as far as they can to find an outcome that is in the national interest, take proper responsibility for it, and lay to one side narrow party considerations. If they don\u2019t, won\u2019t or can\u2019t, we will be leaving without a deal on 12 April. And truthfully, based on what you might call behavioural evidence on the current generation of MPs, I am retaining my prediction that we will be leaving without a deal, probably in 21 days. EU leaders have joined Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general (see 9.53am) in using Twitter to drop a heavy hint to MPs that they should be looking to Norway for a possible Brexit solution. This is from Donald Tusk, the European council president: And this is from Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister: This is from the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler. Predictions are a mug\u2019s game at the best of times, and in the current circumstances trying to forecast what will happen is impossible. But you can offer an informed judgement about certain outcomes. Here are my answers to questions posed BTL that may shed some light on what lies ahead. I can\u2019t claim to have the answers to everything, but hopefully you\u2019ll find my answers a bit more informative than Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s. (See 11.25am.) Will the speaker allow another vote on the Brexit deal? Almost certainly, yes. John Bercow\u2019s ruling on Monday was interpreted by some as a ruling that he would not allow a third meaningful vote (MV3). In fact, it was not as definitive as that. He stressed that he was not taking a final decision, and that circumstances could justify a new job. MPs don\u2019t believe he was ruling out MV3. What he was doing was saying that he would not allow MV3, followed by MV4 a few days later, possibly followed by MV5, MV6 etc etc. Given some suspect that that is what Theresa May was planning, Bercow\u2019s decision did limit her options. Will the EU Withdrawal Act have to be rewritten if the UK does not leave next Friday? Yes, but this is a straightforward process. The government will have to win a vote on a statutory instrument (SI), but any opposition would be minimal, and there is no serious risk of this vote being lost. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Brexit minister, confirmed in the Commons a few minutes ago that the SI would be laid on Monday or Tuesday. If May were to resign, what would that mean for an indicative votes process? It is hard to know, but it is worth stressing that, even if Theresa May were to announce her resignation, she would almost certainly remain as prime minister until the Conservative party elected a new leader. That process would take several weeks at best, if not longer. During that period she would probably want to avoid taking any decisions that might commit her successor, so you can imagine indicative votes being stalled. It is also worth remembering that no one is likely to win a Tory leadership contest by promising a softer approach to Brexit than May\u2019s. What are the alternative options? The two main ones you have not mentioned are a second referendum, or Norway plus. Which leads on to .... What are the advantages of Norway plus? Norway plus is generally taken to refer to the idea of the UK staying in the single market (as Norway is), and staying in the customs union too (unlike Norway - hence the plus). A version of this plan is being proposed at Westminster under the heading Common Market 2.0, although this involves having a customs arrangement with the EU, not being in the customs union. (Whether there is much difference is a matter for debate.) You can read a summary of the plan here and the full Common Market 2.0 paper here (pdf). And if you want to read about the disadvantages with the plan, this briefing, Why Norway Plus Won\u2019t Work (pdf), produced by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, is very thorough. (One of the lesser-appreciated aspects of Brexit is the rivalry between the second referendum campaigners and the Norway plus campaigners. Just because they both oppose a hard Brexit, that does not mean they are allies.) It is also worth stressing that, although Jeremy Corbyn is sympathetic to Norway plus, or Common Market 2.0, Labour\u2019s own plan is slightly different. What does the EU want in return for a longer extension? The EU has not been specific, but it has said that it wants to know that there is a stable majority in the Commons for a particular outcome. A second referendum would probably resolve matters one way or another. An election could result in another hung parliament, prolonging uncertainty, but the EU would probably allow a long article 50 extension to allow one to take place anyway - provided the UK took part in the European elections. What would the EU think of the UK holding a second referendum? Many EU leaders would still like to see the UK change its mind over Brexit - the Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel said as much this morning (see 8.52am) - but they must be realising now that this looks increasingly unlikely. Does extending article 50 extend the transition period? No. The transition period is still due to end at the end of 2020, although there is an option to extend it for one or two years. The e-petition calling for article 50 to be revoked has just hit 3m signatures. Right at the end of the urgent question, Kwarteng says the statutory instrument changing the date of Brexit as set out in the EU Withdrawal Act will be laid on Monday or Tuesday next week. At the morning lobby briefing, No 10 said the EU\u2019s agreement to extend article 50 until 22 May was contingent on holding the meaningful vote next week. The exact date has not been set but it is likely to be on Tuesday or Wednesday, to give MPs and peers time to pass legislation to change the exit date before 29 March. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The consideration is to hold it when we believe we have a realistic prospect of success. My understanding of last night is that the extension to May 22 was contingent on winning the vote next week. Downing Street hopes the acceptance of assurances on the Northern Ireland backstop that the prime minister obtained in Strasbourg from Jean-Claude Juncker will ensure John Bercow, the Speaker, allows a third vote. The spokesman said: It is obviously a decision for the Speaker but there is now EU approval of the legally binding assurances she negotiated with Juncker in Strasbourg. I would point to those as significant issues. May will meet cabinet ministers in Downing Street today and spend the weekend working at Chequers, her country retreat, the spokesman said. Labour\u2019s Karen Buck asks if the government is still committed to going ahead with the indicative votes process as promised by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, last week. Kwarteng says he agrees that that should go ahead, but he suggests only if MPs vote down the deal for a third time. Brexit minister suggests the government will not start the indicative votes process it promised until after it has held the third meaningful vote. Labour\u2019s Tanmanjeet Dhesi asks if May will come to the Commons to deliver an apology to MPs for what she said on Wednesday. Kwarteng says May is due to make a statement to MPs about the summit on Monday. He says what May said about MPs just reflected what people like his constituents feel. The Tory Brexiter Philip Davies says there are people outside the Commons who are \u201cseething\u201d that Brexit is being delayed. Can Kwarteng confirm it will not be delayed again. Kwarteng says he accepts the point Davies is making. Labour\u2019s David Hanson says he is not clear of the process. When will the meaningful vote be held? And when will the statutory instrument required to change the Brexit day date in the EU Withdrawal Act be laid? Businesses need to know. Kwarteng says the government intends to hold the meaningful vote next week. Brexit minister finally confirms government plans to hold third meaningful vote next week. It took quite a while to get Kwarteng to confirm this. In his reply to Hanson, he also says the government expects to bring the statutory instrument changing Brexit day in the EU Withdrawal Act early next week. Labour\u2019s Andrew Slaughter says Kwarteng\u2019s performance is emblematic of the shambles of the government\u2019s handling of Brexit. Can he say when the meaningful vote will be. Kwarteng says the government intends to hold a meaningful vote. Brexit minister refuses to confirm that the next meaningful vote will be held next week. Julian Lewis, a Tory Brexiter, asks what will happen if the indicative votes contradict the results of the 2016 referendum. Kwarteng says the government intends to honour the results of the referendum. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks if MPs will get a free vote if there are indicative votes on the way forward. Kwarteng says if the house is asked to find a way forward it will be surprising if MPs are not allowed free votes. But that will be a decision for the whips, he says. If the house is being asked to decide a way forward, it would be surprising if those votes were not free votes. Brexit minister suggests MPs could be given a free vote if the Commons holds indicative votes on a possible Brexit plan B. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant says Kwarteng is on thin ice and a sticky wicket. It is obvious that he does not know the answers to many of the questions. Theresa May does not know the answers either, he says. Will the Commons sit on Friday? Kwarteng says sitting times are a matter for the house. Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy says the Commons is not in a state of indecision. It has decided repeatedly to say no to the PM. If MPs vote for the indicative votes amendment, will the government accept that? Kwarteng says the house has decided to say no on many occasions. It has not voted for an option. He asks MPs for \u201ca degree of patience\u201d. He goes on: \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens with the meaningful vote.\u201d Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says Denis Healey\u2019s first rule of politics was, if you are in a hole, stop digging. He says he does not think the vote will go through. The PM\u2019s \u201chubristic\u201d speech on Wednesday did not help. He asks Kwarteng to confirm that article 50 cannot be extended again without the UK\u2019s approval. Kwarteng says that is correct. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit committee, asks if the government will back the amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin for Monday to allow the Commons to hold indicative votes. Kwarteng says Benn is making an assumption about when the vote will take place. The government wants to pass the meaningful vote, he says. Sir Edward Leigh, the Tory Brexiter, asks Kwarteng to say what the government will do to ensure the motion is different. Will the government resign rather than delay Brexit? Kwarteng says he cannot say what the government will do with regard to the European elections. But he says the PM has said it would be intolerable to have European elections three years after the country voted for Brexit. Kwarteng is replying to Pennycook. He says it is the government\u2019s \u201cfull intention\u201d to bring the meaningful vote to the house. (But he does not say when.) He ignores the rest of Pennycook\u2019s questions. Pennycook asks Kwarteng to confirm there will be a meaningful vote next week. He asks how the government will comply with the Speaker\u2019s ruling that the motion must be different. When will the government publish the necessary secondary legislation? Can the minister confirm that, if MPs vote down the deal, it will not be government policy to leave the EU without a deal? And what process will the government follow to allow MPs to choose a way forward? In the Commons Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, is asking an urgent question on Brexit. Kwasi Kwarteng, a junior Brexit minister, is responding. He is summarising what was agreed last night. (See 8.01am.) He says Theresa May has said it would be \u201cquite wrong\u201d for the UK to participate in the European elections (which would be necessary if the UK wants to remain in the EU beyond 22 May.) This is from Stewart Jackson, the former Tory MP who was chief of staff to David Davis when he was Brexit secretary. The Tory Brexiter Nigel Evans has just told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics that, if Theresa May loses the vote next week, she must make it absolutely clear that the UK will leave the EU on 12 April. In other words, he wants her to embace no deal, and strongly resist any parliamentary efforts to find a plan B. EU leaders have today invited leaders from the non-EU countries in the EEA (European Economic Area) \u2013 Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein \u2013 to the summit to mark its 25th anniversary. This is from Martin Selmayr, the secretary general of the European commission, who may be dropping a hint that the UK should opt for the Norway model. But EEA/Efta countries might not want us. Arriving at the summit, Iceland\u2019s prime minister, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, was asked if she would welcome the UK into Efta (the European Free Trade Association, which comprises the three non-EU countries in the EEA, plus Switzerland). She did not sound too keen: I think the UK itself must think about the option, whether it is an option. From what I have read from the debate in the UK, they are also very critical of the components of the EEA agreement, which the Efta members are part of. So I don\u2019t know whether that is the solution that the UK is looking for. Asked again if she would welcome the UK joining, she replied: Obviously we would be happy to talk about that with the UK if that\u2019s something the UK wants to talk about. My colleague Rafael Behr has filed a compelling column on last night\u2019s EU summit decision. Here is an an extract. The terms of the extension are not drafted for the prime minister\u2019s benefit. They contain a message from the EU direct to the House of Commons. In crude terms: piss or get off the pot. If you want to leave with a deal, vote for the damned deal. If you are foolish enough to leave without a deal, do not blame us. Have a couple more weeks to think about it. But if you want something else, a referendum or a softer Brexit, work it out soon. And then send someone who isn\u2019t May to talk to us about it. EU leaders cannot say explicitly that they no longer want to deal with the current prime minister. Urging regime change is beyond the pale of normal diplomacy among democratic states. But there is no effort to conceal the frustration in May or the evacuation of confidence in her as a negotiating partner. The one thing everyone in Brussels, Berlin and Paris had most wanted to avoid from an article 50 extension was giving May a licence to carry on behaving as she has done for what feels like an eternity. They could no longer tolerate the hollow shell of a prime minister shuttling back and forth between Tory hardliners demanding fantasy Brexits and Brussels negotiators who trade in realities. There is a difference between patience with the prime minister and readiness to help her country navigate through its current crisis. There are still stores of goodwill available for Britain in Brussels, but they cannot be unlocked by May. And here is the full article. The Commons is sitting today, and we will start with an urgent question on the EU summit. This provides a good overview too. It\u2019s a Twitter thread from Rem Korteweg, from the Dutch thinktank the Clingendael Institute, starting here. The Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor Peter Foster agrees. It is striking how quite a few EU watchers are interpreting what happened last night as being all about Brussels outmanoeuvring Theresa May in terms of who gets the blame for a no-deal Brexit. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has a useful Twitter thread on the choice facing Theresa May. It starts here. And ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has written a good blog addressing exactly the same issue. Here is an extract. So what happens now? Well, nobody knows \u2013 probably not even God. Because there are too many imponderables. If the decision were settled just on where the Brexit preferences of MPs probably lie, the UK would probably pivot to the softest Brexit \u2013 the so-called Common Market 2.0 \u2013 and go for an undetermined but finite further Brexit extension. But that route probably blows up the Tory Party completely and would also see a lesser haemorrhaging of Labour: the Tories could split right down the middle, between the Brexiter purists of the ERG and the rest. And for any of this to happen, backbenchers \u2013 led by Boles, Cooper, Letwin et al \u2013 would in the coming days have to completely take control of the process of shaping and delivering Brexit from Theresa May and the government. Here is some assorted Twitter comment on last night\u2019s EU Brexit offer. From Nicolai von Ondarza, of the German thinktank SWP: From Stewart Wood, the Labour peer and Gordon Brown\u2019s former Europe adviser: From Wolfgang Munchau, an FT columnist and director of the Eurointelligence briefing service: From Ole Ryborg, a Danish journalist: From Politico Europe\u2019s David Herszenhorn: From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson (last night): This is from Michael Roth, the German Europe minister. Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, has arrived for the summit, and is talking to reporters. Q: We heard some EU leaders were unimpressed by Theresa May\u2019s presentation last night. Bettel says he had a text from May this morning saying she would not be at the summit. She has gone back to London to try to win support for her deal. I think she did the best possible, she did really the best possible. I know the situation is very difficult. Q: We heard that some leaders were not reassured by what she said. She is dependent on MPs, says Bettel. He says she lives in a democratic system. He says, as a former MP himself, he knows you cannot always predict what they will do. Q: Macron said the chances of May getting her deal through were 5%. What do you think the odds are? Bettel says 50/50. Q: Did the EU do enough to help May? Bettel says last year he said the UK used to be in the EU, with lots of opt-outs. Now it wants to be out, but with lots of opt-ins. It is not possible to have all those advantages, he says. He says the deal is the best available. Q: What would be the best outcome for you? Bettel says the best outcome would be for a referendum, and for the UK to stay. Q: Does May have a plan? Bettel says she does not know the outcome of the vote. So there will be different plans. A few minutes ago Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, the prime minister of Croatia, was asked about President Macron\u2019s comment as he arrived at the summit. Plenkovi\u0107 did not deny that Macron said the words attributed to him (see 8.28am), and he sidestepped a general question about whether it was true that EU leaders were not impressed with May\u2019s presentation. But, when asked if he thought May had a credible plan to get her deal through parliament, he replied: She explained the context and the intentions. We will see what will happen. We are a little bit careful given the history of votes in the last few months. If you are looking for more on what happened when Theresa May addressed her fellow EU leaders, and tried to persuade them to agree to her request for an article 50 delay lasting until 30 June, my colleagues Jennifer Rankin and Daniel Boffey have a good account. Here is an extract. \u201cIt was 90 minutes of nothing,\u201d one EU source said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even give clarity if she is organising a vote. Asked three times what she would do if she lost the vote, she couldn\u2019t say. It was fucking awful. Dreadful. Evasive even by her standards.\u201d Around a dozen EU leaders peppered the British prime minister with questions. Did she have a plan B? How was she going to gain a majority? When would she hold the vote? \u201cShe very much dodged these questions,\u201d a second EU source said. A third source said: \u201cShe was not convincing. It was not clear if she had a plan B; it was not clear if she had a plan at all.\u201d And here is the full article. According to Reuters, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told fellow EU leaders during the EU27 discussion (ie, after Theresa May had left the room) that he thought May had only a 10% chance of winning the vote next week before he arrived at the summit. After hearing her address the meeting, he was revising that down to 5%, he said. Donald Tusk, the European council president, said Macron was being \u201cvery optimistic\u201d, Reuters says. This is from Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, told the Today programme that Theresa May must now open her mind to an alternative Brexit approach. His committee has called for MPs to be given the chance to vote on different plans, to see what has most support, and Benn said he would table an amendment designed to allow this process (\u201cindicative votes\u201d) to start on Wednesday. He told the programme: This won\u2019t work if the prime minister is not prepared to move an inch. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s the story of the last two-and-three-quarter years because about a month ago she said: \u2018My door is open, come and talk to me\u2019, but it was very evident that her mind was closed. We need to open up this process because we have rejected her deal, we\u2019ve rejected no deal, the EU has decided to give us a little more time and we\u2019ve really got to get on with it. This is from the Press Association, explaining what four leading European papers are saying about last night\u2019s decision. The centre-left leaning French paper Liberation points out that the current summit was originally intended to be the final goodbye. In a piece headlined \u201cBrexit: The British circus moves to Brussels\u201d, the paper writes: \u201cThis council should have seen the ratification of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU with an agreement reached after two-and-a-half years of negotiations. \u201cWe should have nicely said goodbye, perhaps even with a little tear. \u201cInstead, irritation, tiredness and a clear sense of being fed-up was felt behind the statements given by members of the commission.\u201d Le Figaro, at the other end of the political spectrum, reports that Europeans are tired of the twists and turns from London. The paper writes: \u201cNo-one has any illusions about Theresa May\u2019s ability to win a vote in the House of Commons in the coming days. \u201cWhat to do in case of failure ... Come back to Brussels for a new summit next week? There is not a shadow of a doubt. \u201cThe 27, whose confidence in Theresa May has evaporated but who have not given up the idea of an orderly exit with the United Kingdom, fear this prospect. They fear being trapped again in a new request for a delay.\u201d In Germany, Die Welt tops its coverage of events in Brussels with the headline \u201cNow the EU states determine British politics\u201d, while Spain\u2019s El Pais writes that the ball remains in the UK\u2019s court. \u201cThe weight of the dramatic decision to choose between a long extension or a brutal and chaotic Brexit falls squarely in London,\u201d it says. Good morning. If you are catching up after last night, this is what you need to know. Theresa May went to Brussels yesterday requesting an extension of article 50 - ie, a delay in Brexit - from 29 March (next Friday) until 30 June. Her request was turned down, and instead the EU27 agreed an alternative revised Brexit schedule. There are now three key dates in the diary. Friday 29 March (the end of next week): If MPs approve the withdrawal agreement by the end of next week, the EU will delay Brexit until Wednesday 22 May \u2013 the day before the European elections. This would give the UK time to pass the legislation needed for Brexit. After that, the transition would kick in, meaning UK/EU relations would in practice remain much the same until the end of 2020. Friday 12 April (three weeks today): This is now the new effective deadline. If MPs do not pass May\u2019s deal next week, Brexit will be delayed until 12 April to allow the UK to come up with \u201ca way forward\u201d. If the UK does agree a \u201cplan B\u201d acceptable to the EU, there could be a further article 50 extension. But if that does not happen, the UK will leave with no transition - ie, there will be a no-deal Brexit. Wednesday 22 May: This is the last possible date for the UK to stay in the EU unless it agrees to participate in the European elections. But any decision about taking part in the European elections would have to be taken much earlier, which is why 12 April is the new effective deadline for a decision. May plans to put her deal to a vote in the Commons again next week, but few observers think it has much chance of passing. The new EU timetable means that if MPs are serious about taking control of the process and agreeing a new Brexit plan they have three weeks in which to do it. (Quite how that might happen, though, is not at all clear - see here and here.) Here is our overnight story about events in Brussels. And here are the three key texts from last night. The conclusions setting out what the EU27 agreed on Brexit. The statement from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, explaining them. Theresa May\u2019s statement setting out her response. Today we will be focusing on reaction. The EU summit is continuing without May, but the main Brexit discussion is over. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here.

      "bodyText": "The significance of the home affairs committee report on immigration detention should not be underestimated (MPs scathing over \u2018cavalier\u2019 treatment of migrant detainees, 21 March). For years, Freedom from Torture has been highlighting how vulnerable people are being wrongly detained, for no good reason, and without adequate safeguards. In addition, our research shows that even where detainees are identified as being \u201cvulnerable and at risk\u201d, only 6% are released. We see the devastating impact of detention on torture survivors \u2013 how it compounds trauma and can severely hamper recovery. The report highlights that inhumane treatment and poor decision-making \u2013 a hallmark of the hostile environment \u2013 continues to operate at all levels of the asylum system. The UK has a proud tradition of offering safety to those in need \u2013 there can be none more deserving than a person fleeing torture. We should all be shamed by the inhumane and almost impossible battle survivors in the UK face in an asylum system that sets them up to fail. This report is a wake-up call for all asylum decision-makers tasked with what are, quite literally, life and death decisions. Torture survivors and the most vulnerable should never be detained. Sonya Sceats Chief executive, Freedom from Torture \u2022 When is Sajid Javid going to get a grip of the Home Office? This department appears to be ungovernable. For all his inclusive and compassionate rhetoric, Javid appears to be presiding over an entity that does not adhere to the usual checks and balances of a fair and just system. I fully appreciate he has Brexit on his mind but his department needs an urgent overhaul. Treating detainees in a less than civilised manner is not conducive to ethical practice.

But parliamentarians may feel emboldened by the EU27\u2019s clear invitation for them to seek an alternative solution, not to mention enraged by what many saw as May\u2019s strident anti-parliament rhetoric in her Downing Street broadcast on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>There were strong hints on Friday, including from the Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng, that the government could also be preparing to facilitate some process of indicative votes itself in the coming days, rather than surrender control of the parliamentary timetable to backbenchers.</p> \n<h2>Is \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/15/brexit-rebels-20-meet-the-cross-party-quartet-on-a-quest\">common market 2.0</a>\u2019 still an option?</h2> \n<p>Yes. If there is some process of indicative votes, it would be likely to be one of the options under consideration. It would be most likely to win a majority if its supporters could find a way of overcoming differences with the Labour frontbench Brexit plan \u2013 something its advocates have been working hard on in recent days.</p> \n<p>\u201cCommon market 2.0\u201d or \u201cNorway plus\u201d would mean joining the European Free Trade Association (Efta), a group of four countries \u2013 including Norway \u2013 that have a somewhat looser relationship with the EU than full membership.</p> \n<p>Members accept freedom of movement (subject to an \u201cemergency brake\u201d the UK could impose in the event of significant economic or social disruption) and are inside the single market, and therefore follow all EU regulations. Advocates of the plan say the UK would then seek to negotiate a customs deal, too, to maintain just-in-time supply chains and obviate the need for checks at the Irish border.</p> \n<p>But because it is an off-the-shelf plan, rather than a bespoke future relationship of the kind May\u2019s deal promises, fans say there would be no need for a lengthy and disruptive second phase of negotiations, and instead, the UK could be an Efta member within a few months.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"832727f6-90c6-4c64-912a-86630e6eb9ec\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>At the moment there seems to be three likely Brexit outcomes: a no deal departure on 12 April, a departure on 22 May with Theresa May's deal, or a lengthy extension to the process.</p>\n    <p>The EU is only likely to grant a long extension if there is a significant change in the UK's position. For example, calling a second referendum, holding a general election, or asking the EU to renegotiate the political declaration that accompanies the withdrawal agreement.</p>\n    <p>If the EU were to grant an extension beyond 22 May, the UK would be required to hold and participate in the European Parliamentary elections, which would take place on Thursday 23 May.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What about a second referendum? Could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/23/one-million-march-against-brexit-tories-plan-oust-may\">Saturday\u2019s march</a> and petition make any difference?</h2> \n<p>A second referendum is another option MPs would be expected to consider in the short period available after May\u2019s deal is defeated next week.</p> \n<p>It would necessitate a longer delay to Brexit beyond 12 April so that a poll could be held.</p> \n<p>The UK would also then need to participate in May\u2019s European elections \u2013 something May has insisted would be unacceptable.</p> \n<p>Parliament would have to decide what options would be on the ballot paper. Labour has insisted it will only back a referendum with a \u201ccredible\u201d leave option available, so that its leave voters can support Brexit \u2013 May\u2019s deal would not appear to fit the bill if it has been repeatedly and overwhelmingly defeated in parliament.</p> \n<p>However, any indicative votes process could involve allowing MPs free votes, so the frontbench\u2019s position might prove less important.</p> \n<p>The petition calls for article 50 to be revoked altogether, an option that has little support in parliament \u2013 unless it appeared to be the only way to stop a no-deal Brexit, which would not be the case if the government opened the door to finding alternatives.</p> \n<p>But Saturday\u2019s march will send a strong message to MPs when they are weighing up the options in the coming days.</p> \n<h2>If May\u2019s Brexit deal is voted down for a third time, can she survive?</h2> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s authority, already shattered after her deal was defeated overwhelmingly for a second time, is draining away by the day.</p> \n<p>It is unclear whether she would feel it incumbent on her to resign if the vote was lost again \u2013 she didn\u2019t when it was lost the first time, by 230 votes, or the second, by 149.</p> \n<p>But she has little support left on either wing of her own party, with MPs openly discussing her departure date this week. She might decide to bow out \u2013 but judging by her past record, she might also cling on. Tory MPs have no means of challenging her until December, when the yearlong breathing space she gained when she won last year\u2019s vote of no confidence in her expires.</p> \n<h2>If she resigned, would that mean a general election?</h2> \n<p>Not immediately. There would have to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/21/jcb-backs-boris-johnson-leadership-conservatives-gift\">Conservative leadership contest</a>, which would take several weeks at least, involving a series of run-offs among MPs at Westminster (there are a <em>lot</em> of potential candidates), and then a members\u2019 vote.</p> \n<p>The winner would automatically become prime minister, just as May did when Cameron resigned, and indeed Gordon Brown did when Tony Blair stepped aside.</p> \n<p>However, any new leader would face intense pressure to seek their own, personal mandate, on their own distinctive manifesto. And, more importantly, governing in a hung parliament is extremely difficult. A new prime minister who fancied their chances, as May once did, might be tempted to roll the dice and try to win a clear majority.</p>",

The cross-party group of parliamentarians who have been working together to avoid a no-deal Brexit, including Hilary Benn and Oliver Letwin, have already tabled an amendment that would allow MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable, usually one of the key powers held by the government, to make the time for a series of \u201cindicative votes\u201d on what should happen next. MPs have several times declined the opportunity to support such efforts, with the last amendment defeated by a majority of two votes. But parliamentarians may feel emboldened by the EU27\u2019s clear invitation for them to seek an alternative solution, not to mention enraged by what many saw as May\u2019s strident anti-parliament rhetoric in her Downing Street broadcast on Tuesday. There were strong hints on Friday, including from the Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng, that the government could also be preparing to facilitate some process of indicative votes itself in the coming days, rather than surrender control of the parliamentary timetable to backbenchers. Is \u2018common market 2.0\u2019 still an option? Yes. If there is some process of indicative votes, it would be likely to be one of the options under consideration. It would be most likely to win a majority if its supporters could find a way of overcoming differences with the Labour frontbench Brexit plan \u2013 something its advocates have been working hard on in recent days. \u201cCommon market 2.0\u201d or \u201cNorway plus\u201d would mean joining the European Free Trade Association (Efta), a group of four countries \u2013 including Norway \u2013 that have a somewhat looser relationship with the EU than full membership. Members accept freedom of movement (subject to an \u201cemergency brake\u201d the UK could impose in the event of significant economic or social disruption) and are inside the single market, and therefore follow all EU regulations. Advocates of the plan say the UK would then seek to negotiate a customs deal, too, to maintain just-in-time supply chains and obviate the need for checks at the Irish border. But because it is an off-the-shelf plan, rather than a bespoke future relationship of the kind May\u2019s deal promises, fans say there would be no need for a lengthy and disruptive second phase of negotiations, and instead, the UK could be an Efta member within a few months. What about a second referendum? Could Saturday\u2019s march and petition make any difference? A second referendum is another option MPs would be expected to consider in the short period available after May\u2019s deal is defeated next week. It would necessitate a longer delay to Brexit beyond 12 April so that a poll could be held. The UK would also then need to participate in May\u2019s European elections \u2013 something May has insisted would be unacceptable. Parliament would have to decide what options would be on the ballot paper. Labour has insisted it will only back a referendum with a \u201ccredible\u201d leave option available, so that its leave voters can support Brexit \u2013 May\u2019s deal would not appear to fit the bill if it has been repeatedly and overwhelmingly defeated in parliament. However, any indicative votes process could involve allowing MPs free votes, so the frontbench\u2019s position might prove less important. The petition calls for article 50 to be revoked altogether, an option that has little support in parliament \u2013 unless it appeared to be the only way to stop a no-deal Brexit, which would not be the case if the government opened the door to finding alternatives. But Saturday\u2019s march will send a strong message to MPs when they are weighing up the options in the coming days. If May\u2019s Brexit deal is voted down for a third time, can she survive? The prime minister\u2019s authority, already shattered after her deal was defeated overwhelmingly for a second time, is draining away by the day. It is unclear whether she would feel it incumbent on her to resign if the vote was lost again \u2013 she didn\u2019t when it was lost the first time, by 230 votes, or the second, by 149. But she has little support left on either wing of her own party, with MPs openly discussing her departure date this week. She might decide to bow out \u2013 but judging by her past record, she might also cling on. Tory MPs have no means of challenging her until December, when the yearlong breathing space she gained when she won last year\u2019s vote of no confidence in her expires. If she resigned, would that mean a general election? Not immediately. There would have to be a Conservative leadership contest, which would take several weeks at least, involving a series of run-offs among MPs at Westminster (there are a lot of potential candidates), and then a members\u2019 vote. The winner would automatically become prime minister, just as May did when Cameron resigned, and indeed Gordon Brown did when Tony Blair stepped aside. However, any new leader would face intense pressure to seek their own, personal mandate, on their own distinctive manifesto. And, more importantly, governing in a hung parliament is extremely difficult. A new prime minister who fancied their chances, as May once did, might be tempted to roll the dice and try to win a clear majority.",

Finally, with only eight days to go until the original deadline, the British prime minister was granted a full 90 minutes in the multicoloured summit room in the Europa headquarters. For the EU, it was not time well spent. \u201cIt was 90 minutes of nothing,\u201d one EU source said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even give clarity if she is organising a vote. Asked three times what she would do if she lost the vote, she couldn\u2019t say. It was fucking awful. Dreadful. Evasive even by her standards.\u201d About a dozen EU leaders peppered the British prime minister with questions. Did she have a plan B? How was she going to gain a majority? When would she hold the Commons vote? \u201cShe very much dodged these questions,\u201d a second EU source said. A third source said: \u201cShe was not convincing. It was not clear if she had a plan B; it was not clear if she had a plan at all.\u201d May knew the EU\u2019s patience was at breaking point. In case she needed a reminder, Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, had said Brexit was like waiting for Godot \u201cand Godot is never coming\u201d. Over coffee and biscuits, she thanked EU leaders for their patience and said it would be helpful if the UK could delay Brexit until 30 June. Once she had left the room, leaders vented their frustrations. \u201cMaybe we should just let them go,\u201d Bettel said, a remark made more in frustration than in earnest, according to one observer.

In the Commons, Kwarteng\u2019s abrupt change followed mounting frustration from MPs at his refusal to answer any questions on what the government would do following the EU\u2019s decision, particularly the next steps if May\u2019s plan is again rejected, triggering a deadline of 12 April for the UK to find a new approach or leave without a deal. Opening the questioning, the shadow Brexit minister, Matthew Pennycook, began by condemning May\u2019s TV statement on Wednesday in which she blamed MPs for being unable to make a decision on Brexit. \u201cBut we have made a decision \u2013 voting down her deal twice, by historic margins,\u201d he told MPs. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s a decision the prime minister is clearly incapable of accepting. It is her intransigence, her pandering to the hardliners in her party, and her refusal to compromise that has brought us to this point.\u201d He asked Kwarteng to say when the third meaningful vote would happen, as well as how the government would comply with the ruling by the Speaker, John Bercow, that a new vote will only be allowed under Commons procedures if it is a notably different proposal. If it were defeated again, Pennycook said, Kwarteng should \u201cset out the process by which the government will provide this house with an opportunity to properly debate the range of alternative options available to us, and to facilitate attempts to secure a majority for one of them\u201d. He added: \u201cMinisters have constantly told us that responsible governments prepare for all eventualities.

He then rebuffed requests from Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn to say whether the government would work with MPs on the idea of indicative votes on a possible way forward. \u201cThe government\u2019s focus at the moment is to make sure that we can potentially get a meaningful vote and secure the deal on the table,\u201d Kwarteng said.

Asked by Labour\u2019s Karen Buck if the government still planned to seek a consensus way forward if May\u2019s plan fell again, he replied: \u201cI think that if the meaningful vote is voted down then it would be reasonable to have a wide debate in the house to find what the house would tolerate and how it sees things going forward.\u201d",

A national unity government was first formed during the Napoleonic Wars in 1806 and last occurred in 1931. During the second world war, an all-party coalition was formed by Winston Churchill. Soames has previously mooted the idea of a national unity government, telling Channel 4 News: \u201cI must say, if I had my way, we would have a national government to deal with this. It is the most serious problem this country has faced since the war.\u201d It emerged on Thursday that donations to the Conservatives are drying up as backers unhappy with splits over Brexit refuse to fund the party. Mick Davis, the party\u2019s chief executive, and Brandon Lewis, the party\u2019s chair, addressed a private meeting of the 1922 committee on Thursday, where MPs were told that the party was struggling to raise \u00a332m, Bloomberg reported. According to the Electoral Commission website, the Conservative party has received \u00a3147m in donations since 2013, excluding public funds. Almost 30% of this (\u00a342.8m) came from 20 individual donors. The Guardian interviewed three other Tory donors last month who have given more than \u00a3500,000 since 2010. All said they were unsure whether to give cash to the party at present. One said the party \u201cappears to be dying on its feet\u201d, while another said he wanted to see who was going to lead it into the next election before committing any cash. The Conservative party has been approached for a comment.",

After a marathon late-night session of talks, the EU\u2019s leaders ripped up May\u2019s proposals and a new Brexit timeline was pushed on the prime minister to avoid the cliff-edge deadline of 29 March \u2013 next Friday.

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brexit has been delayed until 12 April at the earliest after the prime minister accepted the EU\u2019s proposals.</strong> Theresa May had been forced into asking for the delay after her Brexit deal went down to two heavy defeats in the Commons.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK will leave the EU on 22 May if Parliament accepts May\u2019s deal and, if it doesn\u2019t, Brexit is scheduled to happen in three weeks.</strong> The government will be able to seek a longer extension if it can come up with a plan and agree to participate in the upcoming European Parliament elections. But May said she was not minded to meet the latter condition.</li> \n   <li><strong>The decision came after late-night talks that followed the EU\u2019s rejection of May\u2019s own plans for a delay.</strong> The prime minister failed to convince the bloc that she was capable of avoiding a no-deal Brexit.</li> \n   <li><strong>Workers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 representatives joined together to issue a statement saying the country is facing a \u201cnational emergency\u201d over Brexit. </strong>In a rare move, the heads of the TUC and the CBI united to demand that Theresa May takes steps to protect jobs and adopt a Brexit \u201cplan B\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Labour leader refused to rule out revoking article 50.</strong> Nevertheless, Jeremy Corbyn insisted his party was focused on working out an alternative deal to leave the European Union. He also defended his decision to walk out of a meeting on Brexit because the former Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, had been invited.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from us this evening but, for those wanting to read more, my colleagues <strong>Daniel Boffey</strong>, <strong>Heather Stewart</strong>, and <strong>Jennifer Rankin</strong> have the full story:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/21/mays-appeal-falls-flat-as-eu-seizes-control-of-brexit-date\">May's appeal falls flat as EU seizes control of Brexit date</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c942277e4b0a5422e6394b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-22T00:06:28.366Z\">12.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the snap analysis from my colleague, <strong>Heather Stewart</strong>:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1108880190917230594\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Notably softer tone from PM tonight after last night\u2019s bombast - understands MPs\u2019 frustrations; doesn\u2019t *rule out* a longer extension, just says she \u201cbelieves strongly\u201d it would be wrong to ask voters to participate in EU elections.</p>\u2014 Heather Stewart (@GuardianHeather) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1108880190917230594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And, in Westminster, the Labour MP <strong>Hilary Benn</strong> is trying to secure the time for MPs to debate what alternatives there might be to May\u2019s deal:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hilarybennmp/status/1108873083094331392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our cross-party amendment for Monday.

Here are the main points he has been making.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn refused to rule out Labour backing revoking article 50 - although he strongly played down the prospect.</strong> Asked if he would consider the idea, Corbyn said that was a hypothetical question. Pressed again on whether he was ruling this out, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We think that what we are proposing can be achieved in the British parliament. We do believe we can construct a majority which will prevent the crashing out and all the chaos that will come from crashing out, and that is what we are absolutely focused on.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The question arises because any request to extend article 50 has to be agreed with all EU member states. But the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally at any point before Brexit. This would cancel Brexit altogether, although there is an argument that if revocation were used solely as a negotiating tactic to buy more time, it would not be allowed under EU law.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn defended his decision to boycott a cross-party meeting convened by the prime minister because Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who now sits with the Independent Group, was there.</strong> Asked why people should believe he was committed to cross-party cooperation in the light of what happened, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There was a confusion over that meeting. I had a separate and very extensive discussion with the prime minister later on. I\u2019m also arranging to meet the prime minister next week, on a one-to-one basis as leader of the opposition. I have met with the leaders of all the other parties in parliament in my office this week, and Keir [Starmer] has also met with delegations from all across the House of Commons.

He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But, underneath, what she was really saying is that in a hung parliament MPs have a different responsibility. In a normal parliament, where a government has a majority, where it can gets its business done with the majority it has, then MPs debate, criticise, do their normal things, come on the Today programme and so on.</p> \n   <p>In a hung parliament MPs actually have to make decisions because governments cannot decide things on their own. And we don\u2019t have those very often in our history. But she was really making the point that all of us as MPs, whether backbenchers or opposition MPs, have a special responsibility, because a decision cannot happen without parliament giving it approval.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is a novel constitutional argument, and not one that we\u2019ve heard from any minister since the general election in 2017. It is also hypocritical, because the government has repeatedly whipped its MPs to vote down attempts by MPs such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn to create a process that would allow MPs to take the initiative in selecting a Brexit alternative. Labour\u2019s <strong>Chris Bryant </strong>makes roughly the same point here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RhonddaBryant/status/1108643068692103169\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So Jeremy Hunt thinks MPs have a special responsibility to back the gov't in a hung parliament!

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog after a Brexit marathon at the EU summit in Brussels. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: Brexit has been delayed until 12 April at the earliest after the prime minister accepted the EU\u2019s proposals. Theresa May had been forced into asking for the delay after her Brexit deal went down to two heavy defeats in the Commons. The UK will leave the EU on 22 May if Parliament accepts May\u2019s deal and, if it doesn\u2019t, Brexit is scheduled to happen in three weeks. The government will be able to seek a longer extension if it can come up with a plan and agree to participate in the upcoming European Parliament elections. But May said she was not minded to meet the latter condition. The decision came after late-night talks that followed the EU\u2019s rejection of May\u2019s own plans for a delay. The prime minister failed to convince the bloc that she was capable of avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Workers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 representatives joined together to issue a statement saying the country is facing a \u201cnational emergency\u201d over Brexit. In a rare move, the heads of the TUC and the CBI united to demand that Theresa May takes steps to protect jobs and adopt a Brexit \u201cplan B\u201d. The Labour leader refused to rule out revoking article 50. Nevertheless, Jeremy Corbyn insisted his party was focused on working out an alternative deal to leave the European Union. He also defended his decision to walk out of a meeting on Brexit because the former Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, had been invited. That\u2019s all from us this evening but, for those wanting to read more, my colleagues Daniel Boffey, Heather Stewart, and Jennifer Rankin have the full story: Here\u2019s the snap analysis from my colleague, Heather Stewart: And, in Westminster, the Labour MP Hilary Benn is trying to secure the time for MPs to debate what alternatives there might be to May\u2019s deal: Theresa May\u2019s speech as a whole has not gone down well with the Labour MP, Chi Onwurah: But then, that is perhaps to be expected. Nor has it gone down well with the hard-Brexit supporting former Tory MP, Stewart Jackson: But then, that too is perhaps to be expected. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, her Labour colleague, Steve McCabe, and the SNP MP, Pete Wishart, are unimpressed by May\u2019s attempt at conciliation tonight: Here\u2019s what Theresa May said this evening on the comments she made last night, in which she blamed the Brexit delay on Parliament, rather than accepting responsibility for it herself: I know MPs on all sides of the debate have passionate views and I respect those different positions. Last night, I expressed my frustration and I know that MPs are frustrated too \u2013 they have difficult jobs to do. I hope we can all agree we are now at the moment of decision and I will make every effort to make sure we can leave with a deal and move our country forward. Later, she was asked if she felt she should apologise to MPs, some of whom have said they have been on the receiving end of death threats and harassment over Brexit. She declined to do so, saying instead: There are passionately held views on all sides of this argument. And yes, as I said, last night I expressed frustration but I know MPs are frustrated too. She added her gratitude to those who have agreed to support her deal, as well as to those she\u2019s met with to discuss their concerns about the deal. Some MPs had reacted furiously to her comments. One Labour MP even said he was physically attacked: Reference is made to the petition to revoke Brexit, which has been signed by more than two million people as things stand. Does May believe opinion in the UK might have shifted? May says the referendum was held and the government agreed to enact its result. That is what it is doing. May is asked to rank in order of preference her choices \u2013 leaving the EU with or without a deal, delaying Brexit and revoking article 50. She declines to do so but reiterates that she will not countenance revoking article 50 (as detailed at 9.39pm). May is asked if she should apologise about her language in discussing MPs\u2019 refusal to vote through her deal. She does not do so, but says she understands people have genuinely held views. She calls for MPs to vote through her deal so they can secure the delay until 22 May. May says she believes it would be wrong to ask the UK to take part in European Parliament elections three years after voting to leave \u2013 a prerequisite of a longer delay. She address an audience in Westminster, saying she understands MPs are frustrated. \u201cWe are now at the moment of decision,\u201d she says and adds that she wants to leave with a deal. The prime minister is reiterating her phrase about \u201clegally binding\u201d changes to the backstop made last week. She was also careful to call the delay \u201cshort\u201d. Theresa May is about to start her press conference. Final question: Tusk said there was a special place in hell for those people who promoted Brexit without having \u201ceven a sketch of a plan\u201d for how to deliver it. He and Juncker are asked whether, should British MPs refuse to vote through May\u2019s deal, more room be should made? Tusk responds: \u201cAccording to our pope*, hell is still empty and it means there are a lot of spaces.\u201d Juncker adds: \u201cDon\u2019t go to hell.\u201d And, with that, the press conference is brought to a swift conclusion. *We originally reported that Tusk had said \u201caccording to our poll\u201d. I misheard him and the quote has been updated to reflect that. Next question: What was the atmosphere in the room and is there a risk of kicking the can down the road now? Tusk says the atmosphere was better than in December. He is satisfied they were able to find a way to ease the process. He does not address the risk of any cans being kicked. After a brief press conference, Tusk and Juncker are now taking questions. They are asked how long a \u201clong extension\u201d is. \u201cTill the very end,\u201d Juncker says, to laughter in the room. Jean-Claude Juncker reiterates that the EU is ready for all outcomes \u2013 including a no-deal Brexit and that it cannot change the withdrawal agreement; a point the European Council was at pains to make in its published proposals. Donald Tusk confirms that Theresa May has agreed to the plan to delay Brexit until 22 May if she can get her deal through the Commons, or 12 April if she cannot. Tusk is outlining the terms of the deal, as detailed at 10.42pm. He says the UK will still have the choice of a deal, no deal, a long delay or revoking article 50. A key point will be whether or not the UK agrees to hold European Parliament elections. Tusk and Juncker are beginning their press conference. The European Council has published the terms of its proposal to Theresa May. She is discussing them with its president, Donald Tusk, now. The most salient parts read as follows: The European Council agrees to an extension until 22 May 2019, provided the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons next week. If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European Council agrees to an extension until 12 April 2019 and expects the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by the European Council. The European Council reiterates that there can be no opening of the withdrawal agreement that was agreed between the [European] Union and the United Kingdom in November 2018. Any unilateral commitment, statement or other act should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the withdrawal agreement. The European Council calls for work to be continued on preparedness and contingency at all levels for the consequences of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal, taking into account all possible outcomes. So, in summary, the prime minister has been offered until 22 May if she gets her deal through the Commons. If she does not, she\u2019d have until 12 April. Meanwhile, the EU will continue to prepare for all outcomes \u2013 including a no-deal Brexit. As Tusk himself puts it: According to the Press Association, EU leaders are set to offer the UK a plan that would delay Brexit from 29 March to 22 May on condition that MPs approve Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal. If the deal is rejected in its third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d in the Commons, the UK would be given until 12 April to come to the European Council with its proposals for the way forward. If the UK agreed to take part in European Parliament elections in May, the possibility would be open for a further extension of several months. Tusk has not officially confirmed what the bloc\u2019s offer will be but is meeting May right now to communicate it to her. Theresa May and the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, are about to meet, with the bloc having decided upon its response to her request for a delay: Sources have dismissed Theresa May\u2019s plea for more time to deliver a form of Brexit she and parliament can live with as \u201c90 minutes of nothing\u201d. My colleagues, Daniel Boffey, Heather Stewart and Jennifer Rankin, report that, according to a source, the prime minister \u201cdismally\u201d failed to offer any answers as to what she would do if the deal was blocked by MPs again One aide is quoted as saying: She didn\u2019t even give clarity if she is organising a vote. Asked three times what she would do if she lost the vote, she couldn\u2019t say. It was awful. Dreadful. Evasive even by her standards. When leaders asked May what she was going to do if her deal was voted down, an official added that the prime minister replied that she was following her \u2018Plan A\u2019 of getting it through. It was then the EU decided that \u201cshe didn\u2019t have a plan so they needed to come up with one for her\u201d, the source added. The prime minister has no intention of revoking article 50, despite a public petition calling for the Brexit deadline to be cancelled passing 1.6 million signatures. When asked for Theresa May\u2019s view on the petition, a Number 10 spokeswoman told the Press Association that May worried failing to deliver Brexit would cause \u201cpotentially irreparable damage to public trust\u201d. The prime minister has long been clear that failing to deliver on the referendum result would be a failure of our democracy and something she couldn\u2019t countenance. The prime minister has said many times she will not countenance revoking article 50. The number of names being added to the petition was so great on Thursday that the parliamentary petition website crashed several times. There are reports around of an increasingly strained relationship between the prime minister and her chief whip, Julian Smith. According to ITV News\u2019 Paul Brand, Smith \u201chas been openly admitting today that he found last night\u2019s statement in Downing Street \u2018appalling\u2019.\u201d On Wednesday evening, May delivered a televised address from Downing Street, in which she said the planned delay to Brexit was not her fault but that of MPs, adding that it was time for them to make a decision. ITV quote Smith as telling a fellow MP the prime minister \u201cjust won\u2019t listen\u201d to him. It\u2019s worth noting that Number 10 has denied the reports of a rift this evening. Here in Brussels, where it\u2019s now past 9pm, we\u2019ve been patiently awaiting a joint press conference from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, to announce the European council\u2019s decision on Theresa May\u2019s request for a three-month Brexit delay. But a spokesman for Tusk has just announced that the discussions will continue over dinner \u2013 without the prime minister. She addressed her fellow leaders earlier, in a 90-minute question and answer session that by all accounts did not go well, as she flatly refused to say what she plans to do if her deal is rejected for a third time. There then commenced a prolonged period of horse-trading over what new exit date Britain should be offered, and on what conditions; with some leaders keen to remove the risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit next week \u2013 or the need to return to Brussels for an emergency summit \u2013 and others, including the French president Emmanuel Macron, taking a harder line. Who knows where they\u2019ll end up. But the outcome will make an enormous difference to how the next few days and weeks play out back in Westminster. Bulgaria\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Dimiter Tzantchev, has posted this picture of the bloc\u2019s Brexit negotiators, Sabine Weyand and Stephanie Riso, as well as the Dutch and Irish ambassadors to the EU, Declan Kelleher and Robert de Groot, among a team of officials working on the article 50 discussions: Weyand is standing in the centre wearing a blue lanyard. Kelleher is to her right and in front of him, apparently kneeling on the floor, is Riso. De Groot is to her right, wearing glasses. It\u2019s looking like we may be in for a bit of a wait \u2013 this comes from Donald Tusk\u2019s spokesman: Discussions between the leaders are ongoing, and don\u2019t appear to be close to being resolved. France and Belgium are pushing for an extension to the 7 May date, with an option to extend until the end of the year. The reason for the move by Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is in part that 8 May is a bank holiday in France. That would give him a buffer in case of the financial shock of a no-deal Brexit. That bank holiday being la F\u00eate de la Victoire\u2019 \u2013 Victory Day \u2013 to celebrate the end of the second world war. There is also an EU summit in the Romanian city of Sibiu on 9 May, where the bloc\u2019s 27 heads of state and government are set to start planning the future of Europe without Britain. The draft conclusions presented to leaders to debate at the head of today\u2019s discussion had stated that the UK could extend until 22 May. The UK holds European elections on 23 May. But Macron is also keen to avoid a no-deal scenario on 22 May \u2013 just ahead of the European elections in France on 26 May. Under the Macron plan, there would also be an option for the UK to extend to the end of 2019 if the British government notified the EU of its intentions by 11 April. That is the date by which the Electoral Commission would need to know if European elections are being held in the UK. Any extension beyond 22 May would require European elections. It is an EU red line. The EU wants to protect its institutions from being improperly constituted through having the UK in as a member state but without MEPs in the parliament. My colleagues Rowena Mason and Dan Sabbagh have also been looking at what Theresa May might do if her deal gets voted down. And, like the Financial Times (see 7.09pm), they have concluded that the evidence is pointing towards no deal. Here is how their story starts. Cabinet ministers believe there is now a real risk of a no-deal Brexit, with sources close to them describing the mood in government as depressing and No 10 as \u201crun by lunatics\u201d. Senior members of the cabinet from both sides of the Brexit argument are understood to think the chances of the UK leaving without a deal have substantially increased after the prime minister set herself against a longer extension to article 50. One aide to a cabinet minister said No 10 was in \u201cfull-on bunker mode\u201d and the prime minister\u2019s speech from Downing Street showed \u201cthey have all taken leave of their senses\u201d. Another soft-Brexit cabinet source described the mood as \u201cdepressing\u201d and said of no deal: \u201cThe risk is now very real.\u201d But do read the whole thing. It\u2019s here. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Politico Europe has what it says is the latest draft wording from the EU27 conclusions on Brexit. This is from Politico Europe\u2019s Jack Blanchard. More reports on what seems to be going on in the EU27 discussion. These are from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. This is from David Henig, a trade policy expert. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler. And this is from the Irish Times\u2019 Denis Staunton. This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. As reported earlier, the key question in British politics at the moment is, \u2018What will Theresa May do if MPs vote down her Brexit deal?\u2019 (See 1.02pm.) Default to no deal, or abandon her opposition to the UK staying in the EU beyond June and taking part in the European elections? The Financial Times thinks it has the answer; it\u2019s no deal. This is from the FT\u2019s George Parker. And here\u2019s an extract from the FT story (paywall). In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Theresa May made a momentous choice. After a day of acrimonious debate in her cabinet and inner circle, the prime minister decided that she was willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal. At Thursday\u2019s European council meeting in Brussels, EU diplomats wondered whether Mrs May was bluffing, but those close to the prime minister said if she cannot secure her Brexit deal she is determined the UK should embark on a no-deal exit. And these are from the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler. Here are some more reports from what is happening in the EU27 discussion. From the Sunday Times\u2019 Andrew Byrne From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming The French president, Emmanuel Macron, posted this on Twitter earlier, reinforcing the point he made as he arrived at the summit. And here is the translation from Twitter. On Brexit, we need to be clear to ourselves, our British friends and our peoples. The withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. In case of a British negative vote, we would go to a no-deal. This is from Bloomberg\u2019s Jess Shankelman. This is from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. These are from Sky\u2019s Deborah Haynes. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli. It prompted this response from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle says a constituent tried to assault him today. He makes a connection between what happened and what Theresa May said in her speech last night about MPs blocking Brexit. (See 9.12am.) A court has upheld the Electoral Commission\u2019s decision to fine the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU for breaching campaign finance rules in the EU referendum. Sitting at the Central London county court, Judge Dight ruled today that the commission was entitled to find the group exceeded campaign spending limits, and that it had misreported some details of loans and spending. However the judge allowed aspects of Leave.EU\u2019s appeal, including that payments to the American political consultancy Goddard Gunster did not need to be reported, because political strategic advice is not a reportable election expense under UK electoral law. The commission originally fined Leave.EU \u00a370,000 for various offences last May. Because aspects of the group\u2019s appeal succeeded, the overall penalty is likely to be reduced at a further hearing in April. The pound has plunged against the dollar on the foreign exchange markets, heading for the biggest one-day fall of the year on rising fears over no-deal Brexit. Sterling dropped by about 2 cents against the dollar to $1.3011, extending falls over recent days from a nine-month high of $1.34 last week. The pound also weakened by about 0.6% against the euro to \u20ac1.15. Analysts said the prospect of only a short delay in the article 50 process and the mounting risk that Britain could sleepwalk into a no-deal scenario were dragging the pound lower. Sterling is still about 12% below the level recorded before the EU referendum in 2016, reflecting the UK\u2019s weaker prospects for economic growth. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at the financial trading firm Oanda, said: \u201cSterling volatility has certainly picked up over the last 24 hours, with May\u2019s article 50 extension request appearing to be the trigger.\u201d Ipsos Mori has some new polling out today that makes grim reading for both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. As Joe Murphy reports in the Evening Standard, only 18% of people have confidence in Theresa May to get a good Brexit deal. But only 21% think Corbyn would get a good Brexit deal, the poll suggests. Ipsos Mori has more polling in its March Political Monitor (pdf). This chart shows how confidence in May to get a good Brexit deal has been falling. This chart is interesting too, because it shows that most Conservative supporters did have confidence in May to get a good Brexit deal until July last year, when the Chequers plan was agreed. At that point May lost the confidence of most Tories on Brexit, and she has not regained it. And this chart could be useful to any Labour MPs wondering whether they will get the blame if they fail to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal next week, leading to the UK leaving the EU without a deal. If these figures are correct (and they should be treated with some caution, because people were being asked about something that has not happened yet), the answer is - not much. These are from Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, on the draft summit conclusions on Brexit. (See 4.59pm.) Teachers in primary schools in Kent have been told they may have to suspend classes and \u201cadopt a carer role\u201d in the event of disruption caused by a no-deal Brexit, my colleagues Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Richard Adams report. They have also been advised by local authorities to check on food supplies and warned that public transport and school coaches could be affected if there is \u201cpanic buying\u201d of fuel, according to a document seen by the Guardian. The schools have been warned they may have to consider looking after \u201cstranded\u201d children in the event parents are caught up in gridlock. Here is their full story. Here is my colleague Daniel Boffey on the draft summit conclusions on Brexit. (See 4.59pm.) This is from Stefan Rousseau, the Press Association\u2019s chief political photographer. The catastrophic impact of no-deal on Ireland\u2019s farming and food sector has been laid out in detail county by county by one of the country\u2019s leading economists. Edgar Morgenroth, professor of economics at Dublin City University, has concluded the border counties Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal will bear the brunt because of their reliance on agri-food for employment. Between them they are among some of the biggest suppliers of mushrooms, chicken, dairy and ready meals to the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, and Michael Heseltine, the former Conservative cabinet minister, are among the keynote speakers due to address the end of the People\u2019s Vote march on Saturday, which hundreds of thousands are expected to attend. Other political figures include Labour MPs Jess Phillips and David Lammy; Conservative MPs such as former cabinet minister Justine Greening; the former attorney general Dominic Grieve; the Independent Group MP Anna Soubry; the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable; and Green MP Caroline Lucas. Speeches are due to begin about 2.45pm in Parliament Square with a feed relayed to large screens in Trafalgar Square. This is from Politico Europe\u2019s Charlie Cooper. The Financial Times\u2019 Robert Shrimsley has a good Twitter thread exploring what might happen if Theresa May has decided that a no-deal Brexit would be preferable to a long article 50 extension, if her deal gets voted down next week. It starts here. This is from the Irish Times\u2019 Pat Leahy. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli. The 22 May date has been chosen because it is the day before the European elections start. Here are some more questions from readers that I will answer here because they might be of general interest. What legislation needs to be passed in the UK to extend article 50? The EU Withdrawal Act, as it currently stands, says EU law will cease to apply when the UK leaves the EU at 11pm on 29 March 2019. If there is an extension, the government will have to change the exit date in the act. But that is a relatively straightforward process; it would have to pass a statutory instrument in the Commons and the Lords. These would be simple yes/no votes (ie, on unamendable motions), probably after a 90-minute debate. If the UK were to revoke article 50, but leave the EU Withdrawal Act as it stands, the UK would be in breach of EU law. The EU would take us to the ECJ. And, in the meantime, lawyers would have a field day. Would the EU offer a long extension if parliament were to take control and back Norway plus? It is hard to say. But the EU can only negotiate with a prime minister, and a government. It can\u2019t decide the UK\u2019s future on the basis of talks with Yvette Cooper, or Hilary Benn, or John Bercow, or Oliver Letwin. EU leaders have repeatedly said they want to know there is a stable majority in the Commons for a Brexit proposition. They would want, not just a Commons vote for Norway plus (or whatever), but a government committed to implementing it. Can parliament force May to revoke article 50? Not very easily. There have been amendments tabled during Brexit debates calling for article 50 to be revoked (at least one was from SNP\u2019s Angus Brendan MacNeil), but they have not been called. MPs would have to vote for article 50 to be revoked, but a straightforward vote on a motion or an amendment would not be binding. MPs could then argue that the PM were in contempt of parliament if she ignored it, but there are limits to how far that process would take you. (Ultimately the Commons can suspend a member, but I\u2019m not sure even that would stop May being PM.) The only surefire mechanism would be for parliament to pass a bill requiring the PM to revoke article 50. Some lawyers argue, without primary legislation, the PM would not have the power to revoke article 50 anyway. But passing primary legislation without government support is extraordinarily hard, because the government normally controls the Commons timetable. Yvette Cooper came up with a plan for how this might happen, involving suspending standing order 14, but there is no guarantee that her plan would work, partly because a bill could be filibustered by government loyalists in the Lords. Can May revoke article 50 on her own? In theory, yes, she can do it on her own. She would be using a prerogative power. But government lawyers argue that in practice she would need a vote in parliament, or even legislation. By the way, I don\u2019t think the Peston scoop (see 1.47pm) necessarily means May has secretly decided never to agree to no deal. I think it\u2019s more a case of Number 10 not wanting a junior minister to be specific, so that as many options as possible remain open. A response, of a sort, from Downing Street to the joint CBI/TUC letter expressing alarm at the possible drift to a no-deal Brexit (see 2.29pm). At the lobby briefing, when asked about it, Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman said: The PM has said that she\u2019s absolutely determined to do everything she can to leave with a deal that protects businesses and jobs, and provides them with the certainty that they want. It was \u201cnot clear\u201d whether the letter had yet been officially sent to No 10, she said, meaning there was no news yet about the groups\u2019 request for an urgent meeting with May. The spokeswoman added: \u201cShe has engaged widely with business, including with those two groups.\u201d The Telegraph\u2019s James Rothwell has another line from what Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said earlier that is worth recording. The e-petition calling for article 50 to be revoked has now got more than 1m signatures. During the business statement in the Commons earlier, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, was asked about the petition (which at that point had been signed by around 800,000 people). Leadsom implied she was not particularly impressed. She told MPs: Should the petition reach more than 17.4m signatures [ie, the number of people who voted leave], there would be a very clear case for taking action. The EU summit is now under way. By early this evening we should know what the EU27 have decided to offer the UK in terms of an article 50 extension. It would be a mistake to read too much into the comments given by the leaders to the media as they arrived, which are mostly just there to fill space in a three-hour news cycle. But politicians do plan in advance what they are going to say at moments like this, and there are some points that stand out. Some EU leaders were keen to talk up the prospect of the UK heading for no deal. In his statement yesterday, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, implied that MPs would next face a choice between voting for Theresa May\u2019s deal or a no-deal Brexit. But he was not explicit about that. Today leaders such as Emmanuel Macron (see 2.11pm), Krisjanis Karins (see 1.59pm) and Xavier Bettel (see 2.19pm) have been talking up the risk of no deal. The same leaders have been playing down the prospect of the UK getting a new offer on an article 50 extension at the end of next week, if MPs vote down the deal. Yesterday Tusk said a short extension would be conditional on MPs voting for the deal. He would not say what would happen if MPs rejected the deal, beyond implying there would be a further EU summit. There has been speculation that at that point the EU could offer a long extension, conditional on the UK taking part in EU elections, and perhaps conditional on something else too. Today no one said that would not happen. But no one was talking up the idea either. Leo Varadkar said the EU wanted this crisis resolved soon (see 1.15pm) and Macron implied the EU would instead tilt towards no deal (see 2.11pm). May has continued to refuse to say what she would request if her deal gets rejected again next week, and she is also refusing to say explicitly that a no-deal Brexit is the only alternative. But she is also saying Brexit must be delivered, implying perhaps she is becoming reconciled to the prospect of the UK having to leave without a deal (see 1.02pm). Theresa May had a meeting with Donald Tusk, the European council president, earlier. The EU has an unusual practice of broadcasting footage of the leaders milling around at the start of their meeting, before they get down to business. There is no audio feed, so you cannot hear what they are saying, but it\u2019s a boon for anyone who believes in the \u201cbody language\u201d theory of reporting (that you can gauge what is going up just by watching the body language). The live feed has just gone down, but there was some footage of May. I don\u2019t think you could really read much into it, but May did not exactly look like a ray of sunshine. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, and Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, have jointly written an open letter to Theresa May saying that the country is facing a \u201cnational emergency\u201d over Brexit and that she should adopt a \u201cplan B\u201d. It is very unusual for the country\u2019s main employers organisation and the body representing trade unions to unite in this way and with such a strongly worded message to government. Here it is in full. Together we represent millions of workers and tens of thousands of businesses. It is on their behalf that we are writing to you to ask you to change your Brexit approach. Our country is facing a national emergency. Decisions of recent days have caused the risk of no deal to soar. Firms and communities across the UK are not ready for this outcome. The shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come. We ask you to take three steps to protect the jobs, rights and livelihoods of ordinary working people. First, avoiding no deal is paramount. Businesses and employees alike need to see their government clearly acknowledge the reckless damage no deal would cause and recommit itself to avoiding this outcome. Second, securing an extension has become essential. 88% of CBI members and a majority in parliament agree this is better than no deal. But at the same time an extension must genuinely allow a way forwards, and be long enough for a deal to be agreed. Third, \u2018the current deal or no deal\u2019 must not be the only choice. A Plan B must be found - one that protects workers, the economy and an open Irish border, commands a parliamentary majority, and is negotiable with the EU. A new approach is needed to secure this \u2013 whether through indicative votes or another mechanism for compromise. We cannot overstate the gravity of this crisis for firms and working people. We request an urgent meeting with you to discuss our concerns and hear your response. Echoing Emmanuel Macron (see 2.11pm), Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, said: If next week we are not able to find agreement in the House of Commons we are going in the direction of no deal. Asked about previous assurances given by Theresa May, he also turned literary. I have to feel sometimes that I\u2019m in the waiting room waiting for Godot, and Godot is never coming ... it\u2019s just a fact that we are waiting for something which is never coming. (Perhaps that\u2019s good news for remainers: Godot never turns up.) UPDATE: A reader thinks this is particularly appropriate. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission, president, said there would have to be another summit if there was a vote against the Brexit deal in the Commons next week. He said: In the event the withdrawal agreement will not be approved by the House [of Commons], we have to come back. Here are some more quotes from what Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said to reporters as he arrived. Prime Minister Theresa May has asked, in the case of a positive vote in the British parliament, for a purely technical extension. I am quite open to a technical extension - it should be as short as possible - in the case of a positive vote. The exit process has taken two years of negotiation. It cannot be renegotiated. Macron also said it was necessary to be \u201cclear\u201d about the consequences of Theresa May losing a third Commons vote on her deal. In the case of a negative vote in the British parliament, we will be going to a no deal. We all know that. It is absolutely essential to be clear in these days and these moments, because it is a matter of the good functioning of the EU. We cannot have what I would call an excessive extension which would harm our capacity to decision and to act. Sky\u2019s Mark Stone has a longer version of the Emmanuel Macron quote. The Latvian prime minister, Krisjanis Karins, said Britain would have to leave without a deal or revoke article 50 if May\u2019s deal is rejected again next week. Speaking as he arrived at the summit, he said: If the UK is leaving we would want that to be an orderly process so there has been a withdrawal agreement agreed over a two-year period \u2013 I don\u2019t see any chance of changing that. So the question is will the UK accept this agreement and then it will be an orderly withdrawal? No one wants a chaotic withdrawal. Asked what would happen if the deal were rejected, Karins replied: There are then two alternatives: either Great Britain withdraws article 50 and stays in the European Union or there is a disorderly withdrawal. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said MPs would have to back the Brexit deal for the EU to agree an extension. Speaking to reporters as he arrived at the summit, he said: The ball has to be in the court of the British parliament. They first have to say \u2018yes\u2019. I think the signal today might be that if the British parliament would say a \u2018yes\u2019 lock, stock and barrel to everything on the table, then Europe understands that technically that you need time to implement everything in law. The Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaite, said EU leaders would be \u201csupportive\u201d to Theresa May but warned there would be conditions to any extension of article 50. As she arrived at the summit, she said: We have European elections and that means probably conditionality will be an extension only [to] May or a longer extension. In that case the UK will need to organise an election ... We are still optimistic. We need to support the UK. The UK for us is important and we are hoping for a solution, but the timing is still in the hands of the UK parliament. Macron is now taking questions in English. (His earlier responses were in French.) He says if there is going to be a yes vote in parliament, the EU can agree an extension. But a no vote \u201cwill guide everybody to a no deal\u201d, he says. From the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has arrived at the summit. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has a mini-scoop that sheds some light on the \u201cwhat will happen if May loses the vote next week?\u201d mystery. (See 1.02pm and 1.19pm.) He has seen a briefing note prepared for Kwasi Kwarteng, a junior Brexit minister who did a round of interviews this morning, and, as Peston says in a blog, it says Kwarteng was told \u201cto avoid saying that MPs face a choice between backing the PM\u2019s deal and a no-deal Brexit\u201d. Peston goes on: Expecting to be asked in interviews that it\u2019s \u201cno-deal if you lose MV3 [a third meaningful vote on the PM\u2019s deal]\u201d, Kwarteng is told to reply \u201cyou\u2019re getting ahead of yourselves\u201d. Elsewhere in the note, headed \u201ctop lines and Q&amp;A\u201d it says that if MPs reject the PM\u2019s deal again, \u201cMPs will have to decide how to proceed\u201d. There is no suggestion that a no-deal Brexit is the automatic consequence. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the EU would do all it could to ensure an orderly Brexit as she arrived at the summit. UPDATE: Here is a fuller version of the quote. To the last hour, we must do everything to ensure that there can be an orderly British exit from the EU. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has released quotes from two more MPs criticising Theresa May for what she said about MPs in her speech last night. (See 9.12am.) This is from Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general. I do not believe that the prime minister\u2019s statement last night will have persuaded a single MP to support a reckless strategy that contrary to our national interest and our democratic tradition. Simply browbeating MPs into submission serves no purpose at all. It brings us the government, parliament and democracy itself into contempt. And this is from the Labour former business minister Pat McFadden. Last night\u2019s statement from the prime minister was not only badly misjudged but also reckless. It is deeply irresponsible to play the people versus parliament as she has done repeatedly over the past week. It has gone down like a lead balloon among MPs that Downing Street thinks it can browbeat into supporting her Brexit deal. And it undermines the nature of our parliamentary democracy where it is the essential job of elected representatives to exercise their judgements and cast their votes and then be answerable to the voters for how they have done so. During the business statement in the Commons, several MPs complained about Theresa May\u2019s speech last night. (See 9.12am.) They included the Labour MP Paula Sheriff, who said: Last week I received a message saying my head should be chopped off among lots and lots of others. I apprehended the prime minister last week and I begged her, \u2018dial down the hate prime minister, it\u2019s in your power to dial down the hate\u2019. People are in fear, not just here but across the country, and the prime minister must show some leadership, it is within her grasp. John Bercow, the Speaker, insisted no MP should be seen as a traitor. He said: None of you is a traitor. All of you are doing your best. This should not be, and I\u2019m sure will not prove to be, a matter of any controversy whatsoever. Ireland\u2019s Twitterverse is roasting the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan for bungling Irish history in a Telegraph article and then refusing to admit his mistake. In citing Ireland as an example of baleful EU influence, the Brexiteer wrote that Fianna F\u00e1il won every Irish election between 1932 and 2008. The party in fact lost six times. When challenged about this and other points this week, Hannan doubled down in a tweet. \u201cI managed a double first in modern history from Oxford. One of the things I was taught is that historians necessarily have different takes on the same events. Please try to accept that yours is not the only interpretation,\u201d he wrote. Mockery has ensued via the hashtag #HannanIrishHistory positing revisionist interpretations of Irish history, such as the ambulance siren being invented in Nenagh, County Tipperary, and Michael Collins faking his own death in 1922 in an insurance scam before fleeing to America, piloting the Apollo 11 mission and being immortalised in the song In The Air Tonight written by his brother Phil. The PM\u2019s deputy official spokeswoman denied that Theresa May had been insulting to MPs in her speech last night. At the lobby briefing earlier, the spokeswoman said: It was about setting up to the public details on the extension and her own personal feelings about that. I can\u2019t speak for MPs but the PM is working very hard to get the deal over the line. There is more work to do and the PM fully understands that. The spokeswoman said she would \u201cflatly reject\u201d the idea that the speech put MPs at risk from an angry public. Asked about the foreign secretary\u2019s claim that May was feeling under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d (see 9.55am), the spokeswoman said: This is an incredibly challenging process. The PM has been working tirelessly to deliver on what people voted for in able for us to be able to leave the European Union. Yes, it is not without its extraordinarily difficult challenges. Earlier I said the big question in British politics at the moment was: what will Theresa May do if she loses the vote next week? (See 1.02pm.) Here is Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby on the subject. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has been speaking at a meeting of the European People\u2019s party ahead of today\u2019s summit. Here are the key quotes. Varadkar said the EU wanted to avoid a \u201crolling cliff-edge\u201d. He said: Everyone wants to avoid a no-deal but we can\u2019t have a situation whereby we have a rolling cliff-edge, where we just put off decisions and deadlines every couple of months. Brexit was never going to be clean. Brexit would always require some very hard choices for the United Kingdom to make. It was never going to be all good and no bad. And those decisions now need to be made. (Presumably a rolling cliff-edge is an avalanche.) He said the EU wanted this crisis resolved relatively soon. Brexit is not a problem of our creation. We do need to see resolution, I think, sooner rather than later. I don\u2019t think this can drag on for months and years. He said now was not the time to consider a long article 50 extension. There hasn\u2019t been a request for a long extension so I don\u2019t think we can consider that at this stage. He said a no-deal Brexit would be a British choice. No-deal can only ever be a British choice. Let\u2019s not forget the March 29th deadline was set by the UK in the first place. It\u2019s always up to them, even at the last moment, to revoke article 50 unilaterally. They do not need permission to do that so no-deal, if it happens, will be a British choice and a British decision. Stefan Lofven, the Swedish prime minister, said a short article 50 extension would depend on MPs backing the Brexit deal as he arrived at the EU summit. He said: An extension would also depend upon the voting in the House of Commons because we believe it is very important that the House of Commons actually agrees upon the agreement that we have and then we can talk extension. Theresa May has arrived at the EU summit. On her way in she told reporters she would be requesting a short article 50 extension until the end of June. As I said yesterday, this delay is a matter of personal regret to me. But a short extension would give parliament the time to make a final choice that delivers on the result of the referendum. Asked if another vote against her deal next week would led to the UK leaving the EU without a deal at the end of next week, she replied: What is important is that parliament delivers on the result of the referendum and that we deliver Brexit for the British people. I sincerely hope that we can do that with a deal. I\u2019m still working on ensuring that parliament can agree a deal so that we can leave in an orderly way. What matters is that we deliver on the vote of the British people. When asked again what would happen if she lost the vote next week, she said: What matters is that we recognise that Brexit is the decision of the British people. We need to deliver on that. We are nearly three years on from the original vote. It is now the time for parliament to decide. One of the great mysteries of British politics at the moment is what May will do if she loses the vote again next week. Default to no deal, or abandon her opposition to the UK staying in the EU beyond June and taking part in the European elections? May did not give much of a clue either way. She did not explicitly say a vote against her deal would led to a no-deal Brexit, but she did repeatedly stress the need to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking to reporters after his meetings at the European commission in Brussels. Here are the main points he has been making. Corbyn refused to rule out Labour backing revoking article 50 - although he strongly played down the prospect. Asked if he would consider the idea, Corbyn said that was a hypothetical question. Pressed again on whether he was ruling this out, he said: We think that what we are proposing can be achieved in the British parliament. We do believe we can construct a majority which will prevent the crashing out and all the chaos that will come from crashing out, and that is what we are absolutely focused on. The question arises because any request to extend article 50 has to be agreed with all EU member states. But the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally at any point before Brexit. This would cancel Brexit altogether, although there is an argument that if revocation were used solely as a negotiating tactic to buy more time, it would not be allowed under EU law. Corbyn defended his decision to boycott a cross-party meeting convened by the prime minister because Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who now sits with the Independent Group, was there. Asked why people should believe he was committed to cross-party cooperation in the light of what happened, he replied: There was a confusion over that meeting. I had a separate and very extensive discussion with the prime minister later on. I\u2019m also arranging to meet the prime minister next week, on a one-to-one basis as leader of the opposition. I have met with the leaders of all the other parties in parliament in my office this week, and Keir [Starmer] has also met with delegations from all across the House of Commons. We have done a great deal. Corbyn said his meetings this morning had been \u201cpositive\u201d. He said that instead of bringing her deal back to parliament, Theresa May should be looking for a \u201cconstructive alternative\u201d. Theresa May\u2019s Downing Street speech last night may have seemed baffling to those watching at home but there may be a clue to its purpose in how the government social media machine has used the footage. Soon after she finished talking in Downing Street, the official UK government Facebook page began paying to promote a clip of her speaking under the banner \u201cBrexit: Let\u2019s Get On With It\u201d. The adverts, funded using public money, began running on Facebook last night and have already been seen at least 2 million times, according to the social network\u2019s new advertising disclosure rules. These views do not necessarily mean than a Facebook user bothered to watch any of the video, but they do mean that they saw a video in their newsfeed of Theresa May talking alongside the quote: \u201cYou want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side.\u201d Although the sums involved are not enormous \u2013 up to \u00a310,000 has been spent promoting the video since last night \u2013 it is another example of how Facebook ads are being used to put pressure on MPs to back Brexit by directly targeting voters. One mysterious group campaigning for a hard Brexit, which has never revealed its financial backers, has spent almost \u00a3500,000 on targeted Facebook ads since last October. \u201cYou\u2019re tired of ... the arcane procedural rows,\u201d Theresa May told the nation in her Downing Street speech last night. But Guardian readers clearly aren\u2019t. In the comments BTL we have been getting lots of questions about procedures. Here are three I think I can helpfully answer. Can parliament force the government what to do? Not easily. The Commons can vote for motions but a) the government has a large degree of control over what is debated (but not total control) and b) general motions passed by MPs are not binding. Votes on legislation are, of course, binding, because they decide what\u2019s law, and at some point the government will have to pass an EU withdrawal agreement bill (assuming the deal is passed). But most of the recent high-profile votes in the Commons have not been on statute. The only failsafe mechanism available to parliament, if it wants to stop the PM doing something, is to remove her with a vote a confidence. But even then she would remain PM until either someone else came forward able to command a majority in the Commons (and it is not easy to see who that might be), or until after a general election, which would take several weeks. Is the leader of the opposition the only person able to table a motion of no confidence? Any MP can table a motion of no confidence in the government. But they won\u2019t get selected for debate, and so they just get published as an early day motion. This is what happened when the smaller opposition parties tabled a no confidence motion at the end of last year. The leader of the opposition is in a different position because if he or she tables one, then by convention the government is obliged to set aside time for it to be debated (provided the request is reasonable \u2013 ie, not a repeat of a vote already held, with no change in circumstances that might make a different result possible). How would an \u2018indicative votes\u2019 process work? We don\u2019t know yet, and the various MPs who are proposing \u201cindicative votes\u201d have not said much on this topic. The problem is that the obvious system used to choose between multiple options, an alternative vote, does not fit with the way the Commons works. MPs vote either for or against a single proposition; this is even formalised in the architecture, where the chamber is flanked by an aye lobby and a no lobby. One option might be for MPs to have straight yes/no votes on a range of options, which is what happened when MPs voted on seven House of Lords reform options in 2003. (It wasn\u2019t a success; all seven were rejected.) Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, tabled an amendment recently suggesting that MPs vote on various options using the alternative vote system used to elect select committee chairs. But this would have to be done on paper, outside the Commons chamber. Kent police are to get another \u00a33.5m in funding to handle Brexit, the Home Office has announced, as no-deal Operation Yellowhammer continues. The policing minister, Nick Hurd, announced today that the department would reimburse the force in full after Kent\u2019s police and crime commissioner applied for additional funding earlier this month. Kent county council is having a full hearing today ahead of activating no-deal contingency plans from Monday. It will bear the brunt of no-deal chaos if the UK crashes out of the EU next Friday and although chances of that are less likely it has already put no-deal plans into action on motorways in the county. MPs have been advised to travel home by taxi when they leave parliament over fears they could be attacked by angry voters over their handling of Brexit, Kevin Schofield reports at PoliticsHome. And here is my colleague Alex Hern\u2019s story on the e-petition website crashing after a petitioner\u2019s call to revoke article 50. Here are some of the celebrities who have been encouraging people on Twitter to sign the e-petition calling for article 50 to be revoked. (See 10.22am.) Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK\u2019s former envoy to the EU, thinks Donald Tusk\u2019s offer of an extension on condition that MPs approve the Brexit deal next week should help Theresa May. Speaking in Dublin last night, Rogers said: That\u2019s not unhelpful to her because in a sense it amplifies the message she\u2019s been trying to give to people, which is: it really is my way or the abyss. However, May\u2019s requested extension raised the risk of no deal, he warned. I\u2019ve always thought the markets and the UK commentariat have underestimated the risks of no deal. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves, there is a very serious chance that we end up with no deal in the summer because \u2026 we\u2019ve run out of road, both sides have to a degree miscalculated the reaction from the other side, and we end up there because there\u2019s nowhere else to go. Rogers was talking to reporters after addressing the Institute of International and European Affairs. Kent county council has activated no-deal plans to keep its roads, hospitals and schools open, as the government considers pulling the trigger on national contingency measures involving 30 central departments and 5,000 staff, my colleagues Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Denis Campbell report. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has backed what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said yesterday about the EU being willing to give the UK a short article 50 extension conditional on MPs voting for the withdrawal agreement next week. Addressing the German parliament before today\u2019s summit, she said: [There was a request from Theresa May] to delay the exit date to June 30. The leaders of the EU27 will intensively discuss this request. In principle, we can meet this request if we have a positive vote in the British parliament next week about the exit document. But Merkel also said there would be a debate about whether a short extension would last until the end of June (just before the new European parliament meets), as May has proposed, or until 23 May (when the European elections start), as the European commission prefers. Merkel said: With regard to the date of June 30, we have to take into consideration that we have European elections in May. This means the future and legality of the European election must be respected. But we can surely talk positively about a short extension. A petition on the government\u2019s e-petition website calling for article 50 to be revoked has attracted more than 675,000 signatures and it is getting hundreds more by the minute. At one point earlier today the site crashed, which may or may not have been related to the volume of traffic it was attracting. E-petitions that get more than 100,000 signatures get debated in parliament. But the debates take place in Westminster Hall, the annex debating chamber, and MPs do not vote on the proposal, so it would be a mistake to think that an e-petition like this will have much influence on MPs. Also, e-petitions are a poor guide to public opinion. The What UK Thinks website tracks Brexit opinion in great detail and, as this chart shows, although remain has been opening up a bigger lead over leave recently, the shift in opinion has not been dramatic. Here is Robert Harris, the novelist, veteran political commentator and Neville Chamberlain expert, on Theresa May\u2019s address to the nation last night. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister who is involved in efforts to find a cross-party alternative to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, told the Today programme this morning that there was probably a majority for a Norway-plus approach. Stressing the need for parliament to find a consensus, he said: I believe, for example, that we will probably on that day be able to get a cross-party majority in favour of what is sometimes called Norway-plus and sometimes called Common Market 2.0, which is an arrangement where we remain in the single market and we have a customs arrangement with the EU, and that has not yet been tested. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was given the main 8.10 slot on the Today programme this morning. Here are the main points from his interview. Hunt defended what Theresa May said in her No 10 statement last night (see 9.12am), saying she was \u201creflecting the fact that people at home are getting very frustrated that the process is going on and on and on.\u201d He claimed that MPs\u2019 responsibilities in a hung parliament were not the same as in a parliament where the government has a majority. This was the point May was making in her speech last night, he argued. He explained: But, underneath, what she was really saying is that in a hung parliament MPs have a different responsibility. In a normal parliament, where a government has a majority, where it can gets its business done with the majority it has, then MPs debate, criticise, do their normal things, come on the Today programme and so on. In a hung parliament MPs actually have to make decisions because governments cannot decide things on their own. And we don\u2019t have those very often in our history. But she was really making the point that all of us as MPs, whether backbenchers or opposition MPs, have a special responsibility, because a decision cannot happen without parliament giving it approval. This is a novel constitutional argument, and not one that we\u2019ve heard from any minister since the general election in 2017. It is also hypocritical, because the government has repeatedly whipped its MPs to vote down attempts by MPs such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn to create a process that would allow MPs to take the initiative in selecting a Brexit alternative. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant makes roughly the same point here. Hunt claimed that if MPs did not vote for May\u2019s deal next week, the alternatives could be revoking article 50, or a second referendum. He said: If we are in the same situation this time next week then only a very limited list of things could happen: parliament could vote to revoke article 50, which is cancelling the Brexit process \u2013 I think that\u2019s highly unlikely ... There could be an EU emergency summit to offer us an extension, and we don\u2019t know what the length will be and it could have some very onerous conditions \u2013 they could say, for example: \u2018We\u2019ll give you an extension if you have a second referendum.\u2019 Again, I think it\u2019s very unlikely parliament would vote for that. And then we have no-deal as the legal default on Friday. So the choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability. He claimed that May had been tested more than any PM in living memory. He said: Let\u2019s not forget the extraordinary pressure that she is personally under, and I think she does feel a sense of frustration. Labour has scrambled to rectify any damage done by reports that Jeremy Corbyn walked out of a meeting with the prime minister at Downing Street last night because Chuka Umunna, the leader of the Independent Group and a former Labour MP, was also attending it. Barry Gardiner, the shadow secretary of state for international trade, told the Today programme that Corbyn had already held a \u201c20-minute, one-on-one\u201d conversation with Theresa May and that the meeting the Labour leader left was actually with David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister. He also said participants in the meeting that Corbyn missed later said the prime minister had refused to cede any ground on her red lines. Gardiner defended Corbyn\u2019s walkout by questioning the legitimacy of the Independent Group. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: Political parties have transparency about their funding arrangements. The Independent Group does not. My understanding is that they were there not for that meeting originally. They were there for a meeting with David Lidington and because No 10 didn\u2019t get its meetings sorted out they happened to be in the same room. It was chaos. It is not about the process, it is about the substance. The people who came out of that meeting said \u2018this meeting was simply for show, this meeting was simply so she could pretend that she was listening.\u2019 She did not listen, she has not changed her red lines, she is not willing to compromise. On the Today programme this morning, Romano Prodi, the former European commission president and former Italian PM, said he thought EU leaders would agree to a longer article 50 extension. He explained: I still think that there will be more time \u2026 there will be some compromise in order to get more time because really the common will against a hard Brexit is real. Theresa May travels to Brussels today to formally request an extension to article 50 that would delay Brexit beyond Friday next week, when the UK is currently supposed to leave the EU. British prime ministers have often had difficult encounters with their EU counterparts over the years, but it is hard to think of one more demeaning for the PM, or one where the power gap between the UK and the EU27 has been wider. \u201cHumiliating\u201d is an adjective frequently overused in political reporting, but today it is the perfect description. As if that was not bad enough, May seems to have hamstrung her own, slender chances of getting parliament to agree a deal next week by giving an evening address to the nation in which she blamed MPs for the Brexit deadlock. You can read the full text here, and it will make quite a good case study for the Guardian\u2019s ongoing study of the new populism. \u201cI am on your side,\u201d May declared, as she framed the crisis as a clash between MPs and the people. Parliament was to blame because it \u201chas done everything possible to avoid making a choice\u201d, May claimed, apparently oblivious to the charge that she herself is an Olympic-grade procrastinator. Unsurprisingly, the speech has infuriated MPs. My colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot have some of their reaction here. And here is more. From Labour\u2019s David Lammy From Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips More worryingly for May, her speech was also denounced by Lisa Nandy, one of the relatively few Labour MPs who (until last night, at least) had sounded open to the prospect of being persuaded to vote for May\u2019s deal. Some Conservatives are unhappy too. This is what the former minister Sam Gyimah, a remain voter who is opposed to May\u2019s deal, told the Today programme: I think democracy loses when a prime minister who set herself against the House of Commons and then blames MPs for doing their job. And this is particularly worrying given she knows MPs are receiving hate mail in their inboxes. Some MPs are receiving death threats. And Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says May was inadvertently making the case for a second referendum. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Jeremy Corbyn holds talks in Brussels with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general. 12.30pm (UK time): EU leaders start arriving for the EU summit. After 6pm: Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, are due to hold a press conference after the discussion about Brexit. Theresa May is expected to hold one too. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.
