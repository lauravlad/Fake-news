But, the report continues: \u201cThe Commission believes that it is therefore accurate to characterise our system as allowing for the purchase of sexual consent, and believes that this undermines the principle of sexual consent itself.\u201d</p> <p>This is an age old argument \u2013 one that sex workers have been battling against for many years. There are many reasons people consent to sex; money is one of them. But claiming that the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/26/26.pdf\">more than 70,000 sex workers</a> are, essentially, being raped every time they go to work makes it impossible to call out real violence when it happens.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people (mainly women) pay their rent, feed their children, cover university fees and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/05/austeristy-forcing-disabled-women-into-sex-work\">earn a living around disability</a> by selling sex. And here lies the glaring omission in the Tory report, conspicuous by its absence but smouldering away behind the public school debate-club moralising: it is poverty and lack of social care that drive the most vulnerable into the most exploitative parts of prostitution.</p> <p>Throughout the whole 20,000 word report, austerity is <em>not mentioned</em> <em>once</em>. The word \u201cpoverty\u201d appears just a single time. If the authors really believe that all sex work is coercive, perhaps looking at the reasons women do this might have been useful.</p> <p>Omitted from the report was last month\u2019s admission by the Department for Work and Pensions that poverty caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/12/universal-credit-delays-a-factor-in-prostitution-government-accepts\">universal credit</a> is a major driver of prostitution. Likewise the fact that, under the Tories, <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/what-we-do/research-advocacy/universal-credit-and-foodbank-use/\">food bank usage</a> has skyrocketed. \u201cHomelessness\u201d is mentioned zero times, despite an irrefutable link between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/24/housing-secretary-james-brokenshire-admits-tory-policies-blame-homelessness-rise\">Tory policy and rough sleeping</a>. Discussion of trafficking is divorced from immigration policy, quotes about student debt are used to moralise about consent rather than highlight the need for an end to tuition fees and a frontline worker\u2019s statement that the \u201cpresent housing model is a poor fit for women experiencing multiple and complex needs\u201d triggers no self-reflection on the fact that women shoulder 86% of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/women-bearing-86-of-austerity-burden-labour-research-reveals\">austerity burden</a>. Not one sentence is dedicated to the link between brutal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/25/strip-dwp-work-pensions-responsibility-ill-disabled-people\">disability benefits failings</a> and prostitution.</p> <p>Admittedly, wading through the available evidence around prostitution is a huge task. It was undertaken by <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/amnesty-international-publishes-policy-and-research-on-protection-of-sex-workers-rights/\">Amnesty International in 2016</a>, resulting in the organisation\u2019s call for the full decriminalisation of sex work, a legal initiative also backed by the World Health Organisation, UNAIDS and sex worker-led organisations around the globe. In the UK, groups such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ukdecrimnow\">Decrim Now</a>, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProstitutesColl\">English Collective of Prostitutes</a> (ECP) and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SexWorkHive\">Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement</a> (Swarm) call for the same: full decriminalisation for safety\u2019s sake.</p> <p>The Tory report sums up the evidence and decides otherwise, suggesting that \u201cthe most effective way to safeguard sexual consent while reducing the market for prostitution \u2026 is to legislate to make paying for sexual services an offence\u201d. Criminalising clients \u2013 the so-called end demand or Nordic model \u2013 is all that Bruce and her team have to offer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/03/uk-feminists-embrace-sex-workers-rights\">Why UK feminists should embrace sex worker rights | Kate Hardy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s telling that, throughout the report, quotes from current sex workers float free from any input they have on legislation, functioning only to provide lurid detail or harrowing testimony. And so the dots remain unconnected. Descriptions of poverty and illness sit in a vacuum and, free from responsibility, Tory party members can moralise about the obscenity of prostitution while the horror of austerity slides from sight.</p> <p>\u2022 Frankie Mullin is a freelance journalist.

Throughout the whole 20,000 word report, austerity is not mentioned once. The word \u201cpoverty\u201d appears just a single time. If the authors really believe that all sex work is coercive, perhaps looking at the reasons women do this might have been useful. Omitted from the report was last month\u2019s admission by the Department for Work and Pensions that poverty caused by universal credit is a major driver of prostitution. Likewise the fact that, under the Tories, food bank usage has skyrocketed. \u201cHomelessness\u201d is mentioned zero times, despite an irrefutable link between Tory policy and rough sleeping. Discussion of trafficking is divorced from immigration policy, quotes about student debt are used to moralise about consent rather than highlight the need for an end to tuition fees and a frontline worker\u2019s statement that the \u201cpresent housing model is a poor fit for women experiencing multiple and complex needs\u201d triggers no self-reflection on the fact that women shoulder 86% of the austerity burden. Not one sentence is dedicated to the link between brutal disability benefits failings and prostitution. Admittedly, wading through the available evidence around prostitution is a huge task. It was undertaken by Amnesty International in 2016, resulting in the organisation\u2019s call for the full decriminalisation of sex work, a legal initiative also backed by the World Health Organisation, UNAIDS and sex worker-led organisations around the globe. In the UK, groups such as Decrim Now, the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP) and the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm) call for the same: full decriminalisation for safety\u2019s sake. The Tory report sums up the evidence and decides otherwise, suggesting that \u201cthe most effective way to safeguard sexual consent while reducing the market for prostitution \u2026 is to legislate to make paying for sexual services an offence\u201d. Criminalising clients \u2013 the so-called end demand or Nordic model \u2013 is all that Bruce and her team have to offer. It\u2019s telling that, throughout the report, quotes from current sex workers float free from any input they have on legislation, functioning only to provide lurid detail or harrowing testimony. And so the dots remain unconnected. Descriptions of poverty and illness sit in a vacuum and, free from responsibility, Tory party members can moralise about the obscenity of prostitution while the horror of austerity slides from sight. \u2022 Frankie Mullin is a freelance journalist.

According to a weekend report, ministers are preparing for a no-deal emergency budget in the week of 7 October, while Javid has pledged \u201csignificant extra funding\u201d for mitigating a disorderly departure. So Javid\u2019s forthcoming announcements, including a budget, might be about softening the impact of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. There will also be an expectation that they will address the future of the economy in a post-Brexit Britain. Javid also has to decide whether to hold a full spending review that will set the budgets for individual Whitehall departments for the next three years, or to roll over the current settlements for a single year. The Treasury prefers three-year deals but civil servants concede that time is short. Without a full spending review, Johnson skips the usual checks required to ensure cash is spent appropriately, Chadha warned. He added that a no-deal Brexit could divert government spending away from needy areas. \u201cThere is money to be spent. But if it\u2019s spent in the wrong places, the places that do require the money are still in need.\u201d",
