With just days to go before the deadline for Boris Johnson to clinch a last-ditch Brexit deal in Brussels, the Queen will on Monday set out his government\u2019s priorities for a new session of parliament, including 22 new bills. But with MPs deadlocked over Brexit, few at Westminster believe a general election will be long in coming \u2013 and the Conservatives hope the policies will form the basis of their campaign. Under the proposals, violent and sexual offenders will serve a minimum of two-thirds of their sentence before becoming eligible to be released on licence, compared with half under current guidelines. But there were warnings from prison reformers that the plans could put staff in danger by taking away hope from inmates. Meanwhile, amid claims from the home secretary, Priti Patel, that the UK has been a \u201csoft touch on foreign criminals\u201d for too long, maximum sentences for foreign nationals who breach a deportation order will be \u201cdrastically increased\u201d from the present six months. Critics of the proposals, including prison reform charities, have already warned they will impose extra pressure on overcrowded jails and that the public is being misled into believing sentencing policy is softer than it really is. Criminal barristers point out most serious offenders are not automatically released at the halfway point in their sentence. The emphasis on harsher punishment is being urged on a criminal justice system that has been chronically underfunded since 2010 and in which ministers are accused of refusing to tackle the existing backlog of cases. But Conservative strategists believe the move will appeal to voters in Labour-held seats who are believed to be sympathetic to a tougher line on law and order.

      "bodyText": "Amelia Gentleman\u2019s piece on claiming EU settled status (The long read, 8 October) was helpful and revealing but overlooked the organisation that is probably best placed to steer claimants through the process: Citizens Advice. I am a volunteer adviser and have seen for myself how complicated a business it can be, especially for older people. My conclusion is: don\u2019t try this at home \u2013 unless you are very computer-literate. We have far more branches than there are local authorities, and as long as clients have brought all the necessary bits and pieces, they can often get the job done on a single visit. It would benefit a large number of people if you could publicise this. Les Masters Bleadon, Somerset \u2022 To add to the debate about the status of EU citizens in the UK, the British government has just seen fit to write individually to all of its citizens resident in Europe and in receipt of UK state pensions, thus entitling us to reciprocal healthcare rights in our country of residence. This missive informs us that our healthcare will only continue to be funded by the UK until the end of next year and that our pensions will only receive index-linked increases until 2023. This is, supposedly, to allow us time to make arrangements. How is this justified? We have all paid our taxes, so why are we suddenly to be deprived of medical services and expected to stretch our meagre pensions even further? Few of us could remotely afford private medical insurance. We hope that our host countries will be considerate enough to continue our medical care \u2013 but this will mean they are doing so without any contributions from HMG, which leaves us in a precarious position and subject to the differing priorities of changing governments.

But Corbyn signalled his caution on Sunday about the idea of backing a Brexit deal in exchange for a referendum, a view echoed by Trickett.</p> \n<p>\u201cI support the conference decision, and Jeremy\u2019s view, which is to vote down any Tory deal in the house, and then immediately press on to trying to remove the government,\u201d Trickett said. \u201cI think that is the order in which things should be done.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cA referendum before the election would imply a Tory Brexit against remain. I believe that the majority in the country voted for leave \u2013 and I feel that a Labour Brexit can only be delivered by a Labour government. So whichever way you look at it, you are back to the proposition that you have an election, you do the negotiation \u2013 and then you have the referendum.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s policy has evolved in a series of steps since the 2017 general election, which the party fought on a platform of honouring the referendum result.</p> \n<p>At the party\u2019s conference in Brighton last month, it was agreed that if Labour won a general election \u2013 which could come within weeks \u2013 Corbyn would aim to negotiate a revised Brexit deal, including a customs union, within three months, and put it to a public vote within six.</p> \n<p>Several shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have already said they would campaign for remain in that vote. But the Labour leader has declined to say which side he would take.</p> \n<p>Trickett suggested Corbyn could take a neutral role. \u201cIf he wants to unify the country, I could see an argument for him saying, \u2018I will implement whatever decision is taken,\u2019\u201d he said. And he urged pro-remain party members not to try to push Corbyn any further, saying: \u201cDo not tie our leader to a position which he thinks is not quite the right one to try to get us into an election victory.\u201d</p> \n<p>While Starmer has warned that failing to back remain is hurting the party in north London constituencies like his, Trickett said that in Hemsworth, the EU was the least of his constituents\u2019 worries.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I go round my patch, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say this, actually Brexit isn\u2019t mentioned that much. People who are very, very impassioned by Brexit will talk about nothing else. But the vast majority of people are talking about bus services, cuts to the health service, the cost of living,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/12/government-division-parliament-brexit-theresa-may-tory-labour\">This rotten government is too riven with division to unite parliament | Jon Trickett</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Certainly, as the \u201cwomen of Wakefield\u201d, as Trickett jokingly calls them \u2013 a group of local campaigners and community volunteers \u2013 meet to chat over tea and biscuits in his constituency office, Brexit barely comes up.</p> \n<p>Instead, they raise the depredations of universal credit, which has led to burgeoning use of food bank in the area; the lack of opportunities for young people; and the long shadow cast by the miners\u2019 strikes of the 1970s and 80s.</p> \n<p>\u201cFood banks have been around since 2005, when I founded the first one up at the other end of the district.

Because he is a Tory: he\u2019s not standing above party,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI think it will focus back on the old divisions between a centre-left route for the country or a centre-right route for the party.

      "bodyText": "Jon Trickett has become the first member of the shadow cabinet to state that he would like to campaign for a \u201cLabour Brexit\u201d in a potential future referendum. \u201cI\u2019m a Labour politician, I have been all my life. If there\u2019s a Labour Brexit, for me, I would then want to advocate that Labour deal,\u201d Trickett said, speaking in his Yorkshire constituency of Hemsworth. A close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, Trickett said Labour leave voters must be given a credible option to support in any referendum \u2013 which would appear to rule out backing a public vote on a Boris Johnson deal. \u201cThere are a large number of people in my constituency who remain attached to the idea that we ought to leave. I think if Labour is to attach ourselves to the idea of a second referendum, we have to offer them an opportunity of voting for a Labour Brexit.\u201d His intervention comes amid mounting pressure on Labour to support efforts to tag a referendum on to any Brexit deal Johnson brings to parliament at a special sitting that is expected to be held next Saturday. That could then result in a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d being held before a general election. But Corbyn signalled his caution on Sunday about the idea of backing a Brexit deal in exchange for a referendum, a view echoed by Trickett. \u201cI support the conference decision, and Jeremy\u2019s view, which is to vote down any Tory deal in the house, and then immediately press on to trying to remove the government,\u201d Trickett said. \u201cI think that is the order in which things should be done.\u201d He added: \u201cA referendum before the election would imply a Tory Brexit against remain. I believe that the majority in the country voted for leave \u2013 and I feel that a Labour Brexit can only be delivered by a Labour government. So whichever way you look at it, you are back to the proposition that you have an election, you do the negotiation \u2013 and then you have the referendum.\u201d Labour\u2019s policy has evolved in a series of steps since the 2017 general election, which the party fought on a platform of honouring the referendum result. At the party\u2019s conference in Brighton last month, it was agreed that if Labour won a general election \u2013 which could come within weeks \u2013 Corbyn would aim to negotiate a revised Brexit deal, including a customs union, within three months, and put it to a public vote within six. Several shadow cabinet members, including Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have already said they would campaign for remain in that vote. But the Labour leader has declined to say which side he would take. Trickett suggested Corbyn could take a neutral role. \u201cIf he wants to unify the country, I could see an argument for him saying, \u2018I will implement whatever decision is taken,\u2019\u201d he said. And he urged pro-remain party members not to try to push Corbyn any further, saying: \u201cDo not tie our leader to a position which he thinks is not quite the right one to try to get us into an election victory.\u201d While Starmer has warned that failing to back remain is hurting the party in north London constituencies like his, Trickett said that in Hemsworth, the EU was the least of his constituents\u2019 worries. \u201cWhen I go round my patch, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say this, actually Brexit isn\u2019t mentioned that much. People who are very, very impassioned by Brexit will talk about nothing else. But the vast majority of people are talking about bus services, cuts to the health service, the cost of living,\u201d he said. Certainly, as the \u201cwomen of Wakefield\u201d, as Trickett jokingly calls them \u2013 a group of local campaigners and community volunteers \u2013 meet to chat over tea and biscuits in his constituency office, Brexit barely comes up. Instead, they raise the depredations of universal credit, which has led to burgeoning use of food bank in the area; the lack of opportunities for young people; and the long shadow cast by the miners\u2019 strikes of the 1970s and 80s. \u201cFood banks have been around since 2005, when I founded the first one up at the other end of the district. There\u2019s now 22 food banks, and they are all working flat out. We\u2019ve not seen anything like we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d said Gwen Page. \u201cWe can all tell you some horror stories: it\u2019s getting worse. Holiday hunger has been something we\u2019ve all seen.\u201d \u201cPeople come in, and they\u2019re in tears, and they\u2019re crying,\u201d said Leda Prest. \u201cPeople walk in \u2013 and they couldn\u2019t bring the child, because they\u2019ve got no shoes to put on the child\u2019s feet. I was there yesterday, and we handed out 40 packs of food. We do that five days a week.\u201d She added: \u201cJust two words: universal credit is the issue.\u201d Johnson hopes his \u201cget Brexit done\u201d campaign will help win over voters in constituencies like Hemsworth, where the Tories have never had a foothold (it has been Labour-held since 1918, and Trickett\u2019s majority in 2017 was more than 10,000). While these women are staunch Labour supporters, they admit friends and family members are intrigued by Johnson, seeing him as fresh and different to other politicians. \u201cPeople are falling out over it: badly,\u201d said Melanie Burnell. And they say political debate has become increasingly fraught \u2013 particularly over Brexit. Trickett, who was closely involved in planning the 2017 campaign, and sits on Labour\u2019s national executive committee, said the party was ready to challenge Johnson at a general election, despite its uninspiring opinion poll scores. He believes Labour will still be able to squeeze the Conservatives when voters ask themselves who they want to run the country for the next five years. \u201cAt a general election, people are going to have to decide. Because he is a Tory: he\u2019s not standing above party,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI think it will focus back on the old divisions between a centre-left route for the country or a centre-right route for the party. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to boil down to in the end.\u201d",

And the bottom line is that the prime minister envisages a far looser relationship than his predecessor.</p> <p>From what we can ascertain (and remember, we cannot be certain what the government will want in the way of a future relationship until negotiations start) the present government is seeking a goods-only or \u201cCanada minus\u201d deal.

The current government has refused to sign up to EU level playing field provisions on labour and environmental standards.

Based on the reduction in trade alone, under May\u2019s deal (assuming no productivity effect, on which more in a moment) income per capita would have been 1.7% lower than under membership.

      "body": "<p>I had begun last week with a determination to avoid Brexit. Or at least to stick to some kind of personal Brexit diet: either a spartan, fact-based Brexit-Atkins plan, or maybe a four-days-on, three-days-off regime. It was not the first time in the past couple of years that I\u2019d made that resolution. Like many of us, on all sides, I felt jaded by the same questions and the same answers, sated with vitriol, numbed by non-negotiation. I had heard of people who had gone whole weeks without discussing with their kids or their colleagues the removal of the backstop and its implications for the Good Friday agreement, but, in honesty, I didn\u2019t believe they existed.</p> <p>In this spirit I set out on Monday morning to make a point of listening to music rather than news. I used my lunch hour to read a novel rather than Brexit commentary. I deleted the Twitter app from my phone. I wouldn\u2019t, I resolved, give the noise and nonsense any more attention, perhaps until the EU summit \u2013 perhaps, with any luck, until Halloween.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, inevitably, I was suckered back in by an overheard mention of Dominic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/immature-no-10-briefings-trigger-another-day-of-brexit-trouble\" title=\"\">Cummings\u2019s unguarded strategy briefing to the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/immature-no-10-briefings-trigger-another-day-of-brexit-trouble\" title=\"\">Spectator</a></em>. I could not resist Googling. And then, of course, there was the thuggish racism of the Leave.EU poster about world wars and krauts, and I was back composing outraged tweet-lines in my head, admonishing myself for taking the bait, a lost cause.</p> <p>By Friday, like the abstemious Lenten nobleman in the film <em>Chocolat</em>, who ends up gorging on prohibited Easter eggs in the chocolate shop window, I found myself back again at something like peak Brexit. I happened to be down near Parliament Square, mooching among bedraggled tourists and aimless pockets of Extinction rebels and drenched Ode to Joy pipers and St George flag wavers. I stepped into a cafe out of the rain and disappeared down another Brexit rabbit hole for an hour or two. It began with a clip of <em>Question Time</em>: an exchange between Theo Paphitis off <em>Dragons\u2019 Den</em><em> </em>and an audience member voicing the angry beliefs that she both \u201cknew what she had voted for\u201d and that \u201cnobody knows what\u2019s going to happen\u201d.</p> <p>Then I was watching, one after another, the 11 Brexit \u201cexplainer\u201d videos tweeted out by Andrea Leadsom, each one a mesmerising catalogue of the freedoms we are collectively dying in a ditch to discard.

A small part of most of us perhaps wonders how we might replace it when it is over; a much larger part fears it never will be.</p> <p>As any student of addiction knows, hits must get stronger for the craving to be satisfied. In Brexit terms, that means ever more layers of manufactured complexity and false hope in pursuit of a deal that will satisfy nobody.

The nation, as ever, was left to ponder what either of those phrases might mean. That Johnson had developed a plan so subtle in its tracery that it would not bear the light of day? That a meditative safe space was essential to creating a plan for beyond the end of the month?</p> <p>As ever there were one or two new coinages designed to frame the drama. \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d was rolled out as the phrase to describe the emergency session of parliament on October 19 at which a deal or an absence of a deal will be addressed. The Tory MP Nigel Evans repeated this phrase with the dedication of a promoter drawing attention to the latest pay-per-view cage fight.</p> <p>Leaving the EU was always going to be an interminable process, not a singular event, but that has never stopped its cheerleaders persisting with fake promises of a brisk final act.

There have been many other crisis weeks. Each promised to be the beginning of the end. None proved to be close to the end of the beginning.</p> <p>In his lazy bestseller <em>The Churchill Factor</em><em>,</em> Johnson dwelt on the few dramatic moments in which his hero changed the course of history, attempting to associate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/09/digested-read-the-churchill-factor-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">his own flaky character with Churchill\u2019s indomitable will</a>. In thinking about the coming week, the prime minister is deluded enough to have in mind the image of Churchill facing down a rebellious party minded to negotiate with Hitler, and his \u201cdarkest hour\u201d speech, which concluded: \u201cIf this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The country is so energised by the prospect of liberation from the EU that productivity is falling at the fastest pace for five years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The intent of Johnson\u2019s \u201csurrender act\u201d and \u201cdo or die\u201d is a shaming echo of that rhetoric. His emergency Saturday parliament is another effort to shackle the crisis of his own making to previous notable occasions when parliament had weekend sittings: at the outbreak of the war in 1939, for the Suez Crisis in 1956 and on the invasion of the Falklands in 1982. None of those previous threats to the nation was a homegrown invention. Unlike Churchill (or Eden or Thatcher), Johnson, would \u2013 in continuing to countenance a no-deal Brexit \u2013 have his country suffer an economic and social blitz simply to demonstrate that he has a semblance of spirit.</p> <p>If this is his personal plan it feels more than ever like a by-product of a wider philosophy. In his blogs, Cummings dwells on some of his own heroes, those cross-disciplinary \u201csynthesisers\u201d, with their \u201ccool Thucydidean courage to face reality\u201d. His most recent long missive argues that \u201cwhat is happening now is a once in a 50- or 100-year crisis and such crises also are the waves that can be ridden to change things normally unchangeable\u201d. His aim appears to be to surf the current \u201ccreative chaos\u201d in the belief it might beach government in a technocratic future in which policy and strategy are dictated by an elite \u201cRed Team\u201d in his own image. <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/tag/cameron/\" title=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to create a wave and it\u2019s much easier to ride one</a>,\u201d he notes.</p> <p>In this realm of deliberate turbulence, in the name of future efficiencies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/get-ready-for-brexit-government-launches-information-blitz\" title=\"\">billions of pounds continue to be squandered</a> to prepare for a no-deal exit that the courts and parliament have agreed cannot happen. Meanwhile, the government reneges on its promise to settled EU nationals by threatening deportations, and pledges to reward expatriate citizens with six months of healthcare when a lifetime of provision was once guaranteed. And the country is so energised by the prospect of liberation from the European Union that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/08/uk-productivity-brexit-boris-johnson-labour\" title=\"\">productivity of its workforce is falling at the fastest pace for five years</a>, and remains drastically below the EU average.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/15/divided-pessimistic-angry-survey-reveals-bleak-mood-of-pre-brexit-uk\" title=\"\">Surveys of the nation\u2019s psychological health</a> catch the effects of those figures. The latest revealed that around four in 10 people \u2013 22 million \u2013 reported feeling powerless (43%), angry (39%) or anxious (38%) because of Brexit in the last year. An LSE study which examined data from 35,000 people found significant increased levels of \u201cmental distress\u201d post-referendum that showed \u201cno significant difference\u201d between Remainers and Leavers.</p> <p>Where will it end? The news, as I write this, offers the promise that the EU27 have given \u201cthe green light for Brexit talks to move to the \u2018tunnel\u2019 phase\u201d. There is debate about whether that means negotiations are actually \u201centering the tunnel\u201d, or whether intensified discussions are to prepare for \u201cpossibly entering the tunnel\u201d. And so we approach another week, employing more millions of collective hours and days of attention and emotion discovering if we are yet in the dark, and being fed our daily bread of catchphrase and half-truth, waiting for what comes next.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a0b6de3b38d4794d5d3d0fa7f9275f1ffdcab56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a0b6de3b38d4794d5d3d0fa7f9275f1ffdcab56/0_265_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May, then UK prime minister, with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May, then UK prime minister, with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, in 2017, when it seemed a deal could be achieved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>17 January 2017</h2> <p>In her first substantial speech on Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May sets out her \u201cred lines\u201d and a 12-point \u201cplan for Britain\u201d, ruling out membership of the customs union.

      "bodyText": "I had begun last week with a determination to avoid Brexit. Or at least to stick to some kind of personal Brexit diet: either a spartan, fact-based Brexit-Atkins plan, or maybe a four-days-on, three-days-off regime. It was not the first time in the past couple of years that I\u2019d made that resolution. Like many of us, on all sides, I felt jaded by the same questions and the same answers, sated with vitriol, numbed by non-negotiation. I had heard of people who had gone whole weeks without discussing with their kids or their colleagues the removal of the backstop and its implications for the Good Friday agreement, but, in honesty, I didn\u2019t believe they existed. In this spirit I set out on Monday morning to make a point of listening to music rather than news. I used my lunch hour to read a novel rather than Brexit commentary. I deleted the Twitter app from my phone. I wouldn\u2019t, I resolved, give the noise and nonsense any more attention, perhaps until the EU summit \u2013 perhaps, with any luck, until Halloween. On Tuesday morning, inevitably, I was suckered back in by an overheard mention of Dominic Cummings\u2019s unguarded strategy briefing to the Spectator. I could not resist Googling. And then, of course, there was the thuggish racism of the Leave.EU poster about world wars and krauts, and I was back composing outraged tweet-lines in my head, admonishing myself for taking the bait, a lost cause. By Friday, like the abstemious Lenten nobleman in the film Chocolat, who ends up gorging on prohibited Easter eggs in the chocolate shop window, I found myself back again at something like peak Brexit. I happened to be down near Parliament Square, mooching among bedraggled tourists and aimless pockets of Extinction rebels and drenched Ode to Joy pipers and St George flag wavers. I stepped into a cafe out of the rain and disappeared down another Brexit rabbit hole for an hour or two. It began with a clip of Question Time: an exchange between Theo Paphitis off Dragons\u2019 Den and an audience member voicing the angry beliefs that she both \u201cknew what she had voted for\u201d and that \u201cnobody knows what\u2019s going to happen\u201d. Then I was watching, one after another, the 11 Brexit \u201cexplainer\u201d videos tweeted out by Andrea Leadsom, each one a mesmerising catalogue of the freedoms we are collectively dying in a ditch to discard. As I was watching, a text happened to come through on my phone, announcing that \u201cpassport validity rules will change after Brexit\u201d and I needed to look up the new restrictions. From there, it was only a few Google steps into the back catalogue of Cummings\u2019s blog archive \u2013 not the recent, pithy, government one-liners but the impacted, self-mythologising screeds about how the referendum was won and how \u201cthe systemic and consistent dysfunction of establishment decision-making systems over a long period, with very poor mechanisms for good, accurate feedback from reality, created the space for a guerrilla operation to exploit\u201d. Or: how I used technology and behavioural science to create division by manipulating fears about immigration. The trigger for that latest restless effort to make some sense of things, to get a grip, was Thursday\u2019s news that, after three-and-a-half years, the government had identified \u201ca pathway\u201d that might yet lead to \u201ca deal\u201d. Forget about the fact that the unknown concessions would, by any account, make the nation significantly worse off and likely dissolve the union, this shift in \u201cmood music\u201d was apparently a cause for hope. The pound surged, though it was hard not to latch on to the twin qualifiers in the announcement: \u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\u201d The politicians hadn\u2019t set off on the grail quest. But they had identified the place it might start from if they did. Talking earlier this week about his brief Brexit fable, The Cockroach, in which the prime minister\u2019s body is taken over by a giant insect, Ian McEwan noted that, as a nation, \u201cwe have moved into a mystical realm\u201d when it comes to Brexit, somewhere murky and surreal. That land was divided along many lines, he suggested, but one of the primary ones was between those \u201cwho are junkies for this stuff and those who just want to get it done\u201d.

A small part of most of us perhaps wonders how we might replace it when it is over; a much larger part fears it never will be.
