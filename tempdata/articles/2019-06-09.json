He said there were daily meetings of Johnson\u2019s inner circle and a deliberate strategy to keep his media appearances to a minimum at least until he is through the MP rounds.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am not part of the inner core but I have been absolutely blown away by the organisation that I have witnessed.

We have seen in the local and Euro elections there is frustration and anger and I think that needs to be met with something colourful and persuasive. Occasionally it will be edgy and controversial but if we don\u2019t do that we will be saying some very worthy stuff but we will look lame and tired when we face [Jeremy] Corbyn at the next election and it will all have been a pointless effort.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another MP backing Johnson said they had reservations but had been convinced that he had a campaign team who could compensate for some of his personal weaknesses: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it quite up close and it is a pretty slick operation. It is methodical, it\u2019s professionalised, it\u2019s respectful.\u201d He added: \u201cI have been gobsmacked by it really. It is not the Boris we are used to. He must really want it.\u201d<br><br>Gavin Williamson, the former chief whip, is key to getting wavering MPs onboard, telling them the wind is blowing in Johnson\u2019s direction much as he did for May in the 2016 contest. Williamson is also valued for his links to the DUP, whose support will be essential for Johnson to command a majority in the House of Commons. At the same time, Grant Shapps, the former Tory party chair, has been helping Johnson with number-crunching as he seeks to win over Conservative MPs.</p> \n<p>James Duddridge, a Tory MP, said he was backing Johnson because of his clear Brexit policies but also because he was \u201celectorally attractive and with a track record of turning the volume up and getting out there\u201d. He also said it was necessary to have a \u201cMarmite politician\u201d at a time when he would be up against fellow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/11/trump-brexit-rise-of-populism-podcast\">populists</a> Corbyn and Nigel Farage.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think Boris has the wow factor \u2026 He just ticks so many boxes.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister is being organised ruthlessly to limit his media appearances and minimise the potential for gaffes while trying to lovebomb wavering MPs, according to his colleagues. Conservative MPs say they are \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by the lengths to which the Johnson camp has been going in an effort to win their support in recent weeks. The professionalism of his campaign \u2013 a far cry from his shambolic effort in the aftermath of the EU referendum in 2016 \u2013 has won him support from unexpected corners, uniting hard Brexiters such as Owen Paterson and Jacob Rees-Mogg with moderates such as the young rising star Johnny Mercer and Damian Collins, who has previously suggested he could support a second EU referendum. Allies say Johnson is running his campaign from a \u00a33m townhouse on Lord North Street in Westminster from which Iain Duncan Smith masterminded his leadership victory in 2001 and Michael Portillo made a failed tilt at the top job in 1995. Johnson will launch his campaign formally within days, but for weeks his team have been filling his diary with up to 16 phone calls and one-to-one meetings with MPs each day. Johnson\u2019s team, led by the former MP James Wharton, have been briefing him about each individual MP\u2019s concerns. Crucially, they say he is staying on-message and eschewing his usual tendency to resort to crowd-pleasing gags and anecdotes. MPs close to Johnson say Lynton Crosby, the Australian election guru who helped him to two mayoral victories, is not officially on board the campaign but speaks to Johnson daily on the phone and is a very close friend. Despite the denials that Crosby is part of the team formally, Johnson\u2019s performance so far does bear some of the hallmarks of Crosby\u2019s previous campaigns, in which his candidates have sought to avoid the cross-examination of television interviews. His appearances in the media have been strictly limited to just one interview with Tim Shipman of the Sunday Times, and no daily appearances on broadcast programmes like many of his rivals. Johnson is yet to confirm whether he will appear in a series of television debates being organised by the broadcasters. Journalists say Wharton hauled the clubbable Johnson away from chatting to them last week in Portcullis House and gave orders to speak to his chief media adviser, Lee Cain, if they wanted to ask him anything. Instead, the strategy has been to relentlessly target Tory MPs whose votes Johnson needs in order to reach the final shortlist to go before Tory members, making sure his policy advisers follow up on their various concerns ranging from HS2 to schools funding. One MP involved in the campaign said Johnson was impressing on MPs that he would bring serious organisational brains on board if he reaches Downing Street, including his former mayoral deputy Sir Edward Lister, who would be \u201cvery much be part of the team\u201d. He said there were daily meetings of Johnson\u2019s inner circle and a deliberate strategy to keep his media appearances to a minimum at least until he is through the MP rounds. \u201cI am not part of the inner core but I have been absolutely blown away by the organisation that I have witnessed. There are specifically designed work streams and spreadsheets. It is a serious operation. I would say he has definitely learned from last time. Boris is being managed very well,\u201d the MP said. Over the weekend, Johnson picked up backing from several serious Eurosceptics, and he ultimately expects to gain the support of the majority of MPs currently behind Dominic Raab, whose hardline Brexit stance has made Johnson\u2019s position appear more moderate. To win over centrist MPs, Johnson has also been playing up his One Nation liberal credentials, despite a bulging archive of controversialist Daily Telegraph and Spectator columns. Rees-Mogg, an ardent Brexiter and the chair of the European Research Group who is supporting Johnson and has hosted a string of dinners for MPs on his behalf, has barely surfaced in the media to support him, leaving fresher faces such as Mercer as spokespeople. A string of MPs told the Guardian they had decided reluctantly to back Johnson on the grounds that he seemed electable and had improved since 2016, when he decided to play cricket with Earl Spencer the weekend after the referendum rather than plot his leadership bid. Setting aside concerns about his stint in the Foreign Office, where some colleagues felt he mishandled the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and made a series of diplomatic blunders, they believe he has made a decision to become more serious this time. Simon Hart, who led the Brexit Delivery Group of MPs loyal to Theresa May\u2019s deal, said he had come to the conclusion that Johnson should be the next prime minister because the country needed \u201ca bolder choice, not without its risks, but the sort of choice which really engages people in the debate about the country\u2026 [in a way that is] eye-catching, visible and audible\u201d. He added: \u201cI see myself as an example of somebody who has been in a pretty different place from Boris during the whole Brexit process but who fully accepts that we must now move to a conclusion. We have seen in the local and Euro elections there is frustration and anger and I think that needs to be met with something colourful and persuasive. Occasionally it will be edgy and controversial but if we don\u2019t do that we will be saying some very worthy stuff but we will look lame and tired when we face [Jeremy] Corbyn at the next election and it will all have been a pointless effort.\u201d Another MP backing Johnson said they had reservations but had been convinced that he had a campaign team who could compensate for some of his personal weaknesses: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it quite up close and it is a pretty slick operation. It is methodical, it\u2019s professionalised, it\u2019s respectful.\u201d He added: \u201cI have been gobsmacked by it really. It is not the Boris we are used to. He must really want it.\u201d Gavin Williamson, the former chief whip, is key to getting wavering MPs onboard, telling them the wind is blowing in Johnson\u2019s direction much as he did for May in the 2016 contest. Williamson is also valued for his links to the DUP, whose support will be essential for Johnson to command a majority in the House of Commons. At the same time, Grant Shapps, the former Tory party chair, has been helping Johnson with number-crunching as he seeks to win over Conservative MPs. James Duddridge, a Tory MP, said he was backing Johnson because of his clear Brexit policies but also because he was \u201celectorally attractive and with a track record of turning the volume up and getting out there\u201d. He also said it was necessary to have a \u201cMarmite politician\u201d at a time when he would be up against fellow populists Corbyn and Nigel Farage. \u201cI think Boris has the wow factor \u2026 He just ticks so many boxes. It\u2019s about having a politician with a pulse, who you can believe in,\u201d he said. However, not everybody is onboard, with some disappointed at colleagues who they feel are flocking to Johnson in the hope of a job or because they believe he can save their marginal seats from a Brexit party or Labour threat. One of Johnson\u2019s leadership candidate rivals, who sat in cabinet at the same time, believes he is in fact \u201cbloody dangerous\u201d and is furious at the way some Conservatives are overlooking his flaws. They point out his chequered record in the Foreign Office and describe how he often gave the impression of being \u201cembarrassingly underprepared\u201d in cabinet. Another leadership candidate described those colleagues who were falling in behind the frontrunner as delusional about his electability, warning that the party was \u201cabout to make the same mistake again that they did with Theresa of picking someone untested by proper scrutiny during a contest\u201d. There is also the issue of whether Johnson could win everyday votes in the Commons without a general election, given his divisiveness on Brexit and the slim working majority of five that he would inherit from May. A straightforward confidence vote would be likely to arise if Johnson decided to pursue the momentous step of taking the UK out of the EU without a deal at the end of October. On the issue of whether Johnson would be able to face down those determined to stop that outcome, his backers were largely unworried. One said he could not imagine any Tory MPs \u201cutterly foolish\u201d enough to open the door to a Corbyn government. But in response, one sceptical Conservative MP said the Johnson camp would be \u201cutterly foolish\u201d to underestimate parliament\u2019s resolve to stop a no-deal Brexit \u2013 or to think the whole party had been won over to his brand of politics.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson Pitch: The leader to see off the other parties \u2013 robust on Brexit and electorally appealing. Stance on Brexit: Insistent the UK will leave on 31 October, whether or not there is a deal. He is officially committed to trying to renegotiate the deal with the EU, and using \u201calternative arrangements\u201d for the Irish border. Domestic offer: His only commitment so far has been to increase the secondary schools budget in England to at least \u00a35,000 per pupil per year \u2013 a pledge that one analysis calculated would actually only mean a 0.1% rise in spending. Key supporters: Aside from Gavin Williamson (who is helping coordinate the campaign) and Liz Truss, Johnson has won backers across the spectrum from Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker on the hardline Eurosceptic wing to Johnny Mercer and Damian Collins on the more centrist side. Social media game: As with his entire campaign so far, quite low-key, although he did release a very glossy launch video. Chances of winning: Very good. Bookies have him as the odds-on favourite. Campaign so far: No disasters yet \u2013 which is precisely what Johnson needs. Michael Gove Pitch: Not Boris Johnson. The environment secretary is appealing to MPs as a reliable Brexiter who, unlike certain colleagues, always works hard and can focus on a brief. Stance on Brexit: Hard, but not overly hard. Gove has promised to go for no deal if needed, but has said he could countenance shifting the deadline a few weeks beyond 31 October if it meant a deal could happen. Domestic offer: He has also made a schools spending pledge, and more generous than Johnson \u2013 \u00a31bn extra a year. He has also promised free British citizenship for 3 million EU nationals after Brexit. Key supporters: Some influential Tory centrists such as George Freeman, Nicky Morgan and Tom Tugendhat have signed up, as well as more Brexit-minded colleagues such as Bob Seely. Social media game: Professional if not overly exciting, although his campaign video won praise. Chances of winning: Currently the second favourite, albeit on relatively distant odds of about 6/1. Campaign so far: Slow and steady, not least in amassing a fair number of MP nominations. However, his policies have been overshadowed by accusations of hypocrisy after he admitted taking cocaine as a young journalist. Jeremy Hunt Pitch: The competent moderate, who would still deliver Brexit but wouldn\u2019t scare off middle-ground voters. Stance on Brexit: Try to renegotiate a departure deal with a new team involving the DUP and Eurosceptics. If this was not possible, Hunt could go for no deal, but has said this would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d because it would bring a confidence vote and perhaps an election. Domestic offer: Nothing so far in the campaign, but last month he did argue for a doubling of the defence budget in the decade after Brexit. Key supporters: It has been a coup to be backed by cabinet Brexiter Liam Fox. The other 30-plus declared so far are generally centrists, and several are Foreign Office alumni. Social media game: Boringly corporate. His launch video took viewers back to the garage where Hunt set up his educational publishing company. This stressed his entrepreneurial spirit, even if Hunt\u2019s claim that these early days involved \u201ca daily grind to stay alive\u201d raised eyebrows, coming from the son of an admiral. Chances of winning: Seems set in a battle with Gove to get the second place on the members\u2019 ballot alongside Johnson. Currently around 7/1. Campaign so far: Solid. Credentials as a statesman were done no harm by a central role in Donald Trump\u2019s visit. Sajid Javid Pitch: The outsider with a moderniser\u2019s zeal. Did he mention his father was a bus driver? Stance on Brexit: Relatively robust, intimating that he would aim for a 31 October departure, even on no deal. But has mocked the idea of proroguing parliament to ensure no deal as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. Domestic offer: Unshackled from the wishes of Theresa May, the home secretary is opening up on immigration, saying he would scrap long-standing Tory net migration targets and make it easier for overseas students to stay on in the UK to work. Key supporters: Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader is a major coup, and he also has influential backbencher Robert Halfon and the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright. But is lagging behind the others in numbers. Social media game: Enthusiastic if mixed. His campaign launch video was a very basic piece to camera in an echoey parliament room, with the sound of the ubiquitous Westminster bridge bagpipe busker audible in the background. Chances of winning: Seems slim but his campaign has been boosted by Davidson\u2019s endorsement. Bookies say it\u2019s 33/1. Campaign so far: Underwhelming, but he can expect a very senior cabinet job in a new government. Dominic Raab Pitch: Brexit? I\u2019ll give you Brexit. Stance on Brexit: Positively militant. One of only two candidates to not only promise to push through a no-deal Brexit if needed, but to say they might prorogue parliament to stop MPs blocking this. Domestic offer: Raab has made the eye-catching if expensive pledge to cut income tax by 5p over the course of the next parliament, which some estimates say would cost about \u00a325bn. Key supporters: Veteran Brexiter David Davis. Most of his backers are, as you\u2019d expect, on the strongly Brexit side of the Tories. Social media game: Verging on the mediocre, but buoyed by \u201cgrassroots\u201d Twitter feed #ReadyforRaab. Chances of winning: Not great now that Johnson has bagged many leading lights in the hardline European Research Group. Odds are above 20/1. Campaign so far: Underwhelming, but in part this is due to Johnson\u2019s dominance on the pro-Brexit side of the draw. He has also courted controversy by sticking by his assertion that feminists are some of the \u201cmost obnoxious bigots\u201d in the debate on equality. Rory Stewart Pitch: Maverick, man of the people, fond of long walks. Stance on Brexit: Decidedly centrist. Wants a soft Brexit, perhaps involving a customs union. Rules out no deal. Domestic offer: You name it, he\u2019ll think about it. Most eye-catching among the numerous ideas punted in tweets and videos is the idea of a compulsory national citizens\u2019 service for young people. Key supporters: Ken Clarke and David Gauke. And, sadly for Stewart, only three more MPs are publicly backing him so far. Social media game: The clear winner on this score, for all the good it will do him in the end. Omnipresent, responsive, tireless, compulsively engaging with voters on mini-videos. Chance of winning: Odds of 25/1 possibly overstate the real likelihood, given the lack of Tory MPs backing him. But the attention could see a cabinet promotion. Campaign so far: A triumph, if persuading Twitter liberals is the intention. Remains to be seen how this translates to his fellow MPs. Also running Matt Hancock: The heir to George Osborne, with a centrist message and 14 backers so far, but seems unlikely to overtake Gove or Hunt to become the moderate candidate put to members. Andrea Leadsom: The pro-leave ex-leader of the house is having another shot after dropping out of the contest last time around against Theresa May, but her Eurosceptic colleagues seem to be flocking to Gove and Johnson. Mark Harper: A former chief whip barely known by the public, Harper will be glad to get past the first round of voting. Esther McVey: The former work and pensions secretary is even more of a Brexit ultra than Raab, saying she wants to leave with no deal without even trying to renegotiate. Sam Gyimah: The remainers\u2019 remainer in Tory terms. Quit government to seek a second referendum, but has yet to gain any public backers among MPs.",

I have what I suppose you could call a reputation. The clips that go viral are watched by millions and millions of people, so anyone who rings me [must be] certain they\u2019re going to get the better of me. Occasionally, you get the sense that someone might be vulnerable and then you take your foot off the pedal, because there is no pleasure in beating up someone intellectually who sounds a bit unwell. I interrupt because you can\u2019t come on the radio and say things that are untrue.</p> <p>I\u2019m not interested in opinions unless they\u2019re based on fact and, tragically, too many places in the media, particularly with regards to politicians, will allow people to say things that are simply not true and leave them unchallenged.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The factionalism and the infighting is so much more important to a certain kind of leftwinger than taking on the Tories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How often do you think you change people\u2019s minds?</strong><br>Not as often as I\u2019d like. I had a chap at a festival of debate a few weeks ago who was a fully paid up member of the EDL before he started listening to my show and he stood up in front of 600 people and said: \u201cI think you saved my life.\u201d Those moments are incredibly important to me, but that\u2019s extreme. I\u2019m not arrogant or naive enough to think I\u2019m moving the needle on national conversation anywhere near enough.</p> <p><strong>If you</strong><strong> call your book </strong><em><strong>How to Be Right</strong></em><strong>, is it fair for people to accuse you of being smug?</strong><br>I think people who peddle lies for a living call people who tell the truth smug. I\u2019m not smug \u2013 smug would mean I was enjoying this.</p> <p><strong>Your book dismantles the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic views that you encounter on your show. But how much hostility or change in attitudes have you noticed in your day-to-day life?</strong><br>I\u2019m a white heterosexual male and despite what many people are currently arguing, I remain the most privileged constituency on the planet\u2026 I don\u2019t have [that] experience. The mystery is how much of [this] there has always been and how much of it you now have because of emboldening.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019d argue it was already there, but the lid has simply been lifted.</strong><br>Sure. You\u2019ve got Farage on the radio just flirting, knowing exactly where the line is, and Donald Trump crossing the line on a daily basis. So we\u2019re seeing people, prominent people, incredibly powerful people saying these things and the \u201cbreaking point\u201d poster [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\" title=\"\">Farage\u2019s 2016 anti-migrant poster</a>] \u2013 there is no way you can unveil that poster in public and not think some people will think it\u2019s OK to spit at brown-skinned people in the street. It\u2019s the scale of how much the recent rhetoric of invasion, about cultural identity and about values being eroded \u2013 which is all bollocks \u2013 has impacted on beliefs. People who believe it find a logic to their anger.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel people are fundamentally good?</strong><br>Of course I do; you have to. Look at the effort being put in to make people believe bad things: the effort is immense, it\u2019s the richest people on the planet, the most powerful media owners, it\u2019s the demagogues with the biggest platforms, the season ticket holders on <em>Question Time</em>. There is a commercial and audience imperative in this country where if it gets chatter going and it gets clicks, a big reaction, then it must be good. But of course, when ordinary punters watch this stuff, they don\u2019t see a circus or bonfire, they just get seduced by the narcissism and you don\u2019t have good tunes if you\u2019re on the side of kindness and decency \u2013 you have nothing to point at.</p> <p><strong>You sound defeated even by the </strong><strong>fight</strong><strong>back</strong><strong>!</strong><br>It\u2019s pathetic. It\u2019s astonishing; the factionalism and the infighting is so much more important to a certain kind of leftwinger than taking on the Tories or in the last few years, the government. They\u2019re obsessed with centrists, they\u2019re obsessed with Blairites, they\u2019re obsessed with denying antisemitism when it\u2019s right there in front of them, so all that has incubated the problem.</p> <p><strong>Does a career in traditional politics beckon for you?</strong><br>I have a silent rule that anyone who wants to go into politics should be banned \u2013 you should be forced to go into politics by plebiscite because people think you could bring something to the table. So it\u2019s highly unlikely.</p> <p><strong>Given the success of the Brexit party, Farage might believe the same applies to himself?</strong><br>Farage is simply a very very good heckler. He couldn\u2019t be involved in delivering Brexit, he couldn\u2019t be involved in delivering policy, he couldn\u2019t be involved in putting together a proper manifesto or assembling a proper political party, all he can do is assemble a dizzying array of rotten tomatoes, stand at the side of the stage and lob them at the poor sods who are trying to make some sense of the current matter.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve just been on holiday</strong><strong> \u2013 what did you enjoy reading?</strong><br>I\u2019m halfway through <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ministry-of-truth-9781509890736.html\" title=\"\">The Ministry of Truth</a></em>, Dorian Lynskey\u2019s biography of George Orwell\u2019s <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, and it\u2019s absurdly good.</p> <p><strong>What was the last thing that made you laugh?</strong><br>My 13-year-old daughter is addicted to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketches on YouTube and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AtrI9PoiBQ\" title=\"\">Pete Davidson\u2019s character Chad</a> brings me pretty close to wetting myself every time I watch him.</p> <p><strong>How do you relax</strong><strong> and switch off?</strong><br>Crime fiction.

You\u2019ve got Farage on the radio just flirting, knowing exactly where the line is, and Donald Trump crossing the line on a daily basis. So we\u2019re seeing people, prominent people, incredibly powerful people saying these things and the \u201cbreaking point\u201d poster [Farage\u2019s 2016 anti-migrant poster] \u2013 there is no way you can unveil that poster in public and not think some people will think it\u2019s OK to spit at brown-skinned people in the street. It\u2019s the scale of how much the recent rhetoric of invasion, about cultural identity and about values being eroded \u2013 which is all bollocks \u2013 has impacted on beliefs. People who believe it find a logic to their anger. Do you feel people are fundamentally good? Of course I do; you have to. Look at the effort being put in to make people believe bad things: the effort is immense, it\u2019s the richest people on the planet, the most powerful media owners, it\u2019s the demagogues with the biggest platforms, the season ticket holders on Question Time. There is a commercial and audience imperative in this country where if it gets chatter going and it gets clicks, a big reaction, then it must be good. But of course, when ordinary punters watch this stuff, they don\u2019t see a circus or bonfire, they just get seduced by the narcissism and you don\u2019t have good tunes if you\u2019re on the side of kindness and decency \u2013 you have nothing to point at. You sound defeated even by the fightback! It\u2019s pathetic. It\u2019s astonishing; the factionalism and the infighting is so much more important to a certain kind of leftwinger than taking on the Tories or in the last few years, the government. They\u2019re obsessed with centrists, they\u2019re obsessed with Blairites, they\u2019re obsessed with denying antisemitism when it\u2019s right there in front of them, so all that has incubated the problem. Does a career in traditional politics beckon for you? I have a silent rule that anyone who wants to go into politics should be banned \u2013 you should be forced to go into politics by plebiscite because people think you could bring something to the table. So it\u2019s highly unlikely. Given the success of the Brexit party, Farage might believe the same applies to himself? Farage is simply a very very good heckler. He couldn\u2019t be involved in delivering Brexit, he couldn\u2019t be involved in delivering policy, he couldn\u2019t be involved in putting together a proper manifesto or assembling a proper political party, all he can do is assemble a dizzying array of rotten tomatoes, stand at the side of the stage and lob them at the poor sods who are trying to make some sense of the current matter. You\u2019ve just been on holiday \u2013 what did you enjoy reading? I\u2019m halfway through The Ministry of Truth, Dorian Lynskey\u2019s biography of George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, and it\u2019s absurdly good. What was the last thing that made you laugh? My 13-year-old daughter is addicted to Saturday Night Live sketches on YouTube and Pete Davidson\u2019s character Chad brings me pretty close to wetting myself every time I watch him. How do you relax and switch off? Crime fiction. We live near the Thames and I like to walk the dog there as often as I can. I love walking up to Brentford where there\u2019s still a boatyard and a real sense of when the river was an industrial hub. And I try to play Fifa on the PlayStation once a week with one of my oldest friends \u2013 we\u2019ve been doing so for nearly 30 years! I keep meaning to take up meditation properly but can\u2019t find the time. \u2022 How to Be Right\u2026 in a World Gone Wrong is out now in paperback (WH Allen, \u00a38.99).

But when there are circumstances over which you do have control you do not behave in the way that, I\u2019m afraid, some of those six did behave.\u201d Over little more than three months Change UK was buffeted by both difficult political fortunes \u2013 in last month\u2019s European election it took just 3% of the vote \u2013 as well as public bickering over tactics, for example about tactical voting and whether to pursue a merger with the Liberal Democrats. But insiders say the disagreements were even more heated behind closed doors, punctuated by differences over leadership arrangements, threats to quit the party and lack of agreement over even the basics of the party\u2019s future direction. Some of the reported disputes bordered on farce, such as the party almost missing a print deadline for its European election leaflets because one MP wanted a different photograph, and official social media feeds being stopped at the instructions of one member, and then tacitly resumed by another. Meanwhile, sources amid those who quit argue that Soubry and Leslie \u2013 whose spouses are respectively treasurer and chief executive of the party \u2013 sought to run Change UK \u201clike a Soviet state\u201d. Soubry says she will stay as leader until an autumn conference, and has ruled out any idea of joining up with the Lib Dems. The split was clear, Soubry said, when Umunna told her he did not think Change UK should continue as a formal party. \u201cI said to him: the movement\u2019s out there, we just need to build a home for that movement, a political party.
