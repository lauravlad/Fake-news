Nobody seems to believe that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d is genuinely Brexit any more. Labour\u2019s clause V process \u2013 which decides the party\u2019s manifesto \u2013 will surely impose a referendum-with-remain stance before an election. The party should embrace it and make the best of it now, or risk demobilising the base, alienating possible voters and being distracted during the campaign period, which will mean it is unable to draw attention to the party\u2019s transformative domestic agenda. In our uniquely tumultuous times there is no guarantee of either political success or failure, and pundits should be relentlessly reminded of this. Remember the hubris of May, and remember the nemesis that it met. Johnson\u2019s hard-right cheerleaders are currently intoxicated with triumphalism. But if Labour makes the right decisions now, a painful hangover may yet await. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",
