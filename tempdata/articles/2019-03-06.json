I am quite determined before I drop dead and finally lose my marbles that I should get around to the remaining 17\u201d he said in reference to the 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland and the six counties in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Sources have said he was determined to continue his visits to help mitigate the strains to the Anglo-Irish relations caused by Brexit.</p> <p>\u201c[As] our relationship evolves over the coming months and years, I have both the faith and the hope that the essential friendship between the people of Ireland and the people of the United Kingdom will not only endure but will renew itself for generations to come,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Speaking at the dinner, Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister said the many visits by Charles and Camilla in recent years had \u201ccreated opportunities to strengthen\u201d the friendship between communities on the two islands, \u201cnorth and south, east and west\u201d.</p> <p>Charles was speaking amid a growing crisis over the UK\u2019s departure from the EU with no sign of any deal on the Irish border to satisfy eurosceptics in the Tory Party or the DUP.</p> <p>Downing Street said <a

</a>as promised on Tuesday, despite negotiations in Brussels stumbling.</p> <p>Prince Charles first visited the Republic of Ireland in 1995.</p> <p>His visit was hailed as a success, and seen as a step on the way towards the eventual visit by the Queen in 2011.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c804c8de4b016d234256bb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time

looking at how other borders operate and the use of \u201ccutting-edge\u201d technology, officials said.</p> <p>A Department for Exiting the EU spokesman said: \u201cThere is clear support for finding

Equally, since the vote for Brexit, people may have been been more exposed to arguments from remainers about the positive contribution EU workers make to the economy.</p> <p><strong>2) People in the UK are less likely to say they have difficulty making ends meet than the EU average.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e20b65fd8d2881b3940c54187e1ef97a5f21ccf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e20b65fd8d2881b3940c54187e1ef97a5f21ccf/0_0_799_677/500.png\" alt=\"% of people in EU countries who have difficulty making ends meet\" width=\"500\" height=\"424\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">% of people in EU countries who have difficulty making ends meet</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is from the ONS report.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 2017, of households in the UK, 14.1% were making ends meet with difficulty or great difficulty, according to the EU-SILC survey data.

But if a second vote did take place, Leonard said he would back remain.</p> <p>That puts Leonard at odds with a majority of Scottish voters, who rejected leave in 2016 and now back a second vote in large numbers, Scottish Labour supporters and potentially a majority of his parliamentarians, but his stance is, nonetheless, UK party policy \u2013 the orthodox Corbynite position.</p> <p><strong>Willie Rennie</strong>, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said it was \u201ccynical triangulation\u201d; <strong>George Adam,</strong> an SNP MSP, said Leonard\u2019s stance made Labour\u2019s \u201capparent embrace of a second referendum look cynical in the extreme.\u201d <strong>Ian Murray</strong>, the staunchly pro-EU Scottish Labour MP, <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17460503.richard-leonard-defies-majority-of-scots-to-back-brexit-over-second-referendum/\">told the Herald:</a> \u201cThere is no good Brexit, no jobs-first Brexit, and no better Labour Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Fast forward to Tuesday evening, where the SNP, Lib Dems and Scottish Greens voted along with Labour, and against the Tories, to back a motion drafted in collaboration with the Welsh government attacking May\u2019s failure so far to take no deal off the table, and also demanding an extension to article 50 to allow more time for a better deal.</p> <p>Negotiated by Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, and the Welsh Labour first minister Mark Drakeford, it was the first time since devolution 20 years ago both legislatures have voted on the same motion.</p> <p>But what was noticeably absent in the joint motion agreed to by Sturgeon was a demand for a second EU referendum. Why? Because Welsh Labour would not back it. Drakeford agrees with Leonard\u2019s position.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what Drakeford\u2019s office said last night: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a government our policy has always been that there are steps we would like to see taken before a second referendum \u2013 so rule out no deal, get extension, agree a better deal that supports economy and jobs. This is our preferred option to a second referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>A second EU referendum was excluded from the motion to maximise cross-party support, the Welsh government said.

He says on one measures it is the second best place in the EU for conditions in the workplace, behind Sweden.</p> <p>He says the PM has said that Brexit will not be allowed to diminish workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>But the government wants to provide guarantees. So today it is publishing draft clauses for the forthcoming EU withdrawal agreement bill.</p> <p>These have two aims, he says.</p> <p>First, they will ensure that when the government publishes new employment legislation, ministers have to give a written assurance that existing EU rights are not being watered down.</p> <p>Second, they will ensure that MPs get regular updates when the EU passes new legislation in this area, and that they will get to vote on whether the UK should match these new laws.</p> <p>Clark also says the government intends to create a single labour market enforcement body.

He did not exactly wipe the floor with Theresa May, but he was comfortably ahead on most of the exchanges and he succeeded in his key goal; linking knife crime to austerity, and hanging responsibility around May\u2019s neck. When he was elected Labour leader, even his most ardent supporters would have hesitated before predicting that he would outperform the Tories on law and order, but it happened at the general election, when the terrorist attacks made police cuts a headline issue, and it may well be happening again. Perhaps he could have gone harder on May\u2019s own responsibility for falling police numbers because of decisions she took as home secretary. It was hard to tell whether he choose not to because he did not want to personalise this too much, or whether it was because he just wasn\u2019t being forensic. For May, it could have all been a lot, lot worse. Downing Street\u2019s decision to refine its line yesterday meant that she did not really get the hammering on \u201cno direct correlation\u201d between police numbers and violent crime that some might have expected, and her summit announcement, and patient explanation of the linked-up factors explaining knife crime, deserved a hearing. She was advocating just the \u201cholistic\u201d approach that Corbyn was demanding in his final question. Her points about Labour\u2019s voting record struck home too. But she was less persuasive on her generalised claims about spending going up; Labour MPs were jeering loudly because in some respects she seemed to referring to little more than standard, inflation-driving spending increases, not real-terms ones. (Government spending is always going up, in other words.) In her final response, May launched into a wider attack on Labour\u2019s economic plans. But her argument that \u201cspending more to end austerity will cause more austerity\u201d needs a bit more work. You know what she means, but as she set out this case today, it just sounded contradictory.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-06T12:46:04.665Z\">at 12.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c7fba1be4b052c45da0c47e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-06T12:22:00.989Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says crime went down under Labour.

Does May now accept that privatising the probation service has been a disaster?</p> <p>May says, when the government looks at probation, what matters is reducing reoffending. That is something that was not being done under Labour. She says she welcomes the fact that dealing with knife crime requires working across a number of areas. That is what the government is doing in a number of areas, she says. In just two weeks, there have been 1,000 arrests, and more than 1,000 individuals being safeguarded.</p> <p>Corbyn says violent crime has doubled. The rise has been driven by austerity \u2013 something that May said recently was over. But the issues are wider. The privatisation of probation services has been a disaster. Youth centres have been closed, youth workers have lost their jobs, public services have been stripped away. Does May realise there has to be a holistic response to this. You cannot keep communities safe by cuts and privatisation.</p> <p>May says the government has put more money into the police, and Labour voted against this. More money has gone into schools, and local authorities too. Corbyn stands up talking about austerity. If he is that concerned about that, you would think he would want to ensure it would never happen again.

In preparing those updates, trade unions, businesses and the relevant select committees of Parliament will be consulted with.</p> <p>This new process will start with two EU directives that come into force after we have left and following the implementation period \u2013 the work life balance directive and the transparent and predictable working conditions directive. The government has voted in favour of both of these directives in the European council and intends to ask parliament if it wants to adopt them into UK law.</p> <p>The work life balance directive introduces new rights for parents and carers, such as two months of paid leave for each parent up until the child is eight and also five days of leave for those caring for sick relatives.</p> <p>The transparent and predictable working conditions directive will set the terms of employment for workers by their first working day and provides more stability if you work in shifts. The government is already committed to many of these measures.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was supposed to be a relatively big bazooka in the Downing Street plan to get May\u2019s deal through parliament. But, in Westminster spin parlance, it has landed badly.

      "bodyText": "- The government are defeated on Labour\u2019s amendment 13 in the House of Lords. The amendment makes it an \u201cobjective\u201d of the government during negotiations to pursue a free trade deal allowing the UK to stay \u201cin a customs union\u201d with the EU after Brexit. - The government was defeated on amendment 12 which called for parliamentary approval of future trade agreements. - Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) members in London voted to retain their links to the Labour Party while Manchester members of Jewish Labour also voted to stay in Labour and not disaffiliate. - Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, had to issue a clarification in the Commons after appearing to say that none of the killings committed by members of the armed forces in Northern Ireland during the Troubles were unlawful. - Prince Charles saluted the \u201dunparalleled bonds\u201d between Britain and Ireland at a time of strained Anglo-Irish relations caused by Brexit at a St Patrick\u2019s Day dinner at the Irish embassy in London. Prince Charles has saluted the \u201dunparalleled bonds\u201d between Britain and Ireland at a time of strained Anglo-Irish relations caused by Brexit. The Prince of Wales was attending a special St Patrick\u2019s Day dinner at the Irish embassy in London where British and Irish politicians mingled amid continuing uncertainty and recriminations over the Irish border issue in the Brexit withdrawal agreement. He told guests, which included members of the cabinet, that he wanted to visit each of the 32 counties in the island of Ireland before he would \u201cdrop dead\u201d. \u201cAbove all we are friends, we are partners and we are the closest of near neighbours, bound together by everything that we have in common \u2013 and by just how far we have come together, \u201c he told the 80 guests. \u201cThis is precisely why it has been so important to my wife and myself that we too should visit Ireland so often over these past few years \u2013 to experience, and celebrate, as best we can, the unparalleled bonds between our two countries, and to highlight just what a fundamental difference they make to us all. With just 22 days to go before the UK potentially crashes out of the EU, putting further strains on the economic and political relations between Ireland and the UK, the Irish embassy event was designed to demonstrate the resilience of relations between two countries with close historic and sometimes troubled bonds. Among the guests invited were the deputy prime minister of Ireland, Simon Coveney, the head of the Democratic Unionist Party in the House of Commons Nigel Dodds, cabinet office minister David Lidington and other senior Westminster figures including the speaker of the house John Bercow. Prince Charles, who visited Cork and Kerry with the Duchess of Cornwall last year, has been a frequent visitor to Ireland in the last 20 years despite the tragic deaths of the prince\u2019s great-uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, and three others who were killed in an IRA bombing in 1979. \u201cI must say I\u2019m slightly amazed to find that we\u2019ve managed to visit 15 counties already. I am quite determined before I drop dead and finally lose my marbles that I should get around to the remaining 17\u201d he said in reference to the 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland and the six counties in Northern Ireland. Sources have said he was determined to continue his visits to help mitigate the strains to the Anglo-Irish relations caused by Brexit. \u201c[As] our relationship evolves over the coming months and years, I have both the faith and the hope that the essential friendship between the people of Ireland and the people of the United Kingdom will not only endure but will renew itself for generations to come,\u201d he said. Speaking at the dinner, Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister said the many visits by Charles and Camilla in recent years had \u201ccreated opportunities to strengthen\u201d the friendship between communities on the two islands, \u201cnorth and south, east and west\u201d. Charles was speaking amid a growing crisis over the UK\u2019s departure from the EU with no sign of any deal on the Irish border to satisfy eurosceptics in the Tory Party or the DUP. Downing Street said has insisted the meaningful vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal will go ahead as promised on Tuesday, despite negotiations in Brussels stumbling. Prince Charles first visited the Republic of Ireland in 1995. His visit was hailed as a success, and seen as a step on the way towards the eventual visit by the Queen in 2011. Expert panels will advise the Government on developing alternatives to the Brexit backstop measures. Trade and customs experts, business and trade union representatives and MPs and peers will form three groups, with the work overseen by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Treasury Financial Secretary Mel Stride. The UK and European Union have agreed to consider a \u201cjoint work stream\u201d to develop alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The three panels will help influence the UK\u2019s position in the talks, including looking at how other borders operate and the use of \u201ccutting-edge\u201d technology, officials said. A Department for Exiting the EU spokesman said: \u201cThere is clear support for finding alternative arrangements to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. \u201cIn adding business and technical expertise on top of civil service resource, we will ensure we are strengthening the Government\u2019s efforts to identify the necessary facilitations and technologies. \u201cThe creation of these advisory groups now will mean that we can move at pace once negotiations with the EU begin.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has been warned that he needs to do more to tackle anti-Semitism after members of the Jewish Labour Movement agreed in an indicative vote to remain affiliated with the party, maintaining a link stretching back to 1920. But the party\u2019s leadership was given a month to act on the group\u2019s concerns. Labour MP Wes Streeting said it had been a \u201cpainful\u201d meeting and warned the party was \u201con notice\u201d to address concerns. He hit out at colleagues for failing to sign up to a letter organised by fellow MP Stella Creasy expressing solidarity with Jewish members. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that people are committed to staying and fighting but it is very clear, listening to what our Jewish colleagues and comrades and friends are saying, that we are so far away as a political party from having the trust and confidence of the Jewish community,\u201d he told the Press Association. Dame Margaret Hodge said it was an \u201cemotional and angry but determined\u201d meeting. \u201cI fought fascism on the right when I defeated the BNP, I will now fight fascism on the left,\u201d the Barking and Dagenham MP said. Brexit meaningful vote will go ahead, says No 10, despite talks stalling Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) members in London have voted to retain their links to the Labour Party. Manchester members of Jewish Labour have also voted to stay in Labour and not disaffiliate. JLM national secretary Peter Mason said: \u201cThe message from the Jewish Labour Movement this evening was absolutely clear. \u201cIf the Labour Party fails to show solidarity to us, we will not show solidarity to it. \u201cThat counts for MPs who do not sign their names to letters showing solidarity with us, that counts for Members of the Scottish Parliament, that counts for councillors. \u201cBut we as a Jewish movement will make it very clear to the party leadership: we are not going anywhere, we are staying, we are standing and we are fighting against the corrupted anti-Semitism that has gripped our party.\u201d The issue of affiliation with Labour could be back on the table when the JLM has its full annual general meeting in April. International Trade Minister Baroness Fairhead says the amendment would require disputes to be heard by UK courts which \u201chas the potential to undermine a successful and internationally accepted framework\u201d. She said the Trade Bill is not here to deal with future trade agreements and the fact there are processes already in place for complaints, Lord Stevenson should remove his amendment. Lord Stevenson agrees to withdraw his amendment on the promise of further discussions with Baroness Fairhead. The prospect of MPs being given an opportunity to force a softer Brexit were boosted by a government defeat in the House of Lords on the trade bill. A cross-party alliance of peers defeated the government by 207 votes to 141 - a majority of 66 - on an amendment calling on the government to negotiate a customs union with the EU. Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, shadow international trade minister said: \u201cThe success of this cross-party Lords motion gives both the government and the House of Commons a chance to step back from the disaster of a \u2018no deal\u2019, and to deliver an outcome which would satisfy the clear majority of people in the UK. \u201cMinisters must now drop their red lines on Brexit and embark on a fresh approach to the negotiations with the EU \u2013 based around a new customs union that protects jobs, secures opportunities for our industries and removes the need for a hard border in Ireland.\u201d The bill is due back in the Commons before Brexit day - and if the government wants to remove the customs union amendment, it will have to persuade MPs to vote to do so. Next on the agenda is Labour\u2019s amendment 15, which calls for the involvement of judicial systems in trade disputes. The amendment introduces a UK-based investor-state dispute settlement mechanism with parliamentary oversight. The government has been defeated on Labour\u2019s amendment 13, by 207 votes to 141. The amendment makes it an \u201cobjective\u201d of the government during negotiations to pursue a free trade deal allowing the UK to stay \u201cin a customs union\u201d with the EU after Brexit. Contents: 207 Not Contents: 141 Majority: 66 Peers vote on Labour amendment 13 Lord Stevenson of Balmacara said amendment 13 will give MPs the opportunity to say whether they wish to remain in the customs union, potentially protecting jobs and livelihoods. He added it would mean the rollover of trade agreements \u2013 \u201cwhich isn\u2019t going terribly well\u201d \u2013 and would offer certainty to business and industry. This amendment allows the Commons another chance to think about a really important issue.\u201d However, Liberal Democrat peer Lord Purvis of Tweed said if the amendment passes, it shows the Lords is committed to providing a level of certainty that the government is not. \u201cWe must offer a higher level of certainty to businesses,\u201d he concludes, arguing that the government \u201cmust avoid the disastrous impact that leaving the customs union would involve\u201d. The House of Lords is now discussing amendment 13 on the customs union. This amendment would make it an \u201cobjective\u201d of the government during the Brexit talks to pursue a free trade deal allowing the UK to stay in \u201ca customs union\u201d with the EU after it leaves the bloc. If a vote on the amendment is called and the government is defeated, it would return to the House of Commons. The government has been defeated on amendment 12. The amendment passed by 215 votes to 168. Contents: 215 Not Contents: 168 Majority: 47 Labour peer Lord Stevenson of Balmacara said he wishes to test the opinion of peers and will push his amendment 12 to a vote. Peers are now voting on the penultimate amendment and the result is expected at around 8pm. Lord Stevenson of Balmacara had earlier said if international trade minister Lady Fairhead thinks the government and the opposition are \u201cas close as she thinks\u201d on what the scrutiny role of parliament should be, she should return at third reading with a counter-proposal that would be accepted by all. International trade minister Lady Fairhead has argued amendment 12 seeks to ensure that parliament has a role in approving negotiations of free trade agreements which \u201cis an objective that the government shares\u201d. She said the government last week committed to publishing information about future trade deal negotiation and will work closely with committees \u201cto ensure we can work closely from start to finish\u201d. Requiring an agreement of both houses for a trade agreement to be ratified goes against the function of the executive\u2019s ability to present \u201ca single unified voice\u201d. \u201cWe plan to consult Parliament at every stage of the negotiations,\u201d Fairhead added, disagreeing with Lord Hannay\u2019s statement that parliament\u2019s scrutiny role has so far been ignored by the government. Crossbench peer Lord Bilimoria also believes the government has \u201cconsistently tried to bypass Parliament\u201d which is \u201cnot transparent\u201d. Labour peer Lord Stevenson of Balmacara moves amendment 12 which calls for parliamentary approval of future trade agreements. He said he thought it was decided that royal prerogative had \u201chad its day\u201d. Under royal prerogative, governments can make decisions without the backing or, or consultation with, parliament. \u201cOur country needs a modern system to approve trade agreements, rooted in reality not fantasy,\u201d he added. The arrangements involved in the white paper do not provide a proper role for Parliament, nor do they give Parliament the role it should have in ratifying any agreements.\u201d Rising to support the amendment, crossbench peer Lord Hannay of Chiswick said it is \u201ca sad defect\u201d that there is no clear role for parliament in the current arrangements. Peers are now debating Labour\u2019s amendment 12, the penultimate one, which calls for parliamentary approval of trade agreements and for the following rules to be followed before negotiations begin: - A draft negotiating mandate must be laid and approved by \u201cthe appropriately constituted committee and both Houses of Parliament. - The committee must have first produced a sustainability impact assessment on the trade deal to be negotiated. - The text of the free trade agreement (FTA) must be laid and approved by the committee, and be discussed with all devolved administrations. Prior to approving the text, the committee must produce a report of recommendations which must be reviewed by both Houses. - A free trade agreement may not be ratified unless the agreement has been laid before, and approved by an amendable resolution of, both Houses of Parliament. Labour peer Lord Lea of Crondall stands to move his amendment 11 which seeks UK membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), stating that all other ideas are \u201cfalling by the wayside one by one like dominoes\u201d. The European Free Trade Association is a regional trade organization and free trade area comprising of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. The European Economic Area was established via the EEA Agreement, an international agreement which allows for the extension of the EU\u2019s single market to non-EU member parties. Lord Lea said this is a \u201csensible solution\u201d and a UK membership of the EEA is supported by members from all parties and \u201cthis is the only way we can remain a member of an agreed group of rules.\u201d The peer admitted his proposal \u201cis not problem free\u201d but disagrees with \u201cthe main criticism\u201d levelled at UK membership of the EEA that \u201cthe UK would be a rule taker and not a rule maker.\u201d Lea said the initiative is now with the House of Commons and on that basis he will not be pushing the amendment to a vote. The T\u00e1naiste Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, is to meet with Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley this evening to seek clarification on the comments she made in the Commons earlier. Bradley said that killings at the hands of the security forces were \u201cnot crimes\u201d. Sinn F\u00e9in deputy leader Michelle O\u2019Neill described the remarks as \u201coffensive and hurtful\u201d. Coveney said there should be effective investigations into all deaths during the Troubles regardless of the perpetrator. He added that Bradley\u2019s reaffirmation this afternoon that \u201cwhere there is evidence of wrong-doing it should always be investigated whoever is responsible\u201d is important. Bradley had returned to the House of Commons to make clear her position, saying: \u201cThe point I was seeking to convey was that the overwhelming majority of those who served carried out their duties with courage, professionalism and integrity and within the law. \u201cI was not referring to any specific cases but expressing a general view. \u201cOf course where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should always be investigated - whoever is responsible. \u201cThese are of course matters for the police and prosecuting authorities, who are independent of government.\u201d Lady Fairhead says the amendment raised from Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb has limitations, including its reference to \u201cstandards\u201d, which she says is not clear. She said protections over areas including agri-foods are secured by the bill and the UK strives to uphold the highest standards across food, agriculture and human rights. Lady Jones has subsequently withdrawn her amendment. The big vote tonight is taking place at the House of Lords which is debating the Trade Bill at report stage including the customs union. There are 13 amendments being discussed after months of delay which cover laws to prepare the government for its new trade powers after Brexit. Opening the Trade Bill\u2019s report stage, Minister for International Trade Lady Fairhead said scrutiny of future trade agreements is \u201cvery important\u201d. She said: \u201cWe hear concerns about transparency and a desire for Parliament to be involved at every stage of the negotiations.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn met senior Conservative MPs today backing a Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader held talks with former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles, part of a cross-party group who support the so-called \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d model of a close economic relationship, as disclosed earlier by my colleague Heather Stewart. The meeting was also attended by Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Lucy Powell, who back the Norway-style approach for the UK to remain in the single market and customs union. Boles said: \u201cFor months now we have been meeting with senior MPs from all parties in search of a cross-party Brexit compromise.\u201d Kinnock said they had a \u201cvery detailed and constructive conversation\u201d, adding: \u201cThere is a strong and growing cross-party consensus for a pragmatic, bridge-building Brexit.\u201d A Labour spokesman said the meeting was to \u201cdiscuss how to achieve a deal that would be good for jobs and could bring Leave and Remain voters together\u201d. The government has issued a response to demands to spell out which tariffs will be cut in the event of a no-deal Brexit ahead of next week\u2019s Commons vote. MPs reacted angrily after ministers said they only intended to release the new tariff schedules if they actually get to the point of a no-deal break. It followed a report that tariffs across a large majority of imported goods could be reduced by between 80% and 90% in an attempt to prevent prices in the shops soaring, while signalling the UK is an open economy. But the claim prompted renewed warnings that removing tariffs could leave domestic producers exposed to a flood of cheap imports, threatening profitability and jobs. A Government spokesman said: \u201cIf we leave the European Union without an agreement, our tariffs will need to strike a balance between protecting consumers and businesses from possible price rises and avoiding the exposure of sensitive industries to competition. \u201cWe will communicate a decision on what is market sensitive information to stakeholders and the public as soon as possible.\u201d The Brexit negotiations have stumbled in Brussels after late-night talks with EU officials that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, described as \u201crobust\u201d. The government is expected to be defeated in the Lords later night on an amendment to the trade bill saying the UK should aim to stay in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Conservatives do not have a majority in the Lords and the amendment, which has cross-bench support, is very likely to be passed. Ahead of the debate Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, the shadow international trade minister, said: With the Brexit negotiations reaching a critical point, we believe the government should be focused on avoiding a no deal outcome. Their own figures, published last week, show that such an outcome is not in the national interest. It would also cause lasting damage to the UK economy. Labour has consistently made the case for the UK to negotiate a new customs union with the EU \u2013 one that would protect jobs and secure opportunities for our industries, as well as remove the need for a hard border in Ireland. This approach commands wide support around the country and would give everyone some much needed certainty about our future should we leave the EU. It is surely time for ministers to abandon their red lines and for the government to back this proposal. Sajid Javid has said the government must listen to police chiefs\u2019 demands for more resources after they asked the home secretary for emergency cash to fund an immediate rise in the number of officers in England to tackle knife crime. A no-deal Brexit would plunge the UK economy into recession and annual growth will slip below 1% this year for this first time since the financial crisis even if a deal is secured, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has warned. The government is under fire over a \u201csecret\u201d plan to cut up to 90% of tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit, after Liam Fox confirmed details would not be released until after MPs vote on Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement next week. Public support for EU nationals being able to work in the UK has gone up sharply since 2016, the Office for National Statistics has revealed. (See 4.06pm.) A senior Democratic Unionist party MP has insisted the party can only support Theresa May\u2019s revised Brexit deal if the withdrawal agreement itself is amended to make the Northern Ireland backstop time-limited, or allow the UK to withdraw unilaterally. The US ambassador to the UK has dismissed criticism of US food standards as a \u201cmarketing campaign\u201d after a former minister said a post-Brexit trade deal could not accept \u201cwoefully deficient\u201d American farming practices. The Home Office has reached an out-of-court settlement with a charity that had threatened a judicial review over the registration system for EU citizens. Momentum, the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Labour grassroots movement, has been fined \u00a316,700 after what the Electoral Commission described as \u201cmultiple\u201d breaches of electoral law related to spending returns and failures to report donations. The government has revealed details of its \u00a333m payout to Eurotunnel, confirming it will hand over three instalments of \u00a311m over the next three years. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over now. A recall petition for Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya will be launched on March 19, Peterborough city council has announced. As the Press Association reports, voters in the constituency will each be allocated to one of 10 signing stations where they can add their names to the petition. A byelection will be triggered if 10% of eligible voters - around 7,000 people - sign the petition before it closes at 5pm on 1 May. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, had to issue a clarification in the Commons earlier, after appearing to say that none of the killings committed by members of the armed forces in Northern Ireland during the Troubles were unlawful. During Northern Ireland questions she said: Over 90% of the killings during the troubles were at the hands of terrorists. Every single one of those was a crime. The under 10% that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes; they were people acting under orders and instructions, fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way. This provoked fury in Northern Ireland where members of the armed forces have been successfully prosecuted for unlawful killings during the Troubles, and many other cases are outstanding. Sinn Fein said Bradley\u2019s comments were \u201coutrageous and offensive\u201d. Bradley subsequently returned to the Commons to clarify what she meant. She told MPs: The point I was seeking to convey was that the overwhelming majority of those who served carried out their duties with courage, professionalism and integrity and within the law. I was not referring to any specific cases but expressing a general view. Of course where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should always be investigated - whoever is responsible. These are of course matters for the police and prosecuting authorities, who are independent of government. And here is my colleague Robert Booth\u2019s take on the ONS wellbeing report. (See 4.06pm.) And here is an extract. It\u2019s official: life in Britain was getting better before Brexit. In the years up to 2016 people in the UK were on average feeling better about their lives, enjoying better mental health, feeling less lonely and more connected with their neighbours. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has concluded that on all these measures between 2011 and 2016, things were improving and the happiness of the UK population was in line with that of its European Union neighbours, staying steady at a respectable 7.4 out of ten ... Since the end of 2017, six years of improvements in average happiness, life satisfaction and feelings that what people do in life is worthwhile have levelled off in line with recent trends in net household financial wealth and household disposable income per head. Anxiety levels rose in the run-up to Brexit and kept rising afterwards before falling back from September 2017. The Labour MP Geraint Davies has published his EU terms of withdrawal bill. It says there should be a referendum on Brexit before the end of 2019, with a question saying: Do you approve the agreement for the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union or Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union? Under this plan, the agreement could be the one agreed at the end of last year, or a subsequent one. The UK would only leave the EU if people voted in favour. Davies says he will table an amendment to the meaningful vote motion on Tuesday next week that would give time for his bill to be passed. Davies\u2019s plan is very similar to another one, saying the agreement should be subject to a confirmatory referendum, proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson. The European commission has published a very useful document explaining what individual EU governments have said they will do about protecting the residence rights of Britons living in their countries in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Tory MP Nick Boles has posted this on Twitter about his meeting with Jeremy Corbyn to discuss \u201cNorway plus\u201d earlier. (See 1.27pm.) The Office for National Statistics has published an interesting paper today on wellbeing, and comparisons between the UK and the EU. Here are three of the most interesting findings. 1) There has been a sharp increase in support for EU free movement in the UK since 2016. As the Press Association reports, some 57% of people surveyed in spring 2016 said it was a good thing for EU citizens to have the right to work in the UK. By spring 2018 this figure had jumped to 68% - the biggest increase reported by any of the EU\u2019s 28 member states. This shift is probably related to the fact that, since the EU referendum, there has been a sharp fall in immigration from the EU. (People might be more inclined to say they favour EU workers being able to come to the UK if they see fewer of them.) Equally, since the vote for Brexit, people may have been been more exposed to arguments from remainers about the positive contribution EU workers make to the economy. 2) People in the UK are less likely to say they have difficulty making ends meet than the EU average. This is from the ONS report. In 2017, of households in the UK, 14.1% were making ends meet with difficulty or great difficulty, according to the EU-SILC survey data. This was a similar proportion to Estonia (14.3%) and was lower than the EU-28 average of 21.6%. In the UK, this proportion has decreased each year since 2013 (21.1%). The highest-ranking country was Germany, with 6.1% of households reporting making ends meet with difficulty or great difficulty. The lowest-ranking country, with the highest proportion of households struggling to make ends meet, was Greece (77.2%), as has been the case each year since 2011. 3) People in the UK tend to be marginally more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average. Laura Murray has not been made acting head of complaints at Labour, the party is now saying. (See 3.14pm.) This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, was drinking from a biodegradable cup when he gave evidence to the Commons environment committee this morning - not a conventional plastic one, as I and others reported at the time. (See 11.52am.) I\u2019m sorry about that. The Press Association explains: Compostable, plant-based cups were introduced to the Houses of Parliament last year to replace existing single-use plastic items. The cup Gove used was made from polylactic acid, PLA, a renewable alternative to plastic. But environmental campaigners say reusable cups are still better for the planet and critics point out that many products that are labelled biodegradable cannot just be thrown onto a compost heap with food waste. Louise Haigh, the shadow policing minister, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and various Labour police and crime commissioners have signed an open letter to Theresa May urging the government to recruit 10,000 more police officers. It includes this line. It was therefore remarkable to hear you claim again on Monday that \u201cthere is no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers\u201d. Regrettably, this shows that you are in complete denial and senior officers across the country have said so. The Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole says Haigh is being hypocritical, because only last year she herself said there was no direct correlation between police numbers and crime figures. This is from Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen. This appointment is controversial because Laura Murray has been working in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office, as a stakeholder manager. Her father, Andrew, is chief of staff to Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, and a part-time adviser in Corbyn\u2019s office. UPDATE: Subsequently Labour said the parliamentary committee had been misinformed. Former Metropolitan police commissioner John Stevens has accused Theresa May of failing to heed warnings about the impact of cuts to policing budgets. Stevens said May ignored a commission he chaired which called for guaranteed police budgets when May was home secretary. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One, Stevens, who now sits in the House of Lords, said: It has been really frustrating not to be listened to. The Home Office for the last five or six years has not been listening. The commission which I chaired wasn\u2019t listened to. This [the rise in violent crime] has been predicted for a while. And all you\u2019ve got from the Home Office, and particularly from the home secretary at that time who is now the prime minister, was \u2018our reforms are working\u2019. She hasn\u2019t listened to what has been going on and it not good enough. Stevens, who led the Met from 2000 to 2005, added: There has been a decimation and destruction of neighbourhood policing which we know is essential. Resources are needed, the political leadership is needed ... otherwise it is just going to continue in the dreadful way it is at the moment. Stevens was asked if May was capable of addressing the knife crime problem now. He said: I don\u2019t like criticising people when they have got massive problems and they are down, but I doubt it. He added: The person who I think has got the ability is the present home secretary. He has got the personality, he has got the empathy, he understands the difficulties on the streets and he understands the difficulties the police are facing. If anyone chairs it [a Cobra style committee on violent crime] it should be him, but you don\u2019t want her above him getting in the way. Last night\u2019s historic joint vote by the Welsh and Scottish legislatures attacking Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans seems to have exposed what could politely be described by Labour\u2019s opponents at Holyrood as double-standards. Last week Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard was attacked by rival anti-Brexit parties and Europhile Labour MPs after confirming he would rather see Brexit take place on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s terms or a new general election, before a second EU referendum. But if a second vote did take place, Leonard said he would back remain. That puts Leonard at odds with a majority of Scottish voters, who rejected leave in 2016 and now back a second vote in large numbers, Scottish Labour supporters and potentially a majority of his parliamentarians, but his stance is, nonetheless, UK party policy \u2013 the orthodox Corbynite position. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said it was \u201ccynical triangulation\u201d; George Adam, an SNP MSP, said Leonard\u2019s stance made Labour\u2019s \u201capparent embrace of a second referendum look cynical in the extreme.\u201d Ian Murray, the staunchly pro-EU Scottish Labour MP, told the Herald: \u201cThere is no good Brexit, no jobs-first Brexit, and no better Labour Brexit.\u201d Fast forward to Tuesday evening, where the SNP, Lib Dems and Scottish Greens voted along with Labour, and against the Tories, to back a motion drafted in collaboration with the Welsh government attacking May\u2019s failure so far to take no deal off the table, and also demanding an extension to article 50 to allow more time for a better deal. Negotiated by Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, and the Welsh Labour first minister Mark Drakeford, it was the first time since devolution 20 years ago both legislatures have voted on the same motion. But what was noticeably absent in the joint motion agreed to by Sturgeon was a demand for a second EU referendum. Why? Because Welsh Labour would not back it. Drakeford agrees with Leonard\u2019s position. Here\u2019s what Drakeford\u2019s office said last night: As a government our policy has always been that there are steps we would like to see taken before a second referendum \u2013 so rule out no deal, get extension, agree a better deal that supports economy and jobs. This is our preferred option to a second referendum. A second EU referendum was excluded from the motion to maximise cross-party support, the Welsh government said. One man\u2019s cynical triangulation is another man\u2019s pragmatic compromise. Here is the business department policy paper (pdf) containing the draft clauses for inclusion in the forthcoming EU withdrawal agreement bill implementing the pledges made by Greg Clark. (See 1.56pm.) Clark is responding to Long-Bailey. He says he knows the TUC and Labour would like the UK to automatically match new EU rules boosting workers\u2019 rights. But that is not the government\u2019s position, he says. He says the government does not think there would be any point leaving the EU if that were the case. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is responding for Labour. She says these proposals do not go far enough. She says there are many examples of the UK resisting EU efforts to strengthen workers\u2019 rights. Greg Clark, the business secretary, is now making a Commons statement about the Brexit announcement on workers\u2019 rights. (See 9.20am.) He says the UK has a proud record on workers\u2019 rights. In some areas it is ahead of the EU, he says. He says on one measures it is the second best place in the EU for conditions in the workplace, behind Sweden. He says the PM has said that Brexit will not be allowed to diminish workers\u2019 rights. But the government wants to provide guarantees. So today it is publishing draft clauses for the forthcoming EU withdrawal agreement bill. These have two aims, he says. First, they will ensure that when the government publishes new employment legislation, ministers have to give a written assurance that existing EU rights are not being watered down. Second, they will ensure that MPs get regular updates when the EU passes new legislation in this area, and that they will get to vote on whether the UK should match these new laws. Clark also says the government intends to create a single labour market enforcement body. It will carry out roles currently shared between HMRC, the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying on Twitter about PMQs. The consensus is that Jeremy Corbyn won, although quite a few people are also arguing that, overall, the exchanges were pretty feeble. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire From PoliticsHome\u2019s Matt Foster From the Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh From the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From Channel 4 News\u2019 Krishnan Guru-Murthy From the Spectator\u2019s Katy Balls From ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall This, from my colleague Heather Stewart, is very interesting. Nick Boles is a prominent supporter of the \u201cNorway plus\u201d or \u201cCommon market 2.0\u201d plan for Brexit, which would involve the UK staying in the customs union and the single market. In the past Labour has always ruled this out, on the grounds that it would mean accepting free movement and EU state aid rules, although, interestingly, in his recent letter to Theresa May setting out his five demands for Brexit, Corbyn did not mention his desire to end free movement. Here is Full Fact, the factchecking organisation, on one of May\u2019s claims at PMQs. Here is the start of the Press Association story about PMQs. Jeremy Corbyn claimed Theresa May is trying to keep communities \u201csafe on the cheap\u201d as he warned of surging violent crime. The Labour leader challenged Theresa May to explain if she had any regrets over cutting police officer numbers and criticised the impact of \u201csystematically\u201d stripping away public services to support young people. He added that austerity has driven the rise in violent crime as PMQs occurred amid concerns over knife attacks. May began by saying any deaths through violence are an \u201cappalling tragedy\u201d and a \u201cgrowing number\u201d of young people are dying in a \u201cgrowing cycle of violence that has shocked us all\u201d. She reiterated she will hold a summit in Number 10 in coming days and meet victims of the \u201cappalling crimes\u201d to explore what can be done. But Corbyn accused her of not doing enough to tackle the \u201croot cause\u201d of the rise in knife crime, and pointed to the recent deaths of 17-year-olds Jodie Chesney and Yousef Makki. He said 285 people were stabbed to death last year, the \u201chighest level ever\u201d, before asking: \u201cDoes the prime minister now regret cuts in police numbers and will she undertake that under this review they will be restored to the level they were formerly at?\u201d May replied: \u201cWe are putting more resources into the police this year - it\u2019s no good members on the opposition benches standing up and saying \u2018no you\u2019re not\u2019, it\u2019s a fact more money is being put into the police this year, that more money is being put into the police next year. \u201cThe real question is not are we putting more money into the police, because we are - the real question is why did the Labour party oppose that money going into the police?\u201d The Times\u2019 Sam Coates is having a good run with leaked emails about Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism cases. Here is his latest scoop. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asked about Brexit in his two questions. He raised the case of an 87-year-old woman brought up under Nazi occupation in Denmark who has lived in Scotland for 59 years. Why does she have to registered for settled status to be able to stay in living in the country she calls home, he asked. May said the government wanted EU nationals to be able to stay living in the UK after Brexit. Blackford said this was a disgrace. He said the women has children and grandchildren. She has friends here, and has build her life her, he said. Why must she register, he asked. He said May should end \u201cthis heartless policy\u201d. May said the government has consistently told EU nationals they will be able to stay. Blackford should accept that, she said. This is from the i\u2019s Nigel Morris. And this is from the Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. PMQs is over, but Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, rises to make a point of order. Theresa May said the SNP do not have a mandate for an independence referendum, he says. But it does, he says. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, asks about the court ruling criticising government plans to make landlords responsible for immigration controls. May says it is right that, when people access services, checks are carried out to make sure they are eligible. The government is appealing against the court ruling, he says. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks May to support MPs giving up single-use plastics. May says the government will match up to \u00a32m money raised by Tearfund for this campaign. The SNP\u2019s Chris Stephens asks about reports that the police were involved in the blacklisting of trade union activists. Does May agree there should be a public inquiry? May says the government has responded to this proposal in the past. She will write to Stephens, she says. The SNP\u2019s Alan Brown asks about a constituent with a very rare condition that causes epilepsy and autism. He cannot access cannabis medicinal products because his case is so rare. May says the government has changed the rules to allow medicinal cannabis products. Clinicians decide if they can be used, she says. May congratulates a school that has encouraged children to cycle to school. Labour\u2019s Marsha De Cordova says the DWP are carrying out five reviews into how disabled people have lost benefits because of the way PIP is paid. She says people have died because they have been refused PIP. Some 70% of people who appeal win their case. When will May follow Labour and commit to abolishing the PIP assessment process. May says the DWP is taking this very seriously. More than 1,000 staff are working on correcting errors with payments. The DUP\u2019s Paul Girvan says his party is concerned about attempts to prosecute members of the armed forces who protected Northern Ireland. May says the current system for dealing with crimes from the past in Northern Ireland is not working for everyone. She says around 3,500 people were killed in the Troubles. Most of them were killed by terrorists, she says. They must be held to accounts, she suggests. She says the MoD will be publishing plans to ensure former servicemen are not prosecuted unfairly. PMQs - Snap verdict: It is hard to see how the government can win on knife crime \u2013 it is a story that understandably and rightly dominates the news headlines, and where parents are easily persuaded that there is a clear link between a rising risk to their children and government cuts \u2013 and so today\u2019s exchanges offered something of a free hit for Jeremy Corbyn. He did not exactly wipe the floor with Theresa May, but he was comfortably ahead on most of the exchanges and he succeeded in his key goal; linking knife crime to austerity, and hanging responsibility around May\u2019s neck. When he was elected Labour leader, even his most ardent supporters would have hesitated before predicting that he would outperform the Tories on law and order, but it happened at the general election, when the terrorist attacks made police cuts a headline issue, and it may well be happening again. Perhaps he could have gone harder on May\u2019s own responsibility for falling police numbers because of decisions she took as home secretary. It was hard to tell whether he choose not to because he did not want to personalise this too much, or whether it was because he just wasn\u2019t being forensic. For May, it could have all been a lot, lot worse. Downing Street\u2019s decision to refine its line yesterday meant that she did not really get the hammering on \u201cno direct correlation\u201d between police numbers and violent crime that some might have expected, and her summit announcement, and patient explanation of the linked-up factors explaining knife crime, deserved a hearing. She was advocating just the \u201cholistic\u201d approach that Corbyn was demanding in his final question. Her points about Labour\u2019s voting record struck home too. But she was less persuasive on her generalised claims about spending going up; Labour MPs were jeering loudly because in some respects she seemed to referring to little more than standard, inflation-driving spending increases, not real-terms ones. (Government spending is always going up, in other words.) In her final response, May launched into a wider attack on Labour\u2019s economic plans. But her argument that \u201cspending more to end austerity will cause more austerity\u201d needs a bit more work. You know what she means, but as she set out this case today, it just sounded contradictory. Corbyn says crime went down under Labour. There are just not enough officers. The LGA says local services face a funding gap of \u00a33.2bn. That is double what the stronger towns fund is offering over three years, he says. Does May now accept that privatising the probation service has been a disaster? May says, when the government looks at probation, what matters is reducing reoffending. That is something that was not being done under Labour. She says she welcomes the fact that dealing with knife crime requires working across a number of areas. That is what the government is doing in a number of areas, she says. In just two weeks, there have been 1,000 arrests, and more than 1,000 individuals being safeguarded. Corbyn says violent crime has doubled. The rise has been driven by austerity \u2013 something that May said recently was over. But the issues are wider. The privatisation of probation services has been a disaster. Youth centres have been closed, youth workers have lost their jobs, public services have been stripped away. Does May realise there has to be a holistic response to this. You cannot keep communities safe by cuts and privatisation. May says the government has put more money into the police, and Labour voted against this. More money has gone into schools, and local authorities too. Corbyn stands up talking about austerity. If he is that concerned about that, you would think he would want to ensure it would never happen again. But Corbyn\u2019s policy would mean more spending and higher borrowing, and would take us right back to austerity. Corbyn says the police clearly don\u2019t have enough resources. He quotes the former chief prosecutor in Manchester, who lost a relative to knife crime. He said cuts in police numbers meant they did not get the right intelligence. Will May reverse those cuts? May says more money is going into the police this year, and next year. Labour opposed that, she says. Corbyn says violent crime has doubled under the Tories. He quotes from Mike in Gosport. Mike says the town has become unsafe, because there is no police presence. Mike speaks for many people. When are the police going to get the resources they need? May says the government is not just putting more resources in, it is giving the police more powers. When the government did this, to give the police more powers to deal with people carrying knives, Corbyn voted against it, she says. Corbyn says many MPs will have sat with families who have lost people to knife crime. They will never forget that. Yesterday the Met commissioner said of course there was a link between police numbers and knife crime. If police numbers are high enough, why was the defence secretary yesterday offering to send in the army? May says the Met commissioner made the point that the causes of this are complex. She said the police cannot arrest their way out of this, she says. She summarises government initiatives on this. The government is ensuring the police have the right resources. More money is being spent on the police. But it is also about understanding the use of drugs. Jeremy Corbyn says tomorrow is international women\u2019s day. He says Labour wants to close the gender pay gap. He congratulates Luciana Berger for giving birth to a son. He sends his condolences to the families of those who have lost young people to knife crime. What extra funding is being provided to address the root causes of knife crime? May joins Corbyn in congratulating Berger. And he says he is pleased today marks the launch of Rachel Reeves\u2019 book on women who have changed Westminster. On knife crime, she says any of a young person is a terrible tragedy. Responsibility does lie with the perpetrators, she says. But we will only defeat the scourge of violence if we address the root causes. That means ensuring the police have the right resources, tacking drug crime, and turning young people away from violence. That is what the government is doing, she says. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, says Lent is becoming a time for doing something new and positive. Would it be a good idea for MPs to take up supporting the government? Yes, says May. Then MPs could give something up - EU membership. Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, says the UK spent \u00a327bn bailing out the banks. They have repaid the country by closing thousands of branches. Does May agree they have taken without given, and failed to tackle fraud? May says, as people\u2019s behaviour changes, banks have responded to that. They have taken commercial decisions. She says the financial services ombudsman has been looking at banks\u2019 behaviour. Theresa May says she is reminded of when John Howard, another Australian PM, visited the Commons. He said, however lively PMQs was, it was a vicarage tea party compared to what happens in Australia. She turns to knife crime. The death of any young person is a tragedy. May says she will hold a summit on knife crime at Number 10 in the next few days. John Bercow, the Speaker, says Malcolm Turnbull, the former Australian PM, is in the chamber to watch PMQs. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Michael Gove also told the committee that the Easter recess could be cancelled, the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes reports. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, told the environment committee this morning that he has pledged to cut his use of single-use plastics for Lent - while using a plastic cup. This is from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Derek Momodu. UPDATE: Actually, it was a biodegradable cup. See 3.33pm for more details. Scottish Labour\u2019s former leader, Kez Dugdale, has attacked her successor Richard Leonard for his stance on Brexit for failing to celebrate the work of Labour\u2019s two Scottish MEPs at this weekend\u2019s party conference, and for allegedly censoring their pro-second referendum remarks from the programme. In a letter to Leonard, leaked to the Herald on Sunday political editor Paul Hutcheon, Dugdale lodged a formal complaint there would be no chance for David Martin, the party\u2019s longest-serving MEP, or Catherine Stihler to speak in Dundee this weekend or for conference to applaud \u201cfor their combined 55 years of electoral service to the party\u201d. That was \u201ca considerable insult\u201d, Dugdale said. Stihler, an MEP for 20 years, has already stood down in advance of Brexit while Martin, who has been an MEP since 1984, will stop serving on 28 March unless article 50 is extended. He could stand again for the European parliament if article 50 is extended before the European elections in June. Dugdale, one of Scottish Labour\u2019s most openly Europhile parliamentarians, claimed Leonard had also excised pro-people\u2019s vote quotes from a foreword on Stihler and Martin\u2019s in the conference handbook. She wrote: I was shocked to discover from Catherine that her statement in the conference guide was amended without her consent. When that was challenged, she was told it was on your direction and that you had the final say on what was printed. Dugdale said the deleted section said: \u201cBrexit is a tragedy for our country and for the workers and communities the Labour party represents. That\u2019s why David and Catherine fully support a people\u2019s vote with the option to remain in the EU.\u201d Leonard said last week he supports Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance, that Labour wants a Brexit on their terms, or a general election; he would only back a second referendum if it was the last option open. A Scottish Labour spokesman said they were preparing a response. The European commission has admitted that last night\u2019s talks with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, were \u201cdifficult\u201d and that no solution to the backstop problem has yet been identified. This is from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge, quoting the European commission\u2019s spokesman, Margaritis Schinas. On the Today programme this morning Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, defended American farming practices. Building on the arguments he made in a recent article in the Daily Telegraph (paywall), he said those criticising US farming standards were protectionist. The US had the \u201clowest level\u201d of food poisoning, he said, insisting that any UK-US trade deal would have to include American farm products. My colleague Rowena Mason has a story about his comments here. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has accused him of lying and bullying. It released this statement in response from the Labour MP Jo Stevens. Under Donald Trump the US government excels at two things: telling lies and bullying. Both characteristics were on display this morning when Trump\u2019s personal appointment as ambassador to the UK used the BBC to promote his president\u2019s agenda of forcing British consumers to eat chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef. The US ambassador must know that his claim that the US has \u2018the lowest level\u2019 of food poisoning was utter garbage. In fact, around 3,000 Americans die every year as a result of food-borne diseases \u2013 450 from salmonella alone. It is precisely because their animal hygiene standards are so poor that Americans have to wash their chicken carcasses in chlorine. We neither need nor want food from the United States\u2019s charnel houses on our shelves. It is not as though the US\u2019s food industry produces such a volume of cheap and healthy food that Americans are better fed \u2013 more of their babies are born underweight and more of their children are obese. At the international trade committee Liam Fox was asked about reports that the Department for International Trade spent more than \u00a3100,000 on a podcast that was downloaded fewer than 9,000 times. Was that value for money? Fox replied: It depends how many of the businesses who listened to it became exporters. If all the 9,000 who listened to it became exporters, I would say that\u2019s a successful project. If none of them did, I would question its value for money. More on the Brexit talks in Brussels last night. This is from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming. Q: Is it true that the cabinet has signed off its tariff plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit? Fox says that is correct. Back in the international trade committee, Liam Fox says, if there is a no-deal Brexit, the government will publish its plans for tariffs. He says the government will take into account three factors when drawing up its plans; the cost to the UK, the impact on business, and what effect the loss of preferential treatment would have. On the subject of the backstop, as the Irish Times reports, this is what Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, told the Irish parliament yesterday. The position as of today is that we have no texts or draft texts to consider or get legal advice on. I am not entirely sure what MPs are looking at in London but we have no legal texts or draft legal texts to consider, to propose amendments to, or to seek legal advice on. What happens a lot in London, as deputies will be aware, is internal negotiations. This is from Sky\u2019s Sophia McBride. And this is what Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, told Sky News about his talks last night with Michel Barnier. These are very sensitive discussions. We are into the meat of the matter now. We have put forward some proposals, very reasonable proposals. And we are now really into the detail of the discussion. Asked if he had a text to take back to the UK, Cox went on: I can\u2019t reveal the discussions. These are private and confidential discussions. But we are into the meat of the matter now. Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. And we are now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon. Here is my colleague Daniel Boffey\u2019s take on what this means. Back in the committee, Liam Fox is asked about reports that the government will cuts most tariffs to zero in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Q: If that is the case, why would any country want to roll over their trade deals with the UK, when they could benefit from zero tariffs with the UK anyway in the event of no deal? Fox says he will not comment on media speculation. Here is more on what happened in Brussels last night when Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, met Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. From my colleague Daniel Boffey From the Times\u2019 Bruno Waterfield From the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp Q: Can you assure us that the largest seven EU trade deals are ready to be rolled over in the event of a no-deal Brexit? Fox says the UK is making good progress on this front. The UK is ready to roll over these deals. But it is reliant on other countries to be ready too. He says some of these deals may be agreed only very late in the day. At the committee Chris Leslie, the Independent Group MP, asks Liam Fox whether he would back a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday next week, if MPs vote down Theresa May\u2019s deal. Fox says he wants May\u2019s deal to pass. He refuses to say how he would vote if it falls, and the Commons has to vote on a no-deal Brexit, but he does not rule out voting for no deal. Liam Fox does not rule out backing no-deal Brexit. Leslie quotes from what David Sterling, the head of the civil service in Northern Ireland, said in his letter to Northern Ireland\u2019s political parties. Sterling said: The consequences of material business failure as a result of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit, combined with changes to everyday life and potential border frictions could well have a profound and long lasting impact on society. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is giving evidence to the Commons international trade secretary now. At some point he is likely to be asked about this story from Sky\u2019s Ed Conway, saying the government would cut up to 90% of all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Conway says: The government will slash Britain\u2019s trade tariffs to more than at any point in history if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, Sky News has learnt. The Department for International Trade (DIT) intends to cut 80-90% of all tariffs imposed on goods imported into Britain, according to Whitehall sources. The cuts, which will be outlined in documents published if the prime minister fails to get parliamentary backing for her EU withdrawal bill next week, represent a bombshell for many manufacturers and farmers in the UK. Since tariffs are a charge on thousands of types of goods entering the country, they protect domestic producers from overseas competitors. Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour group, has been fined \u00a316,700 for \u201cmultiple breaches\u201d of electoral law, the Electoral Commission has said. As the Press Association reports, the commission said the fines related to an inaccurate spending return for the 2017 general election as well as failures to report donations. It is the first time the group has been investigated by the commission and the penalties include the highest fine to be levied on a non-party campaigner for not submitting a complete and accurate spending return. Louise Edwards, director of regulation at the commission, said: Non-party campaigners are essential for a healthy democracy. But just as crucial is that after a poll, voters can see complete and accurate spending data. The fines that we have levied reflect Momentum\u2019s repeated revisions to their spending return, poor record keeping and failure to follow advice given by the commission prior to the election. Wilson goes on to accuses David Sterling, head of the civil service in Northern Ireland, of scaremongering in his letter sent to Northern Ireland political parties yesterday. We\u2019ve got from David Sterling in his letter, it\u2019s a scare tactic ... I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s head of civil service or Santa Claus, it really doesn\u2019t matter, the fact of the matter is, he\u2019s got it wrong. Wilson says that, even if a no-deal impact did have a negative effect on the Northern Ireland economy, there would be things that the government could do to compensate for this. And that\u2019s it. Wilson has finished his evidence. Q: What if the backstop were subject to an enhanced arbitration process? Wilson says that would not be acceptable to the DUP. The UK would not necessarily be able to get out of it. And any arbitration process could drag on for years. Wilson says the DUP would not accept an enhanced arbitration process as a solution to the backstop. Hermon points out that, according to some reports, this is what Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is likely to come back with from Brussels. Q: Would you be willing to accept no deal? He says, if there is a no-deal Brexit, \u201cit will be a result of the intransigence of the EU\u201d. If we finish up with a no-deal it will be a result of the intransigence of the EU. We have made it quite clear all along that we wish to have a deal, but they have to have a deal which has the support of people within the House of Commons. You can\u2019t expect the government to cave in because the alternative is no deal. Q: But what about the impact on Northern Ireland? Did you see what David Sterling, the head of the civil service in Northern Ireland, said about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland. Wilson says Sterling was just regurgitating claims he made in an earlier letter. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP, goes next. Q: The DUP seems to have changed its view on the backstop. Originally you said it must go. Now you say it might be acceptable if subject to a time limit? Wilson says, if Northern Ireland finds that 60% of its rules are set by the EU, then it will not be in the same position as the rest of the UK. Under the backstop, Northern Ireland would be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory, and it would be subject to single market rules. If laws are made outside the UK for part of the UK, that part of the UK has had its constitutional position changed, he says. He says, if the backstop was subject to a time limit, that would mean it would be removed after a certain period of time. Wilson says he thinks a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM\u2019s deal. He says business groups in Northern Ireland came out with a \u201cknee jerk\u201d response to the deal. If they had looked at it more closely, they might have recognised its disadvantages, he claims. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, is giving evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee now. Invited to set out the DUP\u2019s concerns about the backstop, Wilson says he has two points to make. First, he says there is a lot of concern in Northern Ireland about how the withdrawal agreement would leave Northern Ireland isolated from the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland would be an annex of the EU, he says. Second, he says the agreement will have an impact on the Belfast agreement (or the Good Friday agreement, as it is better known). The Belfast agreement stresses that Northern Ireland must remain as part of the UK, unless people in Northern Ireland choose otherwise. Andrew Murrison, the committee chair, says business and farmers\u2019 organisations in Northern Ireland like the Brexit agreement. Wilson says he finds it hard to understand this. I find that rather odd. Let\u2019s just take the Ulster Farmers Union, if they had read the agreement they would actually find that state aid rules applying to Northern Ireland would mean that the EU could cap that support, in accordance with what they saw as the appropriate policy. As far as businesses, I do find it very difficult to understand why Northern Ireland businesses who export around the world would wish to be excluded from UK trade deals in the future. On the subject of the backstop, this is from Alberto Nardelli, BuzzFeed\u2019s Europe editor. He is referring to last night\u2019s talks between Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels. After Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was rejected by MPs in January, in that unprecedented 230-vote defeat, May returned to the Commons to say that there were three changes she intended to make that she hoped would be enough to win around her critics. The most important, of course, was about the backstop (more on that later), but another area for concessions related to workers\u2019 rights. May said she wanted to \u201cembed the strongest possible protections on workers\u2019 rights and the environment\u201d. And today we have got the plan - which mostly involves a mechanism to ensure that, if the EU increases workers\u2019 rights after Brexit, MPs will get the chance to consider whether the UK should do the same. Here is an extract from the overnight press notice from the business department setting out the details. The government has made a commitment not to reduce the standards of workers\u2019 rights from EU laws retained in UK law and will ensure that new legislation changing those laws will be assessed as to whether they uphold this commitment. Parliament will be given the right through the withdrawal agreement bill to consider any future changes in EU law that strengthen workers\u2019 rights or workplace health and safety standards, and vote on whether they too should be adopted into UK law. The measures will require parliament to be given regular updates on changes to EU legislation in this area and will give MPs a choice on the action government will take in response, including whether MPs want to decide that the UK should remain aligned with the EU. In preparing those updates, trade unions, businesses and the relevant select committees of Parliament will be consulted with. This new process will start with two EU directives that come into force after we have left and following the implementation period \u2013 the work life balance directive and the transparent and predictable working conditions directive. The government has voted in favour of both of these directives in the European council and intends to ask parliament if it wants to adopt them into UK law. The work life balance directive introduces new rights for parents and carers, such as two months of paid leave for each parent up until the child is eight and also five days of leave for those caring for sick relatives. The transparent and predictable working conditions directive will set the terms of employment for workers by their first working day and provides more stability if you work in shifts. The government is already committed to many of these measures. This was supposed to be a relatively big bazooka in the Downing Street plan to get May\u2019s deal through parliament. But, in Westminster spin parlance, it has landed badly. Not only has the announcement been overshadowed by very damaging, stories about knife crime, it has also been given the thumbs down by Labour and the unions, two players in the Brexit process that who it was hoped might welcome what May had to offer. Here is Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, in an article in the Daily Mirror. What planet is the prime minister living on? She wants us to believe that under her government, Britain is leading the way on workers\u2019 rights. Tell that to the millions who haven\u2019t seen a real pay rise for years and are stuck in jobs where their bosses have the whip hand. The flimsy proposals she\u2019s unveiled today won\u2019t even guarantee your existing rights after Brexit. And they certainly won\u2019t stop workers\u2019 rights in the UK from falling behind those in the rest of Europe. And this is from Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary. Instead of automatically keeping up with European workers\u2019 rights, and using that as a floor as Labour has pledged, the government is admitting that British workers could see their rights fall behind those of colleagues in Europe. This is utterly unacceptable and workers and trade unions will not be fooled. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, gives evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee about Brexit. 9.30am: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, holds a summit on knife crime with police chiefs. 10am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international trade committee. 10.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to the Commons environment committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 3.30pm: Peers start debating the trade bill. As Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason report, the government faces a possible defeat on an amendment for a customs union. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary when I finish at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has insisted the meaningful vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal will go ahead as promised on Tuesday, despite negotiations in Brussels stumbling. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman repeated the line on Wednesday that the government is determined to secure \u201clegally binding changes\u201d to the Irish backstop, despite the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, returning empty-handed from the talks. Shortly before leaving Brussels, he conceded \u201cstrong views\u201d had been expressed during three hours of \u201crobust\u201d discussions. Downing Street said the talks had been \u201cdifficult\u201d, but stressed the vote would take place on Tuesday, as committed by May. If it is lost, MPs will vote on successive days on whether to block a no-deal Brexit and whether to extend the departure date. With it increasingly being assumed No 10 will not secure significant EU concessions on the backstop, May is expected to try to sell her plan to MPs and the public later in the week, potentially with a speech. There are no plans as yet for the prime minister or Cox to return to Brussels, but it is understood this could happen if required. Sunday night is the final deadline for any changes, as the government needs to publish and print copies of deal documents on Monday, and publish the motion MPs will then vote on. The two sides are seeking to find a set of assurances on the temporary nature of the Irish backstop to win over MPs to the prime minister\u2019s deal when it returns to the House of Commons. Cox said: \u201cThere are very sensitive discussions. We are into the meat of the matter now. We have put forward some proposals, very reasonable proposals. We are now into the detail of the discussion.\u201d The government\u2019s chief legal adviser, who had travelled with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, to Brussels, added: \u201cI can\u2019t reveal the discussions. These are private and confidential discussions. Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views and we are now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon.\u201d Cabinet ministers are pessimistic about the prospects of wooing enough waverers in parliament to win the second meaningful vote. May will then come under intense pressure to offer MPs a free vote on a no-deal Brexit, with her cabinet deeply divided. The opportunity to vote on this was only secured after scores of frontbenchers made it clear they were willing to resign, and the cabinet ministers Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke wrote to the Daily Mail rejecting the idea of a no-deal departure. Senior EU diplomats said the bloc\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, offered a \u201cgloomy\u201d analysis of the talks. According to a diplomatic note, Weyand told the ambassadors: \u201cCox\u2019s asks are going well beyond where Barnier can go.\u201d The \u201cthorniest issue\u201d is described as a request for the \u201cindependent review mechanism\u201d, already in the agreement, to be outside the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. \u201cThe assurances on independence that the QC [Cox] seeks would mean substantial carve out of EU law,\u201d Weyand told the ambassadors. \u201cNo indication this would bring the vote home. Such guarantees let alone indications were not given.\u201d \u201cTomorrow parties will review whether new meetings are considered helpful,\u201d the note adds. \u201cThe general feeling: UK is seeking substantial assurances without any assurance these will in any way actually work.\u201d The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, also gave a downcast progress report to officials on Wednesday morning, including the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. A European commission spokesman disclosed that Barnier had \u201cinformed the commissioners that while the talks take place in a constructive atmosphere, discussions have been difficult\u201d. The latest negotiations have been focused on turning a series of pledges made in a letter in December by Juncker and his European council counterpart, Donald Tusk, into legally binding commitments. Those include stating the EU\u2019s \u201cfirm determination\u201d to have an alternative to the backstop ready before the end of 2020, to avoid it being triggered. Should the customs union it envisages come into force, both sides would set the \u201cobjective of making this period as short as possible\u201d. Such commitments could be used in arbitration by the UK should there be any doubt about the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the EU negotiators in subsequent talks. But the EU in turn wants to avoid any legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement that undermines the terms of the backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union and Northern Ireland in the single market if there were no other alternative to avoiding a hard border in Ireland. There are concerns, given the debate in Westminster and the prime minister\u2019s insistence that the UK should be able to enjoy the benefits of frictionless trade without being in the customs union, that the EU is setting itself an unachievable goal of making such swift progress in the future trade talks. The British side is seeking to convince the EU\u2019s negotiators that this week offers the best chance of winning over parliament, and reversing the 230-vote defeat of May\u2019s withdrawal agreement in January. There are concerns among UK officials that the EU side is assuming there will a better opportunity for success once a one-off extension of article 50 is triggered, and MPs face the choice of a deal or no deal at a later vote. The prospect of MPs being given an opportunity to force a softer Brexit were boosted by a government defeat in the House of Lords on Wednesday night on the trade bill. The Department for Exiting the EU sought to underline its determination to press ahead on Wednesday, by announcing that it would create three new expert panels to investigate \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to checks at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, as part of a joint UK-EU \u201cworkstream\u201d. One panel will be made up of \u201ctechnical experts in trade and customs\u201d, a second of business and trade unions, and a third of MPs, DExEU said. They will be tasked with looking at international best practice, and examining ways technology can be used to make border checks less onerous.",

      "bodyText": "A two-decade surge in populist rhetoric that has upended the global political landscape can be revealed for the first time after the Guardian commissioned a study of speeches by almost 140 world leaders. The research, which is based on analysis of public addresses by prime ministers, presidents and chancellors in 40 countries, suggests the number of populist leaders has more than doubled since the early 2000s. It also reveals how politicians across the globe have gradually adopted more populist arguments, framing politics as a Manichean battle between the will of ordinary people and corrupt, self-serving elites. The project was overseen by Team Populism, a global network of political scientists who have pioneered the use of \u201ctextual analysis\u201d in populism studies. Their research is compiled in the Global Populism Database, the most comprehensive and reliable tracker of populist discourse in the world. Each leader was given an average populism \u201cscore\u201d, based on the extent to which speeches contained populist ideas. The data pinpoints populist discourse by leaders in all the largest countries in Europe and the Americas, as well as India. Researchers graded their speeches on a 0-2 scale, ranging from not populist to very populist. The average populism score, across all 40 countries, has doubled from 0.2 in the early 2000s to around 0.4 today. The number of countries with leaders classified as at least \u201csomewhat\u201d populist \u2013 a score of 0.5 and above \u2013 has also doubled in that period, from seven in 2004, to around 14 in recent years. The study also highlights the trajectory of individual countries, such as Venezuela, where very high levels of populist discourse persisted as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 the most populist leader in the database \u2013 was succeeded by president by Nicolas Maduro. That contrasts with countries like India, the US, Mexico and Brazil, where leaders rarely used any populist rhetoric until recent elections, when the successful prime ministerial or presidential candidate transformed the terms of debate. The nature of the rise in populist rhetoric is brought into focus when the size of affected countries is considered. In the early 2000s, Venezuela, Argentina and Italy were the only countries with populations larger than 20 million with populist leaders.

      "bodyText": "Chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef are already infecting the debate over a post-Brexit trade deal, with one of the US\u2019s most senior diplomats dismissing the European Union\u2019s \u201cmuseum of agriculture\u201d approach to food safety. The US ambassador, Woody Johnson, claimed fears over US food standards leading to lower quality food were \u201cmyths\u201d and part of a \u201csmear campaign\u201d to cast American farming in the worst possible light. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has pledged that food standards will be the same if not better after the UK leaves the EU, but campaigners are concerned that welfare and environmental protections could be jettisoned in the rush to strike a US trade deal. On Wednesday, the leading Brexit supporter George Eustice, who resigned from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last week, wrote in the Guardian that the UK should not countenance signing any deal that would reduce food standards as it could \u201cgive free trade a bad name\u201d. He called US agriculture \u201cquite backward\u201d. Chlorinated chicken and the use of hormones in animals and animal feed, along with the use of pesticides and food colourants, remain among the top concerns of the Soil Association, which will launch an updated food risk list for US-UK trade talks later this week. \u201cUK public health and wildlife could be negatively affected if our food and farming standards are sacrificed in pursuit of a US trade deal,\u201d said Rob Percival, the organisation\u2019s head of policy. \u201cUK farmers have been making positive strides in recent years, reducing farm antibiotic use and these efforts risk being undermined by a trade deal that floods the UK market with US meat.\u201d Food practices listed among the 10 risks to Britain in a US-UK trade deal by the Soil Association include: Chlorinated chicken In the US, farmers are allowed to use chlorine washes and other disinfectants to remove harmful bacteria that may have infected the birds during rearing and slaughter. The EU banned the practice 22 years ago, leading to a long-running dispute over imports of chicken from the US. The US poultry sector has argued the ban in the EU is not based on science, but the EU is concerned that chlorine may compensate or mask poorer hygiene and animal welfare standards earlier in the food chain. The European Food Safety Authority has concluded that \u201cchemical substances found in poultry meat are unlikely to pose an immediate or acute health threat to consumers\u201d, but a team of microbiologists from Southampton University found last year that some bacteria remained completely active after chlorine washing. Antibiotics The Soil Association report on risks to food in a US-UK trade deal says that the use of \u201cantibiotics per animal in US farming is on average a shocking five times higher than in the UK\u201d. Antibiotic resistance is one of the gravest public health threats facing the world and investigations last year by the Food Safety and Inspection Service showed that powerful antibiotics were still being used despite new rules to curb their use and combat the spread of deadly superbugs. Data from a US investigation seen by the Guardian showed that 13 separate antibiotics classed by the World Health Organization as \u201ccritically important\u201d to human medicine were still being used in meat supply chains. Hormone-fed beef Cattle producers in the US and other countries use hormones to induce faster, bigger animal growth but they have been banned in the EU since 1989. Australia and America are both pushing to have hormone-treated beef included in any future trade deal with the UK, arguing that the EU\u2019s position on the subject is scientifically flawed. The EU currently allows some imports of beef from the US but they are for high quality non-hormone treated meat. American farmers have long complained that the EU quota was a bad deal for them because it was exactly the same as was made available to smaller WTO countries such as Australia and Uruguay. Ractopamine Ractopamine is a growth hormone used to promote leanness in animals by shifting nutrients into muscle and away from fat deposition. It is administered in the days leading up to slaughter. It is banned by the EU, mainland China, Russia and almost 160 other countries but not in the US, Japan or South Korea. According to the European parliament, \u201cthe substance is widely used: according to some estimates, in the rearing of 60-80% of all pigs produced\u201d in the US. In swine, the drug is linked to several adverse effects including hyperactivity, broken limbs and trembling. Food colouring In the US, products that include Yellow 5 and 6, Red 3 and 40, Blue 1 and 2, Green 3 and Orange B are available for purchase and do not require labelling. The UK banned these food dyes following a 2007 double-blind study that found eating artificially coloured food appeared to increase children\u2019s hyperactivity. Food colours are contained in many foods and drinks, including snacks, margarine, cheese, jams and desserts. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2019.
