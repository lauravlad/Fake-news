Tomorrow is a big day for Brexit, so it would probably be rather prudent if we all got some rest. <br></p> <p>Here a short overview of the latest key developments:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>MPs are scheduled to vote on Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement alone from 14.30 tomorrow, the 29th of March, the day Britain was originally meant to exit from the EU.</strong> Unless some last-minute shifts occur, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/28/brexit-theresa-may-to-ask-mps-to-vote-only-on-withdrawal-agreement\">it would be a huge surprise if the prime minister managed to get enough MPs to back her agreement</a>, even after having separated it from the deal\u2019s political declaration. <br></li> <li><strong>The legality of this separation is still disputed.</strong> Various MPs and pundits, from both the Remain and Leave camps, have questioned whether tomorrow\u2019s vote is lawful. Attorney general Geoffrey Cox told parliament earlier that it is, and will address concerns in his opening speech tomorrow. <br></li> <li><strong>It is this separation that got the withdrawal agreement past speaker John Bercow for the third time</strong>, as it represented in his view a substantial enough amendment of the PM\u2019s twice-rejected deal.</li> <li><strong>If the WA passes, Britain will most likely leave the EU on the 22nd of May</strong>, the deadline the European Council has set for that scenario. <strong>If the WA fails again tomorrow, the UK faces crashing out without a deal on the 12th of April, or a longer extension and possibly a general election.</strong> If the deal is passed after tomorrow but before the 12th of April, the EU might still allow the 22nd of May deadline, but this can\u2019t be taken for granted.<br></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/28/cabinet-ministers-considering-running-prime-minister-theresa-may-conservatives-tories\">At least 10 cabinet ministers are competing to succeed Theresa May as prime minister.</a> Jacob-Rees Mogg has hinted that he would back his brother-in-Brexit Boris Johnson in his leadership bid. <br></strong></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/28/mps-backing-soft-brexit-hope-to-unite-around-a-compromise-option\">MPs in favour of a soft Brexit are still hopeful about finding a compromise that is workable</a>, </strong>such as a Norway-style Brexit, also dubbed \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d.

They want to see this resolved. <br>\u201cOn the other hand, the fact that we do this without there being violence in the streets or anything like that is something that commentators and people abroad mention with some degree of being impressed. <br>\u201cSo, has it affected our standing abroad?

He made two newish points on this subject.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Bercow said he would not allow a repeat vote on Theresa May\u2019s unchanged Brexit deal just because support for it might have gone up.</strong> He was responding to a point of order from the Conservative MP <strong>Anne Main</strong>, who said 30 of her colleagues had changed their minds on May\u2019s deal since the second meaningful vote and that she herself wanted to have the option of being able to vote for it now too because the indicative votes debate had revealed what the alternatives might be. Bercow rejected her argument. He told her:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conventions exist for a purpose ... The validity of a convention or otherwise is not dependent upon a head count at a particular time. The whole point of having a rule is because it is judged to be of value, and the fact that somebody suddenly thinks it isn\u2019t convenient doesn\u2019t mean that it should simply be disregarded.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Bercow said he accepted the argument that MPs should be protected from having to repeatedly make difficult voting decisions. </strong>He was responding to a point of order from the Tory MP<strong> Julian Lewis</strong> who said he attended a meeting yesterday where two of his colleagues were in tears at the prospect of having to vote to defy the whip on May\u2019s Brexit deal for a third time. Bercow (who is very friendly with Lewis) said Lewis had made good point. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many people will feel that\u2019s a powerful observation. There are a number of reasons for the long-established convention that the house is not asked to decide the same question more than once in the same session ... [The point Lewis makes was not one of the original reasons for the rule but it is] a powerful reinforcement of the continuing case for the convention. I think he\u2019s made an extremely important point and it is something on which colleagues at all levels need to reflect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bercow\u2019s comment about colleagues \u201cat all levels\u201d seemed like an obvious reference to the ones who work in Downing Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7e212cfaf9bc9fce17365c93b063f8dc0b71a0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7e212cfaf9bc9fce17365c93b063f8dc0b71a0f/0_103_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Bercow, the Speaker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bercow, the Speaker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Mark Duffy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c9ce825e4b0347f70e75544\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-28T15:34:18.691Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Charles Grant,</strong> the director of the Centre for European Reform, has posted a good thread on Twitter explaining what EU leaders think about the Brexit crisis in the UK.

She added that the option of staying in the single market and customs union was not on the ballot paper last night.</p> <p>Her spokesperson later said that the first minister\u2019s position was that \u201cremain appears to be very much in play\u201d, that there was nothing on last night\u2019s ballot that met the full continued single market/customs union arrangement put forward as a compromise by the Scottish government in 2016, but that the SNP has \u201cnot abandoned the potential for compromise\u201d.</p> <p>Sturgeon suggested at FMQs that her MPs might vote differently on the options if they were brought forward again. </p> <p>Meanwhile, two SNP MPs abstained on the amendment for a second vote last night; long-serving MPs Pete Wishart and Angus Brendan Macneil broke the whip \u2013 unusually for SNP MPs \u2013having spoken out previously about their concerns that such a vote sets a dangerous precedent for another independence referendum in Scotland. </p> <p>The FM\u2019s spokesperson said that she disagreed with their position. And, again, he said that it was \u201cself-evident that we need to wait for clarity\u201d before Sturgeon can set out her own long-awaited thinking on independence. </p> <p>At the start of the session proceedings were interrupted by protesters from Extinction Rebellion Scotland who unfurled a banner demanding that the FM \u201cestablish a citizen\u2019s assembly to address the climate emergency\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a5fbc80f1a55274edc568a25891555c8462be2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a5fbc80f1a55274edc568a25891555c8462be2f/0_86_3893_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-28T14:48:42.749Z\">at 2.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c9cd3dce4b0833458363a87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-28T14:03:52.844Z\">2.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2544dd2ce5cb9f91d01ddbdf66eb27d85882a8be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2544dd2ce5cb9f91d01ddbdf66eb27d85882a8be/0_186_3803_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro and anti-Brexit campaigners outside the House of Parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro and anti-Brexit campaigners outside the House of Parliament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c9cce93e4b0b4d18bde1c8f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-28T13:51:08.381Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour says May's resignation announcement makes backing her 'blindfold Brexit' even harder</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sir Keir Starmer,</strong> the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking at the BCC conference now.

He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is, you can\u2019t separate the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. And the prime minister knows it. On 14 January \u2013 when pleading with MPs to back her deal the first time round, she told the Commons there was \u201cabsolute clarity on the explicit linkage between the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration\u201d ...</p> <p>The prime minister and the EU know these documents cannot be separated. Yet now she may ask the Commons to pretend they can.</p> <p>But I want to clear \u2013 Labour will not support this latest desperate attempt by the PM.</p> <p>To now to split the withdrawal agreement and political declaration would leave us with the blindest of blindfold Brexits.</p> <p>Labour will not countenance that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said May\u2019s decision to stand down before the next phase of the Brexit talks made Labour even more opposed to supporting her deal.</strong> He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the prime minister\u2019s commitment yesterday to resign before the next phase of negotiations begin, it\u2019s even more of a blindfold Brexit \u2013because we now know that the outcome of our future relationship with the EU is not going to be determined by her.</p> <p>My biggest fear is that unless parliament takes a stand now, the outcome of the negotiations is going to be determined by the outcome of next Tory leadership contest.</p> <p>It could be a Boris Johnson Brexit.</p> <p>A Jacob Rees-Mogg Brexit.</p> <p>Or a Michael Gove Brexit.</p> <p>That should give anyone considering supporting May\u2019s deal on Friday serious concern.</p> <p>Equally, if the prime minister tries to separate the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration altogether, that only makes matters worse.</p> <p>We would be leaving the EU, but with absolutely no idea where we are heading.

British MPs spend their own careers operating through party; they have little incentive to work \u201cacross the aisle\u201d, as they would say in the US. True, we did have a coalition between 2010 and 2015, but that turned out to be a disaster for one of the parties involved, the Liberal Democrats, and did little to undermine the case against first-past-the-post. If anyone were to reinvent the British constitution from scratch, they would almost certainly choose an alternative model. The devolved legislatures set up within the last 20 years all use more proportional voting systems, and in Edinburgh and Cardiff cross-party cooperation is much more common than at Westminster. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c9c9d9fe4b0347f70e751f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-28T10:14:49.120Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> has posted a tweet this morning attacking the SNP.

      "bodyText": "I am going to wrap up now. Tomorrow is a big day for Brexit, so it would probably be rather prudent if we all got some rest. Here a short overview of the latest key developments: MPs are scheduled to vote on Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement alone from 14.30 tomorrow, the 29th of March, the day Britain was originally meant to exit from the EU. Unless some last-minute shifts occur, it would be a huge surprise if the prime minister managed to get enough MPs to back her agreement, even after having separated it from the deal\u2019s political declaration. The legality of this separation is still disputed. Various MPs and pundits, from both the Remain and Leave camps, have questioned whether tomorrow\u2019s vote is lawful. Attorney general Geoffrey Cox told parliament earlier that it is, and will address concerns in his opening speech tomorrow. It is this separation that got the withdrawal agreement past speaker John Bercow for the third time, as it represented in his view a substantial enough amendment of the PM\u2019s twice-rejected deal. If the WA passes, Britain will most likely leave the EU on the 22nd of May, the deadline the European Council has set for that scenario. If the WA fails again tomorrow, the UK faces crashing out without a deal on the 12th of April, or a longer extension and possibly a general election. If the deal is passed after tomorrow but before the 12th of April, the EU might still allow the 22nd of May deadline, but this can\u2019t be taken for granted. At least 10 cabinet ministers are competing to succeed Theresa May as prime minister. Jacob-Rees Mogg has hinted that he would back his brother-in-Brexit Boris Johnson in his leadership bid. MPs in favour of a soft Brexit are still hopeful about finding a compromise that is workable, such as a Norway-style Brexit, also dubbed \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d. In a second round of indicative votes on Monday, provided the PM\u2019s deal fails tomorrow, this option could theoretically stand a chance to win a majority. Rien ne va plus, that\u2019s all from me. Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli reports that the EU \u201cthinks the UK is now facing a binary choice between no deal and a long delay to Brexit, according to a diplomatic note\u201d they got their hands on. The note reportedly reveals that EU 27 leaders are planning to meet on April 10 - two days before April 12, the date the UK is set to leave the EU if it doesn\u2019t pass Theresa May\u2019s deal by then or seeks a longer extension. This just in from Brexiter and MEP Patrick O\u2019Flynn, who appears to be fuming. Labour peer and People\u2019s Vote campaigner Andrew Adonis is evidently not very keen on the PM\u2019s decoupling of Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration, and insists that it was a Conservative manifesto promise to vote on them together. The tone of people\u2019s Westminster jokes is becoming increasingly desperate, and who can blame them. This from the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon. Jeremy Corbyn just tweeted this 2-minute video, in which he called for a General Election, \u201cso Labour can stop a damaging Tory Brexit and rebuild our country, for the many, not just the few.\u201d Nothing new to see here, tbh. Conservative MP and May loyalist Lucy Allan has just called for the support of the PM\u2019s deal tomorrow. It\u2019s perhaps not surprising, but nevertheless important to note that Jacob-Rees Mogg appears to be in favour of Boris Johnson becoming the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Yes, let those words linger a little. This from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. MPs interested in a softer Brexit are scrambling to find a workable compromise, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Here an excerpt: MPs backing a soft Brexit are hoping to forge compromise options to be put to parliament when the next round of indicative votes take place in the House of Commons. Supporters of a Norway-style approach, dubbed \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d, as well those MPs backing a customs union, hope they can come together and attract a majority for a form of soft Brexit. Discussions are taking place to persuade the Labour frontbench to adopt more broadly appealing wording for a softer Brexit proposal, rather than put their own version of a Labour Brexit deal as one of the options in the next round of voting. Unless Theresa May\u2019s deal passes on Friday, MPs are expecting to vote again on a series of Brexit options on Monday, using a similar system to the first round of voting this Wednesday, where options are put down by MPs and selected by the speaker. Full story below. Alistair Burt MP, who resigned as Foreign Office minister this week because he did not feel like obeying the Tory whip during the Brexit votes, thinks Brexit has caused international concern about stability in the UK. This is from the Press Association: Brexit has caused international concern about stability in the UK, former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt has said. Mr Burt, who quit his ministerial post this week so that he could vote against the Government on EU withdrawal, said overseas observers want to see the situation resolved. He said Brexit had had an impact on the view of the UK from abroad, telling The House magazine: \u201cThe exposure of our processes has made some people think very carefully about where British politics is going. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned about stability. They want to see this resolved. \u201cOn the other hand, the fact that we do this without there being violence in the streets or anything like that is something that commentators and people abroad mention with some degree of being impressed. \u201cSo, has it affected our standing abroad? Yes, it has. \u201cThey want to be sure of what the answers are in terms of making their future decisions. \u201cBut they\u2019re open to it, they certainly haven\u2019t all been saying, we think you\u2019re totally wrong and you should get back in the EU.\u201d The comments came as Tory MP Alberto Costa said that Government plans regarding the status of the estimated 3.7 million EU citizens after Brexit could lead to a \u201ctsunami of litigation\u201d. Mr Costa, who quit a Government aide post after tabling a Commons amendment on EU citizens\u2019 rights in a no- deal scenario in February, expressed concern about how plans would work out in practice. The MP told The House magazine that confusion over settled status could lead to another Windrush-style controversy as some EU nationals do not realise they need to be proactive. From Saturday, the Home Office\u2019s EU settlement scheme will be fully open following test phases during which nearly 200,000 people have received status. EU nationals and their family members who have lived continuously in the UK for five years can obtain settled status, meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely. People with less than five years\u2019 residence can apply for pre-settled status, which can later be converted into settled status. Mr Costa told The House magazine: \u201cThe registration scheme and the danger of Windrush is that you potentially leave a very large amount of people who might not acquire these rights by the deadline of 2021 for whatever reason. \u201cSome might be vulnerable, some might be in care homes.\u201d He added: \u201cI think there is a real danger here that if the Government does not learn its lesson that it could become Windrush writ large.\u201d Although various people have declared their staunch refusal to vote for May\u2019s deal tomorrow, the prime minister can perhaps find some solace in Rory Stewart\u2019s repeated 11th hour attempts to make it palatable to his fellow MPs. The Prisons minister told the BBC this evening that the vote on the withdrawal deal alone was simply a way of breaking things \u201cdown into chunks\u201d. Earlier, Stewart said this on BBC Radio 5 Live: This is a piece from the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor Katy Balls in the iPaper on how the Maybot could still return for another general election campaign trail. Keir Starmer is particularly furious about the \u201cdecoupling\u201d of the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration, which together form May\u2019s departure deal with the EU. My colleague Tom Kibasi has written an explainer on the consequences of this separation for project Brexit. Labour MP Keir Starmer launched a withering attack on the government earlier in the Commons, and labelled tomorrow\u2019s vote on the withdrawal agreement alone May\u2019s \u201clatest desperate attempt\u201d to get her deal past the post. He summarises his views in this thread: Theresa May\u2019s cabinet seems preoccupied with finding a worthy successor to the current boss. So far 10 cabinet ministers have entered the race to the throne, my colleagues Rowena Mason, Heather Stewart, Rajeev Syal and Jessica Elgot write. This was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s response to the question of whether Labour would back tomorrow\u2019s Brexit motion. Things do not look good for the passing of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement tomorrow. This from Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts: This is from Lib Dem Tom Brake, who earlier called for \u201can emergency Brexit support fund of at least \u00a37.5bn to mitigate job losses caused by Brexit uncertainty.\u201d He also questions the legality of tomorrow\u2019s vote, even though the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, assured MPs earlier that the vote was entirely lawful. In more ridiculously mad news, Fishing For Leave, a campaign representing the largely Brexit-supporting fishing industry and aiming \u201cto ensure restoration of national control of all waters &amp; resources coupled with a decent future UK fisheries policy\u201d, will apparently be staging a fishy stunt on Parliament Square tomorrow, according to the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope. I fear there will be many, many terrible puns. This from the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg: The BBC\u2019s Darren Marshall just tweeted more, not exactly revelatory, DUP news, quoting the MP Nigel Dodds: Also, do not miss this Guardian podcast if you are curious about details surrounding the Tory leadership contest which kicked off today, plus more. Peter Foster, Europe editor of the Daily Telegraph, has also bashed out a handy thread on where we\u2019re at and what\u2019s potentially next. My colleague Rajeev Syal has written an excellent, concise piece explaining the vote tomorrow and what it is all about. It\u2019s easy enough to digest alongside chips and a pint, promise. All eyes are now on how tomorrow\u2019s vote might pan out. Yesterday it looked like there was practically no chance Theresa May\u2019s deal would pass at a third attempt, but that was before MPs were informed they were voting on the withdrawal agreement alone, which the government has cleverly \u201cdecoupled\u201d from the political declaration to get it approved for a third vote by the Speaker, John Bercow, without having to reopen negotiations with the EU. The DUP has already shouted their umpteenth \u201cNo!\u201d into the room and won\u2019t be voting for the withdrawal agreement unless a miracle happens. But apparently there is still potential in winning the some hardline Tory Brexiters from the ERG over. This just in from Tom Newton-Dunn, political editor of the Sun: Tom McTague, UK political correspondent for Politico, has written a long, very interesting explainer on the Brexit that was promised but currently seems undeliverable in a form that would please anybody, and the long-term repercussions of this scenario. Pardon his French. Commenting on the government\u2019s latest manoeuvres, Chris Bryant MP, leading supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, has issued the following statement: Just when we thought the Brexit chaos could not get worse, we are now confronted by this appalling behaviour by the government. Parliament passed a law requiring the government to get the approval of the House of Commons for both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on our future relationship with the EU before Brexit could go ahead. Ministers are now flouting the spirit and perhaps the letter of that law. They are now engaged in an anti-democratic sleight of hand to deny parliament the time needed to properly consider what form a final Brexit should take. Above all this is a legal manoeuvre designed to force its broken Brexit deal on our country and stop, at any cost, the British people having the final say on Brexit. Tomorrow, questions about its legality and whether the House of Commons will stand for this disgraceful behaviour will be answered. But it is already crystal clear that the government is now acting in utter contempt for parliament and the principles of democracy itself. There are bags of uncertainty about what will happen tomorrow in the House of Commons. Since there won\u2019t be any clarity regarding the exact date of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union \u2013 should it happen at all \u2013 until after parliament\u2019s vote on May\u2019s withdrawal agreement tomorrow, (and it\u2019s entirely possible that we still won\u2019t know more after the vote), it is only understandable that some people are starting to get a tad concerned about that famous cliff-edge we\u2019ve been talking about for the past three years. ITV News has met people who have seriously started to stockpile \u2013 one family has even bought open date one-way Eurostar tickets out of here to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. Hello everyone. I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Andrew Sparrow, who has posted a summary of key developments as they currently stand that is about as clear as possible below. Tomorrow is a big day \u2013 29 March \u2013 the day the United Kingdom was originally meant to leave the EU. We know this is no longer happening, but what will happen instead remains a puzzle that still has various pieces missing. On the upside, this is an excellent time to evacuate from this island and go on holiday, as my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, the Guardian Brexit correspondent, is pointing out in her latest piece. Theresa May is now embarked on a new strategy to get her Brexit deal through the Commons. Her new strategy seems largely driven by the decision of John Bercow, the Speaker, to declare that he will rule out repeat votes on the same proposition (a ruling that he firmed up yesterday, and again today). The details of the new approach are complicated, and at this stage not all 100% clear, and some MPs are already questioning the legality of what she is trying to do. But this is what we know. MPs will be asked to vote on motion tomorrow approving the withdrawal agreement (the long, legally-binding treaty covering the backstop, payments to the EU and citizens\u2019 rights), part of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. MPs will not be asked to approve the second part of the deal \u2013 the political declaration, the much shorter text setting out plans for the future relationship. See 5.16pm for the text of the motion. Ministers seem to have abandoned plans for MV3 - meaningful vote three - a vote which would have involved MPs being asked for the third time to approve the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. Instead, if the government wins the debate tomorrow (WA1 \u2013 withdrawal agreement one) it plans to press ahead with a debate on the EU withdrawal agreement bill. This could be used to amend section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act, which requires MPs to pass a resolution combining the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration for the withdrawal agreement to be ratified. (See 3.17pm for more details.) Labour MPs have questioned whether this is legal. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has said what the government is doing is legal, and he has said he will give more details tomorrow when he opens the debate. (See 5.12pm.) Labour has quashed speculation that splitting the meaningful vote will make it more likely to vote for the withdrawal agreement. Most of Labour\u2019s objections to May\u2019s deal relate to the political declaration, not the withdrawal agreement. But Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, explained today why the party would be voting against the withdrawal agreement. (See 1.51pm.) Today\u2019s announcement confirms that Jeremy Corbyn was right when he said on Monday that his talks with Theresa May on Monday led him to believe she was planning a stand-alone vote on the withdrawal agreement. At the time Downing Street denied this. May is holding the vote tomorrow because she wants to protect the article 50 extension until 22 May agreed by the EU. That is dependent on MPs voting for the withdrawal agreement by the end of tomorrow. But to win the vote she faces an uphill struggle \u2013 particularly since the DUP have just said they will vote against (see 6pm) \u2013 and if the vote is lost, then the UK will be heading for no-deal on 12 April \u2013 unless it revokes article 50, gets the EU to agree a long extension conditional on the UK holding European election, or passes the deal before 12 April and persuades the EU to agree another very short extension. (See 4.20pm.) That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is now taking over. DUP to vote against government on withdrawal agreement Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, says if the motion were passed tomorrow, the UK would have an extension of article 50 until 22 May. But at that point the UK would not be able get a further extension. So does passing the motion preclude another extension? John Bercow, the speaker, says he cannot rule on this. But Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will speak tomorrow, Bercow says. Cox himself rises. He says he will address this point tomorrow. This is what Andrea Leadsom said a moment ago when she was asked if the passing of the motion tomorrow would mean the UK would not be ratifying the withdrawal agreement. She replied: No. What it would mean is that the withdrawal agreement bill would then be before this house. Leadsom says if the motion is passed tomorrow, the government will move on to passing the EU withdrawal agreement bill. This implies that there would be no \u201cmeaningful vote three\u201d. Here is the text of the motion being debated tomorrow. That this house notes the European council decision of 22 March 2019 taken in agreement with the United Kingdom extending the period under article 50(3) of the treaty on European Union, which provides for an extension to the article 50 period to 22 May 2019 only if the House of Commons approves the withdrawal agreement by 29 March 2019; notes that if the house does not do so by that date the article 50 period will only as a matter of law be extended to 12 April 2019 and that any extension beyond 22 May 2019 would require the UK to bring forward the necessary day of poll order to hold elections to the European parliament; notes that article 184 of the withdrawal agreement refers to the political declaration between the UK and EU agreed on 25 November 2018, but that the EU has stated it remains open to negotiating changes to the political declaration; notes that the house is currently undertaking deliberations to identify whether there is a design for the future relationship that commands its support; notes that even should changes be sought to the political declaration, leaving the European Union with a deal still requires the withdrawal agreement; declares that it wishes to leave the EU with an agreement as soon as possible and does not wish to have a longer extension; therefore approves the withdrawal agreement, the joint instrument and the unilateral declaration laid before the house on 11 March 2019 so that the UK can leave the EU on 22 May 2019; notes that this approval does not by itself meet the requirements of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act; and resolves that it is content to proceed to the next steps of this process, including fulfilling section 13 of this act. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is speaking now. He says the procedure set out by the government is perfectly lawful and perfectly sensible. He says the government could not let the deadline for the 22 May extension lapse tomorrow without giving MPs a chance to approve it. When the house listens to the rationale behind it, when it hears the full context of it, I\u2019m sure the house will accept it is not only perfectly lawful, perfectly sensible and is designed to give this house an opportunity of availing itself of a right the European Union has given to us to avail ourselves of an extension until May 22. The view of the government is simply we could not let the time limit expire at 11pm tomorrow, of allowing this house the opportunity of availing itself of that right. It is perfectly reasonable and it is perfectly lawful. This is from Graeme Cowie, a Commons library clerk specialising in Brexit. Leadsom reads out the motion for tomorrow, which is lengthy. It says that the vote would not count as a meaningful vote \u2013 ie, a vote under section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act approving the Brexit deal. Leadsom is asked if that means the government intends to go ahead with a meaningful vote three. She suggests that, instead, the government will bring forward legislation, the EU withdrawal agreement bill, and use that to approve the Brexit deal. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, says the government is tabling this motion so that it can take advantage of the extension of article 50 until 22 May. In the Commons John Bercow, the Speaker, says that he will allow tomorrow\u2019s Brexit motion. It is not the same, or substantially the same, as a previous one, he says. He says the motion for debate tomorrow will just cover the withdrawal agreement (WA). It will not cover the WA and the political declaration (PD), like the previous meaningful votes, he says. He says he is glad the government has accepted his ruling that the MPs should not be asked to vote on the same proposition twice. Bercow says MPs will tomorrow vote on a motion to approve the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Unlike the two meaningful votes already held, it will not cover the political declaration. It is day one of the Conservative leadership contest, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is already out of the traps with an interview in the Evening Standard. It is not hugely revealing, but Hunt uses it to provide an outline for what his pitch will be: compassionate Conservatism, with a Brexity tinge. Hunt claims the mantle of one nation Conservatism, saying his party has not had the chance to implement it during this decade. He says: Everything [David Cameron] wanted to do was eclipsed by the need for huge public spending cuts and austerity after the financial recession. Theresa May arrived as a one nation Conservative and had to deal with Brexit. So we have really never had a chance to show the British people what one nation Conservatism can be. He says that he would never support a second referendum and that, although he voted remain in 2016, he would now vote leave. Asked why, he says: To respect the outcome of the last referendum. The way to heal divisions is not to try and unpick a result, we have to make a success of Brexit, bring the country together. He stresses his loyalty to Theresa May, in an obvious jibe at his rival Boris Johnson. He says: Brexit is far more important than the ambitions of the many people who might like to succeed Theresa May. According to the Standard, the interview was conducted around the time that May was announcing to the 1922 Committee that she would resign before the next phase of the Brexit process begins. That means Hunt must have scheduled it before her news was even announced. It is a transparent leadership pitch, although, according to the Standard, Hunt refused to confirm or deny that he would be a candidate in the contest. \u201cRight now it is heads down to get this deal over the line,\u201d Hunt said. This is worth clarifying. If the withdrawal agreement does not pass tomorrow, is it just no-deal, or no Brexit? If the withdrawal agreement does not pass tomorrow, it is not just no-deal, or no Brexit. You have misunderstood. It is worth restating what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said at the summit explaining the deal. In the first scenario, that is, if the withdrawal agreement is passed by the House of Commons next week, the European council agrees to an extension until the 22nd of May. In the second scenario, that is, if the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European council agrees to an extension until the 12th of April, while expecting the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward. What this means in practice is that, until that date, all options will remain open, and the cliff-edge date will be delayed. The UK government will still have a choice of a deal, no-deal, a long extension or revoking article 50. So, if the WA does not pass tomorrow, a long article 50 extension would still be an option, provided the UK takes part in the European elections. If the UK were to pass the deal after tomorrow, but before 12 April (the last date for deciding that the UK will participate in the European elections), it is conceivable that the EU could revive the 22 May deadline, but that is not certain. In the Commons earlier John Bercow, the Speaker, restated his determination to enforce the Commons rule saying the government cannot bring the same proposition back for a vote in one session of parliament unless it has changed significantly. He made two newish points on this subject. Bercow said he would not allow a repeat vote on Theresa May\u2019s unchanged Brexit deal just because support for it might have gone up. He was responding to a point of order from the Conservative MP Anne Main, who said 30 of her colleagues had changed their minds on May\u2019s deal since the second meaningful vote and that she herself wanted to have the option of being able to vote for it now too because the indicative votes debate had revealed what the alternatives might be. Bercow rejected her argument. He told her: Conventions exist for a purpose ... The validity of a convention or otherwise is not dependent upon a head count at a particular time. The whole point of having a rule is because it is judged to be of value, and the fact that somebody suddenly thinks it isn\u2019t convenient doesn\u2019t mean that it should simply be disregarded. Bercow said he accepted the argument that MPs should be protected from having to repeatedly make difficult voting decisions. He was responding to a point of order from the Tory MP Julian Lewis who said he attended a meeting yesterday where two of his colleagues were in tears at the prospect of having to vote to defy the whip on May\u2019s Brexit deal for a third time. Bercow (who is very friendly with Lewis) said Lewis had made good point. He went on: Many people will feel that\u2019s a powerful observation. There are a number of reasons for the long-established convention that the house is not asked to decide the same question more than once in the same session ... [The point Lewis makes was not one of the original reasons for the rule but it is] a powerful reinforcement of the continuing case for the convention. I think he\u2019s made an extremely important point and it is something on which colleagues at all levels need to reflect. Bercow\u2019s comment about colleagues \u201cat all levels\u201d seemed like an obvious reference to the ones who work in Downing Street. Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform, has posted a good thread on Twitter explaining what EU leaders think about the Brexit crisis in the UK. It starts here. And here are two of his main points. The Brexit rapporteur for German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party has urged UK politicians not to cause a no-deal Brexit by accident, the Press Association reports. Detlef Seif said: The discussion in the United Kingdom has created the impression that a lot of options for action are possible. But only three options exist: To agree to the deal that is on the table, to revoke the withdrawal notification, or to delay the exiting day. We must urge our British friends that a delay is only possible if the UK takes part in the European parliament elections. Here are two Twitter threads on the pros and cons of a decision by the government to ask MPs to vote to approve the withdrawal agreement, but not the political declaration. There is one from the barrister Jolyon Maugham starting here. And there is one from Joe Marshall from the Institute for Government starting here. Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, has used Twitter to say the UK must provide clarity on Brexit. Here are his tweets (with the translation below). Yesterday\u2019s votes in the House of Commons once again brought no clarity. Almost three years after the #Brexit referendum, however, it is now time to be for something and not just always against. Citizens of both the other #EU member states and the UK, as well as businesses, rightly expect certainty as soon as possible as to how to proceed. A hard #Brexit, that is, a disorderly exit, would hurt the EU, but much more #GreatBritain, and therefore must be avoided. We, as the EU27, continue to hope for approval of the withdrawal agreement. First minister\u2019s questions was inevitably dominated by Brexit matters, specifically with Nicola Sturgeon being accused of hypocrisy by Scottish Conservative deputy Jackson Carlaw after her SNP MPs failed to back the customs union amendment last night, despite promoting it as a compromise option along with a single market for the last three years. It was clear, argued Carlaw, that the SNP were obsessed with independence and not interested in compromise at all. But Sturgeon insisted that her reasoning was that, with options to remain among the amendments, \u201cstopping Brexit altogether must be our top priority\u201d. She added that the option of staying in the single market and customs union was not on the ballot paper last night. Her spokesperson later said that the first minister\u2019s position was that \u201cremain appears to be very much in play\u201d, that there was nothing on last night\u2019s ballot that met the full continued single market/customs union arrangement put forward as a compromise by the Scottish government in 2016, but that the SNP has \u201cnot abandoned the potential for compromise\u201d. Sturgeon suggested at FMQs that her MPs might vote differently on the options if they were brought forward again. Meanwhile, two SNP MPs abstained on the amendment for a second vote last night; long-serving MPs Pete Wishart and Angus Brendan Macneil broke the whip \u2013 unusually for SNP MPs \u2013having spoken out previously about their concerns that such a vote sets a dangerous precedent for another independence referendum in Scotland. The FM\u2019s spokesperson said that she disagreed with their position. And, again, he said that it was \u201cself-evident that we need to wait for clarity\u201d before Sturgeon can set out her own long-awaited thinking on independence. At the start of the session proceedings were interrupted by protesters from Extinction Rebellion Scotland who unfurled a banner demanding that the FM \u201cestablish a citizen\u2019s assembly to address the climate emergency\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking at the BCC conference now. Some extracts from his speech have been released in advance, and here are the key points. Starmer said Labour would refuse to vote for the withdrawal agreement on its own. There is speculation that tomorrow\u2019s vote will just be on the withdrawal agreement. (See 12.23pm.) Labour\u2019s main objections with Theresa May\u2019s deal are with the elements of the political declaration, but, in the remarks released to journalists, Starmer said leaving out the PD would not make Labour support the WA. He explained: The truth is, you can\u2019t separate the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. And the prime minister knows it. On 14 January \u2013 when pleading with MPs to back her deal the first time round, she told the Commons there was \u201cabsolute clarity on the explicit linkage between the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration\u201d ... The prime minister and the EU know these documents cannot be separated. Yet now she may ask the Commons to pretend they can. But I want to clear \u2013 Labour will not support this latest desperate attempt by the PM. To now to split the withdrawal agreement and political declaration would leave us with the blindest of blindfold Brexits. Labour will not countenance that. He said May\u2019s decision to stand down before the next phase of the Brexit talks made Labour even more opposed to supporting her deal. He explained: Following the prime minister\u2019s commitment yesterday to resign before the next phase of negotiations begin, it\u2019s even more of a blindfold Brexit \u2013because we now know that the outcome of our future relationship with the EU is not going to be determined by her. My biggest fear is that unless parliament takes a stand now, the outcome of the negotiations is going to be determined by the outcome of next Tory leadership contest. It could be a Boris Johnson Brexit. A Jacob Rees-Mogg Brexit. Or a Michael Gove Brexit. That should give anyone considering supporting May\u2019s deal on Friday serious concern. Equally, if the prime minister tries to separate the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration altogether, that only makes matters worse. We would be leaving the EU, but with absolutely no idea where we are heading. That cannot be acceptable and Labour will not vote for it. The government hopes to hold another vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal on Friday after announcing a debate on Brexit for that day, even as it emerged that no new talks were scheduled with the DUP. Quite what MPs will be asked to vote on has not yet been announced. Government sources have said this will not be the third meaningful vote (MV3), the vote on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration needed to May\u2019s Brexit deal to be agreed. But a government spokesperson has that the motion will be will be designed to ensure that the UK can still get an article 50 extension until 22 May, in line with the conditions set by the EU at last week\u2019s summit. (See 1.10pm.) Oliver Letwin, the Conservative MP behind a series of indicative votes in the Commons has insisted the process could still find a consensus despite Wednesday night\u2019s first attempt ending in deadlock, saying a final collapse of May\u2019s deal would focus minds. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, has said that businesses want MPs to stop \u201cchasing rainbows\u201d and instead pass a Brexit deal. (See 11.25am.) Annual poverty figures published today have shown that the number of poor children living in working families has risen from 67% to 70%. According to an Child Poverty Action Group analysis, the figures also show that there are 200,000 more children living in absolute poverty and 4.1m children in poverty after housing costs are taken into account, meaning 30% of UK children are below the poverty line. Commenting on today\u2019s annual poverty statistics, Alison Garnham, the CPAG, said: Today\u2019s poverty figures make grim reading with more than 4.1m children still in poverty and a jump in the proportion of poor children in working families. Despite high employment, today\u2019s figures reveal that 70% of children living under the poverty line have at least one parent in work. That is not an economy that is working for everyone. A spokesperson for Andrea Leadsom has confirmed that the motion being debated tomorrow will be designed to ensure that the UK can still get an article 50 extension until 22 May, in line with the conditions set by the EU at last week\u2019s summit. The spokesperson said: Tomorrow\u2019s motion will need to be compliant with both the Speaker\u2019s ruling and the EU council\u2019s decision on conditionality relating to exit on 22 May. Discussions are ongoing and we will look to table the motion as soon as possible today, in order to avoid asking for another extension and the requirement to undertake European parliament elections. This is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. The SNP\u2019s Neil Gray asks if tomorrow\u2019s vote will be meaningful vote three. And, if it isn\u2019t, what\u2019s the point? Leadsom says the motion has not been finalised. But it needs to comply with UK law, with the EU summit conclusion, and with the Speaker\u2019s ruling. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on the Leadsom announcement. Tomorrow\u2019s vote will not be the third meaningful vote, Downing Street sources are saying. But they have not commented on suggestions that it might be a vote on the withdrawal agreement on its own. This is what Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said in her opening statement about tomorrow\u2019s Brexit debate. Subject to the House approving the motion on the order paper in the name of the prime minister this evening the business for tomorrow will be Friday March 29 - debate on a motion relating to the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU ... Should the house agree the motion in the name of the prime minister later today it is intended that the hours will be the same as for a normal sitting Friday, with the House sitting at 9.30am and the moment of interruption at 2.30pm. And this is what she said in response to Valerie Vaz, when asked for more information about tomorrow\u2019s debate. If agreed by the house tomorrow there will be a motion relating to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. The motion tabled will comply with the Speaker\u2019s ruling but the only way we ensure we leave in good time on May 22 is by approving the withdrawal agreement by 11pm on March 29, which is tomorrow. The European council has agreed to an extension until May 22 provided the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons this week. It\u2019s crucial we make every effort to give effect to that and to allow the house to debate this important issue. We do not want to be in a situation of asking for another extension and of course for the requirement to undertake European parliament elections. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant says the EU Withdrawal Act says the WA and the PD must be debated together. (See 12.23pm.) If that does not happen tomorrow, tomorrow will be \u201ca complete waste of time\u201d. Leadsom says any vote tomorrow must comply with the EU summit conclusions, as well as with the Speaker\u2019s ruling. She says of course it will comply with the law. Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, asks Leadsom if she will definitely move the motion for the Commons to sit tomorrow. Leadsom refers him back to what she said earlier. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw asks if what Leadsom has announced for tomorrow is meaningful vote three. And he says separating the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration would be \u201cintolerable\u201d and \u201cpotentially illegal\u201d. (See 12.23pm.) He says that would involve asking MPs to vote on a blind Brexit. Leadsom sidesteps the questions, and in her reply she just talks about the importance of honouring the referendum. This is from Graeme Cowie, a Commons clerk specialising in Brexit. Even he doesn\u2019t know what is happening tomorrow. There is speculation that the government might hold a vote just on the withdrawal agreement, instead of on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. The WA is the legally-binding treaty covering the backstop, the \u00a339bn payment to the EU and citizens\u2019 rights. The PD is the much shorter and vague outline for the future trade deal, which is not legally binding. The two documents are part of the same package, and in the two previous meaningful votes, they have been considered together. But the agreement at last week\u2019s EU summit on extending article 50 said that the UK would be allowed to extend until 22 May if the WA gets passed by tomorrow. It did not say when the PD had to pass. In theory passing the WA alone would be much easier. The Labour party has very few objections to the WA; its objections to the deal focus almost entirely on the PD. But, as the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment points out, there is a problem. The EU Withdrawal Act says in section 13 that the WA and the PD must be voted on together. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons is responding to Vaz now. She says any motion brought forward tomorrow will have to be compliant with the Speaker\u2019s ruling. That discussion is still going on. She says she hopes a motion will be laid tomorrow. That implies, again, that the vote will be on the meaningful vote. This is from ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, asks if the vote tomorrow will be meaningful vote three. She says she has not seen the motion for tomorrow. Leadsom says, if the business motion for tomorrow is agreed, the Commons will sit tomorrow from 9.30am until 2.30pm. She says the UK can only get its article 50 extension until 22 May if the deal is passed tomorrow. She says the government intends to comply with the Speaker\u2019s ruling about MPs not voting on the same motion twice. In the Commons Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced that there will be a debate on Brexit tomorrow. But she did not say whether it would be the next meaningful vote. Dominic Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary because he could not support Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, told the BBC what he thought should happen next. Calling for \u201cpragmatism\u201d, he said the UK should go back to Brussels and try again to get legally-binding changes to the backstop \u2013 something that the EU has already ruled out ad nauseam. Failing that, he suggested that what is sometimes described as a \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d might be the way forward. This is what he said: I think this is a time for pragmatism, realism. I know the discussions with the DUP and others are proceeding here at home. One thing I would like to see is us go back to the EU again, keep the arm of friendship open, explain that there is still time for an exchange of letters providing a legally-binding exit from the backstop. I know a lot of people will say, well, the EU just won\u2019t move; that\u2019s been treated as a fixture of these negotiations, rather than being tested. But if they still don\u2019t move, I think we should have sensible conversations over the two weeks we\u2019ve got left over the suite of no-deal arrangements that can be made to mitigate any of the potential damage on either side, to European jobs and livelihoods, but also to UK jobs and livelihoods. And I think if we do all of those things in a spirit of realism and pragmatism, we will find a way through. This is from Daniel Ferrie, from the European commission, quoting Margaritis Schinas, the commission\u2019s chief spokesperson. These are from my colleague Peter Walker, who has been covering David Lidington\u2019s speech at the BCC conference. Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, indicated that he was strongly opposed to no-deal, but did not say how it would be avoided. Another question from below the line. There has been speculation about something like this happening. But there are good reasons an election happening, at least in the way you describe, seems unlikely. 1) Most Conservative MPs don\u2019t want one. They want to elect a new leader first. And, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, MPs would have to vote to trigger one. 2) An election would not necessarily break the deadlock. In fact, it seems quite likely that it would produce another parliament almost as divided as this one. 3) Given the time it would take to hold an election, and the possible time afterwards for a new government to form (coalition talks?), the EU would almost certainly insist on a long article 50 extension, meaning the UK would have to participate in the European election - something to which May and other Tories are strongly opposed. The head of one of Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby groups has called on MPs to stop \u201cchasing rainbows\u201d and avoid no-deal Brexit, warning that severe damage has been caused to companies across the country. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that a \u201cBrexit black hole\u201d has pushed up firms\u2019 costs, lost companies\u2019 orders and put investments on hold, damaging the economy while the risk of no-deal Brexit remains. \u201cThree years going round in circles. Three years is long enough,\u201d he said at the start of the BCC\u2019s annual conference in Westminster. He said there is a firm he speaks to in the West Midlands that has mothballed its flagship project and put some of its assets up for sale because its investors want to move their money, \u201cto a more stable country\u201d. \u201cUncertainty is generating a growing list of business casualties and a litany of rising costs,\u201d he said, adding that MPs must do all that they can to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It cannot be right that we leave in a way where government itself predicts there will be mass disruption to businesses and communities ... A messy and disorderly exit would not just be deeply irresponsible \u2013 it would be a flagrant dereliction of duty. This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. Here is the Evening Standard splash. The full story does not seem to be online yet. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter and vice chair of the European Research Group, is becoming notorious for his lurid hyperbole. He was at it again this morning, saying he would continue vote against Theresa May\u2019s deal even if the whips \u201cput a shotgun in my mouth\u201d. If you are looking for more detail on how MPs voted on indicatives votes last night, this Guardian graphic is excellent. This Institute for Government chart presents the same information in a different format. It has been hard keeping up with Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s position on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. For weeks, as chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory Brexiters pushing for a harder Brexit, he led opposition to it. Yesterday, in an article in the Daily Mail, he apologised to his supporters for changing his mind. He wrote: I apologise for changing my mind. Theresa May\u2019s deal is a bad one, it does not deliver on the promises made in the Tory party manifesto and its negotiation was a failure of statesmanship ... Yet, I am now willing to support it if the Democratic Unionist party does, and by doing so will be accused of infirmity of purpose by some and treachery by others. Then, last night in the Commons, he said he would be happy to support May\u2019s deal, as long as the DUP abstained or voted in favour. And this morning he described himself as being in favour of the deal. He told reporters: I\u2019m in favour of the deal and I hope the DUP will come over to the deal but we\u2019ll have to wait and see what they do ... I don\u2019t think the deal\u2019s suddenly got better, simply that the alternative is now worse. It\u2019s not having any Brexit at all and it\u2019s letting down the 17.4m people who voted to leave. Here\u2019s a good question from BTL ... There is no easy answer to this, and it probably merits a longer response than I can, but it all goes back to first-past-the-post, an electoral system that was supposed to prioritise delivering majority governments at the expense of fairness, and a House of Commons build around an adversarial model, government v opposition. British MPs spend their own careers operating through party; they have little incentive to work \u201cacross the aisle\u201d, as they would say in the US. True, we did have a coalition between 2010 and 2015, but that turned out to be a disaster for one of the parties involved, the Liberal Democrats, and did little to undermine the case against first-past-the-post. If anyone were to reinvent the British constitution from scratch, they would almost certainly choose an alternative model. The devolved legislatures set up within the last 20 years all use more proportional voting systems, and in Edinburgh and Cardiff cross-party cooperation is much more common than at Westminster. Jeremy Corbyn has posted a tweet this morning attacking the SNP. Anyone would think there is a general election is coming soon. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, has responded with this. Faced with constitutional chaos, senior lawyers sought spiritual solace in the Temple Church in central London last night for a choral evensong \u201cto acknowledge Brexit and its challenges\u201d. The ceremony was in the Inns of Courts\u2019 medieval chapel, which was built by the Knights Templar, whose origins are Burgundian, and in which key negotiations over Magna Carta took place. According to the order of service written by Rev Mark Hatcher, it is therefore both \u201can epitome of historic Englishness\u201d and \u201can icon of Britain\u2019s links with the continent of Europe\u201d. The judges and barristers sang the hymn \u2018Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\u2019 with gusto, relishing the refrain: \u2018Forgive our foolish ways, Re-clothe us in our rightful mind.\u2019 Lord Judge of Draycote, the former Lord Chief Justice, delivered the address with the bracing vigour of a judgment from the criminal court of appeal. Brexit, he began, is not \u201can eternal verity\u201d. The country, he warned, is exposed to a \u201cpolitical shambles\u201d while intolerance is on the rise. Declining to indicate which way he voted in the referendum, the retired judge said he was perturbed by the rise of \u201cabsolutist opinions\u201d among those who are \u201cblind\u201d to others\u2019 views and \u201cbelieve they are the only person who is being reasonable\u201d. The referendum itself, he explained, had been a \u201ccardinal error\u201d and a \u201cmortal sin\u201d. Referendums work well in a country like Ireland but not where the majority views are in conflict with the elected assembly, he remarked. As a result it had messed about with our constitution and debased it. Not much forgiveness implied for David Cameron. Perhaps some Anglican high church in Oxfordshire is this morning dusting down its confession box? Damian Green, the Conservative former first secretary of state, told the Today programme this morning that he thought MPs now faced a choice between Theresa May\u2019s deal and a customs union. He told the Today programme: If you want a deal, the choice is now between the government\u2019s deal or a customs union. The customs union was only eight votes off winning yesterday. That\u2019s a slightly softer Brexit than the government\u2019s deal. So that\u2019s the choice that faces MPs, even the most hard Brexit MPs. John Bercow, the Speaker, has given an interview to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica in which he rejected claims that he was biased against Brexit. He said: There was a time when Europhiles, pro-Europeans, used to criticise me years ago for selecting urgent questions from Brexit supporters when they were in a minority. And now the Brexit supporters criticise me for choosing questions or amendments from remainers. So, in other words, at different times, I\u2019ve upset both sides. And, like most Speakers, I think it\u2019s important to give a voice to minorities in the house, not just to the government view or the majority view, but to the minority of the dissident view. Bercow said he was \u201cimpartial in parliament but ... not impartial about parliament\u201d. He went on: If I\u2019m biased, I\u2019m biased in favour of parliament. Parliament being heard. Parliament having a right to speak. Parliament having time. Parliament being respected by the government of the day and indeed by the opposition. So what happens next? Frankly, God knows. We are one day before the date when the UK was supposed to leave the EU, and 15 days away from the revised deadline, and it is harder than ever to see how the government, parliament and the country might escape from the Brexit paralysis. The BBC\u2019s Norman Smith has to ring Number 10 at the crack of dawn for his regular 6.30am round-up on the Today programme (always one of the best upsums available first thing) and, from his Twitter feed, it sounds as if even within the bunker they have given up trying to pretend they know what might happen next. One big decision for Theresa May today will be whether to go ahead with a third vote on her Brexit deal tomorrow. According to Smith, that is starting to look less likely. Here is our overnight story summarising yesterday\u2019s dramatic events, including the announcement from May that she intends to stand down as PM before the next phase of the Brexit process gets underway and the latest votes in the Commons, which saw all eight alternative options being rejected by MPs. But this morning Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister who tabled the amendment that initiated the indicative votes process, told the Today programme that, just because there was no majority for any option last night, that did not mean MPs would not be able to support one on Monday, when another round of indicative votes is due. Stressing that he still hoped May\u2019s deal would be passed, Letwin said: If [May\u2019s deal has not been passed by Monday], then I think people will finally see that that isn\u2019t going to happen by 12 April, and I think quite a lot of Tories who didn\u2019t vote for any of the options because they were, perfectly honourably, taking the view that until they had a last chance to vote for the prime minister\u2019s deal, they did not want to commit themselves to anything else - many abstained, some voted against - may come round and say, \u2018We\u2019ll choose amongst these options.\u2019 So we could get a result ... At some point or other we either have to get her deal across the line or accept that we have to find some alternative if we want to avoid no deal on the 12th, which I think at the moment is the most likely thing to happen ... It is very difficult to translate from how people vote the first time, when they don\u2019t know how other people are voting, to how they will vote when they can see how other people are voting under new circumstances. So I don\u2019t think one should make any assumptions about how it will go on Monday. Letwin also said, if MPs failed to unite around a Brexit plan, the alternative would be no-deal on Friday 12 April. At the moment we are heading for a situation where, under the law, we leave without a deal on the 12th, which many of us think is not a good solution, and the question is \u2018Is parliament on Monday willing to come to any view in the majority about that way forward that doesn\u2019t involve that result?\u2019 And here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 9.45am: The British Chambers of Commerce annual conference opens. The speakers include Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, at 10.15am; Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, at 10.45am; David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister (and de facto deputy PM) at 11.15am; and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, at 1.40pm. After 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, announces next week\u2019s Commons business. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit, and the Conservative party leadership campaign which will now be getting underway. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Sources said Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Amber Rudd, Michael Gove and Matt Hancock are all considering their options, having been urged to run by fellow MPs. Liz Truss, Gavin Williamson, Andrea Leadsom, Stephen Barclay and Penny Mordaunt are also understood to be weighing up leadership bids. With May still struggling to pass her agreement and parliament paralysed over the options, speculation is rife among Conservative MPs about the frontrunners to replace her. There are also numerous backbenchers preparing to throw their hats in the ring, including Boris Johnson, who is backed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the darling of the Tory selectorate. The former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab also has an advanced and organised campaign, with a well-staffed political consultancy helping him, and a Facebook page of \u201cgrassroots\u201d activists with the slogan \u201cReady for Raab\u201d. He has positioned himself as the most hard-Brexit candidate holding out against May\u2019s deal, but a source close to a rival campaign said this would isolate him in the party \u201calong with 15 or so hardcore Eurosceptics that it doesn\u2019t look good to have backing you\u201d. One aide working for one of the frontrunners said \u201caround 20 will run but most people will tuck in quite quickly behind the big players\u201d.

She has not definitively ruled out a campaign for the leadership, but is regarded as a strong potential running mate, particularly for a Brexiter keen to shore up their standing with the party\u2019s remainers. Rudd was spotted having breakfast with Hunt on Wednesday, and a friend said conversations had also taken place with Javid, adding: \u201cShe\u2019s extremely in demand with top-tier candidates.\u201d The friend said Rudd was \u201cvery close\u201d to Johnson, of whom she said in a televised debate during the 2016 EU referendum campaign that he was \u201cnot the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Just when you thought it was safe to come out \u2026 It\u2019s back. And this time it may not be meaningful. But there again, it might be. At business questions, Andrea Leadsom wasn\u2019t at all clear what the government was planning to bring back to the Commons on Friday. Brexit is now a fast-replicating virus that is entirely resistant to everyone\u2019s best efforts to control it and is claiming dozens of victims, the latest being the prime minister herself.</p> <p>Leadsom started by keeping things deliberately vague, hoping no one would pick up on its significance. The government would be having a debate on something to do with leaving the EU and at some point \u2013 hopefully around 2.30pm, so that anyone still breathing could go home and overdose \u2013 MPs would get to vote on it.</p> <p>Understandably, no one was entirely reassured by this unexpected development and pressed her for more information. Which she genuinely didn\u2019t have. The leader of the House had been hung out to dry. And given that she frequently struggles even when she does have a script, she was a sitting target for any opposition MP.</p> <p>\u201cUm,\u201d she said guardedly, playing for time. She couldn\u2019t say precisely just how meaningful the vote would be. Or what it would be on. It might look something like Meaningful Vote 3 or it could be Meaningless Vote 27. It could be Withdrawal Agreement 1. Or it could be W1A. Though maybe it would just help if everyone stopped trying to think in such binary terms.</p> <p>MPs should think of it as Mindfulness Vote One. A new type of zen parliamentary process where everyone took time to concentrate on their breathing and then listened to the voice inside their heads telling them to do exactly what the Leader in Name Only wanted. To emphasise the point, she struck a near perfect Warrior Two yoga pose. She still had it.

      "bodyText": "Just when you thought it was safe to come out \u2026 It\u2019s back. And this time it may not be meaningful. But there again, it might be. At business questions, Andrea Leadsom wasn\u2019t at all clear what the government was planning to bring back to the Commons on Friday. Brexit is now a fast-replicating virus that is entirely resistant to everyone\u2019s best efforts to control it and is claiming dozens of victims, the latest being the prime minister herself. Leadsom started by keeping things deliberately vague, hoping no one would pick up on its significance. The government would be having a debate on something to do with leaving the EU and at some point \u2013 hopefully around 2.30pm, so that anyone still breathing could go home and overdose \u2013 MPs would get to vote on it. Understandably, no one was entirely reassured by this unexpected development and pressed her for more information. Which she genuinely didn\u2019t have. The leader of the House had been hung out to dry. And given that she frequently struggles even when she does have a script, she was a sitting target for any opposition MP. \u201cUm,\u201d she said guardedly, playing for time. She couldn\u2019t say precisely just how meaningful the vote would be. Or what it would be on. It might look something like Meaningful Vote 3 or it could be Meaningless Vote 27. It could be Withdrawal Agreement 1. Or it could be W1A. Though maybe it would just help if everyone stopped trying to think in such binary terms. MPs should think of it as Mindfulness Vote One. A new type of zen parliamentary process where everyone took time to concentrate on their breathing and then listened to the voice inside their heads telling them to do exactly what the Leader in Name Only wanted. To emphasise the point, she struck a near perfect Warrior Two yoga pose. She still had it. Hell, yeah! Sensing she was rather losing her audience, Leadsom became more desperate and played her last card. If MPs couldn\u2019t even manage a Mindfulness Vote One then at least go for Mindlessness Vote One, also known as the Wishful Thinking Vote. Do it for Lino.

The Brexit chaos has vividly displayed the multiple faults of our first-past-the-post system, unresolved by a referendum in which a 52:48 win is represented as \u201cthe will of the people\u201d. Since the second world war under our system British governments have repeatedly achieved a parliamentary majority on the back of an electoral minority. This is the system that Theresa May claimed at the last election would give \u201cstrong and stable government\u201d.</p> <p>What we need now is radical reform of the whole system, starting with the abolition of single-member constituencies and first past the post. These ensure that election results are always distorted and deny real choice to electors. If you were a Brexiter Tory in Beaconsfield you had no choice at the last election but to vote for Dominic Grieve. In neighbouring High Wycombe, a Tory remainer had no choice but to vote for Steve Baker. What a ludicrous denial of true choice! Yet the same lack of choice is characteristic of seats right across parliament, whichever party has won a constituency.</p> <p>The single transferable vote works. The Irish have proved that it is perfectly simple for voters to understand. It would not simply smash the present discredited system but replace it with one that gives proportional representation among parties, and power back where it belongs \u2013 to the electors. It would make individual MPs answerable not just to their party members but to all their electors. Its introduction would begin the process of fundamental reform vital to long-term political recovery. <br><strong>Robert W Bradnock</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is right that it will be difficult for many MPs to take the kind of steps necessary for dismantling archaic practices \u2013 becoming independents, disobeying the whips, or even leaving their party for good. That is why Compassion in Politics believes it is so important for us to get back to basics and to establish clear common values across parliament that most politicians can work towards. And while we\u2019re honoured that many politicians have already joined our cause, the work begins when we put our plans to the test in parliament. That will see us propose a new bill to ensure all future legislation improves the wellbeing of the most vulnerable and protects future generations \u2013 a simple, but we hope effective, way of re-establishing the social<strong> </strong>concrete and giving MPs who are currently living life in a tailspin a new sense of direction.<br><strong>Matt Hawkins</strong><br><em>Co-founder, Compassion in Politics</em></p> <p>\u2022 So Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed an observation from a fellow Tory as \u201ccharacteristically Wykehamist\u201d (Old school ties: Rees-Mogg\u2019s intervention, 28 March). The Wykehamist fallacy is a trap to which British diplomats were said to be prone, namely the mistaken belief that the intentions of others could be always trusted as if they shared the values of someone who might have been educated at Winchester (ie a Wykehamist).

High standards of professional behaviour are maintained in the medical profession by the General Medical Council. Perhaps the MPs\u2019 code of conduct should be strengthened and become active in enforcing its principles of a high standard of conduct in public life. It would need to remove from public office ministers who waste public money while damaging our prison, probation and transport services or who have squandered millions on a vanity bridge project, make racist comments about Muslim women or use false information in a referendum campaign. Doing this might help restore confidence in the majority of MPs who do maintain high standards of behaviour in public life.

The hope is that some MPs from other parties could switch sides if they are not voting on the political declaration, which has been rejected by Labour because it does not say the UK will remain in a customs union. May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, appeared to hint at this by urging MPs to back the withdrawal agreement irrespective of their opinions about the latter. \u201cIf you believe in delivering the referendum result by leaving the EU with a deal then it is necessary to back the withdrawal agreement,\u201d he told the British Chambers of Commerce conference in London. \u201cWhether a particular MP wants the final destination to look like Norway or look like Canada or look like the proposals in the Chequers white paper, the starting point is the withdrawal agreement itself.\u201d Some Labour MPs have been approached by Conservative whips about the plan to split the withdrawal agreement and political declaration. However, Labour said it could not vote for leaving the EU without an idea of where the UK was heading in its relationship. The government is also contemplating the move in order to secure a longer extension to article 50, as the EU only requires the passing of the withdrawal agreement to move the exit date from April 12 to May 22. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, warned MPs that the Tory leadership contest meant it could be a \u201cBoris Johnson Brexit, a Jacob Rees-Mogg Brexit, or a Michael Gove Brexit\u201d.

That cannot be acceptable and Labour will not vote for it.\u201d No 10 also acknowledges that the withdrawal agreement and political declaration would both ultimately have to be passed through parliament in order to leave the EU. The chances of the deal making it through the House of Commons remain slim, with at least 20 and probably more like 30 Eurosceptics still holding out. Boris Johnson, the Tory leadership hopeful who had said he would reluctantly support the deal, said it was \u201cdead anyway\u201d, and others joined the list of those who will not vote for it, including Adam Afriyie, Bernard Jenkin, Bill Cash and Dominic Raab. Raab, another leadership contender, positioned himself as the \u201cno-deal\u201d candidate on Thursday by urging May to \u201cgo back to the EU again\u201d to press for changes to the deal, which Brussels has already ruled out.

A party source said on Thursday there were \u201cno talks today\u201d, fuelling speculation they had been shelved entirely. But despite the ominous signs for May\u2019s deal, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told MPs they would sit on Friday to debate a government motion on Brexit again.

The DUP\u2019s main objection is to the backstop, the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d designed to avoid the return of border checkpoints in the event a future trade deal is not agreed.

      "bodyText": "A few days before the 2015 general election, the prime minister, David Cameron, tweeted: \u201cBritain faces an inescapable choice \u2013 strong and stable government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.\u201d Cameron won (the first general election the Tories have won outright since 1992), followed through on his pledge to hold a referendum on staying in the European Union, promised not to resign if he lost, lost and then resigned as chaos ensued. Theresa May took over after all other challengers either fell on their swords, stabbed each other in the back, or put their foot in their mouths. It is as good a time as any to recall that, of all the jokers and hucksters standing for the Conservative party leadership, she was probably the best candidate. It really could have been worse. It could have been Andrea Leadsom. May insisted she would not call a snap election, called a snap election promising strong and stable government, lost her majority, and has presided over a weak and unstable government. Her sole achievement has been to negotiate a deal with the EU that has twice been overwhelmingly rejected in parliament. Yesterday she presented her party with an ultimatum: if it accepts the deal it doesn\u2019t want, it can get rid of the leader it doesn\u2019t like. Depending on the interpretation of a 415-year-old precedent by the House Speaker, John Bercow, and some procedural shenanigans, this may be how our trading and political relationship with Europe is settled: we are not so much leaving the EU as falling out head first. Yesterday\u2019s events in parliament illustrated four things about our politics and the Brexit process that are now unavoidable. The first, and most evident, is that the Conservative party is not fit to govern. Let us leave aside for a moment its mendacious policies that pauperise the vulnerable and deport the eligible. Morally its agenda is contemptible; and from Windrush to trains to universal credit its incompetence is undeniable. But even if the Conservatives were decent and effective, as a simple matter of capacity they are no longer even low-functioning \u2013 they are not viable. Terrified of their own members and overwhelmed with internal rivalry, they cannot run themselves let alone the country. Their divisions are multiple and irreconcilable. (True, many say the same about Labour. But there are two important distinctions: Labour did not get us into this mess; and it has a far more plausible plan to get us out of it.) The Tories lack discipline, direction, cohesion, coherence, substance, stature and credibility. They haven\u2019t got a clue and they have no idea how to get one. With May\u2019s promised resignation we will see the baton yet again pass from one failure to the next, each abdicating responsibility for the legacy they bequeath, none claiming ownership for the calamity they have wrought. This is not just a question of politics, but personnel. Take a look at those poised with indecent haste to replace May, and it is clear what a shallow and shabby bench they are drawing from. A contest in which Michael Gove is favourite, and Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are being seriously considered, owes more to reality TV than a party that wants to run the country with any serious intent. Things could get worse. Second, we now have to have a second referendum. I have come to that conclusion belatedly and reluctantly. The first referendum was a mistake. But you can\u2019t just support outcomes when they support you. Remain lost. There is a contemptuous sense of entitlement and condescension among a hard core of remain advocates that is not only deeply problematic but utterly counter-productive. That said, a narrow majority for a notion is not the same as a mandate for a plan: we voted to leave, and nearly three years later we clearly don\u2019t know how. Parliament has voted no to all the proposals it put before itself.

There is no guarantee a second referendum will produce a clearer result, but at least that will be on us, and we will be voting in full knowledge of what we are up against. Third, we need a general election. This is no longer a purely partisan point made in the hope of a Labour government. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. For the sake of our hospitals, schools and welfare alone Britain needs Labour in power. But the necessity of an election now transcends party advantage. As a practical matter this parliament is not working.

The beleaguered prime minister, whose authority has been shattered by the double rejection of her deal and the humiliation of a delay to Brexit day, made the offer to Tory backbenchers at a packed meeting in parliament. It came as MPs held backbench-led \u201cindicative votes\u201d on eight alternative Brexit options, including no deal, a referendum, a customs union and a Norway-style deal \u2013 none of which secured a majority. May told her party\u2019s backbench 1922 Committee: \u201cI have heard very clearly the mood of the parliamentary party. I know there is a desire for a new approach \u2013 and new leadership \u2013 in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations, and I won\u2019t stand in the way of that.\u201d She added: \u201cI am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party.\u201d Her high-stakes pledge came on another dramatic day in Westminster, as: \u2022 Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith led a stream of Eurosceptics to support May\u2019s deal. \u2022 MPs failed to coalesce around an alternative to the deal in a series of \u201cindicative votes\u201d. \u2022 Labour\u2019s divisions on Brexit were exposed, as three members of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet defied the whip to resist backing a second referendum. \u2022 The DUP threw May\u2019s chances of getting her deal through parliament into doubt by saying its MPs would not support it. The prime minister had hoped to remain in No 10 after exit day, and build a legacy that extended beyond the humiliations of the Brexit talks to domestic policy. But if the withdrawal agreement is passed and Britain leaves the EU in eight weeks\u2019 time, she could now be gone before the summer \u2013 after just three years in the top job. Three ministers resigned on Monday to back an amendment tabled by a cross-bench group of MPs led by the Tory former minister Oliver Letwin to test the backing for alternatives to the prime minister\u2019s deal. On Wednesday night, Letwin said it was \u201ca great matter of disappointment\u201d that no majority had emerged for any of the eight options debated that day.

May was forced to give her MPs a free vote \u2013 and instructed her cabinet to abstain \u2013 rather than suffer a string of resignations from ministers keen to signal their support for alternatives. The government had earlier tried and failed to stop the indicative vote process happening altogether, by whipping MPs to reject the business motion kicking off the debate. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said: \u201cThe results of the process this House has gone through today strengthens our view that the deal the government has negotiated is the best option.\u201d Ministers now hope to make a third attempt to ram May\u2019s deal through the House of Commons on Friday \u2013 though their prospects of success were thrown into doubt after the DUP said its 10 MPs would vote against it. The prime minister had been under intense pressure to set out a timetable for her departure, as the leave-supporting wing of her party continued to resist supporting her deal, which was defeated by a majority of 149 earlier this month. Outside the 1922 meeting, the Tory MP Simon Hart, who leads the Brexit Delivery Group, said: \u201cShe made it very clear: I want the next prime minister to be one of the colleagues in there tonight, not down the corridor at the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] meeting.\u201d The response from MPs was \u201crespectful recognition for her hard work and service, not celebration\u201d, he said.

But ministers were considering plans to hold the first reading of the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 giving MPs a vote on the flagship bill implementing the deal, rather than a similar motion. May had already been widely expected to face a fresh challenge once the year-long breathing space she secured by defeating a no-confidence vote last December expired. Several cabinet ministers and a clutch of backbenchers have been making thinly disguised pitches for the premiership in recent months, with collective responsibility all but breaking down as rival contenders ensure that their views become known. The frontrunners will be Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove, but the range of candidates is likely to be wider. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, responded to the prime minister\u2019s promised departure by calling for a general election. \u201cA change of government can\u2019t be a Tory stitch-up \u2013 the people must decide,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 March 2019.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to the threat of Islamist terrorism, no one doubts the role of radicalisation. The internet, hate preachers such as Anjem Choudary and Abu Hamza, and the western-armed, extremism-exporting state of Saudi Arabia: all play their part in radicalising the impressionable. When it comes to the far right, however, this consensus is absent. The reason for this is as obvious as it is chilling: the hate preachers, recruiting sergeants and useful idiots of rightwing extremism are located in the heart of the British, European and American establishments. They are members of the political and media elite. Less than two weeks ago, dozens of Muslims were murdered in Christchurch. Before the lethal rampage, the shooter is said to have inscribed \u201cFor Rotherham\u201d on one of his gun magazines \u2013 in reference to the English town\u2019s grooming scandal. In Britain, far-right terrorist attackers have ranged from David Copeland, who detonated a nail-bomb in a Soho gay pub in 1999 after decades of media hatemongering against LGBT people, to the murderer of Jo Cox, to Darren Osborne, who ploughed his van into worshippers outside a mosque. As one radicalisation expert, Abdul-Azim Ahmed, of the Centre for the Study of Islam in the UK at Cardiff University told ITV news, Osborne\u2019s extremism \u201calso came from the mainstream media. It came from mainstream politicians both here and abroad.\u201d Days before the Christchurch atrocity, I interviewed Tore Bekkedal, a young Norwegian socialist. In 2011 he survived a massacre of his friends at the hands of the far-right terrorist Anders Breivik by hiding in a toilet. For 90 minutes, he heard the shots and the screams of 69 people being murdered. \u201cI call it the \u2018Hurricane Breivik\u2019,\u201d he told me, \u201cbecause people are more comfortable treating it as a natural disaster.\u201d The anti-immigration Progress party (Fremskrittspartiet) is now a junior partner in Norway\u2019s coalition government, he notes. As newspapers such as the Telegraph noted at the time, Breivik\u2019s justification for his slaughter was to make \u201ca future Europe safe from the tyranny of cultural Marxism and of Islam\u201d. This week the Tory former Brexit minister Suella Braverman declared: \u201cWe are engaged in a war against cultural Marxism.\u201d When my colleague Dawn Foster challenged her, noting the phrase\u2019s far-right antecedents, including its link to Breivik, Braverman doubled down. As the Board of Deputies of British Jews put it, \u201cthe term \u2018cultural Marxist\u2019 has a history as an antisemitic trope\u201d. This is correct, but Braverman did not have to voyage into the darkest recesses of the internet to happen on the phrase. \u201cCultural Marxism is running rampant,\u201d wrote Sunday Telegraph editor Allister Heath last year. Other writers who have deployed the term include Sherelle Jacobs, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s assistant comment editor; the newspaper also published an anonymous civil servant who said: \u201cThere is a strong presence of Anglophobia, combined with cultural Marxism that runs through the civil service.\u201d Or consider the Times, supposedly a paper of record, which has published Tim Montgomerie bemoaning the prospering of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d. Or Rod Liddle in the Sunday Times, who believes young Britons are brainwashed by the \u201cdelusions of cultural Marxism\u201d. It\u2019s not clear whether these people were aware of the phrase\u2019s loaded nature \u2013 they surely should have been more careful \u2013 but many readers would certainly have heard a dog whistle. As Britain\u2019s own counter-terrorism chief said last week, mainstream newspapers are helping to radicalise the far right with irresponsible reporting. This should be self-evident, but sometimes stating the obvious is a revolutionary act. Much of the British press incites hatred against minorities, not in fringe mosques or on street corners, but to millions of people. \u201cMuslims tell British: Go to hell\u201d proclaimed one Daily Express front page. Or consider a front page of the Sun, which declared that \u201c1 in 5 Brit Muslims\u201d had sympathy for jihadists, accompanied by a picture of \u201cJihadi John\u201d wielding a knife.

the necessary changes we seek to the backstop have not been secured between the government and the European Union, and the remaining and ongoing strategic risk that Northern Ireland would be trapped in backstop arrangements at the end of the implementation period, we will not be supporting the government if they table a fresh meaningful vote.</p> \n   <p>The backstop, if operational, has the potential to create an internal trade border within the United Kingdom and would cut us off from our main internal market, being Great Britain.</p> \n   <p>We want to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from, and our future relationship with, the European Union on terms that accord with our key objectives to ensure the integrity of the United Kingdom. </p> \n   <p>In our view the current withdrawal agreement does not do so and the backstop, which we warned this government against from its first inception, poses an unacceptable threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom and will inevitably limit the United Kingdom\u2019s ability to negotiate on the type of future relationship with the EU. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The DUP statement does not say whether the party will abstain, or vote against the deal, but the reference to the backstop being \u201can unacceptable threat\u201d to the union implies the latter.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

But the date also needs to be changed in the EU Withdrawal Act, which repeals the European Communities Act 1972. Walker said if the EU Withdrawal Act were not amended, there would be legal confusion.</p> \n  <p>The statutory instrument needs to be passed by both the Commons and the Lords. In the Lords peers passed it earlier today, without a division, but some Brexiter peers did complain about the need for a delay.</p> \n  <p>The former Conservative cabinet minister <strong>Lord Forsyth </strong>said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is not a very pleasant place we find ourselves in and it has come about because there has been a conspiracy by remainers.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A 52-48 vote was certainly not an instruction for a disastrous no-deal, or a hard Canada-style job-destroying Brexit. It was an instruction to move house but to stay in the same neighbourhood ...</p> \n   <p>It is worth remembering what Nigel Farage told a Question Time audience in 2016. \u2018I hear people say\u2019 he said: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be terrible if we were like Norway or Switzerland. Really? They are rich, they are happy and they are self-governing countries\u2019.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Backing the same amendment, <strong>Nick Boles</strong> said he wanted to make the case for compromise.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Not as something cowardly but as something courageous. In a divided country and a divided parliament, finding and sustaining a compromise that most people can support is a noble endeavour. </p> \n   <p>After years of paralysing conflict we have moral duty to open our minds this afternoon and reach for a compromise that will allow us to put the interminable Brexit row behind us.</p> \n   <p>The great strength of the common market 2.0 proposal relative to all other Brexit compromises is that it offers something important and valuable to everyone and every party in this house.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-27T17:08:28.033Z\">at 5.08pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c9ba9d7e4b0347f70e74b8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-27T16:52:15.887Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Theresa May is due to address the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee at 5pm.

I have a question. Much is being made of the need for the PM to bring the ERG around to voting for her deal, and how their support is crucial. Isn't this only half the picture? Won't the staunchly Remain tories vote against her deal regardless, and so May won't have the numbers even with the ERG, DUP and the odd Labour straggler?</p>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The remain Tories are less important, because there are fewer of them, but almost a dozen of them have voted against May\u2019s deal, and so they do count.</p> \n  <p>My colleague<strong> Rowena Mason</strong> has been looking at the numbers that May needs in more detail. She has sent me this summary of the PM\u2019s situation.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The magic number that Theresa May needs for her deal is 320 votes. It means she could get the withdrawal agreement over the line if she had:</p> \n   <p>- 303 out of 313 Conservative MPs</p> \n   <p>- 10 DUP MPs</p> \n   <p>- 7 Labour and Independent MPs who have already backed her deal</p> \n   <p>So unless she gets more Labour abstentions or votes, she can only afford to lose 10 Tory votes. This means it is still looking extremely tight for her \u2013 even assuming the eventual backing of Eurosceptic big beasts like Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the DUP.</p> \n   <p>There are currently six or seven Tory MPs (eg Justine Greening and Sam Gyimah) who want a second referendum and therefore guaranteed to vote down May\u2019s deal come what may. And there are undoubtedly more than a dozen Tory Eurosceptic MPs who currently say they are still immovably opposed \u2013 like Andrea Jenkyns, Steve Baker, Crispin Blunt and Julian Lewis.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-27T14:54:08.030Z\">at 2.54pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c9b87e4e4b09fe67e8226d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-27T14:42:40.757Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is a question from BTL, or two.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/127373153\"> \n   <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n    <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n     <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100476708\" title=\"View Toshack10\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/100476708\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Toshack10\"> </a> \n    </div> \n    <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n     <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100476708\" title=\"View Toshack10\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Toshack10</span> </a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/127373153\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">27 March 2019 11:00am</a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n      <p>@Andrew<br>2 Questions...<br>1. You posted on Monday night that the orders for today had also called for Monday to be given over to Parliamentary business rather than Government business. Is there anything to stop them repeating that process into Tuesday or some other day next week?<br>2. Peston last night on ITV suggested that the AG and Cabinet Secretary were of the view that anything that Parliament does decide (seems a long way off, I know) would be binding on the Executive. So if the votes ended up with - let's say - Revoke, she'd be obliged to go to Brussels and do that - or be in contempt (again) etc</p> \n      <p>Thanks v much - your work is greatly appreciated. </p> \n      <p>Obscure, Constitutional issues I know but quite pertinent here.</p>\n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </figure> \n  <p>1) No, nothing at all. In theory the process could be self-perpetuating. That is why it alarms the government so much \u2013 even though Oliver Letwin did say earlier that, after Monday, if ministers were to accept what the Commons proposes, there would be no need for him to seize the order paper on any more days.</p> \n  <p>2) I did not see Peston\u2019s report, but there is a write-up of it <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-03-26/prime-minister-would-break-the-law-if-she-ignores-letwin-result/\">here.</a></p> \n  <p>Whether the PM would be bound by the vote would depend on the precise wording. Normally Commons motions are not binding on the government. But some categories of motions are considered binding \u2013 eg, \u201chumble address\u201d ones, and also, I think, ones that require or order (\u201cmandate\u201d, to use Peston\u2019s word) the government to do something.</p> \n  <p>But these votes would not necessarily be legally binding, in the sense of capable of being enforced by a court. To bind the hands of the government in that way, MPs would have to pass legislation.</p> \n  <p>It would be interesting to read the Sedwill/Cox advice. I\u2019m sure they know more than me. But the Peston story talks about May possibly being in breach of the ministerial code if she failed to follow an instruction of parliament. That may be the case, but the person ultimately in charge of deciding whether or not a minister has broken the ministerial code is \u2013 the PM herself.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-27T14:53:04.235Z\">at 2.53pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c9b84b5e4b0a127cdabdc78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/heatherstewart\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-27T14:14:46.444Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the party would whip for Margaret Beckett\u2019s \u201cconfirmatory public vote\u201d option \u2013 as well as Gareth Snell\u2019s and Ken Clarke\u2019s, calling for a customs union, and of course the one setting out Labour\u2019s own Brexit policy.</p> \n  <p>And he said whips would be \u201cencouraging\u201d Labour MPs to support common market 2.0, the cross-party proposal drawn up by Stephen Kinnock, among others.</p> \n  <p>The spokesman then embarked on a long justification of Labour\u2019s support for a referendum \u2013 which has sparked a backlash, and could yet result in resignations tonight.

The Speaker, John Bercow, will announce which ones will be put to a vote, probably when the debate proper starts at about 3pm.</p> \n  <p>You can read them all on <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190327.pdf\">the order paper here (pdf).</a></p> \n  <p>And here is a Press Association guide to what they all are.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong><em>Labour plan </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Labour has tabled a motion proposing its plan for a close economic relationship with the EU. The plan includes a comprehensive customs union with a UK say on future trade deals; close alignment with the single market; matching new EU rights and protections; participation in EU agencies and funding programmes; and agreement on future security arrangements, including access to the European arrest warrant. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Common market 2.0 </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Tabled by Conservatives Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Andrew Percy and Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, Lucy Powell and Diana Johnson. The motion proposes UK membership of the European free trade association and European Economic Area. It allows continued participation in the single market and a \u201ccomprehensive customs arrangement\u201d with the EU after Brexit, which would remain in place until the agreement of a wider trade deal which guarantees frictionless movement of goods and an open border in Ireland. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Confirmatory public vote </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Drawn up by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson and tabled by former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett with the backing of scores of MPs across the House, this motion would require a public vote to confirm any Brexit deal passed by parliament before its ratification. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Customs union </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Requires a commitment to negotiate a \u201cpermanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU\u201d in any Brexit deal. Tabled by veteran Conservative Europhile Ken Clarke, backed by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, Helen Goodman and chair of the Commons Brexit committee Hilary Benn and Tory former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Sarah Newton. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Malthouse compromise Plan A </em></strong></p> \n   <p>A cross-party proposal calls for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to be implemented with the controversial \u201cbackstop\u201d for the Irish border replaced by alternative arrangements. Backed by Conservatives from both the leave and remain wings of the party, including Nicky Morgan, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Damian Green, Steve Baker and Sir Graham Brady, as well as the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds and Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Revoke article 50 </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Under this plan, if the government has not passed its withdrawal agreement, it would have to stage a vote on a no-deal Brexit two sitting days before the scheduled date of departure. If MPs refuse to authorise no-deal, the prime minister would be required to halt Brexit by revoking article 50. The motion, tabled by the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry, has been signed by 33 MPs including the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw and all 11 members of the Independent Group. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Revocation instead of no deal </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Under this plan, the government is called on to \u201curgently\u201d bring forward any legislation needed to revoke article 50 \u201cin the event that the house fails to approve any withdrawal agreement four days before the end of the article 50 period\u201d. It has been signed by 28 MPs, including the SNP\u2019s Angus Brendan MacNeil and Tory MP Ken Clarke. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>New customs union </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Tabled by Labour\u2019s MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, Gareth Snell, this motion simply states that it should be the government\u2019s objective to implement a trade agreement including a customs union with the EU. It mirrors an amendment to the trade bill secured by Labour peers in the House of Lords. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>EEA/EFTA without customs union </em></strong></p> \n   <p>A motion tabled by Conservative MP George Eustice \u2013 who quit as agriculture minister this month to fight for Brexit \u2013 proposes remaining within the EEA and rejoining Efta, but remaining outside a customs union with the EU. The motion was also signed by Conservative MPs including former minister Nicky Morgan and head of the Brexit Delivery Group Simon Hart. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>No deal </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Backed by Conservative MPs John Baron, David Amess, Martin Vickers and Stephen Metcalfe, the motion proposes leaving the European Union without a deal on April 12. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Unilateral right of exit from backstop </em></strong></p> \n   <p>The same four Tory MPs, as well as Andrew Percy and Neil Parish, have also backed a motion to leave the EU on May 22 with the PM\u2019s withdrawal agreement amended to allow the UK to unilaterally exit the Northern Ireland backstop. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Consent of devolved institutions </em></strong></p> \n   <p>Backed by SNP MPs including Ian Blackford, Kirsty Blackman and Stephen Gethins, this motion requires an agreement that the UK will not leave without a deal, and that no action for leaving the EU will be taken without a consent motion passed in both the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. </p> \n   <p><strong>Contingent preferential arrangements </strong></p> \n   <p>A group of Conservative MPs, including Marcus Fysh, Steve Baker and Priti Patel, have signed a motion that calls for the government to seek to agree preferential trade arrangements with the EU, in case the UK is unable to implement a withdrawal agreement with the bloc. </p> \n   <p><strong>Contingent reciprocal arrangements </strong></p> \n   <p>A similar group of Tory MPs have backed a proposal calling for the government to \u201cat least reciprocate the arrangements put in place by the EU and or its member states to manage the period following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU\u201d, in case the UK is unable to implement a withdrawal agreement. </p> \n   <p><strong><em>Respect the referendum results </em></strong></p> \n   <p>A cross-party proposal, signed by 94 MPs including the Conservatives\u2019 Will Quince, Labour\u2019s Frank Field and the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds, urges the house to \u201creaffirm its commitment to honour the result of the referendum that the UK should leave the European Union\u201d.</p> \n   <p><strong><em>Constitutional and accountable government</em></strong></p> \n   <p>Tabled by Sir Bill Cash and other Tory Brexiters, this backs leaving the EU, rejects the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement and proposes changing Commons standing orders so that a two-thirds majority would be needed to allow any fresh attempt to allow indicative votes debates to take precedence over government business on any given day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-27T14:59:46.013Z\">at 2.59pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c9b35b2e4b0a127cdabd906\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-27T09:33:09.473Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs to vote on alternative plans as speculation mounts May could announce decision to quit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning. We are two days before the date originally set for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU and in the Commons they have gone back to the drawing board, holding a debate and votes on up to 16 alternative Brexit plans. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/26/public-think-government-has-not-handled-brexit-well-study\">And 7% of people still think the government is handling this process well.</a></p> \n  <p>Here is our overnight preview story.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/26/tory-brexiters-want-may-resignation-date-in-order-to-back-deal\">Tory Brexiters want May resignation date in order to back deal</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here are the main developments this morning.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has said the government hopes to be able to hold a third vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal later this week.</strong> In an interview on the Today programme she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that there is a real possibility that it does. We are completely determined to make sure that we can get enough support to bring it back.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Leadsom refused to comment on <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6853815/Theresa-announce-TOMORROW-shell-quit-weeks-Tory-MPs-agree-Brexit-deal.html\">speculation that May could tell Tory MPs tonight that she will stand down as prime minister if her deal gets passed.</a> </strong>\u201cI am fully supporting the prime minister to get us out of the European Union,\u201d Leadsom said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has said that Labour could have difficulty backing a plan for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit agreement.</strong> The amendment was originally drawn up by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, but is on <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190327.pdf\">today\u2019s order paper</a> with Dame Margaret Beckett as the lead signatory. In an interview on the Today programme, Gardiner said that if Labour voted for it, that could suggest it was a remain party, which was not the case. He said, under the terms of the motion, a referendum could be a choice between May\u2019s deal or staying in the EU. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It would be saying we could accept what we have always said is a very bad deal. Therefore it looks as if the attempt to have a public vote on it is simply a way of trying to remain because nobody likes this deal.</p> \n   <p>To put that up as the only alternative in a public vote and say we will let it go through looks as though you believe that at the end of it remain would be the result. </p> \n   <p>It is not where our policy has been. Our policy is clearly that we would support a public vote to stop no-deal or to stop a bad deal, but not that we would allow a bad deal as long as the public had the opportunity to reject Brexit altogether. </p> \n   <p>That implies that you are a remain party. The Labour party is not a remain party now. We have accepted the result of the referendum.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But earlier<strong> Peter Kyle </strong>told the same programme that Jeremy Corbyn would order Labour MPs to back the Beckett amendment. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Corbyn] will order MPs to vote for this. We had a really constructive process of engaging with him. At no point was he instinctively against this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative MP who tabled the amendment that set up today\u2019s indicative votes process, said that if the government ignored the plan backed by most MPs, the Commons could legislate to force it to respond. </strong>He said that he did not expect there to be a majority for any one idea today, but that on Monday, when there is due to be another indicative votes debate, MPs could unite behind one plan. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If on Monday one or more propositions get a majority backing in the House of Commons, then we will have to work with the government to implement them.</p> \n   <p>The way I would hope it would happen under those circumstances is that we would have sensible, workmanlike discussions across the House of Commons and the government would move forward in an orderly fashion. </p> \n   <p>If the government didn\u2019t agree to that, then those who I am working with across the parties will move to legislate to mandate the government - if we can obtain majorities in the House of Commons and House of Lords for that - to carry that forward.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has said the almost 6 million people who have signed the revoke article 50 petition should not be ignored.</strong> Speaking in a debate in the European parliament, he criticised those who say it would be unacceptable for the UK to have a long article 50 extension because it would have to hold European elections. He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me be clear, such thinking is unacceptable. </p> \n   <p>You cannot betray the six million people who signed the petition to revoke article 50, the one million people who marched for a people\u2019s vote, or the increasing majority of people who want to remain in the European Union. </p> \n   <p>They may feel that they are not sufficiently represented by their UK parliament, but they must feel that they are represented by you in this chamber because they are Europeans.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/government-rejects-petition-to-cancel-brexit-signed-by-58-million-people\">The government has formally responded to the revoke article 50 petition,</a> </strong>saying no. It says: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This government will not revoke article 50. We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leading Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, has used <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6853609/JACOB-REES-MOGG-Im-ready-Theresa-Mays-deal.html\">an article in the Daily Mail </a>to apologise to his supporters for changing his mind on May\u2019s Brexit deal</strong>.

      "bodyText": "ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt has also issued a prediction for what might happen next. I will wrap this up now. Here a short summary of today\u2019s developments: All eight alternative Brexit proposals MPs voted on tonight in indicative votes were rejected by parliament. Sir Oliver Letwin, who is responsible for these indicative votes, said in the Commons immediately after the results were read out that this had been expected, and that the indicative votes were a \u201ctwo-step process\u201d that would deliver more decisive support for some of the proposals in a second day of voting on Monday, which Speaker John Bercow has allowed. Theresa May told Tory MPs this afternoon that she would resign if her withdrawal agreement gets approved by parliament in a third meaningful vote (MV3). However, before her announcement, Speaker John Bercow reiterated in the Commons that he would not allow another vote on the same deal unless it is substantially amended. The DUP has confirmed that it will not support May\u2019s deal if it comes back for a third vote, and that none of its MPs will abstain, making it highly unlikely that Theresa May\u2019s deal could get enough votes to pass. Boris Johnson has said he will now support May\u2019s deal, which many interpret as a sign that he wants to replace her as PM if she resigns. That\u2019s all from me, goodnight. This is a good summary of today\u2019s events. Earlier, Sky\u2019s Kate McCann had pondered the possibility of a DUP split over whether to back May\u2019s deal or not. This is her comment on the matter since the votes: The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon has summarised Theresa May\u2019s limbo like this: The trouble for Theresa May, as of tonight, is this: She has promised Tory Brexiters to resign if her deal gets through parliament, implying the caveat that if it fails, she plans to cling on. Unfortunately she made a remark in the Commons on March 20, where she said: \u201cAs prime minister I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30.\u201d Many pundits were interpreting that sentence as a hint that she would step down if the failure of her deal would prompt MPs to push for a longer extension beyond June 30 - an option Donald Tusk has not ruled out. This means that if she were to stand by her word, the PM is definitely resigning, whether her deal goes ahead (her promise today) or not (long extension, most likely). Perhaps Speaker John Bercow, who has restated tonight that he won\u2019t allow a third meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement unless its modified, will deliver a solution to the PM\u2019s dilemma. James Forsyth, the Spectator\u2019s political editor, has just made a prediction on what might happen next: Compared to the Tory whip however, the Labour whip looks almost muscly. This from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam: Labour\u2019s Barry Gardiner, who told BBC Radio 4 this morning that Labour was \u201cnot a Remain party\u201d, is apparently not the only person who needs to get to know his party better, if one is to believe Owen Smith MP. But it is not only the Tory party that is battling an internal crisis: 27 Labour MPs defied the three-line whip tonight and voted against the second referendum proposal tabled by Margaret Beckett. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow housing minister, Melanie Onn, has resigned. Read the full story written by my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot. Jacob-Rees Mogg meanwhile seems to have done a U-Turn re May\u2019s deal, for which he only expressed support in today\u2019s Daily Mail. This from Paul Brand, ITV News\u2019 political correspondent: Criticising the sudden support of hardline Brexiters like Boris Johnson for Theresa May\u2019s deal, now that she has offered to quit when it passes, is another popular activity tonight. Here the SMP\u2019s Jamie Hepburn: \u201cThe future of Theresa May should not be what we are focussing on tonight, the future of our country is what we should be focussing on.\u201d This is Gary Lineker\u2019s message to Boris Johnson: If you enjoy mingling with many immensely frustrated people, I suggest you go on Twitter now. Earlier in the Commons much jeering, such as \u201cridiculous waste of time, crazy, crazy\u201d, was heard when Sir Oliver Letwin tried to defend the indicative votes and bringing the rejected proposals back again for more votes on Monday. Many similar sentiments are aired elsewhere tonight. This from Stephen Bush, political editor at the New Statesman: Labour MP Jess Phillips reacts to Theresa May\u2019s attempt to get Tory Brexiters to back her deal by promising to resign. This from Conservative peer Andrew Lansley: Various MPs and pundits have rushed to point out that two of the eight proposals that failed in the Commons tonight, Ken Clarke\u2019s Customs Union and Dame Margaret Beckett\u2019s Confirmatory Public Vote, got in fact more \u201cayes\u201d than the PM\u2019s deal. This from Labour and Cooperative MP Anneliese Dodds: This from the People\u2019s Vote campaign: This from Labour peer Andrew Adonis: Evening everyone. Another frankly astonishing day in the Commons is now coming to an end. I\u2019ll be gathering some reactions to today\u2019s indicative votes - which thus far have resulted in not much more than a line from Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d (see all those \u201cnoes\u201d on the Guardian splash) - and to May\u2019s promise to step down if her withdrawal agreement passes parliament. Whatever you\u2019re drinking tonight, I won\u2019t judge you. Here is the Guardian splash. And that\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Jedidaja Otte is taking over now. These are from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. Speaker John Bercow reads out the results of the eight indicative votes \u2013 all of which were defeated. Here is our main story on the results of the indicative votes ballot. Here is the full text of what Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said in his point of order after the results were announced. The house has today considered a wide variety of options as a way forward. And it demonstrates that there are no easy options here. There is no simple way forward. The deal the government has negotiated is a compromise, both with the EU and with members across this house. That is the nature of complex negotiations. The results of the process this house has gone through today strengthens our view that the deal the government has negotiated is the best option. Furthermore, Mr Speaker, although this was not a significant feature of today\u2019s debate, any deal must include a withdrawal agreement. It is the government\u2019s firm wish to get the withdrawal agreement approved by this house, and I urge all members, no matter the view on what the future relationship should be, if you believe in delivering on the referendum result by leaving the EU with a deal, then it\u2019s necessary to back the withdrawal agreement. If we do not do that, then there are no guarantees about where this process will end. It is for that reason that I call on all members from across this House, in the national interest, to back the prime minister\u2019s deal. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief and a People\u2019s Vote campaigner, has tweeted out a list of Labour MPs who did not back the Beckett amendment for a confirmatory referendum. The Times\u2019 Sam Coates has tweeted more of the results. You can read all the division lists for the eight votes here. Patrick McLoughlin tries again with his point of order about why John Bercow is allowing repeat votes on the indicative vote Brexit alternatives. Bercow says this was meant to be a process. The Commons decided earlier that this should take place over two days, he says. And here are the results, ranked in order, with the least unpopular at the top. J - Ken Clarke\u2019s - Customs union [see note] For: 264 Against: 272 Majority against: 8 M - Dame Margaret Beckett\u2019s - Confirmatory public vote For: 268 Against: 295 Majority against: 27 K - Labour\u2019s - Customs union and alignment with single market For: 237 Against: 307 Majority against: 70 D - Nick Boles\u2019s - common market 2.0 For: 188 Against: 283 Majority against: 95 L - Joanna Cherry\u2019s - Revocation to avoid no deal For: 184 Against: 293 Majority against: 109 B - John Baron\u2019s - No deal For: 160 Against: 400 Majority against: 240 O - Marcus Fysh\u2019s - Contingent preferential arrangements For: 139 Against: 422 Majority against: 283 H - George Eustice\u2019s - Efta and EEA [see note] For: 65 Against: 377 Majority against: 312 \u2022 Note: This note was added on 29 March 2019. After publication, the Speaker of the House corrected the counts that had been initially declared for two votes: H, EEA/Efta without customs union, was defeated 64 to 377, not 65 to 377 as originally declared; and J, Customs union, was defeated 265 to 271, not 264 to 272 as originally declared. Patrick McLoughlin, the former Tory chief whip, asks John Bercow if his \u201cno repeat votes\u201d ruling means these matters cannot be put to a vote again. Bercow says that is not the case. He says this is a different process. The business motion made it clear it would be a two-step process. McLoughlin tries to intervene again, but Bercow won\u2019t let him. MPs jeer very loudly. It feels as if Bercow is losing control of the house, but eventually he restores control, and says he won\u2019t be intimidated by McLoughlin. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the House of Commons cannot find a way forward. The issue must be put back to the people in a general election, he says. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, says tonight\u2019s results show there is no easy way forward. They strengthen the government\u2019s view that the PM\u2019s deal is the best option. He says any deal must include a withdrawal agreement. If MPs want to leave the EU with a deal, they must back the withdrawal agreement, he says. He says otherwise he cannot say where this process will end. Barclay, the Brexit secretary, says the indicative votes results show why the PM\u2019s deal is the best way forward. Oliver Letwin makes a point of order. He says he thought all ideas put to a vote tonight would fail to get a majority. But he says he wants to go ahead with a further debate and votes on Monday. Some MPs are jeering at him, implying such a debate would be pointless. Letwin goes on. He says he hopes that MPs will back May\u2019s deal in a vote on Friday, which would obviate the need for further indicative votes. Here are the results of the indicative votes on the Brexit alternatives. I have taken the summary of what each amendment does from the Press Association summary featured earlier. MPs vote against all eight options considered under the indicative votes process. This is what Oliver Letwin, the MP who championed this process, said he expected to happen in his Today interview this morning. B - John Baron\u2019s - No deal Backed by Conservative MPs John Baron, David Amess, Martin Vickers and Stephen Metcalfe, the motion proposes leaving the European Union without a deal on April 12. For: 160 Against: 400 D - Nick Boles\u2019s - common market 2.0 Tabled by Conservatives Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Andrew Percy and Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, Lucy Powell and Diana Johnson. The motion proposes UK membership of the European free trade association and European Economic Area. It allows continued participation in the single market and a \u201ccomprehensive customs arrangement\u201d with the EU after Brexit, which would remain in place until the agreement of a wider trade deal which guarantees frictionless movement of goods and an open border in Ireland. For: 188 Against: 283 H - George Eustice\u2019s - Efta and EEA A motion tabled by Conservative MP George Eustice \u2013 who quit as agriculture minister this month to fight for Brexit \u2013 proposes remaining within the EEA and rejoining Efta, but remaining outside a customs union with the EU. The motion was also signed by Conservative MPs including former minister Nicky Morgan and head of the Brexit Delivery Group Simon Hart. For: 65 Against: 377 J - Ken Clarke\u2019s - Customs union Requires a commitment to negotiate a \u201cpermanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU\u201d in any Brexit deal. Tabled by veteran Conservative Europhile Ken Clarke, backed by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, Helen Goodman and chair of the Commons Brexit committee Hilary Benn and Tory former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Sarah Newton. For: 264 Against: 272 K - Labour\u2019s - Customs union and alignment with single market Labour has tabled a motion proposing its plan for a close economic relationship with the EU. The plan includes a comprehensive customs union with a UK say on future trade deals; close alignment with the single market; matching new EU rights and protections; participation in EU agencies and funding programmes; and agreement on future security arrangements, including access to the European arrest warrant For: 237 Against: 307 L - Joanna Cherry\u2019s - Revocation to avoid no deal Under this plan, if the government has not passed its withdrawal agreement, it would have to stage a vote on a no-deal Brexit two sitting days before the scheduled date of departure. If MPs refuse to authorise no-deal, the prime minister would be required to halt Brexit by revoking article 50. The motion, tabled by the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry, has been signed by 33 MPs including the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw and all 11 members of the Independent Group. For: 184 Against: 293 M - Dame Margaret Beckett\u2019s - Confirmatory public vote Drawn up by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson and tabled by former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett with the backing of scores of MPs across the House, this motion would require a public vote to confirm any Brexit deal passed by parliament before its ratification. For: 268 Against: 295 O - Marcus Fysh\u2019s - Contingent preferential arrangements A group of Conservative MPs, including Marcus Fysh, Steve Baker and Priti Patel, have signed a motion that calls for the government to seek to agree preferential trade arrangements with the EU, in case the UK is unable to implement a withdrawal agreement with the bloc. For: 139 Against: 422 The division bell is going. That means John Bercow, the Speaker, will announce the results of the indicative votes in about two minutes. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, says stopping Brexit \u201cis possible now\u201d. The Conservative MP Huw Merriman says he backed the Becket amendment for a confirmatory referendum on the Brexit agreement. Here is Philip Hammond, the chancellor, on Theresa May\u2019s resignation. The Commons sitting has been suspended but, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh and others report, there is a bit of a row going on about the fact that the mace is still there. From Labour\u2019s Kerry McCarthy From the SNP\u2019s Peter Grant John Bercow, the Speaker, says he is not able to announce the results of the indicative votes ballot yet because they have not all been counted. But he says he hopes to be able to announce them soon. So he suspends the house. MPs have backed the statutory instrument changing Brexit date in the EU Withdrawal Act by 441 votes to 105 - a majority of 336. Alastair Campbell, the former communications chief for Tony Blair and a People\u2019s Vote campaigner, is wondering if Jacob Rees-Mogg will perform a fresh U-turn and revert to opposing the deal. This is what Rees-Mogg told LBC recently. So if the DUP felt the United Kingdom were being divided up in the deal, then that would mean it were impossible to vote for the deal under any circumstances. MPs are now voting on the statutory instrument changing the date of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Act. Turning back to Labour for a moment, these are from my colleague Heather Stewart. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby had the some thought as I did when she read the DUP statement. It provoked this response from the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds. The DUP will definitely be voting against May\u2019s deal, not abstaining, a source confirms. And here is the full version of the DUP statement. The DUP and the government have had good discussions in recent days and some progress on domestic legislation has been made. All concerned recognise the need to ensure that as we leave the European Union the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom is maintained. However, given the fact that the necessary changes we seek to the backstop have not been secured between the government and the European Union, and the remaining and ongoing strategic risk that Northern Ireland would be trapped in backstop arrangements at the end of the implementation period, we will not be supporting the government if they table a fresh meaningful vote. The backstop, if operational, has the potential to create an internal trade border within the United Kingdom and would cut us off from our main internal market, being Great Britain. We want to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from, and our future relationship with, the European Union on terms that accord with our key objectives to ensure the integrity of the United Kingdom. In our view the current withdrawal agreement does not do so and the backstop, which we warned this government against from its first inception, poses an unacceptable threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom and will inevitably limit the United Kingdom\u2019s ability to negotiate on the type of future relationship with the EU. The DUP statement does not say whether the party will abstain, or vote against the deal, but the reference to the backstop being \u201can unacceptable threat\u201d to the union implies the latter. Here is the DUP statement. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said her party cannot support Theresa May\u2019s deal. Our coverage of the indicative votes debate was not as thorough as it would have been had it not been overshadowed by Theresa May\u2019s announcement about resigning before the next phase of the Brexit talks get underway. But if you\u2019re interested, the full transcript is now on the Hansard website. In the Commons the debate on the EU Withdrawal Act statutory instrument is still going on. The Brexiter Sir Bernard Jenkin says tonight will be remembered as the moment when the House of Commons turned against Brexit, and began to ignore the mandate given to MPs to implement the referendum result. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has more on Tory Brexiters who are switching towards backing the PM\u2019s deal. In the Commons MPs are now debating the statutory instrument changing the date of Brexit as set out in the EU Withdrawal Act. Opening the debate, Robin Walker, a Brexit minister, said the agreement with the EU at the summit last week meant the date of Brexit in international law had already been moved \u2013 to 22 May if the withdrawal agreement passes this week, or to 12 April otherwise. But the date also needs to be changed in the EU Withdrawal Act, which repeals the European Communities Act 1972. Walker said if the EU Withdrawal Act were not amended, there would be legal confusion. The statutory instrument needs to be passed by both the Commons and the Lords. In the Lords peers passed it earlier today, without a division, but some Brexiter peers did complain about the need for a delay. The former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Forsyth said: This is not a very pleasant place we find ourselves in and it has come about because there has been a conspiracy by remainers. There has been a conspiracy by members of both houses who have sought from the beginning to frustrate what 17.4 million people voted for. The Conservative MP Tom Pursglove is another Brexiter who has been persuaded to back Theresa May\u2019s deal after previously voting against it, the Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan reports. An ERG source has sent out some lines from the speech that Steve Baker, the ERG deputy chairman, gave at the ERG meeting this evening. It turns out he really did talk about bulldozing parliament. (See 7.43pm.) Baker said: I\u2019m consumed with a ferocious rage after that pantomime [May in the \u201822] ... What is our liberty for if not to govern ourselves? Like all of you I have wrestled with my conscience about what to do. I could tear this place down and bulldoze it into the river. These fools and knaves and cowards are voting on things they don\u2019t even understand. We\u2019ve been put in this place by people whose addiction to power without responsibility has led them to put the choice of no Brexit or this deal. I may yet resign the whip rather than be part of this. The source said that Baker received an enormous standing ovation at the end of the speech and that he was hugged by Jacob Rees-Mogg and others afterwards. \u201cWe are not a hugging group,\u201d the source said. He also said he thought there was \u201cno way\u201d that enough ERG members were going to switch for Theresa May\u2019s deal to pass. There was a time when the Brexiters wanted to restore the constitutional supremacy of parliament. Now, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Hutton, some of them have other plans for the place. The Tory Brexiter Sheryll Murray voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal earlier this month. According to the BBC\u2019s Martyn Oates, she has now been persuaded to back it. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, has just told Sky News that he thinks the chances of Theresa May\u2019s deal being passed are now \u201cmuch higher than they were\u201d. Here is a column from my colleague Polly Toynbee on Theresa May\u2019s decision to announce that she will resign before the next phase of the Brexit talks. And this is how it starts. Theresa May will leave office in an \u201corderly handover\u201d whenever an EU withdrawal deal is done. No one is weeping. The oddity is: we may yet come to miss her, though she has been the worst prime minister of our political lifetimes \u2013 bar none. Yet there was one great good purpose in her premiership: by occupying the space, however vacuously, she kept out the barbarian hordes of Brexiteers barging one another out of the way to seize her throne. Now she has surrendered that one useful role, leaving the country to the untender mercies of those competing in Europhobia for the votes of some 120,000 dwindling Tory party members. To use her deathless phrase, nothing will be changed by her departure. Parliament will be as gridlocked as ever, the combat deadlier with an avowed Brextremist at the helm. According to my colleague Dan Sabbagh, talks of Steve Baker being open to backing Theresa May\u2019s deal (see 7.10pm) sound premature. More from the European Research Group, the Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit who have been meeting following the PM\u2019s statement. From the FT\u2019s Laura Hughes From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the ERG, has been one of its fiercest critics of May\u2019s deal. This is what he said in a Telegraph article (paywall) last week. I understand my Conservative colleagues want to say they have delivered Brexit for fear of voter backlash and I understand the nation is crying out for progress, but this deal would backfire terribly by the next election. Voting for this deal is not pragmatism. It is the reverse. It would be an understandable but counterproductive surrender for immediate respite ... If we vote for this deal, we will have locked ourselves in a prison with no voice and no exit. We will escape only with the permission of those whose authority we rejected. The PM won\u2019t resign if the agreement goes through. She will stay and drag us miserably into deeper political disaster. In the Commons the Brexit indicative votes debate is over. MPs are now voting. Unusually, they are voting on paper. They have got half an hour to fill in a ballot paper looking like this. But MPs are still using the division lobbies. They are expected to go there to hand over their ballot papers. To even things out, John Bercow, the Speaker, said MPs with surnames beginning with the letters A to K should use the aye lobby, and everyone else the no lobby. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, has told the Tory European Research Group, that he will now vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal, HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh reports. Johnson has been signalling that he is ready to drop his opposition to the deal for some days now, but only last night he said in a speech: \u201cIf we vote for the PM\u2019s lamentable withdrawal agreement we are skewered.\u201d (See 9.33am.) And here is Nicola Sturgeon, the Scotland first minister, on Theresa May\u2019s announcement. And this is from my colleague Dan Sabbagh. This is from my colleague Patrick Wintour. As usual, he is right ... The Tory MP Charlie Elphicke voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal in the second meaningful vote but says he will now back it. Here is Jeremy Corbyn responding to Theresa May\u2019s announcement. And these are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth The Tory Brexiter Anne Marie Morris told Radio 4\u2019s PM programme that she did not think DUP MPs were changing their mind about Theresa May\u2019s deal, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. After the meerting Jacob-Rees Mogg, the ERG chair, said he would back May\u2019s plan even if the DUP only abstained. He said: If the DUP is abstaining, that would be enough for me, yes. I would feel entitled to back it. If the DUP was still against it I would not feel able to back it. Rees-Mogg said he did not get the impression May\u2019s announcement made any fellow Brexiters immediately change their mind on the deal. I don\u2019t think anybody who indicated support for the deal wasn\u2019t people you are previously aware of as having moved to support the deal. He said it seemed clear that if the deal was passed, the process of replacing May would happen quickly: I think it was very clear. She basically said that when the withdrawal agreement was approved \u2013 and I assume that was by the 22 May deadline. But if the deal did not pass, he said, \u201cshe would have every right to carry on\u201d. Rees-Mogg declined to say who he would back in the leadership contest: The great joy of the Tory party is that it has so many talented people in it. It\u2019s like finding a fast bowler in Yorkshire. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports, Jeremy Corbyn has written to Labour MPs qualifying the party\u2019s support for the confirmatory referendum amendment. Here is the key quote: Our conference agreed that if we cannot get a general election we would support all options remaining on the table, including a public vote. Labour is supporting the Beckett-Kyle-Wilson amendment (even where it can be read as going beyond our policy) to keep the option of a public vote on the table in order to stop a disastrous no deal or May\u2019s unacceptable deal. Labour\u2019s priority is to deliver our credible Brexit plan which respects our commitment to accept the result of the referendum. Today we are are supporting all options that enable us to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or no-deal being forced on the country. The reason why the Corbyn letter says the Beckett amendment could be read as going beyond Labour party policy is because it does go beyond Labour party policy. It says any withdrawal agreement passed during this parliament should be subject to a confirmatory referendum. Here is the full text: That this house will not allow in this parliament the implementation and ratification of any withdrawal agreement and any framework for the future relationship unless and until they have been approved by the people of the United Kingdom in a confirmatory public vote. So Corbyn is saying Labour is backing the Beckett amendment even though it does not agree with it in full. He sent the letter after some members of the shadow cabinet told him they had strong doubts about backing a second referendum. More from what happened when Theresa May addressed the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee. From ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen From the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins From the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From my colleague Graeme Wearden Downing Street has sent out extracts from what Theresa May said to Tory MPs at the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee. This has been a testing time for our country and our party. We\u2019re nearly there. We\u2019re almost ready to start a new chapter and build that brighter future. But before we can do that, we have to finish the job in hand. As I say, I don\u2019t tour the bars and engage in the gossip \u2013 but I do make time to speak to colleagues, and I have a great team in the whips\u2019 office. I also have two excellent PPSs. And I have heard very clearly the mood of the parliamentary party. I know there is a desire for a new approach \u2013 and new leadership \u2013 in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations \u2013 and I won\u2019t stand in the way of that. I know some people are worried that if you vote for the withdrawal agreement, I will take that as a mandate to rush on into phase two without the debate we need to have. I won\u2019t \u2013 I hear what you are saying. But we need to get the deal through and deliver Brexit ... I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party. I ask everyone in this room to back the deal so we can complete our historic duty \u2013 to deliver on the decision of the British people and leave the European Union with a smooth and orderly exit. More on Theresa May at the 1922 Committee. From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope From the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins More from what Theresa May told the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole From LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood These are from my colleague Dan Sabbagh. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, has just been speaking in the Brexit debate. He quoted what the SNP MEP Alyn Smith told the European parliament in its debate this morning. Smith said he could not predict the future, but he knew Scotland was a European country, and, if the EU did not exist, it would be necessary to create it, and Scotland would want to be part of it. If Scotland was taken out of the EU, independence would be the only way it could return, he said. He told the MEPs that he was no asking them to solve Scotland\u2019s domestic discussion. He went on: I am asking you to leave a light on so that we can find our way home. Here are some quotes from MPs who have been speaking in the Brexit debate. I have taken them from the Press Association wire. The Tory Brexiter John Baron defended his amendment calling for a no-deal Brexit. He said: I appeal to the house for rational consideration with regards to no-deal. I know there are a lot of scare stories out there, but this is a repeat of 2016. Those scare stories were wrong then, they are wrong now. Let\u2019s have a note of optimism about this country, a note of optimism about the capability of this country. Let\u2019s back this country and if we can\u2019t get a good deal, then let\u2019s actually get back to economic reality and realise we already trade profitably with the majority of the world\u2019s GDP outside the EU on WTO terms, there is no reason we can\u2019t trade within the EU on such terms. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock said the Nick Boles common market 2.0 amendment honoured the EU referendum result. He said: A 52-48 vote was certainly not an instruction for a disastrous no-deal, or a hard Canada-style job-destroying Brexit. It was an instruction to move house but to stay in the same neighbourhood ... It is worth remembering what Nigel Farage told a Question Time audience in 2016. \u2018I hear people say\u2019 he said: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be terrible if we were like Norway or Switzerland. Really? They are rich, they are happy and they are self-governing countries\u2019. Backing the same amendment, Nick Boles said he wanted to make the case for compromise. Not as something cowardly but as something courageous. In a divided country and a divided parliament, finding and sustaining a compromise that most people can support is a noble endeavour. After years of paralysing conflict we have moral duty to open our minds this afternoon and reach for a compromise that will allow us to put the interminable Brexit row behind us. The great strength of the common market 2.0 proposal relative to all other Brexit compromises is that it offers something important and valuable to everyone and every party in this house. Theresa May is due to address the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee at 5pm. In a blog about what she might say, the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth says: Speculation is rife that she will use the meeting to announce a timetable for her departure, though there\u2019s no official line from Number 10 on this. I understand that Tory switchers are being told that Theresa May will go if the withdrawal agreement bill gets royal assent, which would have to be by 22 May. This would, obviously, require meaningful vote 3 to pass \u2013 though ... John Bercow is not keen on the vote happening at all. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has also published a useful analysis (pdf) of five of the alternative Brexit options being debated this afternoon. The campaign, which favours a second referendum (and, implicitly at least, staying in the UK), thinks all are flawed. The document includes this chart. This is useful - a chart from Simon Usherwood from UK in a Changing Europe, an academic network, explaining the implications of the eight amendments for the EU. Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt has more thinking on what the government could do to get round John Bercow\u2019s ruling. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is speaking in the debate now. He says the government is going to table a motion for the Commons to sit on Friday, in case it wants to hold the third meaningful vote then. He does not confirm that the debate will be held then. But he says it is better to have the option, and not need it, than to need it, and not have it available. Thirty three Tory MPs defied the whip and voted in favour of the business motion. The full list is here. That is three more than the 30 Tories who rebelled on this issue on Monday. Two Labour MPs joined the Tories, the DUP and three independent in voting against the business motion: Stephen Hepburn and Kate Hoey. Here is some reaction to the Bercow ruling (see 3.47pm) from people who follow Commons procedure closely. From Nikki da Costa, the former head of legislative affairs for Theresa May at Number 10 From Chris White, a former adviser to William Hague when he was leader of the Commons White is correct. Bercow said he would disallow a notwithstanding motion in relation to MV3. But the business motion today includes a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d element. Its third clause says: (c) notwithstanding the practice of the house, any motion on matters that have been the subject of a prior decision of the house in the current session may be the subject of a decision; From the Times\u2019 Esther Webber From Jack Simson Caird, a research fellow at the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law. John Bercow, the Speaker, is putting eight amendments to a vote. Here they are. I have taken the summary of what each one says from the Press Association summary I posted earlier. The letters refer to the letters attached to each amendment in the order paper. B - John Baron\u2019s - No deal Backed by Conservative MPs John Baron, David Amess, Martin Vickers and Stephen Metcalfe, the motion proposes leaving the European Union without a deal on April 12. D - Nick Boles\u2019s - common market 2.0 Tabled by Conservatives Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Andrew Percy and Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, Lucy Powell and Diana Johnson. The motion proposes UK membership of the European free trade association and European Economic Area. It allows continued participation in the single market and a \u201ccomprehensive customs arrangement\u201d with the EU after Brexit, which would remain in place until the agreement of a wider trade deal which guarantees frictionless movement of goods and an open border in Ireland. H - George Eustice\u2019s - Efta and EEA A motion tabled by Conservative MP George Eustice \u2013 who quit as agriculture minister this month to fight for Brexit \u2013 proposes remaining within the EEA and rejoining Efta, but remaining outside a customs union with the EU. The motion was also signed by Conservative MPs including former minister Nicky Morgan and head of the Brexit Delivery Group Simon Hart. J - Ken Clarke\u2019s - Customs union Requires a commitment to negotiate a \u201cpermanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU\u201d in any Brexit deal. Tabled by veteran Conservative Europhile Ken Clarke, backed by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, Helen Goodman and chair of the Commons Brexit committee Hilary Benn and Tory former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Sarah Newton. K - Labour\u2019s - Customs union and alignment with single market Labour has tabled a motion proposing its plan for a close economic relationship with the EU. The plan includes a comprehensive customs union with a UK say on future trade deals; close alignment with the single market; matching new EU rights and protections; participation in EU agencies and funding programmes; and agreement on future security arrangements, including access to the European arrest warrant L - Joanna Cherry\u2019s - Revocation to avoid no deal Under this plan, if the government has not passed its withdrawal agreement, it would have to stage a vote on a no-deal Brexit two sitting days before the scheduled date of departure. If MPs refuse to authorise no-deal, the prime minister would be required to halt Brexit by revoking article 50. The motion, tabled by the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry, has been signed by 33 MPs including the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw and all 11 members of the Independent Group. M - Dame Margaret Beckett\u2019s - Confirmatory public vote Drawn up by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson and tabled by former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett with the backing of scores of MPs across the House, this motion would require a public vote to confirm any Brexit deal passed by parliament before its ratification. O - Marcus Fysh\u2019s - Contingent preferential arrangements A group of Conservative MPs, including Marcus Fysh, Steve Baker and Priti Patel, have signed a motion that calls for the government to seek to agree preferential trade arrangements with the EU, in case the UK is unable to implement a withdrawal agreement with the bloc. This is what John Bercow said about firming up his \u201cno repeat votes\u201d ruling. (See 3.32pm.) Reminding MPs of his original decision, Bercow told MPs: In the course of answering questions following her statement [on Monday], the prime minister accepted this constraint, saying that: \u201cI am very clear about the strictures that Mr Speaker gave when he made his statement last week and, were we to bring forward a further motion to this house, we would of course ensure that it met the requirements he made.\u201d I understand that the government may be thinking of bringing meaningful vote three before the house either tomorrow or even on Friday, if the house opts to sit that day. Therefore, in order that there should be no misunderstanding, I wish to make clear that I do expect the government to meet the test of change. They should not seek to circumvent my ruling by means of tabling either a notwithstanding motion or a tabling motion. The table office has been instructed that no such motions will be accepted. I very much look forward, colleagues, to today\u2019s debate and votes which give the house the chance to start the process of positively indicating what it wants. There had been speculation that the government might get round Bercow\u2019s ruling, which is based on a rule in the Commons bible, Erskine May, by having a vote on a motion disapplying the rule in this case. That option has now been disallowed. John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, is now talking about his ruling about \u201cno repeat votes\u201d, that prevented Theresa May from bringing back her meaningful vote before the EU summit. He says there is talk of the government bringing back the vote on Thursday or Friday next week. He says that, for this to be allowed, there would have to a substantial change to the motion. And he says he has instructed the clerks to block any attempt by the government to get round this ruling by tabling a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d motion \u2013 ie, a one-off rule change that would allow the debate to go ahead despite the usual Commons rule. Bercow restates his ruling that he will only allow a new vote on the Brexit deal if it has changed significantly. He says he will block any attempt by the government to use a procedural rule change to get round his decision. This is new, and unexpected. It has probably reduced the chances of the meaningful vote being brought back this week (MV3), and it makes the chance of MV3 never happening a distinct possibility. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he is putting eight amendments to a vote. Theresa May has lost again. Her attempt to defeat the business motion failed, and it was passed by 331 votes to 287 - a majority of 44. From Sky\u2019s Kay Burley Theresa May could be quite close to announcing her resignation as PM. But, according to some new Ipsos MORI polling, she is still seen as having what it takes to be a good prime minister than all of her most obvious rivals. And this is from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg MPs are now voting on the business motion. If you are interested, you can read the text of it on the order paper here (pdf). On Monday MPs voted in favour of the Oliver Letwin amendment approving the indicative votes process by 329 votes to 302 \u2013 a majority of 27. Thirty Tories rebelled and backed the amendment. You would expect the result of today\u2019s vote to be broadly similar. If it is not, that could be because support for the Letwin process has grown, or shrunk, over the last 48 hours. In the Commons the vote on the business motion has just wrapped up. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, spoke against it, and it all got very public school. Here is ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on the government\u2019s decision to give MPs and junior ministers a free vote. And another question from BTL The remain Tories are less important, because there are fewer of them, but almost a dozen of them have voted against May\u2019s deal, and so they do count. My colleague Rowena Mason has been looking at the numbers that May needs in more detail. She has sent me this summary of the PM\u2019s situation. The magic number that Theresa May needs for her deal is 320 votes. It means she could get the withdrawal agreement over the line if she had: - 303 out of 313 Conservative MPs - 10 DUP MPs - 7 Labour and Independent MPs who have already backed her deal So unless she gets more Labour abstentions or votes, she can only afford to lose 10 Tory votes. This means it is still looking extremely tight for her \u2013 even assuming the eventual backing of Eurosceptic big beasts like Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the DUP. There are currently six or seven Tory MPs (eg Justine Greening and Sam Gyimah) who want a second referendum and therefore guaranteed to vote down May\u2019s deal come what may. And there are undoubtedly more than a dozen Tory Eurosceptic MPs who currently say they are still immovably opposed \u2013 like Andrea Jenkyns, Steve Baker, Crispin Blunt and Julian Lewis. Here is a question from BTL, or two. 1) No, nothing at all. In theory the process could be self-perpetuating. That is why it alarms the government so much \u2013 even though Oliver Letwin did say earlier that, after Monday, if ministers were to accept what the Commons proposes, there would be no need for him to seize the order paper on any more days. 2) I did not see Peston\u2019s report, but there is a write-up of it here. Whether the PM would be bound by the vote would depend on the precise wording. Normally Commons motions are not binding on the government. But some categories of motions are considered binding \u2013 eg, \u201chumble address\u201d ones, and also, I think, ones that require or order (\u201cmandate\u201d, to use Peston\u2019s word) the government to do something. But these votes would not necessarily be legally binding, in the sense of capable of being enforced by a court. To bind the hands of the government in that way, MPs would have to pass legislation. It would be interesting to read the Sedwill/Cox advice. I\u2019m sure they know more than me. But the Peston story talks about May possibly being in breach of the ministerial code if she failed to follow an instruction of parliament. That may be the case, but the person ultimately in charge of deciding whether or not a minister has broken the ministerial code is \u2013 the PM herself. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the party would whip for Margaret Beckett\u2019s \u201cconfirmatory public vote\u201d option \u2013 as well as Gareth Snell\u2019s and Ken Clarke\u2019s, calling for a customs union, and of course the one setting out Labour\u2019s own Brexit policy. And he said whips would be \u201cencouraging\u201d Labour MPs to support common market 2.0, the cross-party proposal drawn up by Stephen Kinnock, among others. The spokesman then embarked on a long justification of Labour\u2019s support for a referendum \u2013 which has sparked a backlash, and could yet result in resignations tonight. He said: The basis for that is that they\u2019re all in line with our policy \u2013 in the case of the public vote motion, in the sense of our conference policy that if we\u2019re unable to achieve a general election, keeping all options on the table. So the intention is to support those options going forward in the process \u2013 and obviously it is an unusual process, and these aren\u2019t normal parliamentary votes. Asked if shadow frontbenchers would be sacked if they disobeyed the whip later, he said \u201cthe discipline arrangements are a matter for the chief whip\u201d. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman also pointed to the phrase \u201cin this parliament\u201d, in the Beckett motion, and suggested that meant that if a future Labour government were to negotiate its own, distinct Brexit deal \u2013 after a snap general election, for example \u2013 that would not need to be subject to a confirmatory ballot. He said: The other issue of controversy about it is the issue about whether it implies support or abstention on Theresa May\u2019s deal, which we have said we would not support in any circumstances. That flatly contradicts what Corbyn\u2019s deputy, Tom Watson, said in his speech to the Put it to the People march on Saturday, when he offered to vote for May\u2019s deal in exchange for a referendum. In the Commons Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house, is speaking now. She says she is disappointed that MPs voted for this process on Monday. It should be the government that decided what business gets debated, she says, not the house itself. She says anything the house decides must be deliverable and negotiable, and it must deliver on the results of the referendum. She says the withdrawal agreement is complicated. And the EU has said it must be accepted if the UK is to get the transition, she says. She says the government will vote against the business of the house motion because it opposes the principle of the Commons taking control of the parliamentary timetable. The government could make another attempt to win a majority for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal on Friday. The choice of Friday 29 March is not an accident. Although no longer Brexit day, it remains an important day in the calendar, because of the two-step extension process imposed by the EU last week. EU leaders agreed to grant the UK an extension until 22 May if the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons \u201cby 29 March 2019 at the latest\u201d. But if the withdrawal agreement is not approved, the extension will expire on 12 April, a UK domestic deadline for confirming British participation in the European elections. The text of the EU\u2019s legal decision states: In the event that the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons by 29 March 2019 at the latest, the period provided for in article 50(3) TEU is extended until 12 April 2019. In that event, the United Kingdom will indicate a way forward before 12 April 2019, for consideration by the European council. Some EU sources suggest there could be some leniency on 29 March deadline. If, for example, MPs vote for the deal on 1 April. \u201cThe text of the legal decision says that we need to vote by Friday,\u201d a senior EU source said. \u201cQuite honestly I think that we will be lenient on that. The real question is whether we have clarity in the coming days, if this going to work or not.\u201d That remains unclear given the \u201cvolatile\u201d nature of British politics that is changing day-by-day, the source said. The EU has already pencilled in a summit for a few days before the 12 April deadline, although it is impossible to say whether that summit will be for EU leaders to decide on a long extension or help them prepare for no-deal. Last week\u2019s meeting with Theresa May left EU leaders unconvinced that the deal would pass, but a positive meaningful vote three has not been completely ruled out. Neither, however, has a major government crisis leading to new elections. Officials see two outcomes from a soft Brexit result of the indicative votes process. \u201cIt could mobilise forces for a slim majority for May\u2019s deal, or we will have a serious government crisis which will probably lead to elections,\u201d the EU source said. In that case it would not be clear if the prime minister would be in a position to request an extension. Whatever happens in parliament, for the EU it is the government that counts. \u201cOur interlocutor is not the Commons, our interlocutor is the UK government,\u201d the EU source said. Here is the message sent to Tory MPs from the chief whip, Julian Smith, saying there will be a free vote tonight. This is from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti. Back in the Commons, Letwin is still speaking, and defending the constitutional propriety of his business motion. Jacob Rees-Mogg says he objects to today\u2019s procedure. The government should be in charge, he says, citing the role played by privy counsellors in Tudor parliaments overseeing the Queen\u2019s business. Letwin says the Commons has the final say over its own procedures. And here is my colleague Jessica Elgot on the Labour whipping arrangements. This is from the Conservative MP James Cartlidge. Theresa May made it clear on Monday and again at PMQs, that she will not necessarily accept any Brexit plan that emerges from the indicative votes process. But she was under strong pressure to give Tory MPs a free vote, not least from pro-Europeans in the government, and so she is going to let Tory MPs vote for what they want, even though the government is opposed to many of the proposals on the menu. MPs are now debating the business motion for today\u2019s debate. Often business motions (which set the timetable for a debate) go through on the nod. But today\u2019s is quite complicated, and the debate on the business motion could go on until 3pm. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister who moved the amendment setting up the indicative votes procedure, is moving the motion. Normally it would be the leader of the Commons moving the business motion, but the government is not in charge today, and so Letwin is moving the motion from the government backbenches. This is a very important point we\u2019re making here about how our country is ultimately governed. In an emergency the House of Commons is capable of controlling its own business in such a way as to find a solution the vast majesties of Whitehall and government have not been able to provide us with. It\u2019s because Whitehall has failed, not due to the inadequacy of any individual but due to the basic difficulty of the situation, that the Commons is taking these steps. Told by an MP that Twitter is reporting that the government will vote against the business motion, Letwin at first says he does not take any notice of Twitter. Then he goes on to say that it is not a surprise that the government is whipping against the business motion. Kate Hoey, the Labour Brexiter, intervenes. She says the business motion today is not the same as the amendment passed on Monday. She says it is setting aside Monday for further indicative votes on Monday. Letwin concedes that he wants to \u201cbook a slot\u201d for Monday. He says he does not expect the votes today to produce a majority for one proposal. That is why he wants another round of voting on Monday. These are from the Downing Street post-PMQs briefing. From my colleague Heather Stewart What is significant about this is that the business motion does not just set out the procedures to be followed today; it also says that Monday next week should also be set aside for another indicative votes debate, instead of being set aside for government business, as is usual under standing order 14. If the government were to win this vote, the indicative votes process would end tonight - before it has been fully concluded. The votes tonight will show which Brexit alternative is most popular. But Oliver Letwin plans some sort of run-off procedure on Monday, to clarify an ultimate winner. See 9.33am. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen PMQs - Snap verdict: PMQs used to be one of the political highlights of the week. Increasingly that has become less and less true (partly because Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are both relatively uninspiring performers in this arena), but today it felt like a particularly diminished event, that did not shed much light on the crisis facing the country, or even resonate with much drama. With the exception of Scottish questions, it may be the most boring half hour in the Commons today. Corbyn devoted all his questions to Brexit, and he started by challenging May to explain what was wrong with a customs union \u2013 a pertinent question given that is where the indicative votes process may lead. But May rebutted his question without much difficulty, and his attack on the government over its unwillingness to commit to accepting the result of the indicative votes process did not get very far because May was able to reply, correctly, that Labour\u2019s position is much the same. The most awkward question for May on Brexit came from her own colleague Andrew Bridgen, who declared that she had now forfeited the trust of his constituents. (See 12.05am.) But even that did not discomfort May much, and some observers were left speculating that perhaps a private decision to stand down soon has lightened her mood. May\u2019s response to the SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, also fuelled speculation that she is not planning to stay in office for long. For the record, this is what Blackford asked: It is becoming increasingly clear that the cost the prime minister will pay to force her disastrous deal through is the price of her departure. Yet again another Tory prime minister is willing to ride off into the sunset and saddle us with a crisis in the UK and an extreme rightwing Brexiteer coming into Downing Street. Does the prime minister feel no sense of responsibility for what she is about to do? May replied: It is my sense of responsibility and duty that has meant I have kept working to ensure Brexit is delivered. It is the sort of answer you might expect from someone who thinks their days as PM are numbered. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says global climate emissions have hit their highest levels. Will May back calls for a green new deal? May says Lucas should have noted what the government is already doing. It is committed to clean growth. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant asks about skin cancer (for which he was recently treated). He calls for a major public health campaign to get people to check out their bodies for suspicious moles, and to use sunscreen. The government can save lives, he says. May agrees. She says Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will have heard Bryant\u2019s request. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Wesminster, says the Belfast city deal was signed yesterday. Will May ensure that this will go forward even without the Northern Ireland executive sitting? May says she can commit to ensure that the city deal goes ahead even without the power-sharing executive being in place. The DUP\u2019s Jim Shannon asks about dementia funding. May says increasing numbers of people are living with dementia. The UK is playing a significant part in the international effort to find better treatment, she says. Labour\u2019s Afzal Khan asks about a Guardian story about the Conservative party reinstating 15 party members suspended for Islamophobia. The party is in denial about the problem, he says. May says the party does take the issue seriously, and investigates all complaints. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, says lawyers are convinced that May\u2019s deal with the EU extending article 50 is unlawful. Did May get legal advice before agreeing that? And will May publish it? And will she withdraw this evening\u2019s motion changing Brexit date? May says Brexit date has already changed under international law. She says the Commons voted to seek an extension to article 50. She says, if the statutory instrument being voted on tonight is not passed, that will cause legal confusion. Labour\u2019s Chi Onwurah says she used to be opposed to a second referendum because it would be so divisive. But the country is paralysed. Will May consider the possibility she is making a terrible mistake? May says, if Onwurah wants to deliver on the referendum result in an orderly way, she should back May\u2019s deal. Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson says the north needs an industrial renaissance. May says she wants an industrial policy that works for every region. There has been significant investment in the north, she says. Kirstene Hair, a Scottish Conservative, says more than 7,000 members of the armed forces based in Scotland have to pay more in tax because of the Scottish government\u2019s tax rates. Will the UK government compensate them? May says a majority of armed forces personnel based in Scotland are affected by differential tax rates. She says the UK government will again compensate them in the coming year. Sir Peter Bottomley, a Conservative, says the PM\u2019s deal has not passed parliament because of those who want to stay in the EU, hardline Brexiters and Labour. But most people in the country want it to pass. May says that is the message she gets from the public too. Labour has now put out a statement effectively confirming that it is backing the Beckett confirmatory referendum amendment. (See 9.33am, 10.58am and 11.58am.) A spokesperson said: In line with our policy, we\u2019re supporting motions to keep options on the table to prevent a bad Tory deal or no deal. The Beckett amendment actually goes further than the Labour statement it implies. It says any amendment should be subject to a referendum. It says: That this house will not allow in this parliament the implementation and ratification of any withdrawal agreement and any framework for the future relationship unless and until they have been approved by the people of the United Kingdom in a confirmatory public vote. The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, asks May if she has a sense of responsibility for what she is doing on Brexit. May says she is trying to deliver Brexit. Blackford says he was at the march for a second referendum on Saturday. Some 6 million people have signed the petition calling for article 50 to be revoked. Will May accept the will of parliament, or will she continue to be held hostage by the hard right and the DUP? May says she is delivering on the referendum result. Blackford wants to stay in the EU. That means staying in the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy, which would not be in the interests of Scottish farmers or Scottish fishermen. May says epetitions are subject to checks to ensure they are not manipulated by foreign powers. Corbyn says May has not been able to guarantee dynamic alignment on workers\u2019 standards. He says Harrington said in his resignation letter May should find a consensus negotiating position. If one emerges, will May accept it as the basis for her negotiating position? May says the objective they should all have is delivering Brexit. She says she has been clear on non-regression on workers\u2019 rights. She says Corbyn is shaking his head (probably because non-regression is not the same as dynamic alignment). She says she will listen to what parliament has to say about matching new rights offered by the EU. Corbyn says May did not answer the question about whether she would accept what the Commons decided. She says May is unable to compromise, unable to unite the country, and unable to govern. She should change course, or go. May says she answered the question on accepting the result of MPs\u2019 decision in the Commons on Monday. For Labour Keir Starmer also refused to commit to what MPs decided, she says. She says Labour would give the UK capital flight, a run on the pound and a drop in living standards. Corbyn is the biggest threat to living standards, she says. Corbyn says the TUC and the CBI back a customs union as part of a deal. So it is strange for a Conservative PM to reject what business wants. Why won\u2019t she consider a customs union? May says Corbyn should have listened to her earlier answer. Corbyn stood on a platform saying he wanted the UK to be able to strike its own trade deal. And now he wants a referendum too. Whatever happened to straight-talking, honest politics? Corbyn says many of May\u2019s colleagues want a race to the bottom. Quoting what Richard Harrington said when he resigned as business minister, he asks why she is pressing ahead with her deal. May says she does not support a race to the bottom. The government has enhanced workers\u2019 rights, she says. As Labour MPs jeer, she says Labour can never stand it when told the Tories stand up for workers. Jeremy Corbyn asks May what her plan B is. May says she has a deal that can deliver Brexit for the British people. Other options do not do that. Corbyn says May\u2019s deal has been defeated twice, by in one case the largest ever majority for a government defeat. Does May agree backing a customs union is the best way of getting her deal over the line? May says her deal delivers the benefits of a customs union, while allowing the UK to negotiate independent trade deals. Corbyn used to want that too, she says. She says the UK wants to negotiate trade in its own interests. The Tory Brexiter Andrew Bridgen says May said on more than 100 occasions the UK would leave the EU on 29 March. Now, because of our EU masters, we are not doing that. He says her constituents will never trust her again. May says she can deliver on Brexit if MPs like Bridgen back her deal. The SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie says Brexit is costing the UK \u00a31bn a week in lost growth. It is not the fault of the EU, or of MPs voting with their consciences. So will May admit it is her fault? And when will she resign? May says the Brexit deal delivers on the result of the referendum. She accepts that result, unlike Hosie, she says. Theresa May starts by saying she will chair a summit on serious violence next week. John Bercow, the Speaker, starts PMQs by saying Woody Johnson, the US ambassador, is in the gallery. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston So that means Peter Kyle was right, and Barry Gardiner was wrong. See 9.33am. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. I normally post a snap verdict after the May/Corbyn exchanges, on the grounds that for most people this is the highlight, but today I will do it at the end because May\u2019s exchanges with her own MPs may be just as interesting. And John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said this morning that what Barry Gardiner said on the Today programme about the Beckett confirmatory referendum amendment being difficult for the party (see 9.33am) was in line with party policy. Asked if he agreed with Gardiner about Labour not being a remain party, McDonnell said: We had to accept in our manifesto respect for the referendum result. We campaigned for remain, we lost, we have to accept that. We have to be honest with people. If there was another referendum now I personally would vote for remain because I think that is best for the country. What he is saying is exactly in line with party policy. We have got to prevent a no-deal, prevent a bad deal, advocate for our own policy, try to get a general election if we can, but failing that, if there is a logjam, yes we will if necessary go back to the people. Dame Margaret Beckett, the Labour MP, has said she expects the party to back her confirmatory referendum amendment. She said: I rest my understanding on what I heard Jeremy Corbyn, who is the leader of the Labour party, say at the dispatch box, which is that we will apply the principle on going back to the people for confirmation to any decision that we\u2019ve reached. And that\u2019s where we stand. This morning party sources were saying the decision on how to whip on this amendment had not yet been taken. (See 10.58am.) This is from Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster. In the European parliament this morning Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader who now sits as a Brexit party MEP, said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the UK was heading for a delay to its departure from the EU. He told MEPs: You should ask yourselves: \u2018Do you really want that? Do you really want Brexit to utterly dominate the next couple of years of your business to the exclusion of your many other ambitions? Do you really want the UK to contest the European elections, to send back a very large number of leave MEPs, just at a time when you are fighting populism \u2013 as you see it \u2013 across the continent? And, to cries of \u201cNo\u201d from some MEPs and \u201cYes\u201d from others, he asked: \u201cDo you really want me back in this place?\u201d The EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, replied: Mr Farage, no one in Brussels is trying to steal Brexit from you, no one is trying to undo the vote of the British people. It is not Brussels that decided that the UK would leave the EU. You were the ones who made that choice and you are the ones who have to take your responsibility and face up to the consequences of that decision. No one else. Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave campaign director, has posted a blog responding to the Commons privileges committee report saying he should be admonished for being in contempt of parliament. (See 11.06am.) He says he did offer to give evidence to the culture committee, and then to the privileges committee. But what is more interesting is what he says about the current state of Brexit. Cummings condemns hardline Brexiters in the European Research Group as \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cuseful idiots\u201d. He says: Those of you in the narcissist-delusional subset of the ERG who have spent the last three years scrambling for the 8.10 Today slot while spouting gibberish about trade and the law across SW1 \u2013 ie exactly the contemptible behaviour that led to your enforced marginalisation during the referendum and your attempt to destroy Vote Leave \u2013 you are also in the pirate category. You were useful idiots for remain during the campaign and with every piece of bullshit from Bill Cash et al you have helped only remain for three years. Remember how you WELCOMED the backstop as a \u2018triumph\u2019 in December 2017 when it was obvious to everybody who knew what was going on \u2014 NOT the cabinet obviously \u2014 that this effectively ended the \u2018negotiations\u2019? Remember how Bernard Jenkin wrote on ConHome that he didn\u2019t have to \u2018ruin his weekend\u2019 reading the document to know it was another success for the natural party of government \u2013 bringing to mind very clearly how during the referendum so many of you guys were too busy shooting or skiing or chasing girls to do any actual work. You should be treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic. Cummings has been contemptuous of backbench Tory Brexiters in the Commons for years. During the EU referendum campaign he used to refer to them as the \u201cflying monkeys\u201d. He suggests the UK could in future abandon any commitments it makes to the EU as part of the Brexit settlement. In a message directed at Vote Leave activists, he says: Also, don\u2019t worry about the so-called \u2018permanent\u2019 commitments this historically abysmal cabinet are trying to make on our behalf. They are not \u2018permanent\u2019 and a serious government \u2013 one not cowed by officials and their bullshit \u2018legal advice\u2019 with which they have herded ministers like sheep \u2013 will dispense with these commitments and any domestic law enforcing them. Cummings used to be an adviser to Michael Gove, the environment secretary, when Gove was education secretary. Gove has also suggested that over time the UK could harden up any Brexit settlement, although he has not gone as far as Cummings, who is suggesting the UK could easily renege on any promises made to the EU. (Cummings seems to be forgetting that they do read this stuff in Brussels. That\u2019s one of the reasons why the EU has been determined to ensure the withdrawal agreement is legally watertight.) The campaign director of the official Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings has been found to be in contempt of parliament after he failed to appear before MPs investigating fake news. As the Press Association reports, the Commons privileges committee said in a report that Cummings\u2019 refusal to give oral evidence constituted a \u201csignificant interference\u201d in the work of the inquiry. However it acknowledged its sanctions were limited to recommending the Commons issue a formal \u201cadmonishment\u201d for his conduct, raising questions about its enforcement powers. The admonishment would require a resolution of the house which, if passed, \u201cshould be communicated to Cummings by the clerk of the house\u201d, the committee said in its report. Cummings was found in contempt because he refused to appear before the Commons culture committee to give evidence for its \u201cfake news\u201d and disinformation inquiry. Damian Collins, the chair of the culture committee, said: The Dominic Cummings case highlights the need for parliament to define in law what its powers should be to require witnesses to attend hearings, and what sanctions should apply if they do not. The current powers have been tested to their limits and found wanting. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, has said that, regardless of what his shadow cabinet colleague Barry Gardiner said on the Today programme about the confirmatory public vote amendment (see 9.33am), he will be backing the amendment. The Labour MP Wes Streeting has also rejected Gardiner\u2019s argument. And the Labour MP Jess Phillips has too. Labour sources are saying the party has not yet decided whether its MPs will be whipped to vote for or against the confirmatory public vote amendment, or whether they will be given a free vote. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, has been tweeting ahead of this afternoon\u2019s Commons vote. Verhofstadt also says the People\u2019s Vote march in London at the weekend would mark the beginning of the campaign to take the UK back into the EU. (People\u2019s Vote will not necessarily welcome this. They are still hoping to get a referendum that might stop the UK leaving in the first place.) The Financial Times political editor, George Parker, says any offer by Theresa May to agree to stand down in return for Tory Brexiters backing her Brexit deal might not be spelled out in public. Some Tory Brexiters have been openly calling for May\u2019s resignation, while others, like Boris Johnson (here), have been making the same demand more obliquely, stressing the need for new leadership in the next phase of the Brexit process. There are 16 Brexit plans on the order paper for today\u2019s debate. The Speaker, John Bercow, will announce which ones will be put to a vote, probably when the debate proper starts at about 3pm. You can read them all on the order paper here (pdf). And here is a Press Association guide to what they all are. Labour plan Labour has tabled a motion proposing its plan for a close economic relationship with the EU. The plan includes a comprehensive customs union with a UK say on future trade deals; close alignment with the single market; matching new EU rights and protections; participation in EU agencies and funding programmes; and agreement on future security arrangements, including access to the European arrest warrant. Common market 2.0 Tabled by Conservatives Nick Boles, Robert Halfon and Andrew Percy and Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, Lucy Powell and Diana Johnson. The motion proposes UK membership of the European free trade association and European Economic Area. It allows continued participation in the single market and a \u201ccomprehensive customs arrangement\u201d with the EU after Brexit, which would remain in place until the agreement of a wider trade deal which guarantees frictionless movement of goods and an open border in Ireland. Confirmatory public vote Drawn up by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson and tabled by former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett with the backing of scores of MPs across the House, this motion would require a public vote to confirm any Brexit deal passed by parliament before its ratification. Customs union Requires a commitment to negotiate a \u201cpermanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU\u201d in any Brexit deal. Tabled by veteran Conservative Europhile Ken Clarke, backed by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, Helen Goodman and chair of the Commons Brexit committee Hilary Benn and Tory former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Sarah Newton. Malthouse compromise Plan A A cross-party proposal calls for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement to be implemented with the controversial \u201cbackstop\u201d for the Irish border replaced by alternative arrangements. Backed by Conservatives from both the leave and remain wings of the party, including Nicky Morgan, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Damian Green, Steve Baker and Sir Graham Brady, as well as the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds and Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey. Revoke article 50 Under this plan, if the government has not passed its withdrawal agreement, it would have to stage a vote on a no-deal Brexit two sitting days before the scheduled date of departure. If MPs refuse to authorise no-deal, the prime minister would be required to halt Brexit by revoking article 50. The motion, tabled by the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry, has been signed by 33 MPs including the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw and all 11 members of the Independent Group. Revocation instead of no deal Under this plan, the government is called on to \u201curgently\u201d bring forward any legislation needed to revoke article 50 \u201cin the event that the house fails to approve any withdrawal agreement four days before the end of the article 50 period\u201d. It has been signed by 28 MPs, including the SNP\u2019s Angus Brendan MacNeil and Tory MP Ken Clarke. New customs union Tabled by Labour\u2019s MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, Gareth Snell, this motion simply states that it should be the government\u2019s objective to implement a trade agreement including a customs union with the EU. It mirrors an amendment to the trade bill secured by Labour peers in the House of Lords. EEA/EFTA without customs union A motion tabled by Conservative MP George Eustice \u2013 who quit as agriculture minister this month to fight for Brexit \u2013 proposes remaining within the EEA and rejoining Efta, but remaining outside a customs union with the EU. The motion was also signed by Conservative MPs including former minister Nicky Morgan and head of the Brexit Delivery Group Simon Hart. No deal Backed by Conservative MPs John Baron, David Amess, Martin Vickers and Stephen Metcalfe, the motion proposes leaving the European Union without a deal on April 12. Unilateral right of exit from backstop The same four Tory MPs, as well as Andrew Percy and Neil Parish, have also backed a motion to leave the EU on May 22 with the PM\u2019s withdrawal agreement amended to allow the UK to unilaterally exit the Northern Ireland backstop. Consent of devolved institutions Backed by SNP MPs including Ian Blackford, Kirsty Blackman and Stephen Gethins, this motion requires an agreement that the UK will not leave without a deal, and that no action for leaving the EU will be taken without a consent motion passed in both the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Contingent preferential arrangements A group of Conservative MPs, including Marcus Fysh, Steve Baker and Priti Patel, have signed a motion that calls for the government to seek to agree preferential trade arrangements with the EU, in case the UK is unable to implement a withdrawal agreement with the bloc. Contingent reciprocal arrangements A similar group of Tory MPs have backed a proposal calling for the government to \u201cat least reciprocate the arrangements put in place by the EU and or its member states to manage the period following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU\u201d, in case the UK is unable to implement a withdrawal agreement. Respect the referendum results A cross-party proposal, signed by 94 MPs including the Conservatives\u2019 Will Quince, Labour\u2019s Frank Field and the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds, urges the house to \u201creaffirm its commitment to honour the result of the referendum that the UK should leave the European Union\u201d. Constitutional and accountable government Tabled by Sir Bill Cash and other Tory Brexiters, this backs leaving the EU, rejects the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement and proposes changing Commons standing orders so that a two-thirds majority would be needed to allow any fresh attempt to allow indicative votes debates to take precedence over government business on any given day. Good morning. We are two days before the date originally set for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU and in the Commons they have gone back to the drawing board, holding a debate and votes on up to 16 alternative Brexit plans. And 7% of people still think the government is handling this process well. Here is our overnight preview story. And here are the main developments this morning. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has said the government hopes to be able to hold a third vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal later this week. In an interview on the Today programme she said: I think that there is a real possibility that it does. We are completely determined to make sure that we can get enough support to bring it back. Leadsom refused to comment on speculation that May could tell Tory MPs tonight that she will stand down as prime minister if her deal gets passed. \u201cI am fully supporting the prime minister to get us out of the European Union,\u201d Leadsom said. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has said that Labour could have difficulty backing a plan for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit agreement. The amendment was originally drawn up by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, but is on today\u2019s order paper with Dame Margaret Beckett as the lead signatory. In an interview on the Today programme, Gardiner said that if Labour voted for it, that could suggest it was a remain party, which was not the case. He said, under the terms of the motion, a referendum could be a choice between May\u2019s deal or staying in the EU. He went on: It would be saying we could accept what we have always said is a very bad deal. Therefore it looks as if the attempt to have a public vote on it is simply a way of trying to remain because nobody likes this deal. To put that up as the only alternative in a public vote and say we will let it go through looks as though you believe that at the end of it remain would be the result. It is not where our policy has been. Our policy is clearly that we would support a public vote to stop no-deal or to stop a bad deal, but not that we would allow a bad deal as long as the public had the opportunity to reject Brexit altogether. That implies that you are a remain party. The Labour party is not a remain party now. We have accepted the result of the referendum. But earlier Peter Kyle told the same programme that Jeremy Corbyn would order Labour MPs to back the Beckett amendment. He said: [Corbyn] will order MPs to vote for this. We had a really constructive process of engaging with him. At no point was he instinctively against this. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative MP who tabled the amendment that set up today\u2019s indicative votes process, said that if the government ignored the plan backed by most MPs, the Commons could legislate to force it to respond. He said that he did not expect there to be a majority for any one idea today, but that on Monday, when there is due to be another indicative votes debate, MPs could unite behind one plan. He went on: If on Monday one or more propositions get a majority backing in the House of Commons, then we will have to work with the government to implement them. The way I would hope it would happen under those circumstances is that we would have sensible, workmanlike discussions across the House of Commons and the government would move forward in an orderly fashion. If the government didn\u2019t agree to that, then those who I am working with across the parties will move to legislate to mandate the government - if we can obtain majorities in the House of Commons and House of Lords for that - to carry that forward. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has said the almost 6 million people who have signed the revoke article 50 petition should not be ignored. Speaking in a debate in the European parliament, he criticised those who say it would be unacceptable for the UK to have a long article 50 extension because it would have to hold European elections. He explained: Let me be clear, such thinking is unacceptable. You cannot betray the six million people who signed the petition to revoke article 50, the one million people who marched for a people\u2019s vote, or the increasing majority of people who want to remain in the European Union. They may feel that they are not sufficiently represented by their UK parliament, but they must feel that they are represented by you in this chamber because they are Europeans. The government has formally responded to the revoke article 50 petition, saying no. It says: This government will not revoke article 50. We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leading Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, has used an article in the Daily Mail to apologise to his supporters for changing his mind on May\u2019s Brexit deal. He is now ready to vote for it, he says, if the DUP backs it too, because the alternative could be a long delay to Brexit, leading to the UK staying in the EU. Another leading Brexiter, Boris Johnson, has also signalled he will vote for the deal. In a speech last night, reprinted on the Telegraph\u2019s front page (paywall), he said: If we vote for the PM\u2019s lamentable withdrawal agreement we are skewered. We run the risk of either weakening the union, or else being forced to remain effectively part of the single market and customs union. But if we vote it down again there is now I think an appreciable risk that we will not leave at all. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives evidence to the Northern Ireland affairs committee. 9.30am: The People\u2019s Vote campaign holds a press conference. 10.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to the Commons environment committee on Brexit. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 1pm: MPs begin debating the business motion for today\u2019s indicative votes debate. After 3pm: MPs begin the indicative votes debate. 5pm: May addresses the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee. 7pm: MPs vote on the indicative votes options. 7.30pm: MPs debate the statutory instrument changing the date of Brexit set out in the EU Withdrawal Act. Around 9.15pm: John Bercow, the speaker, announces the results of the indicative votes ballot.
