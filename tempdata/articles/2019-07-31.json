I am, however, disappointed that you did not mention that many people who have applied for asylum are also caught up in this, having had their asylum claim rejected and been granted discretionary leave to remain instead. So after suffering hardship, persecution and possibly torture in their own countries, having made the difficult decision to leave their homeland, and having struggled for years through the UK asylum system with the humiliations and frustrations that entails, they too are now caught in the DLR trap.

I am, however, disappointed that you did not mention that many people who have applied for asylum are also caught up in this, having had their asylum claim rejected and been granted discretionary leave to remain instead. So after suffering hardship, persecution and possibly torture in their own countries, having made the difficult decision to leave their homeland, and having struggled for years through the UK asylum system with the humiliations and frustrations that entails, they too are now caught in the DLR trap.

Her comments did not go down well with Jeremy Corbyn and his closest advisers, who don\u2019t want Labour to be defined principally as a remain party, and it was widely assumed that this led to Thornberry being \u2018punished\u2019 when she was not allowed to stand in for Corbyn at the next PMQs when he was absent.</p> <p>But this does not seem to have discouraged Thornberry. <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/news/105676/emily-thornberry-warns-jeremy-corbyn-labour-would\">According to PoliticsHome</a>, in an interview in Australia Thornberry said Labour would be \u201coff our bloody rockers\u201d not to campaign for remain in all circumstances in any future referendum.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s official position on this has evolved. Earlier this year Corbyn firmly committed the party to backing a referendum on no deal, or a Tory Brexit deal, and then he went further, saying that if a future Labour government were to negotiate a Brexit deal, that would be put to a referendum too. He says, in a referendum on no deal or a Tory deal, Labour would back remain. But Corbyn has left open the option of Labour backing leave in a referendum on a deal negotiated by a Labour government, or at least staying neutral.</p> <p>Thornberry says, even if Labour negotiated its own Brexit deal, it should campaign for remain. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that any deal, or no deal, or whatever this government comes up with, should be put back to the British people so they can be asked: is this what you voted for? Because if you did, that\u2019s fine.</p> <p>But we don\u2019t think it is what you voted for. And I\u2019m firmly of the view that Labour\u2019s policy should be that whatever deal a government comes up with \u2013 no ifs, no buts, as Boris Johnson says \u2013 we should put it back to the people, we should have another referendum, and that Labour should campaign to remain.</p> <p>When I\u2019ve been talking to people here in Australia ... what\u2019s really come home to me is that one of the reasons for the increased success of the Australian economy ... is that you increased your trade with your closest neighbours, and yet in Britain what we\u2019re doing is walking away from our closest neighbours and our biggest trading allies.</p> <p>And people that I\u2019ve spoken to here appreciate that, and I have to say practically all of them ... have said if we get an opportunity to remain in the European Union, we should take it. Because if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re off our bloody rockers.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f8db43d350358510ae7812f2b580ef09e025188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f8db43d350358510ae7812f2b580ef09e025188/0_233_4287_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Thornberry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Thornberry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d416e2b8f0896be8f8f093f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-31T10:34:56.678Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Naomi Long,</strong> the Alliance party leader and MEP, does not seem to have been impressed by Boris Johnson when they met, according to the BBC\u2019s <strong>Jayne McCormack.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCJayneMcC/status/1156504140866101248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/naomi_long?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@naomi_long</a> says she had a \u201cfrank\u201d discussion and exchange of views with the PM on Brexit and that the deadlock over it is affecting the Stormont talks.

If that was his thinking before his meeting with the Sinn Fein delegation this morning, it didn\u2019t work because <strong>Mary Lou McDonald,</strong> the Sinn Fein president, was fairly scathing when she spoke at her press briefing afterwards. Sinn Fein leaders never come away from meetings with British prime ministers exuding joy and goodwill (and mostly DUP leaders don\u2019t either), but even by Sinn Fein standards, this was quite withering. Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McDonald accused Johnson of being \u201ccomplacent\u201d about the damage Brexit would cause the whole of Ireland. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no doubt that Boris Johnson\u2019s first priority coming to Ireland is his interest, Tory interest, British interests, as he sees them, and it seems to me that he is quite complacent at the idea of Ireland being the collateral damage. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that nobody believed Johnson\u2019s claim (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/31/boris-johnson-holds-talks-in-belfast-as-sinn-fein-says-border-poll-must-follow-no-deal-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d4143218f0845f89e3179e9#block-5d4143218f0845f89e3179e9\">9.29am)</a> to be impartial between the DUP and Sinn Fein.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He tells us that he will act with absolute impartiality. We\u2019ve told him that nobody believes that. Nobody believes that because there are no grounds to believe that there is any kind of impartiality, much less strict impartiality.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the Tory/DUP confidence and supply agreement had \u201cpoisoned the groundwater\u201d in Northern Ireland politically. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have told him that the confidence and supply agreement between the Tories and the DUP poisoned the groundwater here politically and made it very, very, very difficult to sustain a negotiation, much less to land on a conclusion or an agreement.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said Johnson had to stop acting like the DUP\u2019s gofer. </strong>She said Johnson asked the Sinn Fein team for their advice. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have strongly advised that to make progress here he needs to ensure that he is not the DUP\u2019s gofer. He needs to stop mollycoddling them.

The meeting was, the Guardian understands, overwhelming positive, and covered a lot of ground in terms of how Westminster can best serve Scotland.</p> <p>Responding to Blackford\u2019s letter, a Scottish Conservatives spokesman said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re not going to jump ahead 15 stages or deal with hypotheticals \u2013 everyone\u2019s focus is getting a deal done with the EU that can get through parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the fact remains that Davidson has quite a circle to square. Should Johnson call a general election on a platform of no deal, how will she stand, given her own stated opposition and the knowledge that \u2013 as Blackford points out \u2013 her party in Scotland has lost significant numbers of votes to the Brexit party? Will she call on her own MPs to vote against the prime minister?

The last time he was here, for a hustings during the Tory leadership contest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/02/tory-leadership-latest-news-hustings-boris-johnsons-brexit-plan-could-prove-fatal-to-tory-party-says-former-leader-william-hague-live-news?page=with:block-5d1b64c48f082cc21811c0c6#block-5d1b64c48f082cc21811c0c6\">he sounded as if he knew almost nothing about the reasons for the suspension of the power-sharing executive. </a>He should be better informed by lunchtime. We\u2019ll find out, because he is expected to address the media later.</p> <p>Johnson himself and others have also been speaking to the media ahead of the talks, at Stormont and on the usual morning programmes. Here are some of the points they have been making.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson claimed that the UK government will be bound by \u201ccomplete impartiality\u201d as it oversees talks designed to get the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland up and running again. </strong>The DUP is propping up the Conservative government at Westminster through the confidence and supply arrangement, and last night Johnson had a private dinner with DUP leaders. But the government is also supposed to be neutral as it mediates between DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in on restoring power-sharing. Asked how impartial he would be in the light of the dinner with the DUP last night, Johnson said as he arrived at Stormont this morning:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s all there in the Good Friday agreement. We believe in complete impartiality and that\u2019s what we are going to observe.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said he would be focusing on getting the executive functioning again.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Clearly the people in Northern Ireland have been without a government, without Stormont, for two years and six months so my prime focus this morning is to do everything I can to help that get up and running again because I think that\u2019s profoundly in the interests of people here, of all the citizens here in Northern Ireland.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he attached \u201chuge importance to the letter, spirit of the Belfast/ Good Friday agreement and will be insisting on that\u201d. </strong>He was speaking in the context of Brexit, and addressing claims that a no-deal Brexit would undermine the Good Friday agreement.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in president, said that Brexit changes the terms of debate in Northern Ireland, boosting the case for Irish reunification. </strong>Speaking on the Today programme, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Traditionally the argument and the discourse [in Northern Ireland] has been between green and orange, between Irishness and Britishness. But Brexit changed that and added a new dimension, a critical dimension, which is European or not? Inside the European Union or not? And for the purposes of the north of Ireland, a very direct choice, economically, socially, politically, as to whether or not this part of the island wishes to become a sort of backwater, marooned somewhere between the Tories in Number 10 and the very, very destructive agenda of the DUP.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said there were now unionists willing to consider the case for reunification following Brexit. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For everybody across society, Brexit has raised fundamental questions around the wisdom and the sustainability of the partition of our island which we have lived with now since the 1920s ... It\u2019s changed the entire political dynamic, it has changed the parameters of the conversation. In the course of the debate that we will have about constitutional change, lots of people for whom a united Ireland would still not be their first preference, who would still have a strong attachment to union, even they now are willing and eager to have the conversation [about Irish reunification].</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said it would be \u201cscandalous\u201d to refuse Northern Ireland a referendum on joining a united Ireland after a no deal Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the event of a hard Brexit and a crash Brexit, I don\u2019t know for the life of me how anybody could sustain an argument that things remain the same ... </p> <p>I don\u2019t know how Britain could crash this part of Ireland out of the EU with all of the attendant harm and damage economically and politically and, with a straight face, suggest to any of us who live on this island that we should not be given the democratic opportunity as per the Good Friday agreement to decide our future. I think that would be quite scandalous.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she thought there were already grounds for holding a referendum in the north. </strong>Under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, the UK government is obliged to hold a referendum, or \u201cborder poll\u201d, if at any time it seems \u201clikely\u201d that a majority in the north would vote to form part of a united Ireland. McDonald said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a matter that I had explored at great length since I became the leader of Sinn Fein with Theresa May and with Karen Bradley [the former Northern Ireland secretary]. And I raised this matter with Julian Smith [the new Northern Ireland secretary] when I met him the other day. I think it\u2019s very important that the British system sets out very clearly for all of us what it and they would understand to be the point of threshold, the trigger point at which a border poll or a referendum would be called ...</p> <p>I think some of the thresholds have been met. I mean, this northern state is built on the assumption of a perpetual unionist majority. That political majority has been lost in three successive elections ... The demographic patterns have been well discussed and well aired and they are moving in on direction. That for me is not the most compelling of arguments but it is a reality.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said that her party\u2019s confidence and supply arrangement with the Tories was still in place. </strong>On the subject of continuing it, she told Sky News it was not just a matter of money. For example, she said her party particularly welcomed Johnson\u2019s decision to appoint a veterans minister and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-creates-new-office-for-veterans-affairs-to-provide-lifelong-support-to-military-personnel\">to set up an office for veterans\u2019 affairs</a> because, she said, Northern Ireland has more people in the armed forces per head of population than anywhere else in the UK.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP\u2019s chief whip, told the Today programme he thought the risks of a no deal Brexit were now \u201csignificant\u201d. </strong>Asked about claims this could lead 40,000 jobs being lost in Northern Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/2019/0731/1066165-boris-johnson-in-belfast/\">he said that estimate was at the \u201cvery high end of the scale\u201d.</a></li> </ul> <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has wrapped up a morning of talks with the five main parties in Northern Ireland having heard multiple warnings from them about how damaging a no deal Brexit would be (see 11.06am, 11.16am, and 12.10pm). It was his first visit to Northern Ireland as prime minister, and his first proper engagement with the parties, but there was no sign that he had made any progress towards getting Sinn Fein and the DUP to agree to the resumption of power-sharing. It would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d if a no-deal Brexit was not followed by a poll on Irish reunification, the leader of Sinn F\u00e9in has warned Boris Johnson, also telling the prime minister that no one believed he was impartial on Northern Ireland. Any future US-UK trade deal would almost certainly be blocked by the US Congress if Brexit affects the Irish border and jeopardises peace in Northern Ireland, congressional leaders and diplomats have warned. Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry has said the party would be \u201coff our bloody rockers\u201d not to seize the chance to remain in the EU via a second referendum, in an interview which put her at odds with comments from Jeremy Corbyn over the weekend. Investment in Britain\u2019s car industry has effectively stopped amid fears over Brexit, with a \u201cpitiful\u201d \u00a390m pledged for new developments in the first six months of this year, according to the industry body. Campaigners have called for the government to scrap the \u201cnasty\u201d two-child limit on benefits after the latest official figures showed that nearly 600,000 children were affected by the controversial policy. Boris Johnson has sent his most senior EU adviser and Brexit negotiator to Brussels to deliver in person his message that the UK will leave without a deal unless the bloc abolishes the Irish backstop. As Daniel Boffey reports, David Frost, a former British ambassador to Denmark who was also an adviser to Johnson when he was foreign secretary, is to hold talks with EU officials over the next 48 hours. Labour has written to the elections watchdog urging pre-emptive action to ensure a US-based pro-Brexit lobbying group, co-run by Nigel Farage, does not risk \u201cdark money\u201d from overseas subverting the UK electoral system. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The YouGov poll (see 3.47pm) was commissioned by the Times. In the write-up in the paper (paywall), Matt Chorley points out that it reveals a striking gender gap in voting intention. A breakdown of the results shows support for the Tories among men has risen from 23 per cent to 35 per cent since [Boris] Johnson was named leader. Among women it rose by one point to 29 per cent. At the same time support for Labour among women has risen from 19 per cent to 25 per cent. Another way of putting it would be to say that, amongst men, the Tories have a 16-point lead over Labour (35% v 19%). Amongst women the Tory lead is just four points (29% v 25%). You can read all the detailed figures here (pdf). YouGov has some polling out today that is encouraging for Boris Johnson. As the YouGov write-up says, the figures are also grim for Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson is still the public\u2019s preferred prime minister over Jeremy Corbyn, with twice as many people choosing the former (42%) over the latter (21%). A further 34% of people can\u2019t choose between the two. Here is Matthew Goodwin, an academic specialism in the study of populism, commenting on the poll. After Boris Johnson left Stormont the new Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, called the parties together for a meeting. Afterwards he said: Following my initial meetings with the political parties this week and last, I met with the leaders of the five main parties this afternoon to move the talks process forward. I have asked the five independent working group leads to hold further meetings and report back early next week. I will discuss further steps with the Irish government once I have received their reports. It is my priority to restore devolution as soon as possible. This is from the Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald on Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Belfast. In the comments someone asked if Boris Johnson visited the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency when he was in Wales yesterday. There had been no media, so I posted a reply saying he hadn\u2019t. But I was wrong; he did visit. This is from Iain McIntosh, a local Tory councillor. As Sky\u2019s Emily Ashton points out, it is unusual for a politician to do a visit like that and not to include a walkabout. In their comments after their meeting with Boris Johnson, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, both criticised the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. Foster said described comments Varadkar made last week suggesting a no deal Brexit could increase the chance of Ireland being reunited as \u201cproject fear mark two from the taoiseach\u201d. And Dodds criticised him for talking up the prospect of a border poll. He said: Leo Varadkar is in breach of the Belfast agreement by talking that up. The reality is that the conditions are not met and those who create this hysteria about it are actually running contrary to the agreement. Let\u2019s get real here, the idea that many unionists will turn around and vote for a united Ireland on the basis of the current developments, I think, is something that is not reflected in the reality of people on the ground. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, and her deputy Nigel Dodds, both spoke to the media after their discussions with Boris Johnson. Here are the main points they made. Foster said Johnson had told them he would be never be neutral on the issue of the union. But the UK government would be neutral on the administration of government within Northern Ireland, she said. She said people should not confuse the two issues, which were different. She said Johnson had told them he was not minded to have a border poll in Northern Ireland, as Sinn Fein is demanding. (See 9.29am.) She said: Talk of a border poll, he told us, was not something that he was entertaining. Dodds said Johnson had told them he was \u201cvery, very committed\u201d to carrying forward the confidence and supply agreement between the DUP and the Tories. Foster and Dodds both strongly defended the agreement. Dodds said Sinn Fein were wrong to claim it had \u201cpoisoned the groundwater\u201d in Northern Ireland politically. (See 11.06am.) And Foster said it had benefited everyone in Northern Ireland. She explained: The confidence and supply agreement has been good for the people of Northern Ireland. You would think, to hear some people, it\u2019s a bad thing that has been visited on the people of Northern Ireland. We have delivered an extra \u00a31bn for the people of Northern Ireland which they would not otherwise have if it were not for the relationship between ourselves and the current government. Dodds rejected claims that a no deal Brexit would create an insuperable problem at the Irish border. He explained: There is a border, of course there\u2019s a border. We are not the united Ireland. We have a political border, we have a fiscal border, we have a currency border, we have a VAT border, we have a security border. So clearly there will be borders. But the issue is, how do we manage checks and controls so that there is no hard border. The Irish government have already made the point that that can be done away from the border even in the event of a no deal. Foster urged the Irish government to \u201cdial down the rhetoric\u201d and engage with Johnson. She said: There are ways to with this issue [the backstop] if there is a willingness on both sides. And so I hope that Dublin will dial down the rhetoric and there will be a willingness to engage with our new prime minister. Foster said it would be a mistake for Johnson to rule out going for a no deal Brexit if he cannot get a better deal from Brussels. She explained: I sometimes wonder have people ever been in negotiations when they take things off the table before you get to the end of a negotiation. Of course you keep it on the table. Dodds rejected suggestions that it was inappropriate for Johnson to have a private dinner with DUP leaders last night. He said the DUP talk to the government at Westminster all the time. Boris Johnson has now finished his talks with the five main Northern Ireland parties, and he has left Stormont. From what the parties have been saying, there is no sign that he has made any progress towards reviving the power-sharing executive. Downing Street has released this statement about his talks. The prime minister met five of Northern Ireland\u2019s main political parties today in Belfast. The overarching purpose of these meetings was to discuss moving forward in the ongoing power sharing talks and getting the Northern Irish democratic institutions back up and running as soon as possible. The prime minister told all of the parties that he was determined to bring this process to a successful conclusion and that he would do everything he could to make it happen. He said that while there had been constructive progress in recent weeks at Stormont, that there now needed to be serious and intense engagement to get this done and that he had faith that all parties would step up to the challenge. The discussions also included Brexit, where the prime minister made clear that the UK would be leaving the EU on October come what may, and restated his intention to do so with a deal. He said that in all scenarios, the government is steadfast in its commitment to the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and that in no circumstances would there be physical checks or infrastructure on the border. He also made clear his belief and commitment in the rigorous impartiality set out in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, while at the same time reaffirming his determination to strengthen the Union and Northern Ireland\u2019s place within it. They also discussed what the UK government could do to support Harland &amp; Wolff and Wrightbus. Alongside the new secretary of state, Julian Smith, he said he was looking forward to engaging widely and seeing more of this fantastic part of our United Kingdom. Jeremy Corbyn has urged Boris Johnson to nationalise the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Northern Ireland to stop it closing. When George Osborne was chancellor, as part of his austerity programme, which concentrated heavily on welfare cuts, he introduced a \u2018two-child rule\u201d which meant people could not claim child tax credits or the child element of universal credit for more than two children from April 2017. It was sometimes referred to as the \u201crape clause\u201d because among the exceptions allowed were mothers who could prove their third child was conceived as a result of rape. Today HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions have published a document (pdf) showing how many people have been affected. It says that since 2017 almost 160,000 households have lost money as a result. More than 60,000 of those are single-parent households, as this graph shows. The total number of children in these households is almost 600,000. The figures also show that 510 women have been granted an exception due to the \u201crape clause\u201d, or \u201cnon-consensual conception\u201d, as the report puts it. Child tax credits or the child element of universal credit can be worth \u00a32,780 to families with two children. Commenting on today\u2019s figures, Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: Every child deserves a good start in life, but today\u2019s figures are a grim reminder of the human cost of this nasty policy, which says that some children are more deserving than others purely on the basis of their birth order - and which mostly affects working families. In the UK we would never turn a third-born child away from school or hospital. How can it be right to deny the same young children the support they need to enjoy a childhood free from poverty when their family falls on hard times? Back at Stormont Nichola Mallon, the deputy leader of the SDLP, said Boris Johnson does not understand the issues facing Northern Ireland after her team met the prime minister. This is from the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack. This is from UTV\u2019s Tracey Magee. And this is what Mallon said on Twitter earlier, before her meeting. After Labour was beaten by the Lib Dems in the European elections Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said the party should have been been more explicitly pro-remain. Her comments did not go down well with Jeremy Corbyn and his closest advisers, who don\u2019t want Labour to be defined principally as a remain party, and it was widely assumed that this led to Thornberry being \u2018punished\u2019 when she was not allowed to stand in for Corbyn at the next PMQs when he was absent. But this does not seem to have discouraged Thornberry. According to PoliticsHome, in an interview in Australia Thornberry said Labour would be \u201coff our bloody rockers\u201d not to campaign for remain in all circumstances in any future referendum. Labour\u2019s official position on this has evolved. Earlier this year Corbyn firmly committed the party to backing a referendum on no deal, or a Tory Brexit deal, and then he went further, saying that if a future Labour government were to negotiate a Brexit deal, that would be put to a referendum too. He says, in a referendum on no deal or a Tory deal, Labour would back remain. But Corbyn has left open the option of Labour backing leave in a referendum on a deal negotiated by a Labour government, or at least staying neutral. Thornberry says, even if Labour negotiated its own Brexit deal, it should campaign for remain. She said: I think that any deal, or no deal, or whatever this government comes up with, should be put back to the British people so they can be asked: is this what you voted for? Because if you did, that\u2019s fine. But we don\u2019t think it is what you voted for. And I\u2019m firmly of the view that Labour\u2019s policy should be that whatever deal a government comes up with \u2013 no ifs, no buts, as Boris Johnson says \u2013 we should put it back to the people, we should have another referendum, and that Labour should campaign to remain. When I\u2019ve been talking to people here in Australia ... what\u2019s really come home to me is that one of the reasons for the increased success of the Australian economy ... is that you increased your trade with your closest neighbours, and yet in Britain what we\u2019re doing is walking away from our closest neighbours and our biggest trading allies. And people that I\u2019ve spoken to here appreciate that, and I have to say practically all of them ... have said if we get an opportunity to remain in the European Union, we should take it. Because if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re off our bloody rockers. Naomi Long, the Alliance party leader and MEP, does not seem to have been impressed by Boris Johnson when they met, according to the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack. In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which is calling for a second referendum on Brexit, Peter Hain, the former Labour Northern Ireland secretary, says Boris Johnson should be speaking to people living by the border with Ireland on his visit to find out what Brexit will mean. Hain says: Boris Johnson is using Northern Ireland for stake money in his gamble with the future of the UK. He is willing to see security and progress threatened, damaged or even destroyed if it helps him in his drive to push the UK out of the EU without the people being given the final say. Maybe Mr Johnson should spend more time talking to ordinary people in the towns and villages by the border, where the local economies face devastation if no deal is forced on them. After twenty-one years of progress since the Belfast agreement it is disgraceful that Boris Johnson has so little grip on the realities of Northern Ireland\u2019s finely balanced politics that he believes a simple promise not to put infrastructure on the frontier line itself solves all problems. Enforcing new customs checks, wherever they come, will mean massively increasing state intrusion into the lives and businesses of those who regularly cross the border and that poses a real threat to the economy - and ultimately to security. Boris Johnson cannot have his no deal or hard Brexit and keep the border open and invisible. All of this is a million miles away from anything discussed in the referendum campaign and that is why it is essential we have a people\u2019s vote. The Ulster Unionist party told Boris Johnson that it did not want a no deal Brexit, the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack reports. There are various protests going on at Stormont to mark Boris Johnson\u2019s visit. This picture shows anti-Brexit protesters and pro-rights campaigners who are standing together under the statue of Edward Carson. And these are Harland and Wolff employees, who are campaigning to save their shipyard. Boris Johnson sometimes seem to think that he can win people over with a bit of personal charm. If that was his thinking before his meeting with the Sinn Fein delegation this morning, it didn\u2019t work because Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Fein president, was fairly scathing when she spoke at her press briefing afterwards. Sinn Fein leaders never come away from meetings with British prime ministers exuding joy and goodwill (and mostly DUP leaders don\u2019t either), but even by Sinn Fein standards, this was quite withering. Here are the main points. McDonald accused Johnson of being \u201ccomplacent\u201d about the damage Brexit would cause the whole of Ireland. She said: There is no doubt that Boris Johnson\u2019s first priority coming to Ireland is his interest, Tory interest, British interests, as he sees them, and it seems to me that he is quite complacent at the idea of Ireland being the collateral damage. She said that nobody believed Johnson\u2019s claim (see 9.29am) to be impartial between the DUP and Sinn Fein. She said: He tells us that he will act with absolute impartiality. We\u2019ve told him that nobody believes that. Nobody believes that because there are no grounds to believe that there is any kind of impartiality, much less strict impartiality. She said the Tory/DUP confidence and supply agreement had \u201cpoisoned the groundwater\u201d in Northern Ireland politically. She said: We have told him that the confidence and supply agreement between the Tories and the DUP poisoned the groundwater here politically and made it very, very, very difficult to sustain a negotiation, much less to land on a conclusion or an agreement. She said Johnson had to stop acting like the DUP\u2019s gofer. She said Johnson asked the Sinn Fein team for their advice. She went on: We have strongly advised that to make progress here he needs to ensure that he is not the DUP\u2019s gofer. He needs to stop mollycoddling them. He needs to spell out the realities of life to them. She criticised what he has said about how Northern Ireland addresses legacy issues (ie, killings during the Troubles). She said: We have advised him that his commentary thus far on these issues as British prime minister has been damaging and very, very dangerous. That seemed to be a reference to Johnson telling Tory MPs, in his first address to the 1922 Committee as party leader, that the persecution of military veterans facing historical allegations over their conduct in Northern Ireland has \u201cgot to stop\u201d. She said her team told Johnson that it would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d to refuse to allow Northern Ireland a border poll in the event of a no deal Brexit. See 9.29am for more on McDonald\u2019s thinking on this. She said the DUP were denying the people of Northern Ireland their rights. She said: The DUP have used every contrivance to frustrate social and political progress here and to ensure the continuing denial of rights. They have used this as a ruse to really trample on the views of the majority of people who live here, whether it\u2019s in relation to rights issues or in relation to Brexit. This was a particular reference to the DUP\u2019s opposition to marriage equality for Northern Ireland and to legislation to benefit Irish language speakers. She said any move to direct rule in Northern Ireland - something the government has not ruled out in the event of a no deal Brexit - would be unacceptable and very dangerous in turning the clock back. At Stormont Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Fein president, is speaking to the media following the Sinn Fein delegations meeting with Boris Johnson. She says they stressed their opposition to a no deal Brexit, and their view that no deal would justify another border poll. She says Sinn Fein accused the DUP of holding up the restoration of power-sharing. She says Johnson assured them he would be impartial in dealings between the DUP and Sinn Fein. She says they told him that no one believed that. McDonald says her team told Johnson no one believes his claim to be impartial between the DUP and Sinn Fein. She is now taking questions. In response to a question about the DUP, she says there is an axis between the DUP and the Tories. She says the Tories will do anything and everything to remain in government. In coming to Ireland, he is only interested in his interests and Britain\u2019s interests. He says Johnson is \u201ccomplacent\u201d about Ireland suffering collateral damage from a no deal Brexit. Sinn Fein accuses Johnson of being \u201ccomplacent\u201d about risks to Ireland from a no deal Brexit. In her Today programme interview this morning Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Fein\u2019s president, said she has been asking the UK government to explain what needs to happen for another referendum to take place in Northern Ireland on joining a united Ireland. (See 9.29am.) The last one was in 1973. This Institute for Government briefing sets out some possible criteria that might apply. As part of the Good Friday Agreement, an explicit provision for holding a Northern Ireland border poll was made in UK law. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that \u201cif at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland\u201d, the secretary of state shall make an order in council enabling a border poll. It is not clear exactly what would satisfy this requirement. The Constitution Unit suggests that a consistent majority in opinion polls, a Catholic majority in a census, a nationalist majority in the Northern Ireland assembly, or a vote by a majority in the assembly could all be considered evidence of majority support for a united Ireland. However, the secretary of state must ultimately decide whether the condition has been met. The IfG note also includes this chart on polling that undermines McDonald\u2019s claim that support for Irish reunification in the north is rising. The Scottish Conservatives have said they will not \u201cdeal with hypotheticals\u201d after the SNP challenged Ruth Davidson to give \u201ca cast-iron guarantee\u201d that her MPs will vote to block a no-deal Brexit. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Davidson, pointing to suggestions that her opposition to a no deal Brexit is \u201clittle more than meaningless empty rhetoric ...a cynical PR exercise designed to distance you from Boris Johnson, in the knowledge that the Tory party is tanking in the polls in Scotland and came fourth place in the European elections on just 11%\u201d. The letter comes after Boris Johnson visited Scotland on Monday, meeting both first minister Nicola Sturgeon and Davidson, who warned the prime minister on the eve of his visit that she could not support a no deal Brexit. The read-out from their meeting was resolutely reassured, saying that she backed his Brexit strategy \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d. The meeting was, the Guardian understands, overwhelming positive, and covered a lot of ground in terms of how Westminster can best serve Scotland. Responding to Blackford\u2019s letter, a Scottish Conservatives spokesman said: We\u2019re not going to jump ahead 15 stages or deal with hypotheticals \u2013 everyone\u2019s focus is getting a deal done with the EU that can get through parliament. But the fact remains that Davidson has quite a circle to square. Should Johnson call a general election on a platform of no deal, how will she stand, given her own stated opposition and the knowledge that \u2013 as Blackford points out \u2013 her party in Scotland has lost significant numbers of votes to the Brexit party? Will she call on her own MPs to vote against the prime minister? And how does she sell Johnson and his so-called \u2018war cabinet\u2019 to those centre right voters who signed up to her re-framing on the Scottish Tories? The economic shock of a disorderly Brexit in Ireland would shrink employment by 34,000 jobs by the end of next year, the country\u2019s central bank has said. In its quarterly bulletin (pdf) it says GDP growth for 2019 would be reduced from 4.9% to 4.5% if there was a crash out on 31 October, but the country would suffer a massive hit 2020 with growth falling from 4.1 to 0.7 per cent. Household and business spending would fall while exports would fall \u201cdue to an immediate and large reduction in demand from the UK and the fall in sterling\u201d. \u201cAs a result, by the end of 2020 our estimates suggest that there would be around 34,000 fewer jobs in the economy compared to the level of employment that could be realised in a no-Brexit scenario,\u201d it says. However it warns that \u201cthere is an unavoidably high degree of uncertainty\u201d about the modelling of its forecasts because Brexit is without precedent. Boris Johnson is in Northern Ireland this morning where he has just started what will be a series of talks with the five main parties. The last time he was here, for a hustings during the Tory leadership contest, he sounded as if he knew almost nothing about the reasons for the suspension of the power-sharing executive. He should be better informed by lunchtime. We\u2019ll find out, because he is expected to address the media later. Johnson himself and others have also been speaking to the media ahead of the talks, at Stormont and on the usual morning programmes. Here are some of the points they have been making. Johnson claimed that the UK government will be bound by \u201ccomplete impartiality\u201d as it oversees talks designed to get the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland up and running again. The DUP is propping up the Conservative government at Westminster through the confidence and supply arrangement, and last night Johnson had a private dinner with DUP leaders. But the government is also supposed to be neutral as it mediates between DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in on restoring power-sharing. Asked how impartial he would be in the light of the dinner with the DUP last night, Johnson said as he arrived at Stormont this morning: It\u2019s all there in the Good Friday agreement. We believe in complete impartiality and that\u2019s what we are going to observe. He also said he would be focusing on getting the executive functioning again. Clearly the people in Northern Ireland have been without a government, without Stormont, for two years and six months so my prime focus this morning is to do everything I can to help that get up and running again because I think that\u2019s profoundly in the interests of people here, of all the citizens here in Northern Ireland. He said he attached \u201chuge importance to the letter, spirit of the Belfast/ Good Friday agreement and will be insisting on that\u201d. He was speaking in the context of Brexit, and addressing claims that a no-deal Brexit would undermine the Good Friday agreement. Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in president, said that Brexit changes the terms of debate in Northern Ireland, boosting the case for Irish reunification. Speaking on the Today programme, she said: Traditionally the argument and the discourse [in Northern Ireland] has been between green and orange, between Irishness and Britishness. But Brexit changed that and added a new dimension, a critical dimension, which is European or not? Inside the European Union or not? And for the purposes of the north of Ireland, a very direct choice, economically, socially, politically, as to whether or not this part of the island wishes to become a sort of backwater, marooned somewhere between the Tories in Number 10 and the very, very destructive agenda of the DUP. She said there were now unionists willing to consider the case for reunification following Brexit. She said: For everybody across society, Brexit has raised fundamental questions around the wisdom and the sustainability of the partition of our island which we have lived with now since the 1920s ... It\u2019s changed the entire political dynamic, it has changed the parameters of the conversation. In the course of the debate that we will have about constitutional change, lots of people for whom a united Ireland would still not be their first preference, who would still have a strong attachment to union, even they now are willing and eager to have the conversation [about Irish reunification]. She said it would be \u201cscandalous\u201d to refuse Northern Ireland a referendum on joining a united Ireland after a no deal Brexit. In the event of a hard Brexit and a crash Brexit, I don\u2019t know for the life of me how anybody could sustain an argument that things remain the same ... I don\u2019t know how Britain could crash this part of Ireland out of the EU with all of the attendant harm and damage economically and politically and, with a straight face, suggest to any of us who live on this island that we should not be given the democratic opportunity as per the Good Friday agreement to decide our future. I think that would be quite scandalous. She said she thought there were already grounds for holding a referendum in the north. Under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, the UK government is obliged to hold a referendum, or \u201cborder poll\u201d, if at any time it seems \u201clikely\u201d that a majority in the north would vote to form part of a united Ireland. McDonald said: This is a matter that I had explored at great length since I became the leader of Sinn Fein with Theresa May and with Karen Bradley [the former Northern Ireland secretary]. And I raised this matter with Julian Smith [the new Northern Ireland secretary] when I met him the other day. I think it\u2019s very important that the British system sets out very clearly for all of us what it and they would understand to be the point of threshold, the trigger point at which a border poll or a referendum would be called ... I think some of the thresholds have been met. I mean, this northern state is built on the assumption of a perpetual unionist majority. That political majority has been lost in three successive elections ... The demographic patterns have been well discussed and well aired and they are moving in on direction. That for me is not the most compelling of arguments but it is a reality. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said that her party\u2019s confidence and supply arrangement with the Tories was still in place. On the subject of continuing it, she told Sky News it was not just a matter of money. For example, she said her party particularly welcomed Johnson\u2019s decision to appoint a veterans minister and to set up an office for veterans\u2019 affairs because, she said, Northern Ireland has more people in the armed forces per head of population than anywhere else in the UK. Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP\u2019s chief whip, told the Today programme he thought the risks of a no deal Brexit were now \u201csignificant\u201d. Asked about claims this could lead 40,000 jobs being lost in Northern Ireland, he said that estimate was at the \u201cvery high end of the scale\u201d. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

In a sign of the mounting stress facing the economy, the pound has slumped to the lowest level against the US dollar for 28 months amid rising fears that Johnson may pursue a no-deal Brexit. The slide in sterling comes as economic growth dips to stalling point. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), a leading thinktank, said this month there is a one-in-four chance the UK has already tipped into recession even before the threat of a disorderly departure on 31 October. Global economic growth is also slowing against the backdrop of the US-China trade war, with the impact spilling back on Britain. However, economic growth has been supported by consumers continuing to spend, despite a slowdown in activity among businesses as they put spending decisions on hold. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit stance represented the biggest threat to a fragile economy. \u201cCompany bosses continue to warn Johnson against pursuing a no-deal Brexit and he ought to listen. Such a scenario is the biggest downside risk to the UK economy and would be a disaster for living standards,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. One met its forecast while two fell short of expectations. Presented with the challenge of Brexit alongside the global slowdown, the Bank will update its growth forecasts on Thursday with its quarterly inflation report and a press conference featuring its governor, Mark Carney. Threadneedle Street is expected to keep interest rates at 0.75% until there is greater clarity over Brexit, though economists widely believe the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal would trigger an emergency rate cut. Despite mounting concerns over the path ahead, the latest economic data revealed a mixed picture for Britain. Among bright spots was inflation remaining at the Bank\u2019s target rate of 2% for June and wage growth accelerating at the fastest annual rate since 2008, helping households to strengthen their finances. Consumer spending increased unexpectedly by 1% on the month in June, despite a forecast for a 0.3% contraction among City economists, in a sign that Britons tuned out of the political drama at Westminster. The under-pressure high street also put in a strong performance as retail sales rose by 3.8% on the year, also beating forecasts. However, there were signs of storm clouds gathering. Business surveys revealed a slump in company activity as Brexit uncertainty bites, with both the building and manufacturing sectors falling into contraction. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed the service sector barely recorded growth in June, in a sign GDP likely fell in the second quarter. The services sector, which ranges from banking to restaurants and hotels, accounts for around 80% of gross domestic product. Economists warned that activity would probably continue shrinking as the summer turns into autumn, because Johnson ramping up no-deal rhetoric could lead companies to put investment decisions on hold. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the MPC, said growth was slowing as Brexit loomed. Official figures for the second quarter are expected to be published next week, with some economists predicting a contraction of 0.2%. Sentance said the third quarter could be just as bad. \u201cThe current quarter is likely to be no better while there is so much talk of a no-deal Brexit. 2019 looks set to be another disappointing year for the UK economy,\u201d he said.",
