Smiling and joshing, they looked like partners in crime.</p> \n<p>The similarities between these two convulsions, separated by an ocean, range from the trivial to the grave. In the first category, how odd that in both countries the anointed tribune for anti-elite rage and channel for pent-up, nativist fury is a wealthy child of privilege once inseparably associated with the ultra-liberal metropolis. Johnson was the mayor of London who backed an amnesty for undocumented immigrants, Trump the Manhattan socialite who supported abortion rights and gun control. Yet both now pose as champions of the forgotten heartlands against the liberal establishment.</p> \n<p>In the second, more serious category, hovering over the turmoil in both Britain and the US has been the threat of violence. During the 2016 EU referendum campaign, MP Jo Cox was murdered; a few weeks later, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html\" title=\"\">hinted</a> that gun owners might deal with Hillary Clinton by taking the law into their own hands.</p> \n<p>This week, the Commons gasped as Johnson dismissed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/25/outrage-as-boris-johnson-dismisses-dangers-of-inflammatory-language-as-humbug-video\" title=\"\">\u201chumbug\u201d</a> a pained plea to learn the lesson of Cox\u2019s murder and drop the inflammatory talk of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d, language that has been adopted in the death threats that have rained down on so many MPs, women especially. In New York, Trump greeted the testimony of an unnamed whistleblower \u2013 who had revealed that the president had pressed the leader of Ukraine, needy for financial aid, to \u201cdo us a favour\u201d and dig for dirt on a political rival \u2013 with a barely veiled <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/26/20885603/trump-ukraine-whistleblower-spy-treason-threat\" title=\"\">threat</a> of his own: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart?

Both the Brexiters and Trump insist they are locked in a titanic struggle between \u201cthe people\u201d \u2013 with \u201cBoris\u201d or Trump as their champions \u2013 and the hated elite, comprised of anyone who might thwart their will: judges, journalists or even elected representatives. This leads in turn to the dilemma that has confronted those who would oppose Brexit or Trump. Is it wise to mount a challenge when that very challenge will confirm and strengthen the frame that Trump or the Brexiters have constructed? Put another way, is it wise to fight a populist when a fight is exactly what they want?</p> \n<p>In Britain, the dilemma was visible during that ugly Wednesday night in the Commons. Those MPs speaking of their alarm at the increasingly incendiary rhetoric of the Brexit debate had their anxiety etched on their faces. But Johnson was untroubled, insouciant throughout. That might have been because a debate about language provides a handy distraction from the week\u2019s central fact, the supreme court ruling, allowing him to wave aside that verdict as if it were a mere opinion with which he disagreed. (That\u2019s not how the law works. It is not a court\u2019s opinion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/peter-sutcliffe\" title=\"\">Peter Sutcliffe</a> was a murderer; it is a fact.)</p> \n<p>But might it not also have been because Johnson welcomes the outrage of a few teary MPs and their defenders on Twitter? After all, that\u2019s apparently been the Johnson strategy since the start: keep on acting appallingly, keep goading the remainers, keep inviting them to denounce and block you all the way to an election that you can fight as \u201cthe people v the elite\u201d. A debate about whether it\u2019s appropriate to brand a law preventing a no-deal Brexit as \u201cthe surrender act\u201d works well for Johnson, just as the row over the bogus \u00a3350m did in 2016, not least because it ensures the idea gets repeated on the airwaves ad nauseam: surrender, surrender, surrender.</p> \n<p>In the US, Pelosi was reluctant to move to impeachment because she feared it would give Trump the fight he relished. There they go again, he\u2019d say, Democrats and their friends in the \u201cfake news media\u201d using tricks to remove a president that you, the people, elected fair and square. He could play the victim, howling about witch-hunts and \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d, tapping into the deep sense of grievance that animates his base. The circus of televised hearings would provide precisely the polarised chaos in which he thrives.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of other good reasons not to go ahead. Right now impeachment looks doomed to fail: it requires the votes of 67 senators to remove a president from office, which means the defection of 20 Republicans. The liberal Republican wing whose desertion spelled the end for Richard Nixon is all but vanished now: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/what-have-tory-rebels-voted-for-and-will-an-election-now-happen\" title=\"\">21 brave Tories</a> who broke from Johnson have few counterparts on Capitol Hill. The notion of US public opinion shifting en masse against Trump is a stretch, too. US media consumption is now so partisan that Trump\u2019s base will only ever hear a story that exonerates him from guilt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8e23cecd-2522-407e-bb53-989b0937aa05\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1Q-pdDV_Fqk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The truth of Watergate was near-universally accepted in 1974; it\u2019s hard to imagine anything being universally accepted now. What\u2019s more, impeachment will consume Democratic energies, distracting them from their ongoing primary contest. When Democrats should be talking to US voters about healthcare, jobs and the climate crisis, they\u2019ll be talking instead about Ukraine, transcripts and secret servers.</p> \n<p>And yet they have no real choice. The politics of it may be fraught with risk, but it is their duty. The already known facts of the Ukraine episode establish a clear abuse of presidential power: Trump used the might of his office to advance not the country\u2019s interest but his own. Nor can you argue that the remedy for such behaviour is an (upcoming) election, because Trump\u2019s abuse was aimed at subverting that very election.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/27/tories-dominic-cummings-people-v-parliament-election\">Tory MPs beware: if you whip up an angry mob, they may end up angry with you</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Democrats face the same logic that confronted Johnson\u2019s opponents.</p> \n<p>Perhaps, politically, it would have played better not to have a wealthy Londoner such as Gina Miller sue the government. Maybe it did look bad having 11 judges strike down the Brexiters\u2019 champion, thereby confirming every Brexiters\u2019 suspicion about the \u201cremain elite\u201d. But the alternative was to let Johnson\u2019s suspension stand, so that a future prime minister could sweep aside an inconvenient parliament, and its irritating scrutiny, whenever they chose and for however long they liked.</p> \n<p>Perhaps impeachment will hand Trump a reality TV showdown he\u2019ll love. But the alternative was to say that when Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/23/trump-falsely-tells-auditorium-full-teens-constitution-gives-him-right-do-whatever-i-want/\" title=\"\">told</a> a group of teenagers in July that \u201cI have the right to do whatever I want as president\u201d, he was right. If Democrats met this abuse with a shrug, it would become the new normal. In Britain and America, the lesson is clear. Fighting populists might be like wrestling with a pig \u2013 you both get dirty, but the pig likes it \u2013 and yet it has to be done. The alternative is to see our democratic way of life snuffed out while we watch and wait and do nothing.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

In the US, Pelosi was reluctant to move to impeachment because she feared it would give Trump the fight he relished. There they go again, he\u2019d say, Democrats and their friends in the \u201cfake news media\u201d using tricks to remove a president that you, the people, elected fair and square. He could play the victim, howling about witch-hunts and \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d, tapping into the deep sense of grievance that animates his base. The circus of televised hearings would provide precisely the polarised chaos in which he thrives. There are plenty of other good reasons not to go ahead. Right now impeachment looks doomed to fail: it requires the votes of 67 senators to remove a president from office, which means the defection of 20 Republicans. The liberal Republican wing whose desertion spelled the end for Richard Nixon is all but vanished now: the 21 brave Tories who broke from Johnson have few counterparts on Capitol Hill. The notion of US public opinion shifting en masse against Trump is a stretch, too. US media consumption is now so partisan that Trump\u2019s base will only ever hear a story that exonerates him from guilt. The truth of Watergate was near-universally accepted in 1974; it\u2019s hard to imagine anything being universally accepted now. What\u2019s more, impeachment will consume Democratic energies, distracting them from their ongoing primary contest. When Democrats should be talking to US voters about healthcare, jobs and the climate crisis, they\u2019ll be talking instead about Ukraine, transcripts and secret servers. And yet they have no real choice. The politics of it may be fraught with risk, but it is their duty. The already known facts of the Ukraine episode establish a clear abuse of presidential power: Trump used the might of his office to advance not the country\u2019s interest but his own. Nor can you argue that the remedy for such behaviour is an (upcoming) election, because Trump\u2019s abuse was aimed at subverting that very election. Democrats face the same logic that confronted Johnson\u2019s opponents. Perhaps, politically, it would have played better not to have a wealthy Londoner such as Gina Miller sue the government. Maybe it did look bad having 11 judges strike down the Brexiters\u2019 champion, thereby confirming every Brexiters\u2019 suspicion about the \u201cremain elite\u201d. But the alternative was to let Johnson\u2019s suspension stand, so that a future prime minister could sweep aside an inconvenient parliament, and its irritating scrutiny, whenever they chose and for however long they liked. Perhaps impeachment will hand Trump a reality TV showdown he\u2019ll love. But the alternative was to say that when Trump told a group of teenagers in July that \u201cI have the right to do whatever I want as president\u201d, he was right. If Democrats met this abuse with a shrug, it would become the new normal. In Britain and America, the lesson is clear. Fighting populists might be like wrestling with a pig \u2013 you both get dirty, but the pig likes it \u2013 and yet it has to be done. The alternative is to see our democratic way of life snuffed out while we watch and wait and do nothing. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

Maybe \u201creview of the week\u201d would be a better title.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for all your comments today. I\u2019m going to leave you with a summary of the afternoon\u2019s main developments: The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has backed the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming a caretaker prime minister, in a bid to secure an extension to the Brexit deadline. She said she agrees with installing the Labour leader as PM through a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The Scottish Lib Dems said Corbyn was too divisive to lead a caretaker government. The Labour MP Jess Phillips says she has received more threats after an incident outside her constituency office on Thursday when a man allegedly tried to smash her windows. She showed Sky News a message that said: \u201cUnless you change your attitude, be afraid, be very afraid.\u201d Labour has condemned the veteran Conservative backbencher Desmond Swayne for defending wearing blackface makeup as an entirely acceptable bit of fun. His comments after Justin Trudeau\u2019s admission he had worn blackface makeup were described by Dawn Butler as \u201canother example of a politician not even trying to understand the history of oppression\u201d. The Labour MP David Lammy has criticised the columnist Brendan O\u2019Neill after he said on BBC Politics Live that the delay to Brexit should have sparked riots. It came after the Times quoted an unnamed senior cabinet minister today who warned the country risked a \u201cviolent, popular uprising\u201d if a second referendum overturned the result of the first. Here is a last post to bring a smile to your face before I wrap up the blog with a summary. My eagle-eyed colleague Mattha Busby writes about an advert on the Working for an MP website posted by the Conservatives in the European Parliament: The Eurosceptic Conservatives and Reformist Group in the European parliament, which includes Conservative MEPs, are recruiting an intern to begin work in Brussels at the European parliament on 1 November for six months, the day after the UK is expected to have left the EU. The successful applicant for the role working for the Conservatives and Reformist Group will receive \u20ac1,500 a month and will work to \u201cnurture the relationship between the group and the party now and beyond Brexit\u201d. It is made up of MEPs from rightwing parties across Europe such as Spain\u2019s Vox, Brother\u2019s of Italy, Poland\u2019s Law and Justice, and Sweden Democrats, and the Tories have previously been criticised for their affiliation with the group. Hugo Dixon, a supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, says that Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s reasoning, that installing Jeremy Corbyn as a caretaker PM after a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson could secure a Brexit extension, is flawed: Boris Johnson has penned a piece for parliament\u2019s the House magazine ahead of the Conservative party conference saying the UK will leave the EU by 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d. It does not really add much to the debate as there is no indication of how this will be achieved in light of the Benn Act, which was passed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He writes: We are leaving the European Union by 31 October come what may. This is absolutely crucial in order to renew and restore trust in our precious democracy. The British people have had enough of waiting; the constant message I hear from the public is that they are tired of delay. By getting on with the job we will unite and re-energise our great United Kingdom. I would much prefer the UK to leave the EU with a deal, and the government I lead is working flat out to do its part to make that happen. We have also stepped up preparations and will be fully prepared to leave without an agreement. Unfortunately, as well as receiving support (see previous post), the Labour MP Jess Phillips has also received more threats overnight. From Sky News: It reads: \u201cUnless you change your attitude, be afraid, be very afraid... wherever you are, keep looking over your shoulder. The person standing behind you may not be friendly. You and your remain friends have been warned.\u201d Ms Phillips said: \u201cThe other thing that happened yesterday is that all day the phones in my Westminster [office] had to eventually be switched off because the line was being jammed with people. \u201cI won\u2019t say what they were shouting because I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fit for the television, but using words like \u2018traitor\u2019,\u201d the Labour MP added. Asked if she\u2019s had death threats she said: \u201cYeah, lots.\u201d This is Haroon Siddique back at the controls. A positive message from Jess Phillips to resume with. It is about the response to an incident outside her constituency office on Thursday when a man allegedly tried to smash her windows: Following his exchange with the No 10 senior adviser Dominic Cummings yesterday, the Labour MP Karl Turner has issued this statement. The Labour MP David Lammy has criticised the columnist Brendan O\u2019Neill after he said on BBC Politics Live earlier that the delay to Brexit should have sparked riots. It comes after the Times quoted an unnamed senior cabinet minister today who warned the country risked a \u201cviolent, popular uprising\u201d if a second referendum overturned the result of the first, adding that it would only take \u201ca couple of nasty populist frontmen to inspire people\u201d. A new civility awards scheme for politicians has been launched by members of the House of Lords and campaigners, after stormy proceedings in parliament on Wednesday were widely condemned. The annual Civility in Politics prizes will be given out to politicians who have shown courtesy and decency through their work, with categories of bridge-builder of the year and campaigner of the year, political correspondent Kate Proctor reports. Labour peer Lord Wood, one of the figures behind the awards, said: \u201cEveryone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility. \u201cAs divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit, we strongly believe that politics must respond not by mirroring these trends, but by resisting them.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman has insisted the government does not recognise a plan that Sir John Major warned could be used to circumvent the Benn Act, which is aimed at forcing the prime minister to seek a Brexit extension, Heather Stewart and Matthew Weaver report. It comes after the former justice secretary David Gauke insisted ministers could not bypass the Benn law, which he described as \u201cwatertight\u201d. Labour has condemned the veteran Conservative backbencher Desmond Swayne for describing criticism of Justin Trudeau\u2019s admission he had worn blackface makeup as \u201cthe latest absurdity of political correctness\u201d. In a post on his personal blog, the New Forest West MP said there had been no need for the Canadian prime minister to make a \u201ccringing apology\u201d for wearing what Trudeau called racist makeup to a costume party in 2001. \u201cIt was a themed \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 fancy-dress party for heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d Swayne wrote. \u201cIt comes to something when you can\u2019t dress-up as Aladdin without attracting the opprobrium of the \u2018great and good\u2019. He would have done better to have said it was an entirely acceptable bit of fun and refused to apologise.\u201d Swayne went on: \u201cI once went to a \u2018Blues Brothers\u2019 themed fancy-dress party as James Brown. I went to some trouble to be as authentic as possible. I can assure readers of this column that I have no intention of apologising.\u201d Dawn Butler, Labour\u2019s shadow women and equalities secretary, said the comments were \u201canother example of a politician not even trying to understand the history of oppression\u201d. She said: \u201cThe Tories need to explain what action will be taken against him and whether this took place while he was a government minister.\u201d Trudeau, who is in the midst of a re-election struggle, admitted last week that he could not recall how many times he had worn blackface makeup after footage emerged of a third occasion. Here is some reaction to Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s announcement that she would support Jeremy Corbyn as a caretaker prime minister. The Scottish Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for constitutional relations, Wendy Chamberlain, said: We need a plan that has a whiff of a chance of working. Liberal Democrats will back a temporary government to stop a no-deal Brexit but that cannot be led by the divisive Jeremy Corbyn. The numbers don\u2019t add up. Even Nicola Sturgeon has said that she doesn\u2019t trust him. Jo Swinson is working hard across parties to build a majority at Westminster to stop the damage of Brexit. Anyone who wants to keep Scotland in the UK and the UK in the EU should vote for the Liberal Democrats. Kirstene Hair, Conservative MP for Angus, said: This confirms what many have long suspected \u2013 SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. There is no doubt that Corbyn\u2019s weak stance on indyref2 is a deciding factor for the nationalists. He has already left the door open for a re-run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister. Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted no in what was meant to be a once-in-a-generation event. Elaborating on the SNP leader\u2019s tweet earlier, a spokesman for the party said: The SNP has led the way in ensuring Brexit can be stopped and in bringing parliament back into action after the Tories sought to shut down UK democracy, and we will continue to work with all opposition MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit and call a general election to remove this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible. It is now possible \u2013 if the political will is there \u2013 that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards. We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson. The deputy speaker Rosie Winterton has written to her fellow MPs today asking for their support in her effort to become the next Speaker of the House of Commons. She said that she would build on her experience as deputy speaker and seek to be a stabilising, unifying speaker who could help resolve the tensions that have built up in recent times by working with all colleagues in a low-profile, consensus-building way. \u201cWe must learn to disagree better,\u201d she said. The current Speaker, John Bercow, announced this month that he would step down by 31 October, after a decade in the role. Harriet Harman is seen as the frontrunner in the role to succeed him, alongside her fellow Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle, another deputy speaker. Chris Bryant, another Labour MP, is among those also pitching for the position. He has pledged a \u201creturn to the rule book\u201d in what has been described as an anti-Bercow campaign. Good afternoon, Mattha Busby here taking over from Haroon Siddique. This is from PA Media: Nicola Sturgeon has backed the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming a caretaker prime minister, in a bid to secure an extension to the Brexit deadline. The Scottish first minister tweeted on Friday that she agrees with the idea of installing the Labour leader as PM through a vote of no confidence in the Conservative administration so he can secure a Brexit extension, before then calling an immediate general election. In response to a tweet making the suggestion, Ms Sturgeon said: \u201cAgree with this. VONC [vote of no confidence], opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension, and then immediate general election. \u201cNothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal \u2013 or even a bad deal \u2013 seems like a terrible idea to me.\u201d The former cabinet minister Amber Rudd has said Boris Johnson\u2019s language \u201cdoes incite violence\u201d. Rudd who quit the cabinet and party earlier this month said she was stunned by his comments about Jo Cox and compared his rhetoric to that of Donald Trump. Johnson, speaking in Essex, defended his description of legislation designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit as \u201csurrender\u201d. He argued that barring such language would have the effect of \u201cimpoverishing debate\u201d. A cross-party initiative has been launched to attempt to counter inflammatory language in parliament by issuing \u201ccivility in politics\u201d awards. The former justice minister David Gauke has dismissed fears, raised by John Major, that the government could bypass a law to force the government to delay Brexit beyond 31 October if no deal is agreed. Gauke, one of 21 Tory rebels fired from the party for supporting the Benn Act said it was \u201cwatertight\u201d. Legal commentators concurred with Gauke\u2019s comments. Responding to Major, the PM\u2019s spokesman said the former prime minister\u2019s suggestion that the government could bypass the Benn Act via the privy council was \u201cnot something that we recognise\u201d. A No 10 source described it as \u201ctotal cobblers\u201d. The court of appeal in Belfast has dismissed an application that the British government\u2019s Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process. Three applicants failed in their appeal against a Belfast high court judgment that rejected their challenge against the government\u2019s handling of the Brexit process. Ministers do not know whether there are sufficient medicines, medical supplies or freight capacity to support the NHS if the UK leaves the EU without a deal next month, the National Audit Office has found. Amid mounting concern about the use of inflammatory rhetoric in parliament, a cross-party initiative has been launched to attempt to counter it by highlighting those who refrain from such language. The former cabinet minister Amber Rudd has accused Boris Johnson of inciting violence. She told the Evening Standard: The sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from No 10 does incite violence. It\u2019s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence. She added: \u201cThe casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff is immoral,\u201d and said she was \u201cdisappointed and stunned\u201d by the prime minister\u2019s comments relating to Jo Cox. She said Johnson\u2019s rhetoric reminded her of Donald Trump leading chants of \u201clock her up\u201d against Hillary Clinton. Rudd resigned the Tory whip in solidarity with the 21 Tories who were expelled from the parliamentary party for voting to stop no-deal Brexit. She told the Standard she was considering standing as an independent Conservative. From PA Media, on John Major\u2019s comments: Downing Street says it does not \u201crecognise\u201d fears flagged by Sir John Major that Boris Johnson could circumvent the Benn Act. The former Tory prime minister said an order of council issued by ministers in the privy council could avoid the PM having to comply with a demand by MPs for Brexit to be extended if no deal is in place before 31 October. Asked why ministers such as the international development secretary, Alok Sharma, had not been able to rule out the prospect in interviews, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: I\u2019m sure that the fact these comments were going to be made came as a surprise to everyone because it is simply not something that we recognise. A No 10 source said: It is absolute nonsense and (I have) absolutely no idea where he has got it from. Total cobblers. We will not use it [order of council]. You will really have to ask him where he has got these from because it is a mystery to all involved. Boris Johnson has once again defended the language he has used to describe the legislation aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit. Speaking on a visit to Harlow in Essex, he said: I think the threats against MPs and particularly female MPs are absolutely appalling and we\u2019re doing a lot of work to give MPs the security that they need. But then there\u2019s another question which is: can you use words like \u2018surrender\u2019 to describe a certain act or a certain bill? And, quite frankly, I think that you can and if you say that you can\u2019t then you\u2019re kind of impoverishing the language and impoverishing political debate because, after all, the use of that kind of metaphor has been going on for hundreds of years. More rubbishing from No 10 of John Major\u2019s claim that Boris Johnson could try to use the privy council to prevent any delay to Brexit in the event that no deal has been agreed. From PA Media: The court of appeal in Belfast has dismissed an application that the British government\u2019s Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process. Three applicants appealed against a Belfast high court judgment that rejected their challenge against the government\u2019s handling of the Brexit process. One of the applicants was high-profile victims\u2019 campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997. It comes after the supreme court unanimously ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in shutting down parliament for five weeks. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman is pleading ignorance in relation to John Major\u2019s accusation that Boris Johnson could seek to bypass the Benn Act via the privy council, according to the Mirror. John Major\u2019s speech is not the only development to raise fears about potential attempts to subvert the Benn Act. City AM reports that the government believes it is able to circumvent the act requiring it to delay Britain\u2019s departure from the EU in the absence of a withdrawal agreement by (irony alert) invoking EU law. The article says: A closely guarded plan known to a small handful of aides would see the government point to the fact that article 50 rests under EU law, while the Benn Act is enshrined in British law. \u201cEuropean law usurps British law,\u201d a source told City AM. \u201cThat means the article 50 deadline trumps the Benn Act.\u201d No 10 has repeatedly said it will comply with the law, while simultaneously insisting the UK will leave the EU by Halloween. This plan could see both seemingly contradictory statements come to fruition. One high-ranking Tory MP described the plan as legal, albeit a \u2018wheeze\u2019. It should be noted that legal experts have said any attempt to subvert the Benn Act would be unlawful. The former justice secretary David Gauke has rejected the idea that ministers can use a loophole to bypass a law which forces Boris Johnson to seek a Brexit extension, my colleague Matthew Weaver writes. Gauke, one of 21 Tory rebels who had the party whip removed for voting for the Benn Act, warned Boris Johnson he would face instant legal challenge if he tried to avoid it. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: The Benn Act is watertight. The overwhelming legal consensus is that the courts will declare that the Benn Act is effective, and the government will be forced to comply with it ... I don\u2019t know whether it will be me personally, but if it is necessary for it to be challenged, it will be challenged. And there is time from the 19 October and the 31 October, to go to the courts and ensure that the law is properly applied. The former Brexit secretary David Davis has weighed into the debate on the language used in parliament, defending Boris Johnson\u2019s description of the legislation aimed at blocking no deal as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d. Speaking at a conference in Westminster, Davis said: The effect of the Benn bill is to undermine the government. I deplore the abuse received by MPs (from the public), but it should not be used as an argument for suppressing debate. There are a couple of interesting stories around concerning preparedness for Brexit. This, by my colleague Rajeev Syal, says ministers do not know whether there are sufficient medicines, medical supplies or freight capacity to support the NHS if the UK leaves the EU without a deal next month, the National Audit Office has found. Meanwhile, Schools Week reports that the the Department for Education has denied the existence of preparation plans for a no-deal Brexit that it claimed existed just two months ago. Schools Week reports that when it asked the Education and Skills Funding Agency for details of the \u201cdecisive action\u201d it previously said it had taken, the agency told it that while it had \u201cdiscussed the possible contribution of staff as volunteers to be seconded to other government departments for EU exit preparations, there were no specific plans in place regarding discontinuation of work or the allocation of staff numbers or roles to any particular department\u201d. David Allen Green\u2019s comments (see below) dismissing the idea that the government can get round the Benn Act, echo those made by others. They include Jolyon Maugham QC, a leading lawyer in the fight against Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament and Mark Elliot, professor of public law at Cambridge University. The legal commentator David Allen Green has rejected the notion that Boris Johnson could get round the Benn Act via the privy council and says judges would swiftly repudiate any attempt to do so. Here is a link to the full text of John Major\u2019s speech warning that Boris Johnson might try to bypass the law preventing no deal. http://www.johnmajorarchive.org.uk/2015-2/sir-john-majors-speech-at-the-centre-for-european-reform-26-september-2019/ The international development secretary, Alok Sharma, refused to answer this morning when asked how the government could abide by the Benn Act and yet still leave the European Union on 31 October. He told the BBC: I\u2019m not going to set out discussions that have occurred in the privacy of cabinet. We are absolutely going to comply with the law, we are working incredibly hard to get a deal and we will be leaving on 31 October. Sharma also said Johnson was right to label the Benn Act, the \u201csurrender act\u201d. He said: If you look at the fundamentals of what that bill does, it does surrender our ability to have effective discussions with the European Union and it does surrender our ability to be able to walk away from the table if that is what happens. We are surrendering our ability to negotiate effectively with the EU. If you were going into a negotiation with both hands tied behind your back, would you not think it somehow a form of capitulation? In his speech, Major also criticised the language being used by Johnson and others. He said: We abhor the language of division and hate - and words such as \u2018saboteur\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, \u2018enemy\u2019, \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019 have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society. It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. This is Haroon Siddique standing in for Andrew Sparrow. We\u2019re leading today with the news that the former Conservative prime minister John Major has warned that 10 Downing Street\u2019s current incumbent could seek to subvert the Benn Act, which requires the prime minister to seek an extension to the Brexit withdrawal date beyond 31 October if a withdrawal agreement has not been ratified by then. In a speech to the the Centre for European Reform, Major said he feared Boris Johnson could try \u2013 via the privy council \u2013 to bypass the Benn Act by suspending it until after 31 October. He said: My fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving Her Majesty the Queen. I should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget. Major also accused Johnson of \u201cwilfully\u201d destroying the prospects of cross-party agreement on Brexit with his Commons onslaught on the opposition. We\u2019ll be mopping up all the reaction to Major\u2019s speech and covering the other political developments today. If you want to get in touch, the best way is to tweet me at @Haroon_Siddique.",

The government constantly tells us that everyone is fed up with Brexit. So am I. They tell us everyone wants an end to Brexit. So do I. But no one should believe that Brexit will end on the day we leave \u2013 whether that is on 31 October, or beyond. Far from it.

      "bodyText": "At the moment, our country is more unsettled, more divided, than I can ever recall. Ministers assure us they are moving towards a deal. The European Union tells us they are not \u2013 because no new or viable proposals have been put forward by the British government. The prime minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe. But we don\u2019t see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement. Lip service is paid to the unanimous judgment of the supreme court \u2013 that it was unlawful to prorogue parliament for five weeks \u2013 while the prime minister tells us the court was wrong and he was right. That is the cry of those found guilty of misdemeanours throughout the ages. Meanwhile, ministers continue to offer fantasy outcomes of what a post-Brexit future holds for people in every corner of our United Kingdom. As day succeeds day, it seems more likely that we will end up leaving the European Union without any deal at all. On Wednesday night, the prime minister wilfully destroyed any hope of cross-party agreement. The price of such a negotiating failure will be widespread and will affect rich and poor alike \u2013 with one difference: the poor will be far less able to protect themselves. Far more is at stake than simply our relationship with the European Union. At stake also is our relationship with the wider world and \u2013 because of the nature of our Brexit debate \u2013 very probably the future of our domestic politics as well. I don\u2019t believe, after the schism Brexit has created, that we will be able to return to the status quo ante. The government constantly tells us that everyone is fed up with Brexit. So am I. They tell us everyone wants an end to Brexit. So do I. But no one should believe that Brexit will end on the day we leave \u2013 whether that is on 31 October, or beyond. Far from it. The impact of Brexit \u2013 both internally and externally \u2013 will be felt negatively for a very long time. From the outset, the government\u2019s whole negotiating strategy \u2013 if such it can be called \u2013 has been driven by a desire to win the support of the anti-European hard right of the Conservative party, together with like-minded media. If the government is to get a deal; if the House of Commons is to approve it; if the scars of Brexit are to be diminished; then there must be compromise in the negotiations. And not only compromise, but understanding \u2013 from both sets of negotiators. Little of that has been forthcoming. There is much talk of a general election. In the present atmosphere it would be likely to become the most unsavoury election of modern times. Until Brexit is resolved, a general election would solve nothing. It would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity. It may also be pointless, as the most likely outcome is another fragmented parliament \u2013 even more bitterly divided than it is now. So why is the government so keen to put our country through that? There may be a political calculation: they believe the Labour party is unelectable under the present leadership; ministers know how serious the problems will be for the people of this country after a no-deal Brexit, and wish to have the election out of the way before the reality of the mess that lies ahead becomes clear. Let me put it another way: if the government was truly confident in the aftermath of their Brexit policy, they would wait for next spring, when they could take credit for the success of Brexit; rejoice \u2013 even gloat \u2013 that all fears about it were unfounded; and propose a few popular one nation policies to restore the fortunes of the Conservatives. But instead, to reinforce their electoral appeal, the government seems intent on whipping up dissent by using highly emotional and evocative language that can only provoke fear and anger, and fuel grievances against parliament and the law \u2013 inciting opposition to the most important bulwarks of our state and its freedom. Their approach is profoundly un-Conservative and \u2013 whatever its short-term effect \u2013 will do permanent damage to the reputation of the party. I cannot believe any previous government in our long history would have even considered such reckless and divisive behaviour. We were promised, during the referendum campaign, that Brexit would \u201c\u2026 restore parliamentary sovereignty and the supremacy of UK law\u201d. For that reason, I am assuming there will be no further political trickery from this government. There is a contradiction between the act prohibiting the UK leaving the EU without a deal, and the prime minister\u2019s continued assertion that he will leave on 31 October. My fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law by passing an order of council to suspend the act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving the Queen. I should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget. I am a lifelong Conservative. I hope our millions of traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road supporters understand that this Conservative government\u2019s present position is an aberration.

It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so. I hope the Conservative parliamentary party will regain its sense of balance, and rein in the faction of a faction that now prevails in cabinet. Now that parliament is sitting again, it has the opportunity to prove its quality, its strength, its purpose and its power.

He told his cabinet that the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d was hitting home with voters and would form a key part of any campaign. With Labour refusing an election until no deal is off the table, Johnson is still insisting that he will not have to seek an extension from the EU if he fails to reach a deal. Many opposition MPs are sceptical that there really is a way to circumvent the Benn law, but Sir John Major, the former prime minister, will warn on Friday that the government could seek a \u201corder of council\u201d to delay that legislation coming into effect. \u201cMy fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the Act until after 31 October,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving the Queen. \u201cI should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court.

A cabinet source said Johnson is preparing to prorogue parliament again a few days before a Queen\u2019s speech to set out his domestic agenda, with the current intention to stick to the original date of 14 October. The prime minister also intends to carry on with Conservative party conference next week as usual, while opposition MPs sit in parliament attempting to undermine his strategy. Throughout the day on Thursday, Johnson took a defiant approach to the criticism of MPs who lambasted him for his language in the House of Commons, refusing to appear for a question in parliament on his rhetoric. Instead, he addressed Tory backbench MPs, telling them that he would carry on referring to the \u201csurrender bill\u201d. Tory MPs said the mood of Johnson\u2019s meeting had been \u201clargely supportive\u201d but others sighed or raised their eyebrows when asked how he had performed. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, sent a pointed tweet saying that a \u201ctime of strong feelings we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us\u201d, although she cushioned it with a claim that the prime minister was sympathetic about threats received by MPs. However, Johnson was criticised more directly by his own sister, Rachel, who told Sky News: \u201cI think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP, murdered by someone who said \u2018Britain first\u2019, of the far-right tendency, which you could argue is being whipped up by this sort of language. \u201cMy brother is using words like surrender and capitulation as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4m votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered.

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>One of the more remarkable features of the Labour party conference was just how few MPs made the effort to come to Brighton. A couple of outliers parachuted themselves in for the day, but the large majority avoided the conference entirely. Which meant that many of the fringe meetings consisted of the same few shadow cabinet ministers and union leaders making much the same speech over and over again. Regardless of what the topic under discussion was meant to be. It did all get quite dull at times. But it was hard to blame so many MPs for staying away, because for most of the first three days the atmosphere was fairly toxic as delegates appeared more interested in blood feuds than getting ready for an election. Having spent the first two days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/explained-attempt-to-remove-tom-watson-deputy-labour-leader\">unsuccessfully trying to remove the deputy leader, Tom Watson</a> \u2013 one of the few Labour moderates who still bothers to attend conference \u2013 the Corbyn wing of the party then went on to slug it out among themselves. The battleground was between those who believed the whole point of joining Corbyn\u2019s Labour party was that its members now got to decide policy and those who reckoned that the leader and those close to him were entitled to do exactly as they wished. Amid rumours of a stitch-up that involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/23/labour-delegates-reject-plan-to-commit-to-remain-video\">Corbyn\u2019s team packing the hall and the refusal of the chair to allow a formal card vote</a>, the latter prevailed and Labour\u2019s position on Brexit stayed one of creative ambiguity rather than a clear backing of remain. Lord make me a democrat, but not yet.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Having sat through all three days of the supreme court hearing, I wasn\u2019t entirely surprised that the judges upheld the Scottish verdict and allowed Gina Miller\u2019s appeal in the English courts. The government lawyers had appeared hopelessly unprepared compared to Lord Pannick and their entire case seemed to rest on the argument that the government was entitled to do pretty much what it pleased when it came to suspending parliament. So the judges shouldn\u2019t worry their pretty little heads about anything: Boris Johnson could prorogue for as long as he wanted and for whatever reason and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing anyone could do about it. Lord Keen and the rest of the government team appeared to have missed the bit in Constitutional Law for Dommies that said the executive was subservient to parliament and should not frustrate its will. But I was taken aback that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">judgment was unanimous and so damning</a>. There was an audible gasp among the dozens of lobby journalists in the press room at the Labour conference when Lady Hale delivered the verdict and then pandemonium as everyone tried to work out what to do next. Within an hour many reporters had already decamped back to Westminster. The Labour party was also completely wrongfooted but quickly realised it was a win-win situation. They could prevent Tom Watson speaking by bringing forward Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech into the time slot allocated for the deputy leader, while the government\u2019s defeat would mean the conference, which had up till then been a bit of a car-crash, would quickly get forgotten. I left Brighton a day early, taking a late train back to London. The one member of the Guardian team who stayed on at the charming B&amp;B we were in told me the owner looked devastated when no one came down to eat the fabulous breakfast he had prepared. I\u2019m sorry Steve. I had a lovely stay, my room was great and you couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming. I hope you\u2019ll have us back another time.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>One of the more unusual takes on the supreme court judgment was Michael Gove insisting that Boris Johnson was a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-is-the-pep-guardiola-of-politics-says-gove-5wjg88zf8\">winner like Pep Guardiola</a>, the Manchester City manager. If losing six consecutive votes in the Commons, being found to have unlawfully prorogued parliament, \u2019losing your majority in parliament, being accused of misconduct in public office through the award of a grant to a friend whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/unfit-for-office-mps-challenge-boris-johnson-public-money-jennifer-arcuri\">UK phone number</a> redirects you to a Florida mailbox \u2013 not to mention countless other minor acts of self-harm \u2013 makes you a winner, I\u2019d hate to think what Gove reckons would make up a losing streak. I\u2019m fairly certain Guardiola would have been fired by City if he had managed all that in under three months. Hell, even Spurs would have second thoughts about that kind of record and we\u2019ve just been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by league two Colchester. In words I thought I\u2019d never write, Johnson is even making David Cameron look a bit of a winner. Not for anything he did in government obviously, but for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/24/david-cameron-memoir-margaret-atwood-dystopia-for-the-record\">success of his memoirs</a> which have gone straight into the Sunday Times and Amazon top 10 bestseller lists in the first week. I had confidently predicted that Cameron\u2019s memoir would quickly end up in remainder shops, with everyone having had more than enough of him through the extended serialisations in the papers and media exposure elsewhere, but it turns out that there are 20,000 people and counting who are desperate to learn more. If my second book of political sketches \u2013 with new bits! \u2013 Decline and Fail (out late October) sells that many in its first week, I will be delirious. Cameron has already earned back \u00a340K of his advance. Just another \u00a3760K to go.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Doctors have long been aware of the placebo effect. But a new study conducted by scientists in Germany on students suffering from exam anxiety takes it to a whole new level. Up till now it has always been assumed that the placebo effect relies on patients believing the medicines they are taking have active ingredients in them. But the German researchers divided their study into two groups, one of which was given nothing at all and the other told that the medicine they were being asked to take twice daily was an Open Label Placebo with nothing in it that could treat anxiety. Amazingly, over the 14-day trial period the OLP group saw their anxiety scores fall by four points and their self-management skills increase by 16-points. The scores for the group that was given nothing remained more or less the same throughout the two weeks. I\u2019ve sometimes wondered just how effective the medications I take to help control my depression and anxiety are and whether they work because I believe they work, but have long since concluded that I don\u2019t really care one way or the other. My mental health feels far too precious and fragile for me to turn myself into a one-man drug trial by experimenting with either coming off or trying alternatives. However low I may be feeling, I\u2019m always only too aware there\u2019s no situation that can\u2019t get worse. It\u2019s the Spurs fan in me.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Another manic week \u2013 almost every week appears to be unprecedented these days \u2013 in politics ended with some of the most unpleasant scenes in Westminster I have ever witnessed. Boris Johnson appears to be physically and emotionally incapable of apologising for anything he has done. Rather \u2013 in classic Trump playbook style \u2013 he doubles down at every turn by making out that he is the real victim and that he only behaves the way he does because everyone else drives him to it. A man with no sense of personal responsibility. He has left many MPs feeling bruised, angry and depressed by insisting his language of surrender, traitors and betrayal has nothing to do with the abuse and death threats that many have received and that they have brought it on themselves by not delivering his as yet unspecified Brexit. One thing that the Incredible Sulk didn\u2019t manage to spoil, though, was my Thursday night. About five months ago, I booked tickets to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/24/agrippina-review-didonato-royal-opera-house-london\">Agrippina</a> \u2013 a tragicomic opera of ambition, power and lust set in ancient Rome that now looks quite normal compared to the current incumbent of No 10 \u2013 and had feared there might be a critical debate or vote that prevented me from going. For once, though, Johnson didn\u2019t let me down and the opera didn\u2019t disappoint. Three hours in which my soul was temporarily restored. The singing, staging, acting and music were all sensational but Joyce DiDonato in the title role was in a league of her own. She is one of the greatest performers of her generation and was worth every penny and more of the arm and a leg the tickets cost me. It\u2019s odd to be a fan boy at the age of 62, but I\u2019ve seen her many times now and have always come aware that I have been in the presence of a rare talent. An artist generous enough to reach out and touch you with her genius. With one held note and a raised eyebrow she can both break your heart and freeze it. Beg, borrow or steal to get a ticket. You won\u2019t regret it.</p> <p><strong>Digested week: 11-0</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"679c799f869c6d126515ad3b692f6047fe360871\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/679c799f869c6d126515ad3b692f6047fe360871/0_406_4719_2831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Donald Trump at the UN headquarters in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump to Boris: \u2018Supreme court\u2019s nothing.
