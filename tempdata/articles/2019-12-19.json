No, it is not.

Labour eventually returned to power, it has long been argued, only because it abandoned its radical policies and marginalised those in the party who had come up with them. After last week\u2019s disaster, say Corbyn\u2019s critics, Labour should do the same.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He cautions against the party tacking too far to the right and blaming last week\u2019s defeat on the left of the party, as Labour grandees such as Alan Johnson have already begun to do.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On election night, the former New Labour minister Alan Johnson began this familiar ritual \u2013 describing the pro-Corbyn group Momentum, which has 40,000 members, as \u201cthis little cult\u201d. \u201cI want them out of the party,\u201d he said on ITV. \u201cGo back to your student politics.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And one thing for Labour supporters to feel optimistic about is their standing among young voters:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Unlike Foot, Corbyn won the support of a cohort of voters that will only become more important. According to the Conservative pollster Michael Ashcroft, last week Labour received almost three times as many votes from the under-35s as the Tories. In 1983, the Tories led Labour comfortably in this group. Then, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s party often seemed more modern than Labour, offering a vision of an individualistic, competitive country, which many young people liked. There was an intellectual ferment on the right, which for years had been producing fresh policy ideas.</p> \n   <p>Few people would say these things about the Tories now. In 2019, their almost content-free manifesto, and massive reliance on older voters, were highly effective as election tactics. Yet, like the airy promises to increase state spending in today\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, they are also signs of a party with questionable long-term prospects. By contrast, Labour\u2019s youthful support, and policies addressing what are by common consent the biggest contemporary issues \u2013 the climate emergency, the inadequacies of the modern economy and Britain\u2019s proliferating social crises \u2013 suggest a party with the potential to do much better at future elections.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/19/left-labour-michael-foot-tony-blair\">A Labour defeat, yes, but this was not nearly as bad as 1983 | Andy Beckett</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T20:08:40.486Z\">at 8.08pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfbc9628f087e8308e61517\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T19:03:09.329Z\">7.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the Queen\u2019s Speech debate, which has not exactly been troubled by many moments of soaring oratory, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 joint leader <strong>Sir Ed Davey</strong> warned the prime minister that his \u201cwillingness to jump unashamedly over every red line he had previously been willing to die in the ditch for will have been noted in Brussels by Europe\u2019s rather more skilful negotiators\u201d, suggesting that Boris Johnson\u2019s greatest weapon in the negotiations to come would be his \u201cunmatched flexibility with the truth\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHis so-called triumph of achieving a deal for Brexit phase one was only possible because he betrayed his big promise to the DUP,\u201d Davey added, describing the PM\u2019s tactics as \u201cbulldog bluster combined with the record of a turncoat\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is the right approach and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll succeed without reneging on almost all of his previous promises to leave voters.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhether or not, in the dark Conservative forests of the Brexit Spartans, his erstwhile friends have yet smelt betrayal.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T20:09:44.987Z\">at 8.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfbc4e18f087e8308e614cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T18:45:15.795Z\">6.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, <strong>Julian Smith</strong>, has announced that there will be no return to power-sharing in the region before Christmas, blaming the DUP for preventing the move which would have seen the government release extra money for the NHS there.</p> \n  <p>Smith said: \u201cI am deeply disappointed that we have not got all five parties in agreement,\u201d and asked the DUP, the largest party in Northern Ireland, to reconsider. </p> \n  <p>The party said there were outstanding issues under negotiation that would not be resolved in the coming days, and work remained to be done to achieve a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d agreement.</p> \n  <p>The second largest party, Sinn F\u00e9in, had joined the British and Irish governments in making a push to re-establish devolved institutions, ending a three-year hiatus.</p> \n  <p>Smith said: \u201cWe want all parties to be positively part of the new Stormont.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the extra spending is \u00a34.3bn a year in real-terms</p> \n  <p>From next year some of the extra funding will be distributed by minimum per-pupil funding via the new national funding formula, the Department for Education has announced.

This framework bill does not set the date or question on the ballot, which have to be specified in further primary legislation, and much of the debate has centred around that question and whether it will be the same yes/no as 2014.</p> \n  <p>The draft bill originally stated the Electoral Commission would not be consulted if it had previously assessed or recommended a question, as with the yes/no format for the 2014 referendum.</p> \n  <p>Critics argued yes/no favoured the affirmative side, and the commission subsequently recommended the options of leave and remain for the 2016 EU referendum.</p> \n  <p>While the commission has not ruled out a future yes/no question on independence, it believes the assessment should be based on current evidence and political context, and now a compromise amendment has been accepted which states, in summary: if the question has been asked within the same parliamentary session then the commission does not automatically have to assess the question (though Holyrood can ask for it to do so), and if the question has been asked in the previous parliamentary session then Scottish ministers can lodge a motion to extend the \u2018validity period\u2019 of the question which, if passed, would mean the question did not need to be reassessed.</p> \n  <p>This really only matters if a second independence referendum is held next year \u2013 beyond 2021, the question will not have been asked in the past two sessions and so will automatically have to be assessed again. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T17:23:17.679Z\">at 5.23pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dfba5938f087e8308e61313\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-19T17:06:55.065Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Theresa May</strong>, the former prime minister, spoke in the Queen\u2019s speech debate after Ian Blackford.

She said that following last week\u2019s election victory in which her party took 47 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, the case for another referendum was \u201cunarguable\u201d. In <a href=\"https://www.snp.org/nicola-sturgeons-statement-on-scotlands-right-to-choose/\">a statement</a> delivered at Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The alternative is a future that we have rejected being imposed upon us.</p> \n   <p>Scotland made it very clear last week it does not want a Tory government led by Boris Johnson taking us out of the European Union.</p> \n   <p>That is the future we face if we do not have the opportunity to consider the alternative of independence.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sturgeon has also published <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/publication/2019/12/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands/documents/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands/govscot%3Adocument/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands.pdf\">a 38-page report (pdf)</a> setting out arguments for why Scotland should have the power to decide for itself to hold a legally valid independence referendum, instead of having to get approval from London under the Scotland Act, as is the case now. </p> \n  <p>The UK government has said it will not give the Scottish parliament the power to hold a second independence referendum, arguing that the matter was settled by the referendum in 2014. But Sturgeon said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The question is often posed to me: what will you do if the prime minister says no?</p> \n   <p>But the document we are publishing today turns the question on its head.</p> \n   <p>It is for the prime minister to defend why he believes the UK is not a voluntary union of equal nations.

We are expecting the speech to be a beefed-up version of what we heard in October, with some of the measures in the phantom Queen\u2019s speech being regurgitated, but some extra legislation added too.</p> \n  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Matthew Weaver</strong>\u2019s preview story.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/queens-speech-nhs-to-be-at-heart-of-legislative-programme-minister\">Queen's speech: NHS to be at heart of legislative programme - minister</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>In the meantime electioneering in the Labour leadership contest continues. Having declared her candidature with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/18/emily-thornberry-throws-her-hat-into-ring-for-labour-leadership\">an article in the Guardian yesterday</a>, <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, has been giving interviews this morning. In her article she criticised Jeremy Corbyn for ignoring her warning that backing an early election would be an \u201cact of catastrophic political folly\u201d. Today, though, Thornberry has shifted her focus somewhat, laying the blame for Labour\u2019s failings not so much with Corbyn himself, but with his advisers. </p> \n  <p>This is what she told Sky News when asked if she was willing to blame Corbyn for the election defeat.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m prepared to tell the truth, which is that in 2017 Jeremy was authentic, he spoke clearly, he spoke truthfully, people liked it. And what was the difference between 2017 and 2019? I think it was that we had been triangulating on the issue of Brexit, so people weren\u2019t quite sure where we were. I think we had other issues like antisemitism, like our response to Salisbury, where I think that Jeremy was just very badly advised. And in the end advisers should be there to give advice and politicians should be there to make the decisions. And too often we saw a situation where advisers felt that they were more important and should have more of a steer, in terms of where the Labour party was going, than the elected politicians. And that\u2019s not right.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Thornberry did not name the advisers she was referring to. But people in the Labour party will have understood that she was referring to Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s director of communications and strategy, and Karie Murphy, who was Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff before being moved to Labour HQ to run the general election, reportedly in response to complaints about how she was running his office. When it was put to Thornberry that she was talking about these two, she did not demur.</p> \n  <p>She also suggested Milne and Murphy should be dismissed. Referring to the fact that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/18/labour-party-staff-angry-at-handling-of-possible-redundancies\"> staff working in Labour\u2019s HQ, in Corbyn\u2019s office and for the shadow cabinet are facing the sack</a>, but not Milne and Murphy, she said that was wrong. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Those redundancies don\u2019t seem to include the most senior people in the Labour party who made the decisions during the election. And that\u2019s not fair. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.15am:</em> Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, holds a press conference to mark the publication of a paper making the case for Scotland being given the power to hold a second independence referendum.</p> \n  <p><em>11.25am: </em>The state opening of parliament commences, with MPs and peers gathering in the Lords to hear the Queen\u2019s speech.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn speak in the Queen\u2019s speech debate.</p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although mostly I will be focusing on the Queen\u2019s speech and the subsequent debate.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for us tonight, thanks for all your comments. You can read our main politics article on the Queen\u2019s speech here: Britain\u2019s security agencies are investigating how the leaked NHS dossier which was seized upon - to little ultimate effect - by the Labour party during the election campaign came to be in the public domain. Dan Sabbagh, defence and security editor, writes that the inquiry will focus on whether hackers from a hostile state used a personal Gmail account to access the information, which Jeremy Corbyn claimed showed the health service was \u201con the table\u201d in trade talks with the US. It is not clear which country \u2013 if any \u2013 is behind the alleged hack but independent analysts have already suggested that the cache was originally disseminated online by a Russian operation known as Secondary Infektion. One source said that the investigation was focused on events that may have taken place a few months ago. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor Dominic Cummings has reportedly told special advisers not to use such email accounts as \u201cforeign powers\u201d were targeting them. Read the article in full here: \u201cThis was Boris Johnson\u2019s day and nothing was going to spoil it,\u201d writes John Crace in his parliamentary sketch. \u201cHe was world king at last. Free to do whatever he wanted, safe in the knowledge that no one could stop him. If he wanted to decriminalise stealing a journalist\u2019s mobile phone or offer an amnesty to anyone who was late with their child support payments, then he was free to do so. Right now, he was the supreme leader. It would take time for the people to find out that all the People\u2019s Government could be relied on for was to let them down. And by the time they did, it would be far too late.\u201d Read the article in full here: Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, warned in his maiden speech that government plans for an \u201camnesty\u201d for British veterans who served in Northern Ireland was potentially putting the peace process at risk. Eastwood, whose party returned from the electoral wilderness last week in taking a seat apiece from the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, said the proposed policy - in addition to Brexit - threatened stability in Northern Ireland. \u201cEqually damaging to our progress and our peace process is the current proposal to basically give an amnesty for British soldiers for ... whatever they carried out in Northern Ireland during our very, very difficult Troubles. \u201cIs prosecuting those veterans vexatious? No, it is not. We will resist this attempt to undermine our peace process and our political progress and this insult to victims, all of the victims of our terrible, terrible past, and the opportunity that has been denied to them since 1998 to find full truth and full justice. \u201cWe stand by every single one of those victims, no matter who the perpetrator was. People on opposite benches need to understand this. If you begin with an amnesty for the British Army you will end up with an amnesty for everybody. \u201cSo it would better suit this prime minister and this government to stand by all of the victims, all of the innocent victims who have been searching for truth and justice for far too long.\u201d The author of the Queen\u2019s speech was \u201cclearly\u201d Dominic Cummings, with whom the prime minister \u201cis said to be mesmerised\u201d, writes Simon Jenkins. And beyond the headline commitments to getting Brexit done, \u201cthe rest of the speech was intriguing\u201d. Under Johnson-Cummings, the age of \u2018economic man\u2019 is over, replaced by the age of political empathy. The drivers are not \u2018the economy, stupid\u2019 but traditional ideas of national pride, authority, group insecurity and fiscal promiscuity. They are rife in the United States and eastern Europe. Now they have come to Britain. Gone from the Queen\u2019s speech was much trace of Johnson\u2019s once-vaunted social liberalism. Different buttons are now being pushed. The proposal to put \u00a334bn of NHS spending on a statutory basis is a headline gimmick. Prime ministers can spend what they like on the NHS without acts of parliament. The measure will merely confirm the health service as, like defence, beyond budgetary discipline or control. More significant, there was no mention of how to support social care in the long term, beyond an ambition for \u2018cross-party consensus\u2019. Local government remains below the radar. There is scant Christmas cheer for supporters of the Labour party, but as Andy Beckett points out, it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as 1983, when Michael Foot\u2019s party slumped to 27.6% of the vote and the Tories had a thumping 144-seat majority. In that campaign, Labour, led by Michael Foot, offered voters a leftwing manifesto, and was crushed by the Conservatives \u2013 who went on to govern for 14 more years. Labour eventually returned to power, it has long been argued, only because it abandoned its radical policies and marginalised those in the party who had come up with them. After last week\u2019s disaster, say Corbyn\u2019s critics, Labour should do the same. He cautions against the party tacking too far to the right and blaming last week\u2019s defeat on the left of the party, as Labour grandees such as Alan Johnson have already begun to do. On election night, the former New Labour minister Alan Johnson began this familiar ritual \u2013 describing the pro-Corbyn group Momentum, which has 40,000 members, as \u201cthis little cult\u201d. \u201cI want them out of the party,\u201d he said on ITV. \u201cGo back to your student politics.\u201d And one thing for Labour supporters to feel optimistic about is their standing among young voters: Unlike Foot, Corbyn won the support of a cohort of voters that will only become more important. According to the Conservative pollster Michael Ashcroft, last week Labour received almost three times as many votes from the under-35s as the Tories. In 1983, the Tories led Labour comfortably in this group. Then, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s party often seemed more modern than Labour, offering a vision of an individualistic, competitive country, which many young people liked. There was an intellectual ferment on the right, which for years had been producing fresh policy ideas. Few people would say these things about the Tories now. In 2019, their almost content-free manifesto, and massive reliance on older voters, were highly effective as election tactics. Yet, like the airy promises to increase state spending in today\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, they are also signs of a party with questionable long-term prospects. By contrast, Labour\u2019s youthful support, and policies addressing what are by common consent the biggest contemporary issues \u2013 the climate emergency, the inadequacies of the modern economy and Britain\u2019s proliferating social crises \u2013 suggest a party with the potential to do much better at future elections. In the Queen\u2019s Speech debate, which has not exactly been troubled by many moments of soaring oratory, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 joint leader Sir Ed Davey warned the prime minister that his \u201cwillingness to jump unashamedly over every red line he had previously been willing to die in the ditch for will have been noted in Brussels by Europe\u2019s rather more skilful negotiators\u201d, suggesting that Boris Johnson\u2019s greatest weapon in the negotiations to come would be his \u201cunmatched flexibility with the truth\u201d. \u201cHis so-called triumph of achieving a deal for Brexit phase one was only possible because he betrayed his big promise to the DUP,\u201d Davey added, describing the PM\u2019s tactics as \u201cbulldog bluster combined with the record of a turncoat\u201d. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is the right approach and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll succeed without reneging on almost all of his previous promises to leave voters. \u201cWhether or not, in the dark Conservative forests of the Brexit Spartans, his erstwhile friends have yet smelt betrayal.\u201d The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has announced that there will be no return to power-sharing in the region before Christmas, blaming the DUP for preventing the move which would have seen the government release extra money for the NHS there. Smith said: \u201cI am deeply disappointed that we have not got all five parties in agreement,\u201d and asked the DUP, the largest party in Northern Ireland, to reconsider. The party said there were outstanding issues under negotiation that would not be resolved in the coming days, and work remained to be done to achieve a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d agreement. The second largest party, Sinn F\u00e9in, had joined the British and Irish governments in making a push to re-establish devolved institutions, ending a three-year hiatus. Smith said: \u201cWe want all parties to be positively part of the new Stormont. The DUP is a crucial part of that. \u201cI don\u2019t think time is going to make any difference, I think hanging around, delay, not making decisions is not going to make any difference, it is only going to cause more heartache and problems for citizens in Northern Ireland. \u201cI just hope there is time tonight to reflect on that decision.\u201d People in the DUP did want to break the deadlock, he said, and he asked them to make their voices heard. \u201cI would urge them to move forward so that we can get this done.\u201d The shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, has thrown his hat into the ring to become the next Labour leader. Writing in the Guardian, the 48-year-old MP for Norwich North, who is seen to be on the left of the party, said that Labour had suffered \u201cits own Dunkirk\u201d at the election, but that they could bounce back if they gave activists a stake in any changes. The truth is that despite his enormous achievements in inspiring a new generation of members, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s first promise as leader was never fulfilled. The party was never democratised on the scale or to the extent that members were led to expect \u2013 they were never empowered to campaign, select candidates or determine policy on the scale that was required. This must now change. We don\u2019t need foot soldiers, we need an army of activists who think critically, treat each other with respect and have a serious democratic stake in the movement. I don\u2019t want to manage the labour movement, I want to unleash it. That is the first route to victory. Lewis claims that the party still has to make a clear break with the New Labour era: The party was never able to communicate this to voters in our heartlands. When trying to persuade them of our radicalism and sincerity, we often had the legacy of the 2000s thrown back in our faces. Persuading voters that we understand the sources of their long-held resentment and frustration, of their disappointment in how Labour has conducted itself since the 1990s, will be the first step towards winning back their trust. Yvette Cooper, who has yet to comment on whether she will run for the Labour leadership, has also responded to the lack of a commitment to negotiate an agreement to allow unaccompanied refugee children to come to the UK to join relatives (see 17:27). Paul Golding, the leader of the far-right group Britain First, said that he has attempted to join the Conservative party, to show his support for comments that Boris Johnson has previously made about Islam. Golding told the Press Association that he liked the \u201ccut of the cloth\u201d of Johnson when the prime minister described women wearing the burqa as resembling \u201cletterboxes\u201d in a column in the Daily Telegraph. Golding, who has been convicted and imprisoned for religiously aggravated harassment and is a former British National Party councillor, said: \u201cPrimarily, we had the experience of Momentum joining the Labour party en masse to consolidate the leadership position of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cWe have decided to do the same but in reverse. We are all joining to see if we can consolidate Boris\u2019s leadership over the Tory party. He is getting Brexit done but, as well as that, he has made a lot of comments in the past referring to burqa and niqab-wearing women as \u2018letterboxes\u2019. \u201cAfter the London Bridge attack, he said he wanted to crack down on the early release of terrorist prisoners. We like the cut of the cloth on Boris Johnson.\u201d Golding added: \u201cHe is more of a populist leader and I think in recent weeks he has nailed his colours to the mast against immigration and being for Brexit.\u201d Golding shared a screenshot of an email from the Tories following his application which was electronically signed by Tory chairmen and MPs James Cleverly and Ben Elliot, welcoming him to the party at 2pm on Thursday. It reads: \u201cYour membership is now activated. You can now attend party events both locally and nationally. Your membership card will be sent out shortly.\u201d However a Tory spokeswoman said today: \u201cPaul Golding\u2019s application for membership of the Conservative party has not been approved. \u201cWhile we welcome new members from a wide variety of backgrounds, we are vigilant against those seeking to join the party who do not share our aims. There is a process in place for local Conservative associations to approve members who apply to join, or to reject those who do not share the party\u2019s values or objects. \u201cWe support local associations with this work to ensure they can and do take action where needed.\u201d The Independent Group for Change, the party formally known as Change UK which launched in February 2019, has announced that it is beginning the process of winding itself up. At its high-water mark the party boasted 11 MPs from the two main parties, but after failing to make any electoral headway in May\u2019s European elections, six of the party\u2019s MPs left, many to join the Lib Dems. Only three MPs stood in last week\u2019s election, all of them losing their seats. Here is Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, responding to the revelation that the new EU (withdrawal agreement) bill does not contain a commitment to negotiate an agreement to allow unaccompanied refugee children to come to the UK to join a relative that was in the original version. LabourList has a full story on this here. No 10 says the absence of this clause from the bill does not mean its policy has changed. A spokesman said: We are committed to ensuring that children who are claiming asylum or international protection will be reunited with specified family members in the EU and vice versa. The government\u2019s policy on child refugees has not changed and we will continue to do all we can to enable children to claim asylum and be reunited with their families, which the legislation published today reaffirms. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Seth Jacobson is now taking over. No 10 is now ruling out making judicial appointments subject to political approval, the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn says. An earlier briefing did not rule this out, leaving reporters to conclude it was an option (particularly in the light of the PM\u2019s previous remarks on this). See 5.01pm. The government stuck to its existing priorities for education in the Queen\u2019s speech, ticking off the policies in its manifesto and beforehand. Apart from vague comments on free schools (\u201ccontinue to expand\u201d) and university tuition fees (\u201cdelivering value for money\u201d), it reaffirms the improvement in school funding for pupils aged 4 to 16 in England, eventually increasing the annual schools budget by \u00a37.1bn in 2022-23. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the extra spending is \u00a34.3bn a year in real-terms From next year some of the extra funding will be distributed by minimum per-pupil funding via the new national funding formula, the Department for Education has announced. That helps the most poorly funded schools outside of cities, with \u00a33,750 for each primary pupil and \u00a35,000 for secondary pupils, with primaries rising again to \u00a34,000 per pupil in 2021. Schools in Bedfordshire appear to be the biggest winners by 2021. But the government\u2019s notes on the Queen\u2019s speech also mention its plans to raise starting pay for qualified teachers to \u00a330,000 by 2022, a pledge which will have to be funded out of school budgets. And while the government is correct to claim that the extra \u00a3400m for post-16 education is the biggest increase since 2010, the college sector has been starved of funds in that time. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says: The extra money being delivered next year is nowhere near enough to repair this damage and will still leave the funding rate for students a long way short of what it needs to be. While the Commons continues to debate the Queen\u2019s speech, at Holyrood MSPs have been debating the final stage of the referendums (Scotland) bill, the framework bill which paves the way for a second independence referendum, should it be approved by Westminster, as the first minster, Nicola Sturgeon, demanded earlier today. This framework bill does not set the date or question on the ballot, which have to be specified in further primary legislation, and much of the debate has centred around that question and whether it will be the same yes/no as 2014. The draft bill originally stated the Electoral Commission would not be consulted if it had previously assessed or recommended a question, as with the yes/no format for the 2014 referendum. Critics argued yes/no favoured the affirmative side, and the commission subsequently recommended the options of leave and remain for the 2016 EU referendum. While the commission has not ruled out a future yes/no question on independence, it believes the assessment should be based on current evidence and political context, and now a compromise amendment has been accepted which states, in summary: if the question has been asked within the same parliamentary session then the commission does not automatically have to assess the question (though Holyrood can ask for it to do so), and if the question has been asked in the previous parliamentary session then Scottish ministers can lodge a motion to extend the \u2018validity period\u2019 of the question which, if passed, would mean the question did not need to be reassessed. This really only matters if a second independence referendum is held next year \u2013 beyond 2021, the question will not have been asked in the past two sessions and so will automatically have to be assessed again. Theresa May, the former prime minister, spoke in the Queen\u2019s speech debate after Ian Blackford. On election night, when interviewed by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil, she had difficulty answering a question from him about why Boris Johnson had been able to win dozens of leave-voting Labour seats when her attempt to do the same thing in 2017 failed. This afternoon she had a clear answer to that question. She said: I hope [Johnson] will forgive me if I just reflect that this was the result that was supposed to happen in 2017. But of course back then people still thought the Labour party was supporting Brexit. Two years on they saw that was a sham, a pretence and a betrayal of millions of traditional Labour voters. Those Labour voters have now elected Conservative members of parliament. This victory brings with it a huge responsibility. Here are some lines from the afternoon No 10 briefing. These are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn and the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. In an interview at the time of the Conservative party conference Boris Johnson hinted that he was in favour of confirmation hearings of this kind. He said: If judges are to pronounce on political questions [as they did in the prorogation case], then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability. The lessons of America are relevant. But Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has said he would not be enthusiastic about this. That is a reference to this HuffPost story. Zac Goldsmith, who lost his seat as MP for Richmond Park last week, is being given a peerage, No 10 has announced. This will allow him to carry on as an environment minister based jointly in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and in the Department for International Development, an appointment that No 10 has also confirmed. In this role he will attend cabinet, as he did when he was doing this job before the election, government sources have confirmed. It was widely expected that Goldsmith would get a peerage. A lifelong environmentalist, he was regarded as particularly well qualified for his ministerial post. He is also a committed Brexiter (his billionaire father set up the Referendum party, an early Eurosceptic party that made the case for a referendum on the EU in the 1990s) and he is good friends with the PM\u2019s partner Carrie Symonds, who once worked for Goldsmith as an adviser and who campaigned for him during the election. Like Johnson, Goldsmith is also an Old Etonian. In his speech in the Queen\u2019s speech debate Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, challenged Boris Johnson to explain why he would not allow the Scottish government to hold another independence referendum. Blackford said: This morning Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has written to the prime minister to demand the transfer of legal powers to the Scottish government to hold a second independence referendum under Section 30 of the Scotland Act ... It is for the prime minister to explain to the people of Scotland why he is denying Scotland the right to choose our own future? Why did democracy stop in the prime minister\u2019s world with the independence referendum in 2014? At one point Blackford criticised Johnson for looking at his phone during the speech. It was \u201cnot a good look\u201d, Blackford said. In response, Johnson said Blackford should say something interesting. Blackford replied: The prime minister says \u2018say something more interesting\u2019. Well, prime minister, this is about democracy, this is about the Scottish National party that stood in the election on a manifesto about Scotland\u2019s right to choose. And it was about the Conservatives who said no to indyref2, and what happened? Well the Conservatives lost more than half their members of parliament. Prime minister, you got your answer from the people of Scotland. This is what my colleague Simon Murphy wrote in September on the feasibility of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson\u2019s comment about a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland may help to explain this reference to a large-scale infrastructure project in a letter (pdf) published this week by the advisory committee on business appointments, approving a part-time job with an iron and steel making company being taken by the former minister Jo Johnson (the PM\u2019s brother). At one point Jo Johnson was a transport minister. Towards the end of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech, the DUP MP Ian Paisley intervened and asked him to go ahead with the proposal to build a \u201cBoris bridge\u201d between Scotland and Northern Ireland. In response, Johnson hinted that he does want to pursue the idea. He said: As for his desire for a bridge to connect the two biggest isles in the British Isles, all I can say is it is a very interesting idea. I advise [Paisley] to watch this space - and indeed, watch that space between those islands, because what he has said has not fallen on deaf ears. Johnson has hinted at his support for the construction of a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland several times in the past, most recently in September, although one expert has described the idea as \u201cabout as feasible as building a bridge to the moon\u201d. In the Commons, Boris Johnson is now winding up. He says, after dithering and platitudes, the time has come for action. That is what is is offering, he says. Here is the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, commenting on the revelation in the Queen\u2019s speech briefing pack that the commitment to raise the national living wage to \u00a310.50 is now conditional on the economy continuing to prosper. (See 2.14pm.) Johnson says the system of government at Westminster needs to meet the challenges of a new era. So the government will set up a commission to look at measures that could restore trust in government. As a first step, it will repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, he says. Johnson says tomorrow he will \u201cpeel back the plastic wrapping\u201d and present his oven-ready Brexit bill. Then, he says, he wants to focus on the NHS. And he invites the opposition to join in cross-party talks on social care. The government will abolish no-fault eviction for renters, he says. And it will ban strikes that target commuters. He says he wants to revolutionise local transport. Leeds is the biggest city in Europe without an underground or light rail system, he says. Johnson jokes about Corbyn being \u201ca stickler for watching the Queen\u2019s speech at the right time\u201d. He says, as his exchanges with Corbyn come to an end, he wants to say that his personal relations with him have been excellent. And he says Corbyn\u2019s sincerity is not to be doubted. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says this is the moment to repay the people who voted for the government. People do not just want the government to get Brexit done, he says. He says they want it to move on and address other problems. Johnson sums up some of the Queen\u2019s speech proposals. And he says its ambition stretches beyond one parliament. This is not a programme for one year or one parliament; it is a blueprint for the future of Britain. He claims a \u201cnew golden age for this United Kingdom\u201d is on offer. And the government will work flat out to deliver it, he says. The Queen\u2019s speech does nothing for young people worried about tuition fees, and nothing for older people facing poverty, he says. And there is no mention of universal credit, a cruel policy that has ruined many lives, he says. Corbyn says rough sleeping has doubled under the Tories in government. He says everyone who sees people sleeping on the streets knows this is morally wrong. He says that, according to Shelter, there will be 280,000 people homeless at Christmas \u2013 either sleeping rough, or in temporary accommodation. He challenges Johnson to fund the removal of dangerous cladding from blocks of flats, and to pay for the installation of sprinklers. Corbyn says the Queen\u2019s speech contains nothing of substance to deal with the climate emergency. He says many of the big polluters fund the Tories. Corbyn says Labour will oppose the government\u2019s attempt to limit the right of transport workers to go on strike. He claims the proposals on this would contravene the International Labour Organization conventions. Corbyn asks Johnson to deny reports that he wants to merge the Department for International Development. He says setting up DfID was a proud Labour achievement. Turning to Brexit, Corbyn says Johnson has resurrected the threat of a no-deal Brexit, and included it in his bill. Johnson\u2019s priority is a toxic trade deal with Donald Trump, he says. He says the British do not want chlorinated chicken. Under Johnson, trade talks could go on for years, Corbyn says. Back in the Commons Jeremy Corbyn is now on to the serious substance of his speech. He says Labour won the argument on austerity. And he mocks the proposal for an NHS funding bill. He says the last Labour government did not need to pass legislation to force itself to invest in the NHS. He criticises Boris Johnson\u2019s claim to be delivering 50,000 new nurses and 40 new hospitals. There are only 30,000 new nurses, he says, and only six new hospitals. And, referring to what Johnson said about social care when he took office, Corbyn says Johnson\u2019s claim to have a plan (see 1.45pm) was just an empty promise. And this is from MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse. Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, has more on the new version of the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now in the debate. He starts with tributes to the backbenchers who proposed and seconded the loyal address. The government has published the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. It runs to 101 pages and you can read it here (pdf). This is from Graeme Cowie, a Commons clerk. No 10 had already announced that the clause allowing the transition to be extended would be removed. And we knew the workers\u2019 rights protections were going - although Michael Gove has claimed that the protections in the employment bill will compensate. (See 1.16pm.) The original bill had a long clause, clause 31, titled \u201cOversight of negotiations for future relationship\u201d. It said the government could not engage in negotiations on the future relationship with the EU unless a statement setting out the negotiating objectives had been passed by MPs. That clause has gone, and the new clause 31 relates to the repeal of section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act. Eddie Hughes, the Conservative MP for Walsall North, is speaking now. He says he normally only gets called right at the end of debate, when the chamber is empty. Crouch says she hopes the Conservatives will govern in the one-nation tradition. She represents Chatham. Charles Dickens lived in Chatham, and she says he was a great social reformer. He also knew the importance of laughter and good humour. She says she hopes MPs will learn from that. Crouch jokes about Penny Mordaunt\u2019s famous \u201ccock\u201d speech in the Commons, and then delivers a very sharp joke about Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, saying he now realises that Dover is an important trading post. It is a reference to this admission from Raab when he was Brexit secretary \u2013 a comment he would rather forget. Tracey Crouch, the Conservative former sports minister, is proposing the loyal address to the Queen. Two backbenchers are invited to propose and second the loyal address. They are expected to give short, witty speeches. Crouch starts by saying this honour normally goes to someone whose career is behind them. Given that it is panto season, she prompts MPs to shout \u201cOh, no it\u2019s not\u201d when she says her career is behind her. Switching to a Christmas Carol theme, she suggests that Philip Hammond (who is no longer an MP) would fit the role of Scrooge. And Jeremy Corbyn could be Marley, she suggests. Corbyn remains stony-faced at this allusion. MPs have now approved the motion to sit tomorrow by acclamation. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says he was anxious to ensure that MPs did not have to come back on Monday. From my colleague Libby Brooks MPs are about to start the Queen\u2019s speech debate. But, first, Sir Lindsay Hoyle is explaining why he is allowing the second reading of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill tomorrow. Normally a bill like this would not have a second reading on a Friday, and certainly not just one day after the Queen\u2019s speech. Hoyle says other parties in the house have been consulted and the circumstances justify this. The Unite union has now responded to the Anna Turley libel decision. (See 2.22pm.) It is going to appeal. A spokesperson for the union said: Unite is very disappointed with the court\u2019s decision. Anna Turley joined a section of Unite which was only open to the unwaged, this was to enable her to hide her membership from Unite and for the sole purpose of voting in the union\u2019s general secretary election. She then chose to sue for comments released by a Unite press spokesperson which appeared in a publication that we maintain we did not have responsibility for. We note how critical the judgment is of how Ms Turley\u2019s legal team handled this case in so far as they delayed the disclosure of evidence crucial to how Ms Turley came to join Unite, disclosure that revealed the existence of a secretive grouping of MPs. However ultimately the union does not agree with the court\u2019s findings on several points of law, including the finding as to the meaning of the statement originally made by Unite and including the finding as to whether the commentary was a matter of public interest. Unite will therefore be appealing the decision. Turning back to social care, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the World at One that he hoped to start cross-party talks aimed at finding a consensus on the way forward \u201cimmediately in the new year\u201d. But, given that at that point the Labour leadership contest will just be properly getting under way, Hancock may find that the opposition is not in a position to engage at that point. The Lib Dems are also without a permanent leader at the moment. Anna Turley has released this statement about the libel case. (See 2.22pm.) A former Labour MP who sued a union for libel has won a high court fight and been awarded \u00a375,000 damages, the Press Association reports. Anna Turley \u2013 who lost her seat in Redcar, North Yorkshire, in the general election on 12 December \u2013 had sued Unite and blogger Stephen Walker over an item on the Skwawkbox blog. When Sajid Javid, the chancellor, told the Tory conference in September that the government would raise the national living wage to \u00a310.50 an hour over five years, that sounded like a clear commitment. It was in the manifesto (pdf) too as a promise about what would happen under a Conservative government, not something that might happen. But now an element of doubt seems to be creeping in. As the government briefing document (pdf) on the Queen\u2019s speech reveals, the national living wage increase will only take place \u201cprovided economic conditions allow\u201d. This implies that, in the event of a recession, the rise won\u2019t go ahead. The document says: The chancellor has pledged that the national living wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around \u00a310.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow. I\u2019m grateful to SuffolkJason BTL for flagging this up. Here is my colleague Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, on the plans for a review of spying legislation. (See 12.08pm.) The Queen\u2019s speech says almost nothing new on social care, beyond restating the outline approach Boris Johnson sketched out during the general election campaign: an extra \u00a31bn a year for councils, seeking cross-party consensus on a way forward, and ensuring no one should have to sell their home to pay for care. But the government briefing paper (pdf) does say that the government may continue to allow councils to raise money for social care through a social care precept. This is something that has been happening since 2016; councils are allowed to raise council tax by an extra 2%, provided the revenue goes to social care. The government document says: The government is providing councils with an additional \u00a31bn for adults and children\u2019s social care in every year of this parliament. In addition, the government will consult on a 2% precept that will enable councils to access a further \u00a3500m for adult social care for 2020-21. The absence of a detailed plan for social care is an embarrassment because, in his first speech as PM in July, Johnson claimed that he had a \u201cclear plan\u201d to deal with the problem. He said: I am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve. Earlier this week, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, played down reports that the protection of workers\u2019 rights would not be included in the EU withdrawal agreement bill, saying there would be a separate bill on employment rights in the Queen\u2019s speech. There is an employment bill in the Queen\u2019s speech. According to the government\u2019s briefing document (pdf), it will make flexible working the default, give workers the right to request a more predictable contract and ensure workers get the tips in full left for them. The government says the bill will \u201cprotect and enhance workers\u2019 rights as the UK leaves the EU, making Britain the best place in the world to work\u201d. But the briefing does not say anything about how UK employment rights will or will not remain aligned with EU employment rights. Fresh from her Bute House media event (see 10.10am), calling for both section 30 order powers to hold a second Scottish independence referendum and the permanent devolution of those powers to Holyrood, Nicola Sturgeon has faced sustained questioning on her domestic record at FMQs. The Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, raised a series of public service failures revealed over the past week, on ferries, railways and hospitals. Yesterday the Scottish government stripped Abellio, Scotland\u2019s main railway operator, of their franchise three years early after anger from commuters over cancellations and poor services. On the same day the finance secretary revealed that taxpayers were facing a \u00a3100m bill for two lifeline ferries after a catalogue of errors and mismanagement by contractors. Carlaw accused Sturgeon of \u201cshowboating in front of the cameras\u201d this morning, while ignoring the patients let down by poor hospital waiting times. He said every public service run by the SNP was ending the year in a worse place than when it began, while the Lib Dem leader, Willie Rennie, told Sturgeon that \u201cevery hour she takes off to hold another press conference at Bute House is another hour wasted trying to sort out [public services] that matter to the people of Scotland\u201d. Sturgeon accused Rennie of \u201cborrowing his question\u201d from Carlaw, and said childcare staffing was increasing, waiting times improving and the attainment gap closing, although citing the same Pisa education study that showed Scotland\u2019s performance in maths and science at a record low, and reading levels lower than they were at the start of the millennium. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, raised an interesting point about Scottish workers missing out on renewables jobs across the country, while those who are employed are stuck on short-term contracts. The union Unite has talked about a \u201crenewables scandal\u201d as jobs are placed increasingly with overseas firms. Here is some video of Jeremy Corbyn doing his best to avoid even looking at Boris Johnson, let alone talk to him, as they process from the Commons chamber to the Lords together to listen to the Queen\u2019s speech. Johnson does not seem too hurt by the snub. The October Queen\u2019s speech promised an environment bill, to improve air and water quality and to tackle plastic pollution, and the same bill is in today\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech. But now the government is saying explicitly the legislation will \u201cban the export of polluting plastic waste to non-OECD countries\u201d, with industry, NGOs and councils being consulted on when this could be achieved. This will be tough - Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea and India all take our plastic waste - and we have yet to build a domestic recycling industry which can keep this waste and use it here in a circular economy. We export two thirds of our plastic waste. The Department for Exiting the European Union will be wound up on 31 January, the government has announced. A government spokesman said the news was broken to DExEU staff today. It has been been reported that, after the UK leaves the EU at the end of January, Boris Johnson will conducted an extensive reshuffle involving changes to the way Whitehall is organised. One option is for DExEU\u2019s functions to be taken over by a beefed-up Department for International Trade, which would take the lead in negotiating post-Brexit trade deals. In his foreword to the government briefing notes (pdf) on the Queen\u2019s speech, Boris Johnson makes it clear he is planning a programme for the next 10 years. He says: This is a radical Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 it will take us out of the EU, overhaul our immigration system, and will enshrine in law record investment for the NHS. And it will take our country forward with an ambitious one nation programme to unite and spread opportunity to every corner of our United Kingdom. Just imagine where this country could be in 10 years\u2019 time. A country with 40 new state-of-the-art hospitals. More fantastic nurses and fantastic doctors. More police officers making our streets safer. Children given a chance to reach their full potential. Cleaner air. Biodiversity protected. Scientists making incredible breakthroughs in technology. Better transport. Better infrastructure bringing people together. Greater connectivity. Greater opportunity. A Britain where we are uniting and levelling up. That is the future we are going to deliver. That is the future I am going to be working round the clock to achieve. I am humbled by the trust millions of voters placed in this government last week. The work to repay that trust starts here. Unless the repeal of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act is going to go a lot further than any of us were expecting (the Act is the law saying a general election has to take place every five years, replacing the Septennial Act which used to be the legislation setting a time limit for the maximum length of a parliament), Johnson must be assuming that winning the next election won\u2019t be too much of a problem. Leo Varadkar reckons Boris Johnson is eccentric \u2013 but in a good way. The Irish taoiseach outed himself as something of a fan of the prime minister in an TV interview on Wednesday. \u201cHe is the guy that you see, he\u2019s bright, he\u2019s witty, very personable, but he is a bit eccentric as well. He\u2019s not the standard politician but that\u2019s probably a good thing on balance,\u201d he told Virgin Media One. Asked whether he considered Johnson to be really a Europhile and not a Eurosceptic he replied: The story goes anyway that it was a hard decision for him whether he was going to come out for or against Brexit. I definitely think he is internationally orientated though. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a little Englander. I do think he wants to see Britain as having a role to play in Europe and the world. Despite Johnson reportedly mocking Varadkar\u2019s surname \u2013 \u201cwhy isn\u2019t he called Murphy like the rest of them?\u201d \u2013 the two men hit it off during a meeting in October that paved the Brexit deal. The prime minister\u2019s Love Actually spoof campaign video probably boosted his stock with the taoiseach. Varadkar is a fan of the film and cited it when visiting Theresa May at Downing Street in 2017. There was nothing in the Queen\u2019s speech two months ago about new spying legislation. But now the government is proposing legislation to give the security services \u201cthe tools they need to disrupt hostile state activity\u201d. The government notes (pdf) say this is something that has been planned since the Salisbury poisoning attack. The government says: The government is considering whether to follow allies in adopting a form of foreign agent registration, updating the Official Secrets Acts for the 21st century, as well as the case for updating treason laws. The Law Commission have been commissioned by the government to review the Official Secrets Acts. The Official Secrets Acts are the only pieces of UK legislation that currently exist to specifically address hostile state activity such as espionage, sabotage and subversion, other than the ports stop power we included in the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019. The government will reflect on their final recommendations when published. The government is also considering like-minded international partners\u2019 legislation, to see whether the UK would benefit from adopting something similar. This includes the US and Australia. Here is the text of the Queen\u2019s speech. And here is the 151-page government briefing document (pdf) giving details of the bills and other legislative proposals planned for this session of parliament. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn The Queen\u2019s speech always ends with two messages. Members of the House of Commons, estimates for the public services will be laid before you. This is addressed to MPs only, because the House of Lords does not deal with the estimates, the government\u2019s department-by-department spending plans. The Queen goes on: My lords and members of the House of Commons, other measures will be laid before you. This means that, notwithstanding what is being announced today, the government reserves the right to introduce other bills. Governments often pass very significant bills at short notice that were never featured in the Queen\u2019s speech. The Queen ends: I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels. And that\u2019s it. The speech is over. The final passages are about defence and foreign policy. My ministers will continue to invest in our gallant armed forces. My government will honour the armed forces covenant, which will be further incorporated into law, and the Nato commitment to spend at least 2% of national income on defence. It will bring forward proposals to tackle vexatious claims that undermine our armed forces and will continue to seek better ways of dealing with legacy issues that provide better outcomes for victims and survivors. My government will work to promote and expand the United Kingdom\u2019s influence in the world. An integrated security, defence and foreign policy review will be undertaken to reassess the nation\u2019s place in the world, covering all aspects of international policy from defence to diplomacy and development. My ministers will promote the United Kingdom\u2019s interests, including freedom of speech, human rights and the rule of law. My government will work closely with international partners to help solve the most complex international security issues and promote peace and security globally. It will stand firm against those who threaten the values of the United Kingdom, including by developing a sanctions regime to directly address human rights abuse, and working to ensure that all girls have access to 12 years of quality education. To protect members of the armed forces from \u201cvexatious claims\u201d, the government is proposing an armed forces (legal protections) bill. More on Johnson and Corbyn, from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From ITV\u2019s Joe Pike The Queen turns to the constitution. A constitution, democracy and rights commission will be established. Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Sometimes the Queen\u2019s speech is significant for what it does not say. This tells us very little about what the government is planning, but there was a passage in the Conservative manifesto that triggered suspicions that Boris Johnson has grand ambitions in this area. It said: After Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people ... In our first year we will set up a constitution, democracy and rights commission that will examine these issues in depth, and come up with proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates. Ministers have said very little about what this means in practice. The next section of the speech covers the economy and climate change. My ministers will bring forward measures to ensure that every part of the United Kingdom can prosper. My government will invest in the country\u2019s public services and infrastructure whilst keeping borrowing and debt under control, maintaining the sustainability of the public finances through a responsible fiscal strategy. My government will prioritise investment in infrastructure and world-leading science research and skills, in order to unleash productivity and improve daily life for communities across the country. It will give communities more control over how investment is spent so that they can decide what is best for them. To support business, my government will increase tax credits for research and development, establish a national skills fund, and bring forward changes to business rates. New laws will accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband. To ensure people can depend on the transport network, measures will be developed to provide for minimum levels of service during transport strikes. My government will continue to take steps to meet the world-leading target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It will continue to lead the way in tackling global climate change, hosting the COP26 summit in 2020. To protect and improve the environment for future generations, a bill will enshrine in law environmental principles and legally binding targets, including for air quality. It will also ban the export of polluting plastic waste to countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and establish a new, world-leading independent regulator in statute. There will be two bills covering broadband, a telecommunications infrastructure (leasehold property) bill and a telecommunications (connectivity) bill. There will also be an environment bill. From Labour\u2019s Anneliese Dodds Now the Queen is talking about law and order. My government is committed to a fair justice system that keeps people safe. My ministers will establish a royal commission to review and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice process. New sentencing laws will ensure the most serious violent offenders, including terrorists, serve longer in custody. New laws will require schools, police, councils and health authorities to work together to prevent serious crime. My government will ensure those charged with knife possession face swift justice and that the courts work better for all those who engage with them, including victims of domestic abuse. Legislation will be brought forward to support victims of crime and their families. Measures will be developed to tackle hostile activity conducted by foreign states. There are five bills being proposed relating to criminal justice: a counter-terrorism (sentencing and release) bill, a sentencing bill, a serious violence bill, a domestic abuse bill, and a prisoners (disclosure of information about victims) bill \u2013 as well as divorce legislation, the divorce, dissolution and separation bill. The next bit of the speech covers immigration and what might broadly be seen as cost of living measures. The Queen says: A modern, fair, points-based immigration system will welcome skilled workers from across the world to contribute to the United Kingdom\u2019s economy, communities and public services. My government will bring forward measures to support working families, raising the national insurance threshold and increasing the national living wage. To ensure every child has access to a high-quality education my ministers will increase levels of funding per pupil in every school. Measures will be brought forward to encourage flexible working, to introduce the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers and to help people save for later life. New measures will be brought forward to protect tenants and to improve building safety. My government will take steps to support home ownership, including by making homes available at a discount for local first-time buyers. My ministers will develop legislation to improve internet safety for all. On immigration, there will be an immigration and social security coordination (EU withdrawal) bill. The other bills referred to here are an employment bill, a pension schemes bill, a renters\u2019 reform bill, a fire safety bill, a building safety bill and an online harms bill. More on Johnson and Corbyn. The Queen turns to the NHS. The integrity and prosperity of the United Kingdom is of the utmost importance to my government. My ministers will work urgently to facilitate talks to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland. My government will embark on an ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people\u2019s priorities. For the first time, the National Health Service\u2019s multi-year funding settlement, agreed earlier this year, will be enshrined in law. Steps will be taken to grow and support the National Health Service\u2019s workforce and a new visa will ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom. Hospital car parking charges will be removed for those in greatest need. My ministers will seek cross-party consensus on proposals for long-term reform of social care. They will ensure that the social care system provides everyone with the dignity and security they deserve and that no one who needs care has to sell their home to pay for it. My ministers will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act. The government is proposing two NHS bills: an NHS funding bill, and an NHS long-term plan bill. The Queen is speaking now. My lords and members of the House of Commons. My government\u2019s priority is to deliver the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 January. My ministers will bring forward legislation to ensure the United Kingdom\u2019s exit on that date and to make the most of the opportunities that this brings for all the people of the United Kingdom. Thereafter, my ministers will seek a future relationship with the European Union based on a free trade agreement that benefits the whole of the United Kingdom. They will also begin trade negotiations with other leading global economies. The Queen is referring to the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, that will get its second reading tomorrow, and to five related Brexit bills: the agriculture bill, the fisheries bill, the trade bill, the financial services bill and the private international law (implementation of agreements) bill. The Queen is about to start. Boris Johnson is still grinning intensely. MPs are now processing from the Commons to the Lords, having been summoned by Black Rod. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are walking side by side, although they don\u2019t seem to be talking. Johnson is smiling; Corbyn isn\u2019t. The Queen is now on the throne in the House of Lords. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, is now processing into the chamber of the Commons. The royal standard is flying above the Houses of Parliament now that the Queen has arrived. This is the Queen\u2019s 66th Queen\u2019s speech, according to the BBC. The Queen is leaving Buckingham Palace on her way to Westminster. Here are some more lines from Emily Thornberry\u2019s interview with the Today programme this morning. Thornberry said that one of her strengths was that she could offer \u201cclear strategic thinking\u201d. Referring to how she argued against Labour agreeing to an early election, she said: It\u2019s important that people understand about the fact that I can make political decisions and that I am strategic, and in the end that\u2019s going to be a very important part of the leadership ... We need to be able to work out what we\u2019re doing, and where we\u2019re going, and rather than just be reactive all the time. I think that it\u2019s very important, particularly now that we\u2019re going to be in opposition, that we have an idea as to how we will take Boris Johnson on, how we will hold him to account, and not, as I say, just allow ourselves to be kind of knocked around like a ball in a pinball machine. She cited the response to the Salisbury poisoning attack as an example of when Jeremy Corbyn was led down by his advisers. She said: Obviously within my own brief there was the issue of the Salisbury poisonings, where Jeremy seemed to have said one thing in parliament and then a different spin was put on it when briefed afterwards. That undermined him. Those sorts of things need to be called out, and I call it out. She dismissed suggestions that her background might be a handicap in the the leadership contest. She said: I am southern, I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m not. But the point is you\u2019ve got to come from somewhere ... What you need to do is to be able to be empathetic and listen to the public throughout the country, and, as for this kind of class issue, people who know me know that I come from a council estate. People who know me know that I was brought up by a single parent on benefits. The fact of the matter is what makes me a good politician is that I have had a very mixed life, I have had a large amount of life experience, and I can empathise because I have been there. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has insisted \u201cdemocracy must and will prevail\u201d as she confirmed she has now written to Boris Johnson formally requesting the power for Holyrood to hold a second independence referendum, the Press Association reports. She said that following last week\u2019s election victory in which her party took 47 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, the case for another referendum was \u201cunarguable\u201d. In a statement delivered at Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said: The alternative is a future that we have rejected being imposed upon us. Scotland made it very clear last week it does not want a Tory government led by Boris Johnson taking us out of the European Union. That is the future we face if we do not have the opportunity to consider the alternative of independence. Sturgeon has also published a 38-page report (pdf) setting out arguments for why Scotland should have the power to decide for itself to hold a legally valid independence referendum, instead of having to get approval from London under the Scotland Act, as is the case now. The UK government has said it will not give the Scottish parliament the power to hold a second independence referendum, arguing that the matter was settled by the referendum in 2014. But Sturgeon said: The question is often posed to me: what will you do if the prime minister says no? But the document we are publishing today turns the question on its head. It is for the prime minister to defend why he believes the UK is not a voluntary union of equal nations. It is for him to set out why he does not believe people in Scotland have the right to self-determination. And it is for the prime minister to explain why he believes it is acceptable to ignore election after election in Scotland and to override a democratic mandate stronger than the one he claims for his Brexit deal. We live in a democracy, and ultimately democracy must and will prevail. UPDATE: Here is some video from the press conference. Good morning. It\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech day, again, with the Queen heading for parliament only two months after her last visit to read out the government\u2019s legislative programme. Only this time it\u2019s for real, because Boris Johnson now has a majority to pass the bills he is announcing. We are expecting the speech to be a beefed-up version of what we heard in October, with some of the measures in the phantom Queen\u2019s speech being regurgitated, but some extra legislation added too. Here is my colleague Matthew Weaver\u2019s preview story. In the meantime electioneering in the Labour leadership contest continues. Having declared her candidature with an article in the Guardian yesterday, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has been giving interviews this morning. In her article she criticised Jeremy Corbyn for ignoring her warning that backing an early election would be an \u201cact of catastrophic political folly\u201d. Today, though, Thornberry has shifted her focus somewhat, laying the blame for Labour\u2019s failings not so much with Corbyn himself, but with his advisers. This is what she told Sky News when asked if she was willing to blame Corbyn for the election defeat. I\u2019m prepared to tell the truth, which is that in 2017 Jeremy was authentic, he spoke clearly, he spoke truthfully, people liked it. And what was the difference between 2017 and 2019? I think it was that we had been triangulating on the issue of Brexit, so people weren\u2019t quite sure where we were. I think we had other issues like antisemitism, like our response to Salisbury, where I think that Jeremy was just very badly advised. And in the end advisers should be there to give advice and politicians should be there to make the decisions. And too often we saw a situation where advisers felt that they were more important and should have more of a steer, in terms of where the Labour party was going, than the elected politicians. And that\u2019s not right. Thornberry did not name the advisers she was referring to. But people in the Labour party will have understood that she was referring to Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s director of communications and strategy, and Karie Murphy, who was Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff before being moved to Labour HQ to run the general election, reportedly in response to complaints about how she was running his office. When it was put to Thornberry that she was talking about these two, she did not demur. She also suggested Milne and Murphy should be dismissed. Referring to the fact that staff working in Labour\u2019s HQ, in Corbyn\u2019s office and for the shadow cabinet are facing the sack, but not Milne and Murphy, she said that was wrong. She said: Those redundancies don\u2019t seem to include the most senior people in the Labour party who made the decisions during the election. And that\u2019s not fair. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, holds a press conference to mark the publication of a paper making the case for Scotland being given the power to hold a second independence referendum. 11.25am: The state opening of parliament commences, with MPs and peers gathering in the Lords to hear the Queen\u2019s speech. 2.30pm: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn speak in the Queen\u2019s speech debate. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although mostly I will be focusing on the Queen\u2019s speech and the subsequent debate. We plan to publish a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Again.<br><strong>Mike Cashman</strong><br><em>Author, Brexit\u2019s a Trick not a Treat and Brexit\u2019s a Musical Trick</em></p> <p>\u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is right to be concerned about the sense of abandonment faced by the unionist community in Northern Ireland. They have been badly served by the DUP and face a very uncertain future if Johnson\u2019s deal is implemented unamended. His deal runs the risk of crippling the Northern Irish economy and is unlikely to be tenable in the short to medium term.</p> <p>The trouble with offering a united Ireland as an alternative to Johnson\u2019s deal is that it offends the bipartisan spirit of the Good Friday agreement and would encounter much resistance from unionists in the north. However, a different alternative is possible.</p> <p>If Johnson does not pivot towards a soft Brexit, he antagonises his fellow citizens in both Northern Ireland and Scotland. If directed positively this antagonism could fashion a different set of political arrangements on these islands.</p> <p>A newly independent Scotland remaining in the EU could enter into a new Good Friday-type arrangement with the Republic of Ireland, giving security to the unionist community. The EU could help foster these arrangements as part of its discussions about the new relationship with England and Wales.<br><strong>Dr Paul Lally</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole rightly says: \u201cJohnson has no real knowledge of or interest in the consequences of the withdrawal agreement \u2013 and of Brexit itself \u2013 for Northern Ireland.\u201d </p> <p>Maybe Boris Johnson will wake up when there are repercussions on the mainland. An unsettled Northern Ireland will almost certainly mean an unsettled Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and other places with large populations of Irish descent. The peace process led to peace on those cities\u2019 streets. But the current uncertainties have already led to some sectarian disturbances in Glasgow, which took the police by surprise.</p> <p>An ignorant Johnson will thoroughly deserve further sectarian marches and probably disturbances at football matches and around churches. But those of us whom he tried to mislead about the whole Irish implications of Brexit won\u2019t deserve it.

This Northern Ireland protocol doesn\u2019t stand a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of being implemented successfully in 2020 or 2021. Of course, if it is just a case of \u201cany deal will do\u201d to fool the electorate, as a segue to a 2020 no-deal, then the practicality wouldn\u2019t matter to the government. But in that case we are being played for fools by Boris Johnson. Again. Mike Cashman Author, Brexit\u2019s a Trick not a Treat and Brexit\u2019s a Musical Trick \u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is right to be concerned about the sense of abandonment faced by the unionist community in Northern Ireland. They have been badly served by the DUP and face a very uncertain future if Johnson\u2019s deal is implemented unamended. His deal runs the risk of crippling the Northern Irish economy and is unlikely to be tenable in the short to medium term. The trouble with offering a united Ireland as an alternative to Johnson\u2019s deal is that it offends the bipartisan spirit of the Good Friday agreement and would encounter much resistance from unionists in the north. However, a different alternative is possible. If Johnson does not pivot towards a soft Brexit, he antagonises his fellow citizens in both Northern Ireland and Scotland. If directed positively this antagonism could fashion a different set of political arrangements on these islands. A newly independent Scotland remaining in the EU could enter into a new Good Friday-type arrangement with the Republic of Ireland, giving security to the unionist community. The EU could help foster these arrangements as part of its discussions about the new relationship with England and Wales. Dr Paul Lally Liverpool \u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole rightly says: \u201cJohnson has no real knowledge of or interest in the consequences of the withdrawal agreement \u2013 and of Brexit itself \u2013 for Northern Ireland.\u201d Maybe Boris Johnson will wake up when there are repercussions on the mainland. An unsettled Northern Ireland will almost certainly mean an unsettled Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and other places with large populations of Irish descent. The peace process led to peace on those cities\u2019 streets. But the current uncertainties have already led to some sectarian disturbances in Glasgow, which took the police by surprise. An ignorant Johnson will thoroughly deserve further sectarian marches and probably disturbances at football matches and around churches. But those of us whom he tried to mislead about the whole Irish implications of Brexit won\u2019t deserve it. Nor will the people of Northern Ireland whom he tried to hoodwink or their kin in mainland Britain. Professor Emeritus Lalage Bown Shrewsbury, Shropshire \u2022 The prime minister\u2019s mendacity about Ireland, as discussed by Fintan O\u2019Toole, is compounded by the fact that over two-thirds (68%) of people in Northern Ireland voted for parties that wished to remain in the EU \u2013 an increase of 12% from the 2016 referendum.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s EU withdrawal agreement bill has been published, with protections on workers\u2019 rights, unaccompanied refugee children and parliament\u2019s say over the future relationship stripped out. MPs are expecting to vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill for the first time in this parliament on Friday, as Johnson aims to rush it through its first stage before Christmas. The new bill scraps or waters down a number of key protections that were in the last one published in October, when Johnson was trying to get the support of some backbench Labour MPs to get it through parliament. It removes an entire schedule that promised to protect workers\u2019 rights, with the government suggesting this will now be dealt with in separate legislation. Ministers will no longer be bound by the legislation to provide updates on the future trading relationship or to make sure parliament approves the government\u2019s negotiating objectives. In a third change, a commitment to take unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, known as the Dubs amendment, is watered down. The legislation acknowledges this is still an aim but does not make a legal promise to take them. A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that children who are claiming asylum or international protection will be reunited with specified family members in the EU and vice versa. \u201cThe government\u2019s policy on child refugees has not changed and we will continue to do all we can to enable children to claim asylum and be reunited with their families, which the legislation published today reaffirms.\u201d Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said the changes showed the Tories now want to \u201ctear up those protections\u201d for refugee children. In terms of additions, the bill introduces a clause to rule out an extension to the transitional period, and powers to let lower courts overrule judgments from the European court of justice. The bill overall hands much greater power to Johnson\u2019s government to shape a harder Brexit without the checks and balances of parliament. Backbench Labour MPs and some soft Brexit Tories had fought to get concessions into the previous versions of the bill, but Johnson no longer has any need for their votes as he has a majority of 80. Labour is expected to vote against the bill, along with the Lib Dems and the SNP. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, accused Johnson of having \u201cdeliberately resurrected the threat of no deal at the end of next year, which would decimate industry and destroy people\u2019s jobs\u201d. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader, said the bill would hurt Scotland\u2019s economy and cost thousands of jobs north of the border, taking a \u201cwrecking ball to our economic and social foundations\u201d.

It shifted from its origins as an anti-EU party, criticising instead the government\u2019s commitment to an open labour market and its embrace of EU free movement rules.

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has called for the Scottish parliament to be given permanent powers to hold subsequent referendums on independence from the UK. Describing the SNP\u2019s success in last week\u2019s general election as an \u201cunarguable mandate by any normal standard of democracy\u201d, Scotland\u2019s first minister confirmed on Thursday morning that she had formally written to Boris Johnson to request the powers to legally stage another referendum under section 30 of the 1998 Scotland Act. Alongside this, the SNP leader published a 38-page document that also sets out draft amendments to the statute, which would devolve the right to hold votes on leaving the UK to Holyrood. Insisting that she was not advocating for a third independence referendum \u2013 \u201cnot least because I think when Scotland gets the chance to vote again, it will vote for independence\u201d \u2013 she refused to rule one out for ever, underlining that no first minister could bind the hands of their successors over the right to self-determination. Entitled Scotland\u2019s Right to Choose, the publication argues that there has been a \u201cmaterial change of circumstance\u201d since the independence referendum of 2014, based on \u201cthe prospect of Scotland leaving the EU against its will and what EU exit has revealed about Scotland\u2019s position within the UK\u201d. Launching the document at an event at her official residence of Bute House in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said she \u201cfully expected to get a flat no\u201d from Westminster initially. \u201cI\u2019m going to stand my ground. I fully expect today we will get the flat no of Westminster opposition, but that will not be the end of the matter and Boris Johnson should not be under any illusion that it is.\u201d Johnson will use the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday to confirm that a second independence referendum next year would be a \u201cdamaging distraction\u201d, while setting out investment in the Scottish economy. Describing the Tory strategy as \u201cself-defeating\u201d, Sturgeon insisted that continued refusal to allow the Scottish people their right to choose would only boost support for independence. She added: \u201cI am not simply firing off a letter to Boris Johnson; I am publishing a detailed and considered case.\u201d She said that when she spoke to Johnson immediately after the election results, he had committed to engaging seriously with the proposals. Since securing 47 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Westminster seats with an increased vote share of 45% last Thursday, Sturgeon has described the general election as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and declared that the country could not be \u201cimprisoned in the UK against its will\u201d. But, despite Westminster\u2019s chaotic handling of Brexit and Johnson\u2019s unpopularity among Scottish voters, the expected long-term boost to support for independence has not materialised, with polls showing support averaging at around 48%. On Thursday afternoon, a separate bill setting out how referendums in Scotland will be run was voted through its final stage at Holyrood. But this framework bill does not set the date or the question on the ballot, which have to be specified in further primary legislation. Much of the afternoon\u2019s debate centred around whether a previous referendum question \u2013 such as the yes/no format of 2014, which critics argued favoured the affirmative side \u2013 has to be reassessed by the Electoral Commission if it is being asked again within two parliamentary terms. In the end, a compromise was reached, which allows MSPs to vote to consult the commission regardless of timing, but which could in reality be blocked by a pro-independence majority.
