Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that the people want to wait and see what deal Johnson brings back from Brussels. Other Labour MP\u2019s have echoed this view. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Benn bill, designed to outlaw a no deal Brexit, passed its second and third reading with ease in the Commons.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>The House of Lords</strong> is still voting on amendments to a business motion tabled by Labour that aims to get the Benn bill through all stages before parliament is prorogued. </li> \n   <li>About 10 of the Tory MPs who had their whip withdrawn after they rebelled against the government last night have threatened legal action and announced they plan to stand again for the Conservatives.</li> \n   <li>Three Conservative MPs have announced they are standing down at the next general election: the pro-Remain former defence secretary <strong>Michael Fallon</strong>, <strong>Caroline Spelman</strong>, who rebelled against the Tory whip tonight, and <strong>Nicholas Soames</strong>, who is standing down as an MP after 37 years \u2013 after he was expelled from the Conservative party for voting against the government.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This tweet from <strong>Jess Phillips</strong> will sum this day up for many MPs, reporters, pundits and onlookers:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessphillips/status/1169385467109941250\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just got home.

It is a shouting match all too frequently dominated by slogans, displays of machismo and cheap jokes. But even prime ministers who have been most comfortable in such a crude and brutal arena, such as David Cameron, have also acknowledged that they have been under some obligations to answer questions and address matters of policy and detail, and that while insults can get you through some of the time, they won\u2019t work on their own.</p> \n  <p>Today it feels as if PMQs has become even more diminished, because in his first appearance in this arena Johnson seems to show no interest whatsoever in addressing the issue at hand. He has probably set a new record for dodging questions - he did not even half-answer them, as Theresa May frequently did - and instead he seemed intend on using the entire session to road-test some election slogans - principally his claim that Corbyn is championing a \u201csurrender bill\u201d, and that he is scared of a general election.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was also even more dishonest then usual. Corbyn said that Michael Gove told Andrew Marr that food prices would go up in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Johnson claimed Gove said no such thing. But here is the quote. Asked if food prices would go up, Gove said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn focused on a no-deal Brexit, and the government\u2019s refusal to publish details of its Operation Yellowhammer assessment. He was dignified and forensic, and grown up in a way that put Johnson to shame. Although Tory MPs were cheering Johnson enthusiastically, they must have know then.</p> \n  <p>And yet, those Johnson slogans sounded not just rehearsed, but tested. Will they resonate with the public at large? Who knows, but it is not impossible.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6fa5ea8f08b2e15bc1a1a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-04T11:55:45.787Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The best questions are coming at the end. <strong>Margot James</strong>, a Conservative, has just asked about Dominic Cummings, telling Johnson that advisers should only advise.</p> \n  <p>And the Lib Dem leader <strong>Jo Swinson</strong> told Johnson his answer to Dhesi was a disgrace.

It knowingly alienates moderate Tory voters who have always quite liked, say, Ken Clarke, thereby writing off a string of seats \u2013 in the south and the West Country \u2013 that are likely to fall to the Liberal Democrats. It similarly dooms the Tories in Scotland. So Johnson will begin the next election campaign with that immediate handicap. The Cummings plan is to make up for those lost seats, and gain many more, by winning pro-leave seats in the Midlands and north of England, many of them Labour-held, chiefly by neutralising the Brexit party. Why vote for Nigel Farage when you can get a no-deal, full-monty Brexit with Johnson?</p> \n   <p>The trouble with that is, there are plenty of onetime Labour voters who were happy to vote leave in 2016, happy even to vote for Farage in May\u2019s European elections, who may nevertheless baulk at voting Tory.

A business motion is needed because in the Lords bills are not subject to programme motions, meaning in theory debates can go on forever. The Lib Dems support the business motion and so, given that the Tories do not have a majority, it should pass.</p> \n  <p>But before peers get to vote on it they will have to debate the amendments to the business motion.

In the Lords every amendment normally gets debated, and peers are normally free to speak for as long as they want, making it filibustering heaven.

From within No 10 Dominic Cummings threatens to end the career of elected MPs. And David Gauke, the Conservative MP who just six weeks ago was secretary of state for justice, wrote to his former government colleagues on Monday to ask them to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/man-who-justice-secretary-6-19164330\">obey the rule of law</a>.</p> \n   <p>Just because the paradoxes are so glaring makes them no less dangerous.

If you need a gentle reminder I\u2019ve written a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/whips-and-votes-and-early-polls-what-is-going-on-in-uk-politics\">short explainer</a> of what happened yesterday, addressing questions like:</p> \n  <h2>What just happened?</h2> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has just lost a very significant vote in parliament, which has allowed MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. It paves the way to introduce a bill that is designed to block a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> by forcing the prime minister to request an extension if he cannot strike a reworked divorce agreement with the rest of the EU.</p> \n  <p>Johnson threatened his MPs ahead of Tuesday that they should vote with him or face the penalty of having the \u201cwhip\u201d withdrawn. Despite this threat, Johnson lost the vote. The rebel MPs and opposition parties won by 328 to 301.</p> \n  <h2>What does it mean to \u2018withdraw the whip\u2019?</h2> \n  <p>An arcane and slightly disturbing expression, in political-speak \u201cwithdrawing the whip\u201d from someone effectively means booting them out of the party, without them immediately losing their seat.</p> \n  <p>An MP who has the whip withdrawn sits as an independent, but can be brought back into the party fold if it decides to restore the whip. Having the whip withdrawn is one of the most serious disciplinary actions that can be taken against an MP by a party. In this case it may mean they are barred from standing for the Tories in the next election.</p> \n  <h2>What happens next?</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> has announced he will ask parliament to allow a snap general election, which would be held on 15 October.

      "bodyText": "I will be wrapping up now, as most commentators and MP\u2019s have retreated to their boudoirs it seems, in preparation for tomorrow\u2019s Brexit questions in the Commons, kicking off at 09.30am. Here a short summary of what happened tonight: Boris Johnson has lost another big Commons vote as MPs blocked his bid to trigger a general election. It is not clear yet under what circumstances and at what time Labour will back a general election. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that the people want to wait and see what deal Johnson brings back from Brussels. Other Labour MP\u2019s have echoed this view. The Benn bill, designed to outlaw a no deal Brexit, passed its second and third reading with ease in the Commons. The House of Lords is still voting on amendments to a business motion tabled by Labour that aims to get the Benn bill through all stages before parliament is prorogued. About 10 of the Tory MPs who had their whip withdrawn after they rebelled against the government last night have threatened legal action and announced they plan to stand again for the Conservatives. Three Conservative MPs have announced they are standing down at the next general election: the pro-Remain former defence secretary Michael Fallon, Caroline Spelman, who rebelled against the Tory whip tonight, and Nicholas Soames, who is standing down as an MP after 37 years \u2013 after he was expelled from the Conservative party for voting against the government. This tweet from Jess Phillips will sum this day up for many MPs, reporters, pundits and onlookers: And on this note, goodnight. This from the Birmingham Post\u2019s Jonathan Walker: This from ITV\u2019s Alastair Stewart: And here my colleagues Heather Stewart, Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker have written up what went down in the Commons tonight. By the way, here is a handy overview of how each MP voted tonight: The House of Lords is still bogged down in voting on amendments. This from the LibDem peer Paul Strasburger: And this from parliamentary researcher Robbie Lammas: Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is said to have advised European diplomats that the negotiations with the British government are in a state of paralysis - in stark contrast to claims by the PM and his circle that progress is being made. He also said that Britain seemed intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will frame the next stage of the negotiations. According to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler, the statement was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson \u201ccannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric\u201d. The Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Sir Michael Fallon, who supported Remain in the referendum, has announced a little while ago that he is standing down as a Tory MP at the next general election, after 31 years or service. Fallon was forced to resign as defence secretary in 2017 after a series of sexual harassment allegations. In a letter, he thanked his Sevenoaks constituents and said he and his wife would continue to live locally. Salma Shah, a former adviser to Sajid Javid, tells Peston that she believes it\u2019s still possible that it all works out for the PM in the end, and that he is trying to unite the leave votes with his current course. Grieve says May lost an opportunity in January to put her rejected Brexit deal to the people in a referendum. He says he\u2019s getting \u201cirritated\u201d by politicians who only aim to further their own career interests. McDonnell\u2019s comments about the timing of a general election are at odds with those of Jeremy Corbyn. This from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: This, however, from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, makes it look as if Corbyn is aligned with his McDonnell: McDonnell tells Peston now that Labour wants the electorate to have a \u201cproper choice\u201d when they go to the polls, and says this would be the case after the PM has met with the EU council and has come back with a deal or nothing. He says the problem is that the Fixed Parliament Act does not provide an option for MPs to set a binding date for a general election, but that that\u2019s precisely what parliament is now trying to achieve. \u201cWe will offer the people the final say,\u201d he says. Lots of MP\u2019s are insisting that Boris Johnson cannot be trusted tonight. Here Labour MP Lisa Nandy on BBC Newsnight. \u201cIf I\u2019ve learnt one thing about Boris Johnson over the last few months, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t trust a word he says.\u201d Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is now on Peston. He says once there is legislative security around no deal being outlawed, Labour will look at a date for a general election. He says party members are being consulted on the best time for a general election. He says he \u201cdesperately\u201d wants one, but that the PM can\u2019t be trusted. He says that he believes a deal can still be done. This from ITV\u2019s Joe Pike: Is Boris Johnson confident that he\u2019ll get his general election before the EU council meeting? Is he going to be \u201ca permanent lame duck?\u201d, asks Peston. \u201cI think the position by the Labour party, to be so consumed by cowardice as to resist a general election, is not politically sustainable,\u201d the PM responds. The PM told Peston earlier that \u201cit\u2019s been a very good day\u201d, before starting to list several areas his government is intending to invest in, such as schools, police and social care. He said tonight\u2019s events effectively wrote the letter to the EU asking for another extension for him. Like earlier in the Commons, he uses the word \u201csad\u201d again to describe the situation. Peston asks if he really will expel Tory MPs who might vote against his deal with Brussels, like the PM said he would yesterday. Johnson repeats his \u201cwhat\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\u201d line, but is otherwise pretty evasive. Peston has just started, where Jess Phillips and Dominic Grieve currently discuss the punishment of the 21 Tory rebels who defied the government whip yesterday. Grieve, introduced to the audience as a \u201cFormer Conservative\u201d tonight, says it\u2019ll depend on when the next election is and on the circumstances whether he will run or not. Phillips repeats she wouldn\u2019t trust Johnson on anything, and that she believes he will try and force no deal. This from Metro\u2019s Joel Taylor: Anna Soubry is one of many MPs that are outraged by the treatment of the Conservative rebels. This from David Gauke, one of the Tory MP\u2019s who rebelled against the government and had their whip withdrawn yesterday. This from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: Allister Heath, the editor of the Sunday Telegraph, also believes Boris Johnson will eventually get his way. He writes (paywalled): The Tory party is dead; long live the Tory party. The seismic realignment that was supposed to take place in 2016 is finally upon us, and a tougher, rougher, non-deferential conservatism is making its explosive debut. [...] Right now, Johnson and Cummings are still on a path to success, even if they have had to recalibrate their journey several times as obstacles have emerged. The situation is tense, the PM is feeling the pressure and much of the Cabinet is in a state of shock. But Boris hasn\u2019t been \u201chumiliated\u201d. He hasn\u2019t been \u201cwrong-footed\u201d. The semi-prorogation didn\u2019t \u201cbackfire\u201d: it flushed out his hardcore opponents and allowed him to expel them. He knew he would have to do something drastic at some stage and there was no way that those committed to derailing his plans would ever have been allowed to stand under Tory colours at the election. His party was already split de facto, if not de jure; he was always leading a minority government in all but name. The sackings merely formalised this. [...] Last but not least, engineering a delay in Brexit would simply encourage the Government to go for broke. If they were to back a no-deal Brexit, Nigel Farage would step aside and the Leave vote would unite. I am sure those in No 10 genuinely and rightly want a deal. But they may not have a choice if furious voters begin to turn to the Brexit Party again. Do the Remainers really want to goad Downing Street in this way? Johnson\u2019s gamble was breathtaking in its ambition: he would take over a fatally divided Tory party with no majority, forcibly reform it in his image and gain a pro-Brexit majority. For all of the madness of the past few days, I\u2019m still predicting that he will pull it off. There is still some confusion about what happened earlier in the Commons when the Kinnock amendment was passed automatically because the government didn\u2019t provide any tellers, and about the potential consequences. This from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham: And this from the editor of Politics.co.uk, Ian Dunt: There seems to be a rift in the Labour party regarding when it will vote for a general election. This from Kevin Schofield from PoliticsHome.com: Peers in the House of Lords meanwhile are still voting on amendments to the Labour business motion that is designed to ensure the no-deal Benn bill will get through the House by 5pm on Friday, just in time before parliament is to be suspended. They have to vote on over 100 amendments. Earlier there were rumours that the peers were adjourning, but they\u2019ve carried on. As my colleague Andrew Sparrow explained earlier today, Tory peers have the opportunity to filibuster the process, as this kind of debate can in theory go on for as long as it wants to. This from Conservative peer Ralph Lucas earlier: I\u2019ll be rounding up a few reactions to tonight\u2019s events now. This here from the FT\u2019s editor Lionel Barber: The Commons has now moved on to a debate on Treasury funding for the Department of Health and Social Care. The prime minister along with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, Jess Phillips and Dominic Grieve will be on Peston in a bit. Should be fun. Boris Johnson responded by saying that 48 hours ago, Corbyn wanted to \u201cstop the coup\u201d and let the people vote. \u201cNow he is saying \u2018stop the election and stop the people from voting\u2019. \u201cI think he has become the first leader of the opposition in the democratic history of our country to refuse the invitation to an election. I can only speculate as to the reasons behind his hesitation. The obvious conclusion I\u2019m afraid is he does not think he will win,\u201d Johnson said. As expected, Boris Johnson has suffered another big loss, with the Commons rejecting his motion calling for a general election. The PM would have needed 434 votes to reach a two-thirds majority. Ayes: 298 Noes: 56 MPs are now voting on the government\u2019s motion calling to hold a general election. This from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll: Michel Barnier cancelled a planned engagement in Belfast on Monday telling organisers at Queen\u2019s University that his speech could be \u201cused by some to undermine the chances of an orderly Brexit\u201d. It is understood he agreed to deliver the Bill Clinton Leadership Lecture some time ago but decided the timing was no longer appropriate when \u201cthe UK is engaged in an intense political debate\u201d about its future. \u201cIn many respects, we have finally arrived at a moment of truth for the country. It is my judgment that pronouncing myself publicly in the midst of the debate that is ongoing in Westminster would not be appropriate,\u201d he wrote. He said he had wanted to deliver a speech showing \u201cfull respect\u201d for the sovereignty of the UK and the EU and UK\u2019s \u201ccommon goal\u201d to achieve an orderly Brexit for Northern Ireland in particular. Labour\u2019s Lloyd Russell-Moyle is having a rant. \u201cWhat the PM has offered us is really a poisoned chalice,\u201d he says. He says that Johnson is a man who has been sacked twice for lying. \u201cHe clearly is a person we cannot trust,\u201d he says. The Tory MP John Baron says: \u201cIf you\u2019re not prepared to walk away, it makes for a worse deal.\u201d He says there are too many MPs who are trying desperately to derail Brexit and points out that Labour promised originally to deliver Brexit. Too many members of the Commons are secretly remain MPs and have kicked the can down the road too often, and should own up to the fact that what they really want to do is stop Brexit, he says. Labour\u2019s Sandy Martin is up next. \u201cI am absolutely desperate for a general election,\u201d he says. But, he says, the PM is calling for a general election in order to be in sole control, when parliament is prorogued, when Britain leaves the EU. He says revoking article 50 would be \u201centirely wrong\u201d. \u201cI want to see a viable deal that would not destroy the economy of this country being agreed by this parliament.\u201d He adds that he wants this deal to be put to the people again in a people\u2019s vote. Labour\u2019s Thelma Walker says the PM once said the chambers \u201cwere just theatre\u201d and that the real business was going on in meetings. This stayed with her, she says. She says she wants a general election to get a government acting with honour and integrity, but only if there is no chance of a no-deal Brexit. She says Brexit has made Britain \u201cthe laughing stock of the world\u201d. \u201cOur country deserves much better,\u201d she adds. Jenkin says there is fear in the Commons about the consequences of a general election. He predicts the rise of \u201cfar more extremist parties\u201d if the House continues putting off making a decision. Jenkin asks what will happen after another extension has been granted. \u201cThere\u2019s a definition of madness: to repeat the same decision again and again and expect a different outcome,\u201d he says. He says getting on with Brexit requires respecting the decision of the people who voted to leave. The Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin is speaking and describes the paralysis of this \u201czombie parliament\u201d. He says the legitimacy of this House is in danger if the referendum is not honoured. \u201cWhat is going to be gained in putting off the decision again?\u201d he asks. Caroline Lucas is not holding back. She calls the dissolution of parliament \u201ca desperate and utterly cynical move\u201d. She is delighted that the PM needs to \u201ctry and own his own horrendous mess\u201d. She says it is vital that no election happens before there is an extension of article 50. She remarks on the fact that Boris Johnson has left the chambers: \u201cHe can\u2019t even be bothered to listen to the debate on his own motion on something as important as a general election.\u201d Nigel Evans is speaking again and says Labour campaigned on a similar platform as the Tories are now and promised to honour the referendum result. Labour MP Clive Efford says the Benn bill does \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d unless the PM fails to come back from Brussels with a new deal. If he comes back with a deal MPs will vote on it on 19 October, and if it passes, Britain will leave the EU with that deal. If it doesn\u2019t pass, the House will vote on no deal, and only if that\u2019s rejected will MP\u2019s go for another extension. Philips says she doesn\u2019t believe we should have a general election, that parliament should not go on conference recess and that that it should not be prorogued. She says she\u2019ll vote against an election until the end of October. Labour MP Jess Phillips is now speaking. \u201cI have no faith in anything the PM says, in nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe PM is playing some bully-boy game, that I\u2019m probably not able to understand more than parliamentary procedures,\u201d she says. She says the PM could bring his plans to parliament, that some of her colleagues were \u201cbegging him\u201d to reveal details of his negotiation progress. She says her constituents won\u2019t be collateral in the games Boris Johnson is playing to realise his personal ambitions. \u201cThere are thousands of EU migrants in my constituency and they have absolutely no idea what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she adds. Ian Duncan Smith is now speaking. He says Labour and the SNP called for an election just days earlier but now block it. He says the problem with a people\u2019s vote is that the result would not be accepted if people voted to leave again, as the matter would go back to parliament and nothing would get decided again. He calls for people to instead be asked in a general election. \u201cI have never seen a moment when an opposition party does not want to take over ... Put up, or shut up,\u201d he says, to cheers. Soubry says the Benn bill has been carefully drafted in the best interests of the country and is not about stopping Brexit, just about stopping no deal. She calls for a people\u2019s vote. \u201cI think the British people have now changed their minds.\u201d Anna Soubry is now speaking. She says the PM has chosen repeatedly to use the word \u201cfrit\u201d and \u201cfrightened\u201d to describe MPs, when really it took a lot of courage to make their decisions, with some choosing to end their parliamentary career in order to protect their constituents. She says that people in the UK are sick \u201cto their back teeth\u201d of Brexit and the matter must be brought to a conclusion. LibDem leader Jo Swinson says MPs should put party interest aside and focus on national interest. She says the way Tory rebels have been treated is \u201cshameful\u201d. Asked whether the Lib Dems would pledge to revoke article 50 at a general election, she says her party has been \u201ccrystal clear\u201d on wanting to stop Brexit. She says the PM had wanted the job so long \u201cit has been almost painful to watch\u201d, and that he said Britain would get a great deal. \u201cNow he has the job, go and get that deal\u201d, she says. She adds that she doesn\u2019t believe there is a majority in Britain for a specific kind of deal, perhaps not even in the Conservative party, and any election should happen in a \u201ccalm and orderly way\u201d, not under the imminent threat of a no-deal exit. Conservative MP Nigel Evans accuses Labour of \u201crunning scared\u2019 of a general election after having spent two years asking for one. His colleague Craig Mackinlay says many Labour MPs seem to crave EU vassalage and that voters have waited long enough. Says this parliament serves no further purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a general election,\u201d he says. Blackford says the SNP does not trust the prime minister because of his \u201ccontempt for democracy\u201d. \u201cHe has treated this House and the country with contempt.\u201d He then calls the government \u201cshambolic and irresponsible\u201d. Blackford says nobody voted for a no-deal Brexit as it was not on the ballot paper, and challenges the Tories to \u201cshout us down, as you tried last night\u201d. The PM should quit the stunts, he says. The SNP is \u201cready to bring down the Tory government\u201d to give Scotland a chance, and ready to work across the house in order to determine their own future. \u201cIt should be Scotland\u2019s right to decide its own future.\u201d Ian Blackford has just called on the PM to sack Dominic Cummings and to bring Ken Clarke in instead. He says the Benn bill is designed to remove the cliff edge. \u201cIt is the SNP\u2019s top priority to avoid no deal,\u201d he says. Ken Clarke, who lost the Conservative party whip last night, is now speaking and is calling for \u201cmore time\u201d to find a solution with the EU. He says it may be desperate to find a deal, but not desperate enough to wreck the customs union and to mess up the situation in Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn has responded to the prime minister. Theresa May, he said, at least made detailed speeches. \u201cThis PM claims he has a strategy, but can\u2019t tell us what it is ... and he can\u2019t tell the EU either. There really is absolutely nothing there.\u201d Corbyn says PM knows there is no mandate for no deal. He says parliament must decide whether to throw this government out. \u201cIf he has a Brexit plan, he should put it before the public in either a referendum or a general election.\u201d Evening everyone. Boris Johnson is now speaking. So far, much of it sounds almost identical to his speech earlier in the Commons. He says the Benn bill is essentially one that ends the negotiations, \u201chands control to our partners.\u201c There\u2019s only one way forward and the house has repeatedly voted to leave the EU, he says. \u201cToday [parliament] has voted to stop, to scupper any serious negotiations,\u201d he says. He adds that the purpose of the Benn bill is to take away the right of the UK to determine how long it wants to stay in the EU and to hand it to the EU. He says the country must now decide whether it is him or the leader of the opposition who goes to Brussels. \u201cUnder any circumstances this country will leave the EU on 31 October\u201d, he says. He calls again for an election on 15 October. \u201cI think it\u2019s very sad that MP\u2019s have voted like this. I think it\u2019s a great dereliction of their duty.\u201d MPs have given the Benn bill its third reading by 327 votes to 299 - a majority of 28. At second reading the majority in favour was 29. That is all from me for tonight. I am now handing over to my colleague Jedidajah Otte who will cover the debate on an early election. This is from Graeme Cowie, a Commons clerk, on the Kinnock amendment. Here is Labour\u2019s Alex Sobel on the Kinnock amendment division - or non-division. This is from the Labour MP Sarah Champion, who is one of the MPs who signed the Kinnock amendment that has been passed. MPs are now voting to give the bill its third reading. From Labour\u2019s Jim McMahon Here is some comment from journalists on what has just happened. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssbeg From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar MPs started voting on Stephen Kinnock\u2019s amendment 6. But then, a few minutes into voting, Lindsay Hoyle, announced that the division had been called off because the amendment had been passed - because MPs opposed to it did not put up tellers. Here is the explanation of what the Kinnock amendment does. This amendment would set out as the purpose of seeking an extension under article 50(3) TEU the passage of a withdrawal agreement bill based on the outcome of the inter-party talks which concluded in May 2019 \u2013 see NC1 for contents of the Bill and Amendment XX for text of the request letter to the European Council. This means that, if the PM needs to request an article 50 extension (because he has not negotiated a new deal, and MPs have not voted to approve a no-deal Brexit), then getting an extension to pass a version of the Theresa May deal becomes government policy. Effectively, that means that any Brexit delay would not be a blind delay; it would be a delay to enable a version of the Theresa May going through. It is not clear whether this has passed by accident - or as a result of some cunning plot. The Richard Graham amendment (see 7.10pm) was defeated by 495 votes to 65 - a majority of 430. According to the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, there are rumours there could be 10 votes on amendments. MPs are now voting on amendments to the Benn bill, which is designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. We don\u2019t know yet how many amendments will be put to a vote. Each vote takes about 15 minutes. But it may well be that all amendments get voted down. After that there will be a vote on the third reading of the bill. The result of this is set to be identical, or almost identical, to the vote at second reading - which was the important vote on principle. The opposition and Tory rebels won the comfortably. (See 5.22pm.) After the third reading the bill will be ready to go to the Lords. And then MPs will have a 90-minute debate on Boris Johnson\u2019s motion saying there should be an early election. It may be a lively debate - Johnson is opening for the government - but the opposition will not back the motion, and so Johnson will not get the two-thirds majority he needs under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for an early election to actually go ahead. MPs are now voting on the first amendment - amendment 19. The full list of amendments is here (pdf). And the full text of the bill is here (pdf). Amendment 19 has been tabled by the Tory Richard Graham. It is an amendment that is designed to ensure that parliament would get the chance to debate whether it wanted the existing deal after the EU council in October. Explaining it, Graham told MPs: There are many of us in this house on all sides who do not want no-deal and yet ... many colleagues have not supported a deal and therefore my simple amendment to the bill today proposes that the amendment requires the government to have a vote on Monday 21st October, the first sitting day after the EU council on a deal - whether it be a new deal or the previous deal and that should that vote be successful and be approved by members of this house, then the government would be required, if they needed more time, to ask for an extension from the EU purely in order to get the legislation through parliament. It gives us all one last chance to vote for a deal if we do not want no-deal. Barclay says the EU says it is ready for a no-deal Brexit. But he says there is a difference between having the right regulations in place (where he implies EU preparations are satisfactory) and operational readiness, which he says varies from state to state. Caroline Flint, a Labour MP backing the Kinnock amendments, tells Barclay in an intervention that many of her colleagues now regret not voting for a Brexit deal. She says she would like both front benches to get this message. Now is the time to move on, she says. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is now winding up for the government. He says the government opposes the bill. He says it is \u201cso flawed\u201d that the government has not even proposed amendments to it. Referring to the Kinnock amendments, Barclay complains that Kinnock voted against the Brexit deal all three times. In the debate Paul Blomfield, the shadow Brexit minister, is winding up for Labour now. He says he has some sympathy for the Kinnock amendment, but he argues that it is flawed because, he says, the cross-party talks did not actually reach an agreement on a revised withdrawal agreement text. The debate on the 29 amendments tabled to the Benn bill has not been especially illuminating. The most interesting ones are those tabled by Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock and other, mostly Labour, MPs designed to allow MPs to vote for a version of Theresa May\u2019s deal, incorporating the changes proposed during the cross-party talks. Proposing his amendments, Kinnock said: It is a travesty that parliament did not get to vote on the withdrawal agreement bill as it was very different to the former prime minister\u2019s blind Brexit and provided far more clarity on EU and UK relations. Here are some lines about what Boris Johnson told the Conservative 1922 Committee this afternoon. From Sky News From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth Dame Caroline Spelman will not lose the Tory whip for voting against the government tonight, the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner reports. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, admitted on Sky News that Labour has not got a settled view on exactly when it wants an early election to be held. She said: We want the general election after we\u2019ve sorted out the no deal \u2026 I can\u2019t help you with exactly what date it\u2019s going to be. Or when it is that we\u2019re going to put it down. Whether it\u2019s going to be the mechanism which is two-thirds [of MPs voting for an election] or whether we\u2019re going to go for [a confidence vote] later on - I\u2019m not sure at the moment because we\u2019re making decisions on an hourly basis. Thornberry also said her preference would be to wait for a few weeks. I personally think that we need to have a general election when we\u2019re going to win it. I\u2019ll wait a couple of weeks. If we can give them a little bit of extra rope \u2013 just let them be in power for a few more weeks, then people can really see how bad they are. My colleague Peter Walker has been covering the Young Conservatives for a People\u2019s Vote protest outside Conservative Campaign Headquarters this afternoon about the effective deselection of pro-European Tories. He has found out that the group does exist. Donald Trump has been speaking about Boris Johnson. Asked by reporters what he thought about developments in the UK, and the Commons defeat Johnson suffered last night, Trump replied: He\u2019s a friend of mine, and he\u2019s going at it, there\u2019s no question about it \u2026 Boris knows how to win. Don\u2019t worry about him. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s video tweet of Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi urging Boris Johnson at PMQs to apologise for his comment about Muslim women has been retweeted by the American congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Omar herself has been the subject of racist abuse from Donald Trump. Voting on the Benn bill was much the same as voting on the SO24 motion yesterday, but there have been some minor changes. New Tory rebel Dame Caroline Spelman has joined the Tory rebels. Yesterday she voted against the SO24 motion, but today she voted for the Benn bill. Non-voting rebel But there were 21 Tory rebels in the vote at 5pm, the same number as last night. That\u2019s because Caroline Nokes, who rebelled last night, did not vote this afternoon. It is not clear why. Independents joining the rebels Two independents who did not vote yesterday, Kelvin Hopkins and John Woodcock, both voted with the opposition and Tory rebels today. Extra non-voting Labour MP Yesterday, two Labour MPs did not vote: Sir Kevin Barron and Derek Twigg. Today, a third Labour MP, Ronnie Campbell, did not vote. Yesterday, Campbell voted with the Labour whip for the SO24 motion. The division lists for the second reading vote on the Benn bill are here. Boris Johnson is addressing the Conservative 1922 Committee, according to the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. Dame Caroline Spelman, the former environment secretary, was the new Tory rebel, the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn reports. The amendments are available on the Commons website here (pdf). I will highlight some of the main ones soon. MPs are now debating amendments to the bill. Sir Mike Penning, a Tory Brexiter, has just complained that printed copies of the amendments are not available yet in the vote office. Lindsay Hoyle, the deputy speaker, says they will appear soon, and well before voting at 7pm. MPs have voted to give the bill to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October a second reading by 329 votes to 300 \u2013 a majority of 29. That majority is two bigger than last night (when the SO24 motion was passed by 328 votes to 301). This is from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie. This is what Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff, said about a second referendum in an Economist interview in January 2016 (before the referendum on leaving the EU). At the time, Cummings was campaign director for Vote Leave. Asked if he thought the government would hold a second referendum, on the terms of Brexit, in the event of a vote to leave, Cummings replied. I think that is a distinct possibility, yes. It\u2019s obviously not something that we can force. We\u2019re a campaign group. But I think it is perfectly possible that leadership candidates to replace David Cameron will say that they think there are good grounds for a new government team to offer the public a voice on what the deal looks like. And we obviously wouldn\u2019t oppose that, if that\u2019s what senior politicians want to offer. I think there\u2019s a strong democratic case for it. There\u2019s also the issue of the profound loss of trust that the establishment has suffered over the past 20-30 years. All parties have told lies about this subject, whether it\u2019s John Major and David Cameron or Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and Nick Clegg. People have repeatedly promised referendums then not held referendums. So given that, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if leadership candidates to replace Cameron said: we need a mechanism so people can have confidence in what we say. MPs are now voting on the Benn bill. The result will be announced in about 15 minutes. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is winding up the second reading debate on the Benn bill for the government. He claims the bill would undermine the government\u2019s negotiation with the EU. And he insists progress is being made. Originally the EU said the withdrawal agreement could not be rewritten, he says. But now they are saying they are open to effective alternatives to the backstop. Margot James, who was a Conservative MP until she lost the whip last night after voting against the government, has added her voice to those criticising Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s de facto chief of staff. (See 3.17pm.) At PMQs she asked Boris Johnson about him, saying he should remember Margaret Thatcher\u2019s words: \u201cAdvisers advise, ministers decide.\u201d After PMQs she told PA Media she had received \u201ca lot of very supportive texts from people in No 10\u201d after asking her question. She continued: The levels of comments stretches far and wide and it\u2019s high time [Cumming\u2019s] wings were clipped. Asked what she thought of Cummings, James said: Very dangerous, very dangerous indeed. He is ruthless, he couldn\u2019t care less whether we got a deal or whether we didn\u2019t and he rules with a rod of iron. I don\u2019t approve of the way he treats people, apropos that poor special adviser who did nothing wrong whatsoever. I mean, I could go on but you know my opinion of the man. Boris Johnson will open the debate holding an early election in the Commons this evening, Downing Street said. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The prime minister, while not wanting an election, believes that if his negotiating position has been destroyed then that should be tested at an election and the public should be able to decide on the next steps forward. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said Labour and other opposition parties have yet to decide when they might support Boris Johnson\u2019s call for an election, saying this would only happen when they were certain that no-deal Brexit on 31 October had been blocked. The parties were taking legal advice, and would decide day by day, he told reporters, saying it meant Labour could still back an election on Johnson\u2019s preferred date of 15 October, once a backbench bill seeking to block no deal had become law, but also possibly not till the Brexit date had been delayed. The key, McDonnell said, was that they could not trust Johnson, calling him \u201cbeyond all the norms of political and constitutional practice in this country\u201d. He said: We want to get the legislation secure, with royal assent, but we\u2019re also not going to be tricked or conned, so we\u2019re looking at every way in which, having secured the legislation, that he can\u2019t wriggle out of abusing by the law. At the moment there\u2019s nothing that Johnson has done in recent weeks that gives us the confidence that he\u2019s going to abide by the law. McDonnell\u2019s stance seems closer to that advocated by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team. Starmer was due to meet other opposition parties on Thursday morning, McDonnell said, saying the SNP\u2019s stated preference for an earlier election was \u201cnot a settled position by any means\u201d among other parties. He said: We haven\u2019t got a preference. Our preference is to stop a no-deal Brexit. So any mechanism that\u2019s available to us, we\u2019re exploring. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall Here is an extract from Sir Nicholas Soames\u2019 speech. I want to support this bill. But before I do so, I want to make clear that I have always believed that the referendum result must be honoured. And indeed I voted for the withdrawal agreement on every occasion it has been presented to the house, which is more than can be said for the prime minister, the leader of the house and other members of the cabinet whose serial disloyalty has been such an inspiration to so many of us. I think history will in due course favour the view articulated so clearly last night by [Sir Oliver Letwin] that a threat to commit an act of self harm if your counterparts in a negotiation do not do exactly as you wish is not exactly likely to be an effective or successful negotiating strategy ... I am not standing at the next election. And I am thus approaching the end of 37 years\u2019 service to this house which I have been proud and honoured beyond words to be a member of. I\u2019m truly very sad that it should end in this way and it is my most fervent hope that this house will rediscover the spirit of compromise, humility and understanding that will enable us finally to push ahead with the vital work in the interests of the whole country that has inevitably had to be so sadly neglected whilst we have devoted so much time to wrestling with Brexit. UPDATE: Here is video. In the parliamentary estate the division bells have just sounded, signalling that there is a vote in the House of Lords. It is on a closure motion, designed to terminate the debate on an amendment tabled by the Tory Brexiter Lord Forsyth. As explained earlier (see 11.15am), this will be the first of what could theoretically be more than 100 votes as pro-Brexit peers to to filibuster a business motion intended to help the Benn bill become law. Sir Nicholas Soames has just finished an emotional, and at times very funny, speech in the debate. At one point he seemed close to tears as he was talking about how his long career in parliament has ended (with the removal of the whip last night). I will post the quotes in a moment. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw has welcomed Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s declaration that Labour will not back an early election until the provisions of the Benn bill have been implemented. (See 4.08pm.) Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle asks Starmer if he agrees that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to label this bill with the hashtag #surrenderbill is \u201cbeneath contempt\u201d. Starmer agrees that this label is \u201cbeneath contempt\u201d. He says the concerns about a no-deal Brexit are real. Businesses know that, he says. (This morning we learnt that the business minister Kwarsi Kwarteng also has reservations about this language. See 7.51am.) Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking now. He says Boris Johnson is wrong to claim that he is getting closer to a deal. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw asks for an assurance that Labour will not vote for a general election, not just until the Benn bill has been passed, but until it has taken effect. Starmer says Labour will not be voting for an early election tonight. He says the party will wait for the \u201cpassing and implementation\u201d of the bill. The use of the word \u201cimplementation\u201d is significant. It goes further than what an official party spokesman was saying earlier (see 2.48pm), and it clearly implies delaying an election until November - see 2.35pm - (although conceivably one might argue that \u201cimplementation\u201d just means getting royal assent.) Hammond also questions the claim that backing this bill will put Jeremy Corbyn in power. He says: \u201cI would sooner boil my head than hand power to [Corbyn].\u201d He says it is Johnson\u2019s strategy that is damaging the chances of a deal. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor who lost the Tory whip last night, is speaking now. He says MPs need to legislate now because campaigners may need to go to court to get the government to comply with this. He says he wants to address two claims about the bill. Boris Johnson says this bill will cut the legs from under his negotiation. But that is wrong - because no negotiation is taking place, he says. He says that has been made clear from the EU side and the UK side. And he says this displays a misunderstanding of EU politics. EU leaders are used to making deals, because more of them work in PR systems where coalition politics is the norm. Hammond says what is undermining Johnson\u2019s position is his refusal to set a realistic negotiation objective. He says by demanding the total removal of the backstop Johnson is asking for too much. Jane Dodds, the new Lib Dem MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, delivered her maiden speech in the debate, saying she was proud to use her first vote in the Commons last night to allow this debate to go ahead. Alistair Burt, the former Tory Foreign office minister, was the second speaker in the debate. He is a joint sponsor of the bill. He started by saying that, to his surprise, he was speaking as an independent today, having had the whip withdrawn last night after he voted against the government. He said he was firmly against a no-deal Brexit. As a Scot, he said he was appalled by polling evidence showing that Conservatives would rather go ahead with Brexit, even if it resulted in Scottish independence. And he said he was worried about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland. Within the EU, Ireland and Britain became best friends, despite their troubled past. But now Brexit is hurting that relationship, he said. He said when he first became an MP there were \u201cgiants\u201d like Denis Healey and Willie Whitelaw in the Commons. They had served in the war, and they were committed to the cause of Europe because they had seen their friends die. And he said he was worried about what was happening to the Conservative party. In the last week, it has lost Ruth Davidson as Scottish leader, George Young, who resigned as a government whip in the Lords, and Philip Hammond, who had the whip removed last night. What are people going to think about what we have left and what we have lost. Benn ended his speech by saying a no-deal Brexit would not resolve the crisis. At the point the UK would still have to decide what relationship it wanted with the EU, he said. Back in the debate Hilary Benn is explaining what his bill would do. He says the 19 October 2019 deadline is deliberate. It is the day after the October EU summit. So it allows time for the PM to negotiate a deal at that summit, but it means that if no deal has been agreed at that summit, the PM either has to get MPs to approve no deal or request an article 50 extension. He says there have been claims that the bill would allow the EU to determine what Brexit the UK must accept. But that is not correct, he says. He says if the EU were to offer an extension other than one until 31 January 2020 (the extension proposed in the bill), the PM could decide whether or not to accept. Benn is referring to this subsection of the bill. This tweet is misleading because it ignores subsection 3(3), which says the PM does not have to accept the new extension proposed by the EU if MPs have voted to reject it. The Commons library briefing has a fuller explanation. Turning back to the issue of Labour\u2019s position on an early election (see 2.48pm), my colleague Peter Walker says John McDonnell has been setting out his views in a briefing for journalists. A Tory puts it to Benn that all his bill does is actually delay the moment at which the UK has to decide what to do about Brexit. Benn concedes there is some truth in this, but says if you are offered a choice between jumping off a cliff, and waiting for three months before jumping off a cliff, it makes sense to wait. There is a short summary of what the Benn bill says here. And here is a Commons library briefing explaining the bill in more detail. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, is not making the opening speech in the second reading debate on the bill bearing his name. For the next four hours Benn is effectively in charge of the Commons order paper, as a result of the SO24 motion passed last night. The bill, European Union (withdrawal) (No 6) bill, is not on the parliamentary website yet. But Benn posted a copy of the text on Twitter on Monday. The veteran Conservative MP Roger Gale said the strategy pursued by Boris Johnson and his advisor Dominic Cummings \u201cis in danger of tearing the party apart\u201d and said the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives may have to act. \u201cI think to have an unelected, foul-mouthed oaf at the heart of Downing Street is dangerous and unacceptable,\u201d he told ITV news. The time has come for Mr Johnson to get a handle on this and have Mr Cummings frogmarched out of Downing Street, because if he doesn\u2019t the damage is going to continue. The manner, in which I know because I have had from the horse\u2019s mouth, some of my colleagues who went to discuss courteously with Mr Johnson their situation yesterday were treated by Mr Cummings was quite appalling. That has to stop, if it doesn\u2019t then maybe the 1922 Committee can do something about it but we cannot go on like this. In the Commons John Bercow, the Speaker, is taking points of order ahead of the debate on the Benn bill. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, asked if the bill required Queen\u2019s consent. Cash said he was inspired to ask the question partly by this blog by Robert Craig, a public law lecturer, who suggested Queen\u2019s consent would be required. He argued that this would be a problem. But Bercow told Cash he had considered this matter and decided Queen\u2019s consent was not required. Here is a question from below the line. The Conservative party is still the biggest party in the House of Commons. The Commons authorities have updated the figures in the light of the Tory decision to remove the whip from 21 MPs last night. Here are the figures. What this shows is that there are now more independent MPs in the Commons than there are SNP MPs. If they were to organise as a group, and appoint a leader (Philip Hammond?), he would get to ask two questions every week at PMQs instead of Ian Blackford. More than 100,000 people have applied to register to vote in the past 48 hours, with young people making up the bulk of the surge, my colleague Ben Quinn reports. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, confirmed that he has seen zero plans for an alternative to the backstop solution for the Irish border. He told the Guardian: We\u2019ve seen nothing in writing, it\u2019s as simple as that. He said all they have heard are some \u201cconceptual ideas largely\u201d. He said he did not recognise claims by Dominic Raab last week that the EU had come round and he learned in Helsinki at a summit of foreign ministers that they were \u201cwilling to contemplate opening up the withdrawal agreement in a way that wasn\u2019t there before\u201d. \u201cI was in Helsinki and I listened to Dominic Raab, and I talked to all of the same people,\u201d and did not hear that, he said. He said it was important for the British to \u201cunderstand there is a difference between a willingness to look at proposals that do the same job as the backstop\u201d and a renegotiation. More voters think Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was undemocratic than not, according to a YouGov poll for the People\u2019s Vote campaign. Here is an extract from the People\u2019s Vote news release. Voters regard Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament as undemocratic by an overwhelming 46% to 32%, while the prime minister\u2019s decision to throw 21 of his MPs \u2013 including two former chancellors of the exchequer and the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill \u2013 out of his party is also viewed as undemocratic by 45% to 32%. Barely a fifth (22%) of voters think people voted in 2016 to leave with no deal, reinforcing claims by Johnson\u2019s opponents that he has no mandate to impose this on the British people now. But only 21% think a general election is the right way to settle Brexit. Instead, a majority \u2013 53% excluding don\u2019t knows \u2013 say they support a new public vote. Johnson has defended his hardline stance by claiming he\u2019s seeking to negotiate a new deal but fewer voters (39%) think he\u2019s serious about this than think he\u2019s not serious (42%). Labour says the party is still in favour of calling a general election once the Benn bill becomes law, not once the 19 October deadline has passed (see 2.35pm), PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield reports. And here is a video of the moment where Boris Johnson, \u201cfrom a sedentary position\u201d, as they like to say in the Commons, appeared to call Jeremy Corbyn \u201ca great girl\u2019s blouse\u201d. And here is Martin Belam\u2019s story about it. Here is the video of the Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi demanding an apology at PMQs from Boris Johnson for comparing Muslim women to letterboxes and launch an inquiry into Islamophobia. It was the most compelling moment of PMQs. And here is my colleague Kate Proctor\u2019s story. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming Labour\u2019s position on the timing of an election is shifting. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, reflecting what was said at today\u2019s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party. (See 11.50am.) Starmer was referring to 19 October because that is the deadline in the Benn bill being debated this afternoon when the PM would have to seek an article 50 extension, unless either MPs had passed a Brexit deal or they had voted for a no-deal Brexit. If MPs were to vote for an election after 19 October, it would take place in November at the earliest. Here is my colleague Phillip Inman\u2019s main story about the spending review. Here is the Treasury\u2019s spending review document (pdf). And here is the Treasury\u2019s own summary of what was in the announcement. McDonnell says Javid has given no sign of appreciating the seriousness of the climate crisis. And he says Javid has delivered \u201ca pathetic sum to spending departments who are on their knees at the moment\u201d. This is not a government, but a racket, he says. They are pretending to plan ahead while plotting a no-deal Brexit. He repeats Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s line about the government having \u201cno mandate, no morals and no majority\u201d. The government has been in power for nine years. They are trying to fool the public with promises about a \u201cfantasy Brexit\u201d. He describes the government as a \u201cunique combination of rightwing extremism and bumbling incompetence\u201d. And he ends by saying it is a government that \u201cwill never be forgiven but will soon be forgotten\u201d. McDonnell says Boris Johnson just said \u201cpathetic\u201d to him. McDonnell says he knows what develops real pathos \u2013 seeing the experience of those suffering from benefit cuts, he says. McDonnell asks if the 10,000 extra prison places are the same 10,000 extra prison places promised by the government in 2016, and then again in 2017, and then again in 2018. Will anyone in government apologise to the Prison Officers Association for ignoring its warning about the safety impact of job cuts? On the police, McDonnell says the Tories expect people to forget that they were the ones who cut police numbers by 20,000. McDonnell says there has been a 160% increase in people sleeping rough. He says people have died sleeping rough just outside parliament. And yet Javid expects MPs to celebrate an inadequate plastering over of the problem. McDonnell says education spending has been cut by \u00a310bn in real terms since 2010. So schools will still be sending out begging letters, he says. He says councils have a shortfall of \u00a31.2bn for special educational needs funding by 2021. So they will still be out of pocket, he says. He says the NHS spending announcement has already been exposed as referring to money already in the system. McDonnell says a full fiscal event would have meant new economic forecasts. Instead, this is a sham spending review, he says. He says Javid is using \u201cheadroom\u201d (an option to increase spending) that he knows has disappeared. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is responding to Javid. He welcomes Javid to his new job. But he says after that speech, he is starting to miss the old one. He says his own father was a bus driver too. But he says that is probably all they have in common. He says the speech was \u201ca compendium of meaningless platitudes\u201d. He says Javid should take it back to the person who wrote it - Dominic Cummings. He says Boris Johnson is shouting at him now. He tells Johnson that the last time Johnson shouted at someone, they had to call the police, he said. He criticises Cummings for sacking a Treasury aide, and having her escorted out of No 10 by an armed police officer. He says this was not a proper spending review. It was \u201cgrubby electioneering\u201d, he says. And it was \u201cstraight out of the Lynton Crosby handbook of opinion poll politics\u201d. Javid says he is now turning to the departments that have not had their departments protected in recent years. They have had a difficult time, he says. Javid says no government department will have its budget cut next year. He says that is what he means by the end of austerity. Javid praises the UK\u2019s record on diversity. And the UK\u2019s values of openness and tolerance are nowhere better on display than in the aid budget, he says. He says the MoD budget will go up by \u00a32.2bn - an increase of 2.6%. He announces extra funding for the Normandy Memorial Trust, which commemorates D-day. Javid says that for too long the UK has let its trading relationships wither. That is a disgrace, he says. He says there will be 14 upgraded diplomatic posts. There will be an extra \u00a360m for the \u201cGREAT\u201d marketing campaign. And the government will spend over \u00a3500m on future sports events. Javid says the devolved administrations will get the biggest spending settlement for a decade. Javid says he will allocate an extra \u00a3160m for Scottish farmers. They have lost out through a previous policy, he says. Javid jokes that people may not know that his father was a bus driver. He will spend \u00a3200m on transforming bus services, he says. Javid says pupils need support even after the school day is over. Today he is asking the culture department to develop plans for a youth investment fund, including more youth centres. Javid says government will develop plans for a youth investment fund to pay for more youth centres. Javid says he would not be here as chancellor if he had not been to a further education college. He says FE will get an extra \u00a3400m next year. Javid says he will increase school spending by \u00a37.1bn by 2022-23. Every secondary school will get a minimum \u00a35,000 per pupil next year, he says. He says teacher starting salaries will rise to \u00a330,000 by 2022-23. He says most departments will be funded for just one year today, but today\u2019s announcement includes a three-year settlement for schools. Javid turns to the environment. He says this will be the first government to leave the environment in a better state than it found it. Javid announces \u00a354m extra to reduce homelessness and rough sleeping. Javid turns to the NHS, and announces an extra \u00a36.2bn in funding for next year. He also announces an extra \u00a31.5bn for councils for social care next year. Javid announces a 5% increase for the Ministry of Justice. Taken together, his announcements will dramatically improve the functioning of the criminal justice system, he says. Javid says there have been more attacks on mosques and synagogues this year. So he will double the places of worship fund next year. Javid announces an extra \u00a330m to tackle online child exploitation. Javid says his brother is a police officer. He knows how important policing is. Javid announces 6.3% increase Home Office spending. He says that is the biggest increase for 15 years, and will help to finance the plans to hire 20,000 extra police officers. Javid goes on: As I turn to the details of today\u2019s announcement. That gets a cheer from Labour MPs, who feel much the same way as Dan Sabbagh. (See 1.16pm.) Javid says total spending next year will rise by \u00a330.4bn Education was a lifeline for him, he says. And he says the NHS cared for his father in his final days. It is getting worse. Javid says: Health and education are not just the names of departments. From my colleague Dan Sabbagh, who is spot on. Normally, at this stage in a statement like this, the chancellor would have moved on to substance. Javid says he wants faster internet services. He wants better infrastructure. He wants to build in every region. From the motor highway to the information superhighway, he wants an infrastructure revolution. Javid says he will review the government\u2019s fiscal framework. Javid says he will review the fiscal rules the government follows. Javid says the cost of government borrowing has fallen below 1% across all maturities. He says his judgment is that he can invest more in the economy. But that does not mean he can borrow more permanently. He says the country still needs to live within its means. And he will still need to make difficult choices. Javid says he is giving certainty to departments about their budgets for next year. He is \u201cclearing the decks\u201d ahead of Brexit, he says. (Most MP will assume he means clearing the decks ahead of an election.) Javid says the UK is the number one investment in Europe for inward investment. It is a global hub for businesses, he says. The UK is second only to the US in terms of Nobel prize winners, he says. He says an open, free-market economy is under threat. It is not under threat from the people on the other side of the Channel, but from the people on the other side of the chamber. The number one threat to business is not Brexit, but Labour. John Bercow, the Speaker, says what Javid is saying is \u201cunseemly\u201d. He says that he says this \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d. He says Javid is veering into matters unrelated to the spending round, which is supposed to be the subject of his statement. He says he wants Javid to adjust his remarks, so that he focuses on the spending round. He says no one is going to tell him what Commons procedures are. Bercow reprimands Javid for using his spending round statement to make a gratuitous attack on Labour. Bercow has often reprimanded ministers at the despatch box, but I can\u2019t recall any example of him giving such a severe ticking off to a chancellor during a major financial announcement. Ken Clarke, the former Tory chancellor and father of the house, rises to make a point of order. John Bercow, the speaker, says the chancellor\u2019s opening remarks were out of order (because the spending review is not really about Brexit). But he exercised a degree of latitude, he says. He says Javid consulted him yesterday about the length of his statement. Bercow says he accepted the Brexit remarks did not make it over-long. Javid says he is today announcing an extra \u00a32bn for no-deal planning. Javid says the government has to implement the referendum result if people are to have faith in democracy. The government wants a deal, he says. Its central ask is to remove the backstop. But unless it is willing to walk away, it will not get a deal, he claims. He says this is a matter of trust. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has just started his spending review announcement. He says he is laying the foundation for a stronger, fairer society. PMQs has never been one of the enlightened features of our political debate. It is a shouting match all too frequently dominated by slogans, displays of machismo and cheap jokes. But even prime ministers who have been most comfortable in such a crude and brutal arena, such as David Cameron, have also acknowledged that they have been under some obligations to answer questions and address matters of policy and detail, and that while insults can get you through some of the time, they won\u2019t work on their own. Today it feels as if PMQs has become even more diminished, because in his first appearance in this arena Johnson seems to show no interest whatsoever in addressing the issue at hand. He has probably set a new record for dodging questions - he did not even half-answer them, as Theresa May frequently did - and instead he seemed intend on using the entire session to road-test some election slogans - principally his claim that Corbyn is championing a \u201csurrender bill\u201d, and that he is scared of a general election. Johnson was also even more dishonest then usual. Corbyn said that Michael Gove told Andrew Marr that food prices would go up in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Johnson claimed Gove said no such thing. But here is the quote. Asked if food prices would go up, Gove said: Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down. Corbyn focused on a no-deal Brexit, and the government\u2019s refusal to publish details of its Operation Yellowhammer assessment. He was dignified and forensic, and grown up in a way that put Johnson to shame. Although Tory MPs were cheering Johnson enthusiastically, they must have know then. And yet, those Johnson slogans sounded not just rehearsed, but tested. Will they resonate with the public at large? Who knows, but it is not impossible. The best questions are coming at the end. Margot James, a Conservative, has just asked about Dominic Cummings, telling Johnson that advisers should only advise. And the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson told Johnson his answer to Dhesi was a disgrace. He should have apologised, she said. The Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, who wears a turban, has just won a round of applause from Labour MPs for asking an angry and passionate question about Johnson\u2019s language about minorities, and particularly his column about Muslim women looking like letter boxes. And he asked when Johnson would order an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. Johnson looked thoroughly embarrassed, and sheepishly asked Dhesi to read the actual article. I will publish the full quotes soon. Dominic Grieve asks Johnson why he has been unable to find any official or minister willing to state in court that the prorogation had nothing to do with limiting the time available for MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says that case was thrown out by the Scottish court today. We\u2019ve got another 10 minutes or so to go, but I will post a summary now so that it can go up before the spending review starts. Karen Bradley, a Conservative, asks about community hospitals. She asks Johnson to join a campaign to keep her local hospital open. Johnson starts by thinking Bradley for her work as Northern Ireland secretary. He says Bradley has discussed this matter with her. Douglas Ross, a Conservative, asks what Johnson is doing to ensure the US does not impose tariffs on Scotch whisky. Johnson says Scotch is one of those products that will benefit from a trade deal with the US. Labour\u2019s Adrian Bailey says the chancellor has announced more money to help people with a no-deal Brexit. What will the total cost be to the taxpayer? Johnson says the government is preparing for a no-deal Brexit. But it does not want one. The way to avoid one is not to vote for the surrender bill. Labour\u2019s Geraint Davies says people did not vote for less control after Brexit. So will Johnson ensure there is a proper referendum? Johnson says, if Davies wants to put this to the people, he should persuade Corbyn to back an election. Dame Cheryl Gillan, a Conservative, asks Johnson if he will consider proposals for a review of the Autism Act. Johnson says the chancellor will soon be announcing a big investment in schools for pupils with special educational needs. Douglas Chapman, the SNP MP, says he wants to thank Johnson for boosting support for Scottish independence. A no-deal Brexit would cost jobs, he says. Johnson says the UK is preparing for a no-deal Brexit. But he does not think it will be as bad as the merchants of doom suggest. He wants a deal. The choice for the public is \u2013 will it be conducted by him, or Jeremy Corbyn. John Bercow, the Speaker, reprimands Johnson for referring to Corbyn by name, not by his title or constituency. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says a no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table. Will Johnson respect that? Johnson asks Blackford if he will respect the referendum result. Blackford says Johnson is a new boy. But Johnson is supposed to answer questions. Blackford says he and the SNP represent Scotland. And polls today show they are set to win. Blackford says people did not vote for a no-deal Brexit. Will Johnson accept that? Johnson says he is a democrat. He respects the referendum result. And he wants to have an election - he corrects himself, and says he is willing to have an election. (On Monday, outside No 10, he said he did not want an election.) He says the SNP want to distract attention from their domestic failures. He says their signature policy is to join the euro and surrender Scottish fish by rejoining the common fisheries policy. Julian Lewis, a Conservative, asks a closed question (one tabled in advance) about why the cabinet secretary is also the national security adviser. Johnson says that was a decision taken by Sir Mark Sedwill, the person who does both roles. Lewis says Johnson should not agree to this. He says the defence committee will not be able to question Sedwill. There should be two people doing these jobs, he says. Johnson says he will make sure invitations to Lewis\u2019s committee (he chairs the defence committee) are considered properly. Corbyn says Johnson is refusing to answer questions about food supply. He says the government is spending \u00a3100m on an advertising campaign, but refusing to answer the facts. He says the government refused to provide figures to the poverty alliance about food supply. What has he got to hide? Johnson repeats the claim that Corbyn would spend \u00a31bn a month on staying in the EU. He says the poorest people are now taking more money home thanks to this Conservative government. Corbyn says you do not have to go far from this house to see poverty on the streets. Child poverty is up, pensioner poverty is up. Johnson won\u2019t say how his plans will impact on poverty. Yesterday Johnson lost his first vote in parliament. Now he wants to avoid it. He is \u201cdesperate to avoid scrutiny\u201d. Johnson has no plan to get a new deal, and no authority. He says if the PM does to the country what he has done to his party in the last 24 hours, people have a lot to fear from his incompetence and his refusal to publish known facts. Johnson says Corbyn will not submit his \u201csurrender bill\u201d to the verdict of the people. He is frit, frightened. He says he thinks the friends of the UK are in Paris and Berlin and in Washington. Corbyn thinks they are in Moscow and Tehran and Caracas. \u201cCorbyn is Caracas\u201d, he says. And Corbyn is calling for a general strike. A shadow minister said Corbyn\u2019s economic policy was \u201cshit or bust\u201d. But it is both, says Johnson. Corbyn says he cannot be accused of undermining negotiations because no negotiations are taking place. He says Michael Gove said at the weekend that food prices will go up under no deal. Will Johnson publish the Operation Yellowhammer documents so people can see what will do up, and by how much? Johnson said Gove said no such thing. (But Gove did. He said some prices would go up, and some down. I will post the quotes soon.) Johnson says Corbyn is worried about free trade deals with the EU. But there is only one chlorinated chicken in this house - it is Corbyn. Will Corbyn let the people decide? Corbyn says the British Retail Consortium said it was untrue when Gove said there would be no shortages of fresh fruit. He asks Johnson to publish the Operation Yellowhammer documents. Johnson says Corbyn used to be a democrat. Can he say if he would vote remain or leave in a referendum? Jeremy Corbyn also pays his respects to PC Andrew Harper. And he sends his condolences to those affected by Hurricane Dorian. He asks Johnson if it is right that his Brexit strategy involves running down the clock and that the attorney general thinks the idea that the EU will abandon the backstop is a \u201cfantasy\u201d (as the Telegraph reported last night). Johnson attacks the \u201csurrender bill\u201d again. He says Corbyn wants \u201cmobs of Momentum activists\u201d to block the roads. He challenges Corbyn to agree to an election. \u201cOr is he frit?\u201d Corbyn says Johnson did not answer the first question he put to him. He tries again. What proposals have been put to the EU? The fact Johnson won\u2019t answer suggests there are none. If the PM thinks he has made progress, will he publish those proposals? Johnson says you don\u2019t negotiate in public. \u201cWe are making substantial progress,\u201d he claims. Johnson claims he is making \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in talks with the EU. He says he will get a deal. The only thing that is undermining him is \u201cthis surrender bill that will lead to more dither and delay\u201d. He says he wants 20,000 more police officers on the streets. He says Corbyn wants to spend \u00a31bn net a month beyond October to keep the UK in the EU. Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP, says leaving without a Brexit deal is unthinkable. Johnson is pursuing a strategy of brinkmanship. If he believes in no deal, he should put it to the people. Johnson says he will take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. He says the only thing in the way is the \u201csurrender bill\u201d proposed by Jeremy Corbyn. He challenges Corbyn to let the public vote on this by agreeing to an election on 15 October. Johnson challenges Corbyn to let public decide on what he calls the \u201csurrender bill\u201d by agreeing to an early election. Boris Johnson starts by paying tribute to PC Andrew Harper killed while on duty during the summer. He says this is a reminder of the dangers faced by the police. Boris Johnson has just arrived in the chamber, to cheering and booing. (Booing is very, very unusual. That says something about the reaction Johnson provokes.) Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Boris Johnson is about to take his first PMQs. Yesterday Nigel Farage launched 16 new video adverts on Facebook, with straplines like \u201cWe have spent the summer preparing for a general election \u2014 and we are ready\u201d, \u201cI founded The Brexit Party to restore faith in our broken democracy\u201d and \u201cWe are ready for an election. It\u2019s time for a clean break Brexit\u201d. It\u2019s notable that though they are being paid for by the Brexit party, they are all promoting Nigel Farage\u2019s personal page on Facebook, not the party\u2019s page. Farage has six times as many \u2018likes\u2019 on his page than the party does. They are not currently spending any money on adverts from the Brexit party page itself. Retailers have said that the end of October is \u201cprobably the worst time to face a no-deal Brexit\u201d, warning there will be disruption to fresh food supplies and potential price rises despite claims by Michael Gove to the contrary. Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told the Commons Brexit committee that he could not explain why Gove, who is in charge of the government\u2019s no-deal planning said \u201cthere will be no shortages of fresh food\u201d in the event of a disorderly departure from the EU on 31 October. Opie said: Our assessment is based on discussion with our members who move fresh food every day, and the likely disruption. We modelled that with our members who have told us there will be disruption to fresh food. It will effect fresh food in various ways, availability, shelf life and potentially cost. From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard Downing Street has sent out this readout from this morning\u2019s cabinet. At cabinet this morning the chancellor discussed his plans ahead of today\u2019s spending round where he will present an ambitious domestic agenda, delivering on the government\u2019s priorities. He said that thanks to the hard work of the British people and tough decisions made over the last decade, we are beginning a new decade of renewal. We are delivering a step-change in spending on people\u2019s priorities, which is why we are spending more on the NHS, properly funding our schools, boosting further education and tackling violent crime by hiring 20,000 new police officers. The prime minister thanked the chancellor and HM Treasury for all of their work and said that levelling up was at the core of this spending round, unlocking the talent of the whole of the United Kingdom. My colleague Jonathan Freedland has a good column on Boris Johnson\u2019s election strategy. Here is an excerpt. The assumption is that [Dominic] Cummings is intentionally baiting MPs so that he can trigger an election that Boris Johnson will then cast as a populist battle of \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d. If that\u2019s right, it is surely the most high-risk electoral strategy ever attempted in this country. It knowingly alienates moderate Tory voters who have always quite liked, say, Ken Clarke, thereby writing off a string of seats \u2013 in the south and the West Country \u2013 that are likely to fall to the Liberal Democrats. It similarly dooms the Tories in Scotland. So Johnson will begin the next election campaign with that immediate handicap. The Cummings plan is to make up for those lost seats, and gain many more, by winning pro-leave seats in the Midlands and north of England, many of them Labour-held, chiefly by neutralising the Brexit party. Why vote for Nigel Farage when you can get a no-deal, full-monty Brexit with Johnson? The trouble with that is, there are plenty of onetime Labour voters who were happy to vote leave in 2016, happy even to vote for Farage in May\u2019s European elections, who may nevertheless baulk at voting Tory. Still, Cummings and Johnson are gambling on the belief that they can burn down every other plank of historic Tory support, but win power by delighting the hardcore Brexit base. Win the 35%, enrage everyone else. A few weeks from now, we might be watching a triumphant Johnson returned to Downing Street with a healthy majority, forced to applaud the strategic genius of Dominic Cummings. Or we might marvel that a man who inherited a precarious political situation went on a rampage of revolutionary destruction, thereby making that situation much, much worse. And here is the full article. Media attention will mostly be focused on the Commons this afternoon, but in the Lords peers are also gearing up for what should be an epic display of filibustering. Peers are debating a business motion tabled by Labour designed to ensure that, if the Benn bill intended to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October goes to the Lords tomorrow, it can clear all its stages by 5pm on Friday. A business motion is needed because in the Lords bills are not subject to programme motions, meaning in theory debates can go on forever. The Lib Dems support the business motion and so, given that the Tories do not have a majority, it should pass. But before peers get to vote on it they will have to debate the amendments to the business motion. On today\u2019s order paper (pdf) there are 86 of them. In the Lords every amendment normally gets debated, and peers are normally free to speak for as long as they want, making it filibustering heaven. The only way to fast-track a vote is to move a closure motion. But even these take time, because peers first have to vote for the closure motion, and then vote for the amendment. So, in theory, 86 amendments could translated into 172 votes. It probably won\u2019t go on quite that long but Dick Newby, the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, has arrived for work prepared for a long night. The Tory rebels who have now lost the party whip will not be crossing the floor when parliament sits today, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports. Britain\u2019s private sector contracted last month, fuelling fears that the UK could be lurching into a Brexit-induced recession, my colleague Graeme Wearden writes on his business live blog. The full details are here. Turning back to Jacob Rees-Mogg, it has emerged that he single-handedly managed to push the size of the rebellion last night over the 20 mark. In an interview with the Today programme\u2019s Ross Hawkins, Guto Bebb, one of the most prominent rebels, said that Rees-Mogg\u2019s speech helped to persuade four MPs to join him in voting against the government. Bebb said: There were at least four individuals who were still doubtful who changed their position to being supportive and voting with us on the back of Jacob\u2019s performance. He was deemed to be arrogant, out of touch and I think the way in which he treated some of the interventions was a red rag to bull in many cases. Mogg is getting most publicity this morning for his unusual posture on the Treasury bench. (See 6.37am.) Last night the government was, quite literally, flat on its back. But the picture has distracted attention from his speech which, even by Rees-Mogg\u2019s standards, was unusually pompous, as well as peevish and at times offensive. You can read the highlights on last night\u2019s blog here. A judge at the highest court in Scotland has found Boris Johnson\u2019s planned prorogation of parliament lawful, the Press Association is reporting. Legal action aimed at preventing the UK government suspending parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31 October was considered at the court of session in Edinburgh. Lord Doherty revealed his decision that the prorogation was lawful this morning. It followed claims the prime minister wants to limit MPs\u2019 scrutiny and their attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has welcomed the news that Steve Baker, the new chair of the powerful European Research Group caucus in the Conservative party, favours a pact with the Brexit party if there is an early election. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston The Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon says Boris Johnson should accept. Boris Johnson has been chairing a cabinet meeting this morning. It has just finished, and ministers have been leaving No 10. According to the Press Association, the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, did not answer when asked if he \u201chad a good sleep\u201d after he was pictured lounging on the Commons benches during the debate yesterday. Here is how the day will unfold in parliament: 11.30am: The Commons sitting starts with Welsh questions. 12pm: Boris Johnson takes PMQs. This will be his first PMQs as prime minister. Given that parliament may well be prorogued by next Wednesday, and that if there is an early election he could lose, it could be his last one too. Around 12.50pm: Sajid Javid, the chancellor, makes a Commons statement about the spending review. 3pm: MPs begin the debate on Hilary Benn\u2019s bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Around 3.30pm: Peers start debating a business motion tabled by Labour designed to ensure that, if the Benn bill gets to the Lords, it will complete its passage through the house by 5pm on Friday. 5pm: MPs vote for the second reading of the bill. That is a yes/no vote on whether it should go ahead. After that MPs will spend two hours debating amendments to the bill. 7pm: MPs vote on amendments to the bill and for its third reading. There are likely to be several votes, each one taking 15 minutes. Mid-evening: After voting on the Benn bill is finished MPs will have a 90-minute debate on Boris Johnson\u2019s motion saying \u201cthat there shall be an early election\u201d. The motion may well pass but the opposition parties are not voting in favour (because they want the Benn bill passed before they agree to an early election), and so Johnson is not expected to get the two-thirds majority needed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for an early election to go ahead. In his morning London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe, Jack Blanchard has some more evidence of the backlash in the Conservative party against Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to remove the whip from the 21 Tory rebels. Here\u2019s an extract. \u2018Richard bloody Benyon?\u2019 Despite all the threats and aggressive briefings from No 10 in lead-up, plenty of Tory MPs and aides were still gobsmacked by the unprecedented purge of the moderates we saw last night. When was the last time any major political party threw out more than 20 of its MPs for disobeying orders? Worryingly for Downing Street, even slavishly loyal Brexiteers were unnerved. \u201cIt\u2019s like something out of North Korea,\u201d one normally supportive No 10 aide phoned Playbook to say. \u201cI honestly think they\u2019ve completely overreached. They have f***ed this up. We look bonkers. You\u2019re trying to frame it as parliament vs. the people \u2014 and then you deselect 20-odd of your own MPs, including Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson? I mean \u2014 deselecting Philip Hammond is one thing, but Richard bloody Benyon? Imagine what we\u2019d be saying if Corbyn did something like this\u201d ... Caught in the middle: Centrist Tory MPs such as ex-Minister Tobias Ellwood told my colleague Annabelle Dickson they too were worried by Downing Street\u2019s response. \u201cIt is a sad day indeed when the grandson of Churchill is threatened with deselection,\u201d Ellwood said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the party we used to be \u2014 an open, center-right, one nation, progressive party. Given how many people rebelled under Theresa May\u2019s government it is a worrying precedent that has been set.\u201d Another Tory MP told her the deselections were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, adding: \u201cThere are a lot of moderate people who won\u2019t be at all happy with this.\u201d Last night was not a great night for the Conservative party. Those on the centrist, remain-voting wing of the party saw 21 of their number lose the party whip, with the result that they may effectively be purged from parliament after the next election. And they were having the confront the transformation of their party into a quasi-Brexit party. (See 9am.) And, of course, for the Brexiters in government, it was a disaster too. Johnson lost his first vote as PM, his majority has been vaporised, and he is being pitched into a general election where he will be vulnerable to the Brexit party (although it is not impossible that in that election his \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d message could work well for him). But at least one Conservative did seem quite cheery as she left the House of Commons last night. Here is the former PM Theresa May, who seems to be taking some pleasure from the fact that someone who helped to bring her down failed his first parliamentary challenge so dramatically. Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary who lost the Tory whip last night after voting against the government, has just told BBC News that, if he is not reinstated as a Conservative candidate, he will consider standing as an independent in his Penrith and The Border constituency. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to remove the whip from the 21 Tories who rebelled last night - a move that in theory means they won\u2019t be able to stand for the party at the next election - is generating a furious backlash. We have already quoted Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader and a figurehead for moderate, centrist Conservatism. (See 8.13am.) On Newsnight last night Ken Clarke, the former chancellor and now father of the house, also spoke out. He was one of the 21 who lost the whip last night, and he said he did not know if he would even vote Conservative at the next election. He explained: I am a Conservative, of course I am \u2026 But this leader, I don\u2019t recognise this. It\u2019s the Brexit party, rebadged .... [The party has] been taken over by rather a knockabout sort of character [Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff] who\u2019s got this bizarre crash-it-through philosophy \u2026 [And a] cabinet which is the most right-wing cabinet any Conservative party has ever produced. They\u2019re not in control of events. The prime minister comes and talks total rubbish to us, and is planning to hold a quick election and get out, blaming parliament and Europe for the shambles. For the record, here is the list of 21 Tory MPs who voted against the government last night, and who have subsequently lost the whip: Guto Bebb Richard Benyon Steve Brine Alistair Burt Greg Clark Ken Clarke David Gauke Justine Greening Dominic Grieve Sam Gyimah Philip Hammond Stephen Hammond Richard Harrington Margot James Sir Oliver Letwin Anne Milton Caroline Nokes Antoinette Sandbach Sir Nicholas Soames Rory Stewart Edward Vaizey Another intriguing nugget from the interview Keir Starmer gave on the Today programme. The shadow Brexit minister said Labour could always invoke a vote of no confidence against the prime minister and seek to form a government, rather than go to the polls. If there\u2019s a vote of no confidence we\u2019ve obviously got to win it and we\u2019ll have to gauge whether we can or not. And that\u2019s a difficult judgment call Jeremy Corbyn, as leader of the opposition, will make. Asked whether it may be preferable to try to form a new government rather than go to the people in an election, Starmer replied: It may well be. And if there\u2019s a vote of no confidence that is what happens. Following his crushing defeat in the Commons last night, Boris Johnson has woken to deliver this message on Twitter: Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, confirms the party will not back prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s move to hold a general election. The prime minister needs two-thirds of the Commons to vote in favour of an election but Starmer says Labour will not \u201cdance to Boris Johnson\u2019s tune\u201d and wants to ensure a no-deal exit is blocked before going to the polls. He told the Today programme: What we want to ensure is that we\u2019ve got the insurance policy of taking no deal off the table and that we will have a general election, we will have it on our terms not on Boris Johnson\u2019s terms and we\u2019re not going to fall into a trap. He argued Labour was not \u201cshy\u201d of a general election but said the party would not be \u201ctrapped into abandoning control of parliament\u201d. Starmer accused the Tories of \u201cdestroying their own party\u201d by removing the whip from 21 Conservative rebels. Here\u2019s a helpful summary by my colleague, Jessica Elgot, of who the rebels are. Ruth Davidson, who stood down as the Scottish Conservative leader last week, has waded in to the brewing row over Downing Street\u2019s decision to remove the whip from 21 MPs who rebelled last night. The rebels include Conservative heavyweights including Kenneth Clarke and Sir Nicholas Soames, who is Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson. Last night, Soames told Newsnight he will not stand as an MP at the next general election. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, says that she is hopeful that more rebel MPs will join her party. It follows former Tory MP Philip Lee\u2019s stunt, as he walked across the Commons floor to join the Lib Dems as Boris Johnson addressed parliament yesterday. Asked whether there will be more defections, she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I\u2019m very hopeful that there will be because there\u2019s a lot of MPs who are looking to see where the sense in British politics can come from, where we can really people to stop the chaos that is Brexit and to fight for a much better future for our country that people do not see under Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn. She confirmed she was in discussion with more MPs about defecting, saying: There\u2019s certainly many MPs who have for some time been very unhappy, whether that\u2019s in the Conservative party or indeed also in the Labour party, with the direction that those parties are heading off in under the influence of \u2026 Nigel Farage, Brexit, Ukip tendencies in the Conservatives and the hard left in the case of the Labour party. So, of course, yes, I\u2019ve been having conversations with those MPs. Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, has told Sky News the party will not back a general election on Boris Johnson\u2019s terms: Rory Stewart revealed on Twitter this morning that he was thrown out of the Conservative party by text last night after rebelling in the Commons: In an interview with the Evening Standard on Monday, the former Tory leadership hopeful said he would still love to be prime minister. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business minister who has drawn the short straw by being sent out to bat for the government after its crushing defeat last night, says the 21 Tory rebels undermined the government\u2019s position. He told the Today programme: \u201cThat was the basis with which the whip was withdrawn.\u201d Asked by the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson whether he believed the rebels want to \u201csurrender\u201d to the EU \u2013 as has been suggested by Johnson\u2019s rhetoric \u2013 he replied: Look, I wouldn\u2019t use the word surrender or anything like that. They are undermining the prime minister\u2019s position and that\u2019s why the whip was withdrawn from them. You cannot have people standing as Conservative MPs when they are against the government policy on the key issue of the day. He said he is not sure what is going to happen this afternoon, explaining: But what is very clear to me is that the leader of the opposition has said consistently that he wants a general election and it\u2019s perverse of him, I think, to say now that he doesn\u2019t want one and it suggests to me that he\u2019s rather frightened of a general election. He said a general election \u201cmay well be \u2026 the best way forward\u201d to resolve the impasse in Westminster. Yesterday Boris Johnson described the bill being debated today, designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, as \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d. It sounded like a phrase that he will deploy relentless if there is an early election. It is interesting to note that one of his senior ministers seems unhappy with the concept, presumably because of its world war two connotations, and its implication that the EU is the enemy. Downing Street\u2019s move to boot Rory Stewart out of the Conservative party, which he has served as an MP for nearly a decade, has prompted this reaction from members of the lobby: The former Conservative leadership candidate Rory Stewart \u2013 who was among 21 Tory MPs who had the whip removed last night after voting against the government \u2013 has revealed he was dumped from the party by text. Stewart, who until weeks ago was international development secretary, has pledged to stand again for parliament. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Yes, I intend to stand as a Conservative MP \u2026 I think this is very important. What\u2019s happening here is our democracy is being challenged. It was challenged first by proroguing parliament, it\u2019s being challenged again by something completely unprecedented. I mean, Mrs Thatcher had very strong views on the world but she didn\u2019t, when people disagreed with her, try to deselect them as MPs. Asked what he can do about it and whether he would consider legal action, the MP for Penrith and The Border said: I would consider doing the most straight forward thing of all, which is asking my constituents to support me, which they always have in the past. And I think other colleagues will do the same. Good morning folks, Simon Murphy here taking over the live blog on what is likely to be another extraordinary day of politics in Westminster. Brace yourselves. That\u2019s all from me for now, I\u2019m going to hand over to my colleague Simon Murphy. Anna Soubry says that the expulsion of \u201clong-serving, loyal, one nation Conservatives\u201d is \u201csure-fire proof\u201d the party is \u201cgripped by the ideological right\u201d. How the papers covered it There is mixed coverage of Boris Johnson\u2019s resounding defeat and his call for an election. The Guardian focuses on the significance of the defeat, calling it a \u201chumiliation\u201d for the PM. The Times gave weight to its front-page picture of an animated prime minister beneath the headline: \u201cPM loses historic vote.\u201d It says he \u201clost control of Brexit\u201d as MPs paved the way for an extension on the 31 October deadline for an exit. The Telegraph uses the headline: \u201cJohnson demands election\u201d and an image of the PM looking composed at the dispatch box. It carries a graphic with the numbers for last night\u2019s vote without referring to the defeat. The Matt cartoon has the pets of Downing Street saying: \u201cSomebody has made a horrible mess and I\u2019m not clearing it up.\u201d The Express criticises the Tory rebels and parliament in general, accusing them of \u201cbetraying Brexit\u201d on a shameful day for democracy. \u201cParliament surrenders to the EU,\u201d is the headline, above an image of Johnson ruffling his hair. Here are the Tory MPs who voted with the opposition yesterday. They were then called by the chief whip telling them the whip had been removed and they were no longer part of the Conservative party. (As Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, points out, that picture showing the 21 rebels makes it look like Rory Stewart is, in fact, a spy.) Some of them have spoken out since then, including Ken Clarke, the father of the house, who told Newsnight he does not recognise his own party. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty has written this column about the threats to democracy we have seen this week. He writes: Growing up, I learned that leaders who threaten democracy normally came decked out in khaki green, in front of troops toting shiny hardware. They commandeered broadcast studios, captured national buildings and imposed curfews on the streets. What is happening in Britain this week looks nothing like those grainy TV pictures, but it nonetheless marks an assault on our democracy. The government wants to shut down parliamentary democracy, claiming it is acting for the good of parliamentary democracy. From within No 10 Dominic Cummings threatens to end the career of elected MPs. And David Gauke, the Conservative MP who just six weeks ago was secretary of state for justice, wrote to his former government colleagues on Monday to ask them to obey the rule of law. Just because the paradoxes are so glaring makes them no less dangerous. The self-proclaimed party of law and order has this summer dropped the first bit to become merely the party of order. In this battle of Brexit-blocking politicians versus the people, the tribune of us plebs is none other than Jacob Rees-Mogg. His leader is Boris Johnson, perhaps the most slovenly would-be authoritarian in contemporary history. A reminder of this moment from last night\u2019s debate and the many and various jokes it spawned. Have you woken up in such a fog of Brexit confusion that you are struggling to remember what exactly happened yesterday and whether to be more furious, exasperated, delighted or enraged? If you need a gentle reminder I\u2019ve written a short explainer of what happened yesterday, addressing questions like: What just happened? Boris Johnson has just lost a very significant vote in parliament, which has allowed MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. It paves the way to introduce a bill that is designed to block a no-deal Brexit by forcing the prime minister to request an extension if he cannot strike a reworked divorce agreement with the rest of the EU. Johnson threatened his MPs ahead of Tuesday that they should vote with him or face the penalty of having the \u201cwhip\u201d withdrawn. Despite this threat, Johnson lost the vote. The rebel MPs and opposition parties won by 328 to 301. What does it mean to \u2018withdraw the whip\u2019? An arcane and slightly disturbing expression, in political-speak \u201cwithdrawing the whip\u201d from someone effectively means booting them out of the party, without them immediately losing their seat. An MP who has the whip withdrawn sits as an independent, but can be brought back into the party fold if it decides to restore the whip. Having the whip withdrawn is one of the most serious disciplinary actions that can be taken against an MP by a party. In this case it may mean they are barred from standing for the Tories in the next election. What happens next? Boris Johnson has announced he will ask parliament to allow a snap general election, which would be held on 15 October. The date of 14 October had been floated, but was deemed inappropriate as it is the Jewish holiday Sukkot. Johnson has said that even if the rebels\u2019 vote passes on Wednesday he will never request an extension beyond 31 October from the EU, and \u201cthe people of this country will have to choose\u201d in an election. However, the prime minister needs a two-thirds majority to secure an early general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Which means Labour can block it \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn quickly made clear his party would not vote for an election unless and until the anti-no-deal bill has passed. There is talk that if things reach a stalemate, it could result in a motion of no confidence in Johnson, but the prospects of that remain unclear. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the day in politics. It\u2019s only been three hours since we shut down last night\u2019s blog, and hopefully you\u2019ve all had some sleep and some top-shelf coffee since you logged off last night, because it\u2019s going to be another massive day. Yesterday Johnson suffered a humiliating defeat in his first House of Commons vote as prime minister, losing the vote 328 to 301, despite threatening his MPs that the whip would be withdrawn if they did not vote with him. The move was aimed at paving the way for a bill, which is designed to block a no-deal Brexit by forcing the prime minister to request an extension to article 50 if he cannot strike a reworked deal with the EU27. Former cabinet ministers including Philip Hammond and David Gauke were among 21 Conservative rebels who banded together with opposition MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on a dramatic day in Westminster. After the defeat, Johnson announced he would ask parliament to support plans for a snap October general election, saying he would never request the delay mandated in the rebels\u2019 bill (which they are due to table today, having won control of the parliamentary debate yesterday) which he said would \u201chand control of the negotiations to the EU\u201d. However, it is unclear whether Johnson will be able to get the support needed to hold an election. The prime minister needs a two-thirds majority to secure a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, and Jeremy Corbyn quickly made clear his party would not vote for the motion unless and until the anti no-deal bill had passed. There\u2019s a lot that is unclear, a lot that is uncharted, but come along with us as we attempt to chart it. I\u2019ll be with you for the first little while, before handing over to my esteemed colleagues. As usual, get in touch through the comments, on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com).

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s bid to trigger a general election next month has been blocked by MPs following a string of heavy defeats for the government in both houses of parliament. The prime minister was thwarted three times in the House of Commons: an attempt by opposition parties and Tory rebels to block a no-deal Brexit easily cleared its second and third readings, and Johnson later failed in his attempt to force a snap general election. Immediately afterwards, the prime minister called Jeremy Corbyn, \u201cthe first leader of the opposition in the democratic history of our country to refuse the invitation to an election\u201d. But an early poll seemed increasingly likely after the Labour leader signalled that he would back Johnson\u2019s call for a snap poll, but only once the bill opposing a no-deal Brexit bill has passed. The vote came just 48 hours after the prime minister told the public, \u201cI don\u2019t want an election, you don\u2019t want an election\u201d. The motion he tabled calling for an early poll was supported by 298 MPs, but that fell well short of the two-thirds required, with Labour MPs whipped to abstain. But Corbyn made clear explicitly that Labour is ready to support a similar motion, once Hilary Benn\u2019s backbench bill to block a no-deal Brexit has received royal assent, which could happen early next week if it is not scuppered by Tory peers. Corbyn told MPs, \u201cwe want an election, because we look forward to turfing this government out.\u201d But he claimed Johnson\u2019s proposal for a 15 October poll was, \u201ca bit like the offer of an apple to Snow White by the wicked queen\u201d. Speaking after the Commons had rushed through Benn\u2019s bill, which Tory peers are now seeking to block in the House of Lords, the Labour leader said, \u201clet this bill pass, and gain royal assent: then we will back a general election.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, said her MPs would not back an election until after article 50 has been extended. \u201cWe do relish the opportunity to fight an election, and we are confident that we would make significant gains. Yet stopping no deal is the priority and in the best national interest,\u201d she said. Johnson has repeatedly called the legislation, which would oblige him to seek an extension to article 50 if he has not secured a new Brexit deal by 19 October, \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s very sad that MPs have voted like this,\u201d Johnson said, adding, \u201cthe country must decide\u201d whether he or Corbyn go to Brussels for the critical European council meeting on 17 October. \u201cHe would beg for an extension; he would accept whatever Brexit demands, and we would have years more dither and delay,\u201d he said. Benn\u2019s bill passed through all its stages in the Commons in a matter of hours on Wednesday, as the rebels maintained their solid majority over Johnson\u2019s government, gaining a new Conservative convert in former minister Caroline Spelman. There were occasionally chaotic scenes. One amendment, tabled by Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, and calling for the extension to be used for the purpose of passing a Brexit deal, effectively passed by default. Johnson\u2019s motion calling for a general election was held 24 hours after he failed to prevent backbench MPs led by former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin seizing control of the parliamentary timetable to debate the anti no-deal Brexit bill. The prime minister campaigned for the Conservative party leadership with the slogan, \u201cdeliver Brexit by 31 October, unite the party, defeat Jeremy Corbyn \u2013\u2260 and energise our country!\u201d But just weeks after taking power, he is facing a growing backlash from colleagues on Wednesday, after 21 MPs, including former chancellor Philip Hammond and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Nicholas Soames, were expelled from their party. Soames said on Wednesday, \u201cI will not be standing at the next election, and I am thus approaching the end of 37 years\u2019 service to this House, of which I have been proud and honoured beyond words to be a member. I am truly very sad that it should end in this way.\u201d In a crowded evening meeting of the 1922 Committee less than 24 hours after the defenestration of the 21 rebels, senior Tories including the former defence minister Tobias Ellwood, Theresa May\u2019s former deputy Damian Green, former children\u2019s minister Tim Loughton and the veteran MP Sir Edward Leigh, all expressed deep concern at the move. One MP said there was alarm that \u201ccurrent tactics could be interpreted as a desire to shift the party to the right, to which the PM gave an emphatic no.\u201d Several sought assurances that if a fresh deal was put to the Commons, the same disciplinary measures would be applied to Brexiters opposed to the withdrawal agreement, the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d. Green later wrote to Johnson on behalf of the One Nation group of moderate Tories \u2013 originally set up by the current cabinet minister Amber Rudd \u2013 saying they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the whip being removed from \u201cprincipled, valued and dedicated colleagues\u201d. Green, who chairs the group, said that the actions overnight had \u201chindered the mission\u201d of uniting the party and said the group could only support Johnson \u201cif moderate modernising Conservatives are still welcome in Parliamentary party\u201d. However, in an exchange with Tory Brexiter Daniel Kawczynski at the 1922 meeting, Johnson appeared to commit that no MP would have the whip restored. Kawczynski was booed by some MPs for his remarks but said he wanted to hear them on the record from the prime minister. \u201cHe said the whip would not be restored to them and I am going to hold him to it.\u201d After opening the debate on his call for a general election, Johnson faced a withering response from Kenneth Clarke, who the previous day had been stripped of the Conservative whip after 49 years as a Tory MP. \u201cI do think the prime minister, with the greatest respect, has a tremendous skill in keeping a straight face whilst he\u2019s being so disingenuous,\u201d Clarke told a scowling Johnson. The PM, Clarke said, was \u201cdesperate\u201d for an election before 31 October \u201con the basis that he\u2019s been thwarted in getting an amazing, beneficial deal for this country\u201d. It was nonsense for Johnson to say that backers of the bill hoped to overturn Brexit, Clarke said: \u201cA very large percentage of those who\u2019ve been defeating him over the last two days are prepared to vote for Brexit \u2013 they\u2019ve voted for Brexit more often than he has.\u201d Earlier, Johnson and Corbyn clashed at a bad-tempered PMQs \u2013 Johnson\u2019s first since taking office in July. The Labour leader accused the PM of not having a Brexit negotiating strategy and trying to cover up the true impact of a no-deal departure. Johnson \u2013 who pointedly failed to answer any of Corbyn\u2019s direct questions \u2013 in turn accused the Labour leader of running scared of a snap election. The exchanges, in which Johnson was barracked remorselessly by the opposition benches, came the day after the prime minister lost his first vote in parliament, on a backbench bill seeking to delay Brexit, and then ejected 21 Tory rebels from the party. \u201cHe\u2019s been prime minister for six weeks and he promised to get Brexit sorted,\u201d Corbyn told the Commons. \u201cIn six weeks he\u2019s presented nothing to change the previous prime minister\u2019s deal, which he twice voted against. These negotiations that he\u2019s talking about are a sham. All he\u2019s doing is running down the clock.\u201d Johnson repeatedly taunted the Labour leader over backing an election: \u201cI know he\u2019s worried about free-trade deals with America, but there\u2019s only one chlorinated chicken that I can see in his house, and he\u2019s on that bench.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Police use of automatic facial recognition technology to search for people in crowds is lawful, the high court in Cardiff has ruled. Although the mass surveillance system interferes with the privacy rights of those scanned by security cameras, two judges have concluded, it is not illegal. The legal decision came on the same day the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, acknowledged that the Metropolitan police had participated in the deployment of facial recognition software at the King\u2019s Cross development in central London between 2016 and 2018, sharing some images with the property company running the scheme. That contradicted previous assurances about the relationship with King\u2019s Cross given by the mayor, who asked the Met \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d to explain what images of people had been shared with the developer and other companies. Last month, King\u2019s Cross became one of the first property companies to say it had used facial recognition software in two street cameras until 2018 for reasons of \u201cpublic safety\u201d, but following an outcry it said it had abandoned plans to deploy the controversial technology more widely on the site. The legal challenge in Cardiff was brought by Ed Bridges, a former Liberal Democrat councillor from the city, who noticed the cameras when he went out to buy a lunchtime sandwich. He was supported by the human rights organisation Liberty. He plans to appeal against the judgment. Bridges said he was distressed by police use of the technology, which he believes captured his image while out shopping and later at a peaceful protest against the arms trade. During the three-day hearing in May, his lawyers alleged the surveillance operation breached data protection and equality laws. The judges found that although automated facial recognition (AFR) amounted to interference with privacy rights, there was a lawful basis for it and the legal framework used by the police was proportionate. Dismissing the challenge, Lord Justice Haddon-Cave, sitting with Mr Justice Swift, said: \u201cWe are satisfied both that the current legal regime is adequate to ensure appropriate and non-arbitrary use of AFR Locate, and that South Wales police\u2019s use to date of AFR Locate has been consistent with the requirements of the Human Rights Act and the data protection legislation.\u201d Responding to the judgment, Megan Goulding, a Liberty lawyer, said: \u201cThis disappointing judgment does not reflect the very serious threat that facial recognition poses to our rights and freedoms \u2026 It is time that the government recognised the danger this dystopian technology presents to our democratic values and banned its use.\u201d Bridges said: \u201cSouth Wales police has been using facial recognition indiscriminately against thousands of innocent people, without our knowledge or consent. This sinister technology undermines our privacy and I will continue to fight against its unlawful use to ensure our rights are protected and we are free from disproportionate government surveillance.\u201d Facial recognition technology maps faces in a crowd and compares them to a watch list of images, which can include suspects, missing people and persons of interest to the police. The cameras scan faces in large crowds in public places such as streets, shopping centres, football crowds and music events such as the Notting Hill carnival. Three UK forces have used facial recognition in public spaces since June 2015: the Met, Leicestershire and South Wales police. Lawyers for South Wales police told the hearing facial recognition cameras prevented crime, protected the public and did not breach the privacy of innocent people whose images were captured. The technology was likened to police use of DNA. Those not on a watch list would not have their data stored after being scanned by AFR cameras, the court was told. The chief constable of South Wales police, Matt Jukes, said: \u201cI recognise that the use of AI and face-matching technologies around the world is of great interest and, at times, concern. So, I\u2019m pleased that the court has recognised the responsibility that South Wales Police has shown in our programme. \u201cThere is, and should be, a political and public debate about wider questions of privacy and security. It would be wrong in principle for the police to set the bounds of our use of new technology for ourselves.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioners\u2019 Office, which intervened in the case, said: \u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s finding that the police use of live facial recognition systems involves the processing of sensitive personal data of members of the public, requiring compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018. \u201cThis new and intrusive technology has the potential, if used without the right privacy safeguards, to undermine rather than enhance confidence in the police.\u201d A survey of more than 4,000 adults released on Wednesday by the Ada Lovelace Institute found that a majority (55%) want the government to impose restrictions on police use of facial recognition technology but that nearly half (49%) support use of facial recognition technology in day to day policing, assuming appropriate safeguards are in place. The Met said the ruling\u2019s implications would be carefully considered before a decision was taken on any future use of live facial recognition technology. Leicestershire police said they use facial recognition technology in criminal investigations, within locally agreed guidelines and legislation to identify possible suspects. \u201c[It] was last used at a public event in 2015, as a pilot scheme and it has not been used in that way since,\u201d the force said.",

We will also fight to secure a final say for the people of the UK on Brexit and we must campaign to remain in the EU,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Michael Russell, Scotland\u2019s cabinet secretary for constitutional relations, said: \u201cI note the decision of Lord Doherty in the court of session, and will keep a close eye on any forthcoming developments.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s plan to avoid debate and prevent legislation that would avert a calamitous no-deal exit from the EU, should concern all MPs, and all citizens, regardless of their views on leaving.</p> <p>\u201cThe MPs and peers, led by parliamentarians from Scotland, who brought this action to assert their right to hold the UK government to account, should be applauded for their efforts.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of leaving the EU, and particularly leaving without a deal, will be damaging and profound, and the attempt to deprive the Westminster parliament of the opportunity to scrutinise the UK government\u2019s plans is profoundly undemocratic.\u201d </p> <p>Doherty awarded legal costs to the government for Wednesday\u2019s hearing and the temporary interdict hearing last week, but refused a request for full costs.</p>",

Lord Doherty, the judge who heard the case, said the decision could not be measured against legal standards as it was matter of high policy and political judgment, and was therefore for politicians to settle. \u201cIn my opinion, there has been no contravention of the rule of law. Parliament is the master of its own proceedings. It is for parliament to decide when it sits. Parliament can sit before and after prorogation,\u201d he said. Doherty told the court it was for parliament, and ultimately the electorate, to hold the government accountable for such political decisions. The case was initiated by the campaigning barrister Jolyon Maugham QC alongside a cross-party group of 75 MPs and peers, including the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry. An appeal against the ruling is expected, and similar cases are to be heard in Northern Ireland and England. After the ruling, Maugham tweeted: \u201cThe idea that if the PM suspends parliament the court can\u2019t get involved looses some ugly demons. If he can do it for 34 days, why not 34 weeks, or 34 months? Where does this political power end? \u201cIt\u2019s not the law as I understand it. Yesterday\u2019s hearing was always going to be a bit of a pre-season friendly. We\u2019re now focused on the inner house, hopefully later this week, and then the supreme court on 17 September.\u201d Maugham told the Guardian the petitioners would continue with litigation in the courts for as long as they thought it might be effective. The Labour MP Ian Murray, one of the 75 MPs and peers who took part in the action, also confirmed there would be an appeal against the ruling. \u201cBut the main battle is currently in parliament, where the prime minister has lost his majority and does not have the support of the house for his dangerous plan to impose a no-deal Brexit on the country. \u201cWe have wrested control of parliamentary business and will attempt to pass a law that makes a no-deal Brexit illegal. We will also fight to secure a final say for the people of the UK on Brexit and we must campaign to remain in the EU,\u201d he said. Michael Russell, Scotland\u2019s cabinet secretary for constitutional relations, said: \u201cI note the decision of Lord Doherty in the court of session, and will keep a close eye on any forthcoming developments. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s plan to avoid debate and prevent legislation that would avert a calamitous no-deal exit from the EU, should concern all MPs, and all citizens, regardless of their views on leaving. \u201cThe MPs and peers, led by parliamentarians from Scotland, who brought this action to assert their right to hold the UK government to account, should be applauded for their efforts. \u201cThe impact of leaving the EU, and particularly leaving without a deal, will be damaging and profound, and the attempt to deprive the Westminster parliament of the opportunity to scrutinise the UK government\u2019s plans is profoundly undemocratic.\u201d Doherty awarded legal costs to the government for Wednesday\u2019s hearing and the temporary interdict hearing last week, but refused a request for full costs.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has warned Boris Johnson that Labour will only vote for a snap general election once parliament has prevented a no-deal Brexit. After Tuesday night\u2019s overwhelming government defeat, Labour\u2019s leader told the prime minister that his MPs would only vote it through once they have halted the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal. Corbyn and Keir Starmer had earlier consulted lawyers and parliamentary clerks as they sought a way to support a general election while also halting Johnson\u2019s plan to head towards a possible no-deal Brexit. It follows fears, highlighted on Monday by the former Labour leader Tony Blair, that supporting government plans for a general election would give it a free hand to change the polling date during an election campaign. After the government suffered a defeat of 328 votes to 301, Johnson immediately told the Commons that he would table a motion seeking a general election rather than accept a bill which would rule out a no deal. Corbyn replied: \u201cHe wants to table a motion for a general election, fine. Get the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table.\u201d Labour whips managed to hold down the number of rebels. Two Labour MPs \u2013 John Mann and Kate Hoey \u2013 voted with the government, while two others \u2013 Kevin Barron and Derek Twigg \u2013 abstained. Starmer tweeted: \u201cHugely important first step in stopping Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a no-deal Brexit. Important we remain united in making sure the bill becomes law in the coming days.\u201d Earlier in the day, Labour\u2019s leader and the shadow Brexit secretary were examining plans which might avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October, as threatened by the prime minister. It is understood that Labour wanted to use parliamentary procedure to force the Conservatives to hold an election on a particular date, instead of giving Johnson an option of moving it until after 1 November. Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown, told the parliamentary Labour party that they would not back the prime minister\u2019s snap election plans if it might lead to a no-deal Brexit. Clive Efford, the MP for Eltham, asked Brown about comments from Tony Blair in which the former Labour prime minister said supporting a general election would be an \u201celephant trap\u201d because it would give the government a free hand to change the polling date during an election campaign. Brown was applauded by a packed meeting after replying that Labour would not support a general election that could lead to a no-deal Brexit, a Labour source said. \u201cThere was not that much detail, there was just an unequivocal assurance,\u201d the MP Clive Lewis said. The choice of polling day is in the gift of the prime minister, who advises the Queen as to which date to proclaim. Johnson could, in theory, schedule an election for after no-deal, in another move that would push the bounds of convention without breaking the law. Concerns about the possible manoeuvre were raised following a rally in Salford on Monday night, when Corbyn said: \u201cI will be delighted when the election comes. I\u2019m ready for it, you\u2019re ready for it \u2013 we\u2019ll take that message out there and above all we will win.\u201d His enthusiasm caught some Labour frontbenchers by surprise, after a meeting of key opposition figures last week at which it was agreed the first priority was legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. One shadow minister told the Guardian it would be \u201cwholly irresponsible\u201d to agree to an election before 31 October \u2013 but another claimed the doubts about an election emanated from MPs who were sceptical about Corbyn\u2019s leadership. \u201cSome of the people saying, \u2018we can\u2019t have a general election\u2019, are just frightened Jeremy will actually win,\u201d one shadow minister said. Earlier on Tuesday, Corbyn suggested his party would back a general election \u2013 but only if it could also block a no-deal Brexit. After another cross-bench meeting, Corbyn said: \u201cLabour wants to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and to have a general election, so we can end austerity and invest in our communities. I am confident we can have both, and we\u2019ve been in discussions about a way to achieve this.\u201d Whether or not Johnson succeeds in forcing a general election, few at Westminster doubt that one is likely in the coming weeks and months, and Labour MPs are turning their minds to the contest ahead. There is likely to be a lively debate about whether the party\u2019s manifesto should leave open the possibility of going ahead with Brexit. Labour MPs in leave-voting areas were targeted by party whips seeking to defeat the government. Leave supporter MP Ronnie Campbell, who has rebelled against Labour several times and backed the government on Brexit, said: \u201cI\u2019m a leaver, there\u2019s no doubt about it \u2013 but on this I\u2019m half and half.\u201d",

Or arriving at this blog from a non-UK timezone and need some catching up?<br></p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve written a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/whips-and-votes-and-early-polls-what-is-going-on-in-uk-politics\">very basic explainer</a> of what happened today, addressing questions like:</p> \n  <h2>What just happened?</h2> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has just lost a very significant vote in parliament, which has allowed MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. It paves the way to introduce a bill that is designed to block a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> by forcing the prime minister to request an extension if he cannot strike a reworked divorce agreement with the rest of the EU.</p> \n  <p>Johnson threatened his MPs ahead of Tuesday that they should vote with him or face the penalty of having the \u201cwhip\u201d withdrawn. Despite this threat, Johnson lost the vote. The rebel MPs and opposition parties won by 328 to 301.</p> \n  <h2>What does it mean to \u2018withdraw the whip\u2019?</h2> \n  <p>An arcane and slightly disturbing expression, in political-speak \u201cwithdrawing the whip\u201d from someone effectively means booting them out of the party, without them immediately losing their seat.</p> \n  <p>An MP who has the whip withdrawn sits as an independent, but can be brought back into the party fold if it decides to restore the whip. Having the whip withdrawn is one of the most serious disciplinary actions that can be taken against an MP by a party. In this case it may mean they are barred from standing for the Tories in the next election.</p> \n  <h2>What happens next?</h2> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has announced he will ask parliament to allow a snap general election, which would be held on 15 October. The date of 14 October had been floated, but was deemed inappropriate as it is the Jewish holiday Sukkot.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has said that even if the rebels\u2019 vote passes on Wednesday he will never request an extension beyond 31 October from the EU, and \u201cthe people of this country will have to choose\u201d in an election. However, the prime minister needs a two-thirds majority to secure an early general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Which means Labour can block it \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn quickly made clear his party would not vote for an election unless and until the anti-no-deal bill has passed.</p> \n  <p>There is talk that if things reach a stalemate, it could result in a motion of no confidence in Johnson, but the prospects of that remain unclear.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related:

It is without precedent in our history \u2013 it is a bill that, if passed, would force me to go to Brussels and beg an extension. It would force me to accept any terms offered. It would destroy any chance of negotiations or a new deal. And indeed it would enable our friends in Brussels to dictate the terms of the negotiation, that is what it does. </p> \n   <p>There is only one way to describe this bill \u2013 it is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill.

We promised to respect the result of the referendum and we must do so now. </p> \n   <p>Enough is enough. This country wants this done. They want the referendum respected. We are negotiating a deal and though I am confident of getting a deal we will leave on 31 October in all circumstances. There will be no further pointless delay. </p> \n   <p>This house has never before voted to force the prime minister to surrender such a crucial decision to the discretion of our friends and neighbours overseas.</p> \n   <p>What is this bill would mean is that unless we agree to the terms of our friends and partners they would be able to keep us in the EU for as long as they want and on their terms. I urge therefore this house to reject this bill tonight so that we can get the right deal for our country, deliver Brexit and take the whole country forward.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d7ef409303944cf71459c2b0fa5612fba778562\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d7ef409303944cf71459c2b0fa5612fba778562/0_144_3188_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson in the House of Commons earlier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson in the House of Commons earlier.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-03T17:29:55.287Z\">at 6.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6e9eb78f08dc69e15156bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-03T17:13:35.353Z\">6.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Steve Baker,</strong> a leading Tory Brexiter, has confirmed that he has replaced Jacob Rees-Mogg as chair of the European Research Group, which represents those Tories most in favour of a harder Brexit.

Peers do not use programme motions, which are used in the Commons to curtail debates so that bills complete all their stages by a particular time. This led to fears that pro-Brexit peers might filibuster the bill, so that it fails to clear the Lords before prorogation. But <strong>Angela Smith</strong>, the Labour leader in the Lords, has tabled a motion to be debated tomorrow that would ensure that all stages of the Benn bill must be completed by 5pm on Friday.</p> \n  <p>There had been talk of peers sitting over the weekend to deal with the bill, but this motion would kill off that prospect. The Benn bill would then go back to the Commons on Monday, when MPs would debate any Lords amendment.</p> \n  <p>The Smith motion has the support of the Lib Dems, which means it is very likely to get through because there is no Conservative majority in the Lords.</p> \n  <p>Commenting on her plan, Smith said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Should MPs agree to the proposed bill, it would be completely unacceptable for the government to try and use its peers to scupper that legislation.

Since 2010, I have had the privilege of representing the Bracknell constituency. The party I joined in 1992 is not the party I am leaving today. <br></p> \n   <p>This Conservative government is aggressively pursuing a damaging Brexit in unprincipled ways. It is putting lives and livelihoods at risk unnecessarily and it is wantonly endangering the integrity of the United Kingdom. More widely, it is undermining our country\u2019s economy, democracy and role in the world. It is using political manipulation, bullying and lies. And it is doing these things in a deliberate and considered way. It has gone so far beyond reckless as to cease to be conservative.<br></p> \n   <p>I am dismayed at what the Conservative party has become, the role that it has played in feeding division and populism, in squandering a hard-won reputation for sound stewardship, and the blinkered direction in which it has set our country. Those are not my values. I will not implicitly condone these things by being party to them.<br></p> \n   <p>Make no mistake: this is a time of reckoning. The challenges that our world and country face are real \u2013 but not insurmountable. We need to root how we address them in evidence and reality. Critically, we need to recognise that we will not solve climate change, counter extremism, or address our housing, health and social care needs alone. We must work with others. <br></p> \n   <p>The opportunities to leave a better legacy are also significant. As a united country, we need to mobilise all our innovation, creativity, power and talent \u2013 not bury it under a Brexit that does not have the British people\u2019s informed consent. As a society, we need to rediscover the liberal and democratic traditions that made our country great. We should be guided by the values of justice, liberty and community. We must recognise our responsibilities to our people and planet: we are stewards of our country\u2019s and our world\u2019s limited resources.<br></p> \n   <p>Each generation needs to define democracy for itself and so we each have a part in shaping what we want our politics and our country to stand for. Each of us must stand and be counted.<br></p> \n   <p>That is why today I am joining Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats. I believe the Liberal Democrats are best placed to build the unifying and inspiring political force needed to heal our divisions, unleash our talents, equip us to take the opportunities and overcome the challenges that we face as a society - and leave our country and our world in a better place for the next generations. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-03T15:16:33.095Z\">at 4.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6e80cc8f082da28762c94b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-03T15:07:10.404Z\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ken Clarke says Johnson's strategy is to ensure EU gets as much blame as possible for no-deal Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ken Clarke</strong>, the Tory pro-European, says Johnson\u2019s strategy is obvious.

It is vital that those issues are fully developed in court. Our clients, who are members of parliament, seek naturally a political resolution in parliament to the question of whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal but believe that their entitlement as MPs to take a full part in that debate and decision is being unlawfully curtailed. They join the action to ensure that the voice of backbench MPs is heard in the question of whether the foundation of the proroguing of parliament is lawful.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Philips said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When the prime minister took the decision to prorogue parliament it was a sad day for our democracy. Not only does he seek to gag parliament from its clear opposition to \u2018no deal\u2019 but he is throwing out pending legislation including the domestic violence bill. The bill is dedicated to addressing the issues faced by victims of violent crime, and those who provide the services that respond.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And Sobel said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is absolutely clear that the proroguing of parliament is a device to shut down the opposition to \u2018no deal\u2019. The intent of the prime minister to rob parliament of its constitutional rights is unlawful.

She has just told Sky News that she is confident that the opposition will be able to pass the Benn bill, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, by the end of this week.</p> \n  <p>More significantly perhaps, she also implied the opposition parties have agreed not to vote for an early general election until the bill has become law. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have to be very alert to the fact the the prime minister could be using an early general election as a way of bringing through a no-deal Brexit and to do what he really wants, which is to remain in power. We must be very alert to not accepting a general election on the terms of the prime minister which suits the prime minister and the prime minister alone ...</p> \n   <p>We are very aware of the way that Boris Johnson will try to play the house. We are not going to be part of his game. And our priority is to stop no-deal Brexit. And the legislation is the way to do that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if Corbyn backed this approach, she replied: \u201cWe were in agreement.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Johnson cannot call an early election without opposition support. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the easiest way to get around the rule saying the next election should not take place until 2022 (five years after the last one) would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for an early election. That could not happen if opposition MPs voted against, or abstained. </p> \n  <p>Alternatively, under the FTPA, the government could lose a vote of no confidence, and an election would take place if no alternative government won a confidence vote within 14 days. But Johnson would not want to tell his MPs to vote against him in a confidence motion because that could lead to someone else becoming prime minister.</p> \n  <p>Those are the only two mechanisms under the FTPA that would allow an early election. Alternatively, the government could pass a new bill to amend the FTPA to allow an early election. But, given the size of Johnson\u2019s majority (one, including the DUP), this would probably only get through the Commons with opposition support.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f3ac1568279643dd8184ce05c066fd6b2807a3c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f3ac1568279643dd8184ce05c066fd6b2807a3c/36_0_892_535/500.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Saville Roberts\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Saville Roberts</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-03T12:32:56.894Z\">at 1.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6e50858f08dc69e1515275\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-03T11:55:35.081Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson fails to win over rebels in meeting at No 10</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson held a meeting with some of the Tory rebels this morning.

Some shadow ministers \u201cfreelance\u201d when they give media interviews (ie, they push their own views as much as the official party line), but Chakrabarti had good relations with Corbyn\u2019s office and is a reliable guide to the official line. This is what she said about when Labour would support an early election.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So to clear it up, it\u2019s about sequencing ...</p> \n   <p>What we need to ensure is that we get this legislation locked down. And that\u2019s quite hard, because remember, we\u2019ve got ministers who say that they\u2019ll ignore legislation. So that\u2019s another thing to consider. We\u2019ve got to get a locked-in guarantee that Britain would not crash out of the EU in an election campaign period.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve also got to try as best as possible to ensure that it wouldn\u2019t be possible for the sitting, squatting, prime minister in this period to set the general election and then change the date. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Chakrabarti said Corbyn would be meeting other opposition leaders in parliament this morning to discuss the matter further. When pressed on whether she was saying the election would have to take place after 31 October for Labour to support it (which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/03/commons-showdown-looms-in-battle-over-no-deal-brexit-live?page=with:block-5d6df9628f08b61c80d95a9d#block-5d6df9628f08b61c80d95a9d\">what Lloyd implied last night)</a>, she replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We certainly need to make sure that Boris Johnson can\u2019t go in for the kind of shenanigans he\u2019s been going in for with his chums last week, where the date is perhaps moved so that you could crash out [of the EU] by default during this period of a campaign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Chakrabarti said Labour\u2019s priority was preventing a no-deal Brexit, But beyond that the party wanted an election because \u201cwe live and breathe for a general\u201d.</p> \n  <p>What does this all mean? Chakrabarti seems to be setting out up to three conditions.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) The Benn bill, designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, would have to pass.</strong> That is what getting the legislation \u201clocked down\u201d implies. But there is no chance of that bill becoming law before Wednesday, when Johnson wants to hold a vote on an early election if he loses tonight.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) Ministers would have to promise to obey the bill.</strong> As Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/brexit-gove-refuses-rule-out-ignoring-law-passed-stop-no-deal-\">in an interview on Sunday</a>, at the moment they are not giving those assurances.

Lloyd implied last night that it would be best for Labour to wait until an article 50 extension had been secured, and 31 October had passed without a no-deal Brexit, before agreeing to an election. An alternative option might be to hold an election before 31 October, knowing that if Labour won, Corbyn could then request an article 50 extension (or, in extremis, revoke article 50 \u2013 although he has never said he would do that). But yesterday there were suggestions that Johnson could agree to an election on 14 October, and then change the date once parliament was dissolved to ensure it happened after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c97c6290a6bb66a1d43d2ab5f3da3275f646967f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c97c6290a6bb66a1d43d2ab5f3da3275f646967f/0_42_5092_3055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shami Chakrabarti and Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shami Chakrabarti and Jeremy Corbyn.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-03T09:30:02.857Z\">at 10.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6e22448f08b61c80d95b8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-03T08:21:39.462Z\">9.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lawyers for a group of 75 opposition MPs and peers will appear in court in Edinburgh this morning to urge a judge to prevent Boris Johnson from suspending parliament, bolstered by the support of Scotland\u2019s most senior legal figure, the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC.<br></p> \n  <p>The case, being brought by a group of MPs led by Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC, of the Good Law Project, is the first to be heard in full of three live legal actions against the prime minister, with the others in Belfast and London.</p> \n  <p>The case in Edinburgh has further significance after Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer acting for the MPs and peers, told the court last week he wanted Johnson to provide a sworn affidavit explaining why prorogation was necessary and legally sound.

Rest up, see you then! Boris Johnson said he would ask MPs to support plans for a snap general election after he lost his first Common vote as prime minister. Nearly two dozen Tory MPs voted with the opposition to allow a debate on a Bill that would block a no-deal Brexit. Johnson needs a two-thirds Commons majority to call an early general election. After the vote, the rebel Tory MPs were told the whip had been withdrawn. The 21 MPs, whose number included several former government ministers, were effectively thrown out of the party, meaning Johnson lost his Commons majority \u2013 as well as the vote. They had also been threatened with deselection and some said they would not seek reelection, though Philip Hammond was not among them. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would not back Johnson\u2019s moves for an early election until a no-deal Brexit was taken off the table. He was backed by the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, and other opposition parties. Steve Baker, the new chair of the hard Brexit-backing Tory backbench ERG, said his party should agree a pact with the Brexit party in the event of an election. A motion was tabled to ensure the anti-no-deal Bill can be rushed through Parliament this week. There are no time limits on debates in the Lords. But the Labour leader in that house tabled a motion that would ensure all stages must be completed by 5pm on Friday. Before the vote, the Philip Lee defected from the Tories to the Lib Dems. He said the Conservatives government was \u201caggressively pursuing a damaging Brexit in unprincipled ways\u201d. Boris Johnson wants to wants to provoke a no-deal Brexit and then blame the EU for it during a general election, according to Ken Clarke. The former Tory grandee set out what he believed to be the prime minister\u2019s strategy after reports that Johnson\u2019s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, believes the negotiations with the EU to be a \u201csham\u201d. An autumn general election would be a \u201cfantastic opportunity\u201d for Scots to demand a second vote on independence, according to the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader. Ian Blackford said Scottish voters would be able to send a message by returning SNP MPs in any such election. Still scratching your head about what happened today? Or arriving at this blog from a non-UK timezone and need some catching up? I\u2019ve written a very basic explainer of what happened today, addressing questions like: What just happened? Boris Johnson has just lost a very significant vote in parliament, which has allowed MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. It paves the way to introduce a bill that is designed to block a no-deal Brexit by forcing the prime minister to request an extension if he cannot strike a reworked divorce agreement with the rest of the EU. Johnson threatened his MPs ahead of Tuesday that they should vote with him or face the penalty of having the \u201cwhip\u201d withdrawn. Despite this threat, Johnson lost the vote. The rebel MPs and opposition parties won by 328 to 301. What does it mean to \u2018withdraw the whip\u2019? An arcane and slightly disturbing expression, in political-speak \u201cwithdrawing the whip\u201d from someone effectively means booting them out of the party, without them immediately losing their seat. An MP who has the whip withdrawn sits as an independent, but can be brought back into the party fold if it decides to restore the whip. Having the whip withdrawn is one of the most serious disciplinary actions that can be taken against an MP by a party. In this case it may mean they are barred from standing for the Tories in the next election. What happens next? Boris Johnson has announced he will ask parliament to allow a snap general election, which would be held on 15 October. The date of 14 October had been floated, but was deemed inappropriate as it is the Jewish holiday Sukkot. Johnson has said that even if the rebels\u2019 vote passes on Wednesday he will never request an extension beyond 31 October from the EU, and \u201cthe people of this country will have to choose\u201d in an election. However, the prime minister needs a two-thirds majority to secure an early general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Which means Labour can block it \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn quickly made clear his party would not vote for an election unless and until the anti-no-deal bill has passed. There is talk that if things reach a stalemate, it could result in a motion of no confidence in Johnson, but the prospects of that remain unclear. Taking votes for best slouching Jacob Rees-Mogg tweet. Sam Coates of Sky News has shared a Whatsapp message forwarded to him from the administrator of a Whatsapp group for Conservative MPs, asking those who have had the whip removed to remove themselves from the group. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, who seems to be having a lot of fun on Twitter tonight, has shared the tweet, saying that such a move is \u201c#basic\u201d. Brutal. Good evening, this is Kate Lyons returning to the helm of this blog that I kicked off in the wee hours this morning and what a day it\u2019s been in between. As the dust settles and everyone tries to work out where we go from here, some MPs \u2013 many of whom are facing a future, or at least a present, outside the Conservative party \u2013 are trying to see the light side. Including Ed Vaizey, who has delivered one of the night\u2019s great tweets. People are also thoroughly enjoying this picture of Theresa May thoroughly enjoying her drive home, with not a hint of smugness or schadenfreude on her completely loyal face. As British readers absorb the latest ructions in Westminster \u2013 whether the ousting of Tory grandees or Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s apparently laid-back approach to Commons debates \u2013 we would like to hear from readers outside the UK about how their media view the latest developments. Please send any front pages, comment pieces and editorial approaches that you feel are of note to G_J_Russell. The argument that Boris Johnson is genuinely trying to strike a deal with the EU is \u201cabsurd\u201d, according to the former Conservative minister, Ken Clarke, who has told Newsnight: He\u2019s obviously not trying to get a deal. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d prefer one if he thought he could get one past his right-wing supporters but he\u2019s dug himself in. He assumes he\u2019s going to get no deal because he can\u2019t get the right wing of the Conservative party, many of them now stuck in his cabinet, to agree to it. Referring to the state of the party, Clarke added: It\u2019s been taken over by a rather knockabout sort of character, who\u2019s got this bizarre crash-it-through philosophy ... a cabinet which is the most right-wing cabinet any Conservative party has ever produced. They\u2019re not in control of events. The prime minister comes and talks total rubbish to us and is planning to hold a quick election and get out, blaming Parliament and Europe for the shambles. I have to decide whether to vote Conservative if Boris Johnson is still the leader. That\u2019s my next problem. I am a conservative, of course I am ... but this leader, I don\u2019t recognise this. It\u2019s the Brexit party, rebadged. More reaction from MPs to tonight\u2019s vote is coming in. The former Tory minister, David Gauke, voted against the government The chairman of the Conservative party, James Cleverly, tweeted: Richard Burgon, Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary, has told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: We want a general election as soon as possible, as soon as it is legally bolted down that Boris Johnson can\u2019t use any tricks or ruses to lead people to believe there is going to be a general election before we have left with a no-deal Brexit but then change his tune and leave with a no-deal Brexit. And Joanna Cherry, the Scottish National Party MP, made similar comments on the same programme: We want a general election as soon as possible once this bill goes through. We don\u2019t fear a general election. We are not necessarily going to let Boris Johnson have it on his terms. We are anxious that this legislation we have worked so hard, cross party to back, goes through first to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Theresa May, whose premiership was wrecked by Brexit, has been photographed leaving Parliament after her successor, Boris Johnson, suffered defeat in his very first Commons vote. Rory Stewart, initially appeared to confirm he would not stand as an MP at any upcoming general election after rebelling against the government tonight. Speaking at the GQ Men of the Year Awards in London, he said: Politics is at an all-time low at the moment all over the world and it is great you continue to take an interest in it. We have a lot of work to do to regain anybody\u2019s trust. But I want to finish by saying this is a pretty special evening in many ways because, when I voted against the government this evening, I heard that my whip has been removed. It\u2019s likely tomorrow that there\u2019s going to be an election and I\u2019m not going to be able to stand as the member of Parliament because Boris [Johnson] has decided he doesn\u2019t want me in the party. I am very proud to take the award as politician of the year on the evening which I cease to be a politician. However, Stewart later clarified that he had been joking about leaving politics: Guto Bebb also voted against the government and is now believed to have had the whip withdrawn. He told the BBC: It is frankly rather hypocritical of a prime minister who constantly voted against the previous Conservative prime minister in taking this action against people who voted against him. None of this would have happened if it wasn\u2019t for the way in which No 10 and the prime minister have handled this whole issue. That decision to prorogue parliament on the advice of Dominic Cummings has misfired spectacularly. Another of those to rebel was Anne Milton, who wrote to her constituents to explain her decision: The mayor of London and avowed remain supporter, Sadiq Khan, has described tonight\u2019s vote as a \u201cfirst step towards stopping Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit\u201d. However, we are not over the line yet. It is now absolutely vital that this Bill is passed by both Houses, and that Boris Johnson ensures it receives Royal assent and then agrees to abide by it. Those of us who agree that Brexit is a total disaster for the future of London and our country simply must keep the pressure up this week. Sir Nicholas Soames, the Tory former minister, has told Newsnight that he will stand down at the next election. Soames, 71, whose grandfather was Winston Churchill, is losing the whip because he voted against the government tonight. That\u2019s all from me tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. This is from a source close to the rebel Tories. Tonight\u2019s decisive result is the first step in a process to avert an undemocratic and damaging no deal. No 10 have responded by removing the whip from two former chancellors, a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson. What has has happened to the Conservative party? Mark Spencer, the chief whip, has been ringing the Tory rebels telling them they are having the whip withdrawn, we\u2019ve been told. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, has already had the call. As of now, he is technically no longer a Conservative MP. And here is the full text of what Jeremy Corbyn said in the chamber after the vote. I welcome tonight\u2019s vote. We live in a parliamentary democracy, we do not have a presidency but a prime minister. Prime ministers govern with the consent of the House of Commons, representing the people in whom the sovereignty rests. There is no consent in this house to leave the European Union without a deal. There is no majority for no deal in the country. As I have said before: if the prime minister has confidence in his Brexit policy - when he has one he can put forward - he should put it before the people in a public vote. And so, he wants to table a motion for a general election, fine get the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table. Here is the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s statement after the result was announced. Let there be no doubt about the consequences of this vote tonight. It means that parliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal we might be able to strike in Brussels. Because tomorrow\u2019s bill would hand control of the negotiations to the EU. And that would mean more dither, more delay, more confusion. And it would mean that the EU themselves would be able decide how long to keep this country in the EU. And since I refuse to go along with that plan we are going to have to make a choice. I don\u2019t want an election. The public don\u2019t want an election. But if the House votes for this bill tomorrow, the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on October 17 to sort this out and take this country forward. Everyone will know if the Rt Hon Gentleman is the prime minister, he will go to Brussels, he will beg for an extension, you will accept whatever Brussels demands and we\u2019ll have years more arguments over Brexit. And by contrast, everyone will know that if I am prime minister, I will go to Brussels, I will go for a deal and get a deal but if they won\u2019t do a deal we will leave anyway on 31 October. The people of this country will have to choose. The leader of the Opposition has been begging for an election for two years. I don\u2019t want an election but if MPs vote tomorrow to stop the negotiations and to compel another pointless delay of Brexit, potentially for years, then that will be the only way to resolve this. I can confirm that tonight we will are tabling a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, was wrong when she said earlier that the Tory rebels would be given a second chance before they had the whip removed (see 10.29pm), the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young reports. Here is the list of MPs who did not vote in the division. As is normal, the Speaker, his three deputies and the seven Sinn Fein MPs (who have not taken their seats) did not vote. The other MPs who did not vote were Sir Kevin Barron and Derek Twigg (both Labour) and four independents (Kelvin Hopkins, John Woodcock, Jared O\u2019Mara and Chris Williamson). It is impossible to tell from the division lists whether an MP did not vote because they wanted to abstain, or whether there was another reason, like illness, for their non-appearance. Here is the list of MPs who voted against the motion. There were 286 Tories voting this way, and all 10 DUP MPs voted against. The other votes came from two Labour MPs, Kate Hoey and John Mann, and three independents (Ian Austin and Ivan Lewis, who are both ex-Labour, and Charlie Elphicke, who is ex-Tory). You can find the division lists here. Here are the 21 Tory MPs who voted with the opposition. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, has signalled that the Tory rebels will not have the whip removed immediately. In an interview with BBC, she said that she hoped that the MPs who voted against the government would \u201creconsider overnight\u201d and decide to vote with the government to defeat the bill tomorrow. Asked if they would lose the whip immediately, she said they wouldn\u2019t. They would get a second chance, she said. UPDATE: Leadsom was freelancing, or just plain wrong. Party sources have made it clear that all rebels are losing the whip. See 10.48pm. Anna Soubry rises as leader of the Independent Group for Change. Some MPs jeer, because they do not see this as a proper party. Soubry says she will not be shouted down by a man. She says the rumour is that all the rebels will have the whip withdrawn. Is that correct? Bercow says they are not having a debate now. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, says MPs must act responsibly. She says she backs the idea of an election, but not before MPs have removed the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Wesminster, says Johnson has a 100% record when it comes to losing votes in the Commons. He says Johnson should respect the vote. He says the \u201cfantasy\u201d that there is a deal to come from the government is \u201cnonsense\u201d. Let us have an election. But let us have an election that respects the democracy of this house. Blackford says SNP also wants Benn bill passed before general election called. Jeremy Corbyn says if Johnson wants an election, he must get the bill passed first. Boris Johnson says he will refuse to go along with this bill. He does not want an election. But if MPs vote for this bill tomorrow, the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on 17 October. He says if Jeremy Corbyn goes, he will do what the EU wants. If Johnson himself goes, he will get a deal, he says. He says if MPs vote for a pointless delay to Brexit tomorrow, he will seek to hold an election. Tonight he is tabling a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. MPs have backed the motion to allow a debate on a bill tomorrow that would prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October by 328 votes to 301 - a majority of 27. John Bercow has sent the serjeant-at-arms to investigate the delay in the aye lobby. From Labour\u2019s Alex Sobel From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope From my colleague Jessica Elgot From Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury From Labour\u2019s Luke Pollard These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, moves a motion that the question be now put. MPs back the call by acclamation. John Bercow, the Speaker, moves to the main vote. He has just called the division, and voting has started. We should get the result in about 15 minutes. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Back in the debate Bob Neill, a Tory who voted remain in 2016, says he has rebelled over Brexit. He wants the UK to leave the EU with a deal. But he thinks this motion will make it harder for the PM to get a deal at the EU summit in October. He urges MPs to reject the motion. Here are some pictures from the protests outside the Houses of Parliament. A spokesman for the Irish government said it had been briefed on Tuesday evening on the latest Brexit negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom. As PA Media reports, the spokesman said Ireland \u201cnoted the increasing risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October\u201d. In a statement issued to the media, the Irish government said it had agreed that no-deal Brexit planning would continue to get \u201ctop priority\u201d across all government department and agencies. This is from the SNP MP Gavin Newlands on Jacob Rees-Mogg. From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman If the rebellion is that size, it is hard to see how the government could win. The Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake says he has asked colleagues in the European parliament if there is any evidence that the UK is putting forward alternative plans for the backstop. He says he has been told that there has been \u201ctotal radio silence\u201d from the UK with regard to the Brexit negotiation. He urges MPs to support the motion. The Tory MP Bob Seely says he is against this motion because it provides an opportunity for another extension. He says he wants a deal. But he also thinks the country needs to bring this matter to a conclusion. Back in the debate the Green MP Caroline Lucas criticises the \u201cferal, out of control executive\u201d. And she also criticises Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s body language. (See 9.23pm.) She says his stance shows his contempt for parliament. \u201cSit up,\u201d some MPs shout. These are from the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson. MPs are not supposed to take photographs of each other in the chamber, but you can see why Labour\u2019s Anna Turley could not resist this shot. MPs sometimes lean back like that in the chamber because there are speakers embedded in those benches at the top, and if they are having difficulty hearing the debate, having your ear to the cushion can help. Obviously, Turley has an alternative explanation for Rees-Mogg\u2019s posture ... Antoinette Sandbach, one of the Tory rebels, is speaking now. She says if Boris Johnson is allowed to shut down parliament to reduce the chances of MPs stopping a no-deal Brexit, there will be nothing to stop another prime minister doing this again. Labour\u2019s Gordon Marsden says there is no evidence, \u201cnot a sniff\u201d, that the government has presented Brexit plans to the EU. He says Boris Johnson is a \u201cpetulant man-child unable to get his way with this house\u201d and that is why he wants to shut down parliament. That is why MPs must vote for this motion, he says. In the debate Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Tory Brexiter, is speaking now. He says this situation partly reflects various constitutional changes. One is the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. This has strengthened the position of the PM, as was intended when it was passed by the coalition. But this means the Commons can now wound a PM without bringing them down. And the other factor is the increased use of referendums. That has created a problem of competing legitimacies, he says. It is not clear what is most legitimate, he says \u2013 the representative or the direct mandate? This is from Antonello Guerrera, a corespondent for the Italian paper, La Repubblica. This sounds like a reference to a briefing similar to the one reported by RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly earlier. (See 5.51pm.) Dominic Grieve, a Tory rebel and the former attorney general, says he does not know what the \u201cwill of the people\u201d means now. He says it is not clear what the public want. That is why he thinks there must be a referendum, he says. He says he is alarmed by the way people who make this argument are now accused of being traitors. And he says he was surprised when Jacob Rees-Mogg argued that passing the Benn bill could interrupt the great set pieces that follow the Queen\u2019s speech. (See 7.40pm.) Grieve says, as a Conservative, he likes the set pieces that follow the Queen\u2019s speech. But his constituents know that averting the damage a no-deal Brexit would cause is more important. He also criticises Rees-Mogg for the way he criticised Oliver Letwin. (See 7.38pm.) He says Letwin spent more months in high office than the number of days Rees-Mogg has spent in his. Anna Soubry, the former Tory MP who is now leader of the Independent Group for Change, urges MPs to back the motion. She says it is not just about the future of the country, it is about self-respect too. She says MPs need to be able to look themselves in the mirror, and tell their grandchildren they have done the right thing. Liam Fox, the former international trade secretary, is speaking now. He says MPs must honour the result of the referendum. He says this motion would turn the UK into supplicants in relation to the EU. He says MPs would create a \u201ccoalition of chaos\u201d if they back this plan. And he says a senior French minister told him that it was important for the UK to honour the referendum result. He told Fox that France\u2019s current political problems, which saw the collapse of the traditional parties, started when the French government failed to honour the spirit of the French vote against the European constitution. In the Commons Nick Boles, the former Tory who now sits as an independent, is speaking. He recalls the day he woke up in hospital in 2017, where he was being treated for cancer, and got ready to go to the Commons to vote for article 50 to be triggered. His blood cell count was low, and there was a high chance of infection, he says. But he was driven to the Commons to vote because he believed the referendum vote should be respected. He says he has voted for a Brexit deal. But what he will not do is accept a no-deal Brexit. He says taking this stand lost him the support of his local Tory association, and led to him leaving the party. But he has no regrets. He has put what is right for the country ahead of his self-interest. How many members of the cabinet can say the same? He says he is the only MP in parliament sitting as an independent progressive conservative. But he urges other MPs to join him so that they can provide a new force in parliament. At the moment, I am the only independent progressive Conservative in parliament. To those brave souls on the Conservative benches who face expulsion from the party for voting for the motion today, I say this: your country needs you. Do what you know to be right. Join me on these benches and, together, let us build a new force in British politics and a true home in parliament for those who believe in one nation. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has just told Sky News that Labour is desperate to hold a general election. But, asked if Labour would support a vote for a general election tomorrow, she says the party might abstain, or vote against. She says the party wants to see the bill ruling out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October passed first. Under the Letwin plan, the bill could become law on Monday. No 10 has been saying that, if the government loses the vote tonight, Boris Johnson will push for a vote on an early election tomorrow. But without Labour\u2019s support he will not get the two-thirds majority required under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for the vote to be operable. Clarke says the obvious compromise is a soft Brexit, that would keep the economic relationship with the EU (ie single market membership). He says people say this amounts to disrespecting the referendum result. But he says he has voted for Brexit three times. He voted for a deal that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, now derides. Back in the Commons Ken Clarke, the Tory former chancellor who is now the father of the house (the longest-serving MP) is speaking. He says parliament has voted against no deal. But Boris Johnson has put himself into the situation where he has to have no deal. If parliament allows itself to be sidelined, the impact this would have on what future governments might do would be \u201chorrendous\u201d. Clarke says allowing Johnson to implement a no-deal Brexit against the wishes of parliament would set a \u201chorrendous\u201d precedent for the future. He mocks Jacob Rees-Mogg for what he said about a WTO Brexit being acceptable. (See 9.25pm.) He says no doubt the North Koreans thrive on such a regime. The only other countries trading just on WTO terms are Algeria and Serbia, he says. He says he admires Rees-Mogg\u2019s ability to keep a straight face when he was making this argument. Jared O\u2019Mara has postponed his plan to resign from the Commons, PA Media reports. The Sheffield Hallam MP, 37, announced his decision in July to step down after a series of problems which saw him suspended from the parliamentary Labour party and then resign from the party. MPs cannot simply resign. If they want to leave the Commons they have to apply to be appointed to one of two ancients stewardships, PA reports. A Treasury spokesman said: Jared O\u2019Mara remains an MP after writing to the chancellor asking to postpone his appointment to an office of the Crown. Turning away from the debate for a moment, Steve Baker, the new chair of the European Research Group, has given an interesting briefing to journalists. During the leadership election Boris Johnson ruled out an election pact with the Brexit party. But Baker, after a meeting of the ERG where he took over as chair from Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the Tories would need to reach an arrangement with Nigel Farage\u2019s party to win a general election before Brexit. Baker said: What\u2019s very clear to me is if we have an election before we have left the European Union, and the Brexit party think that we are heading in a direction which does not deliver our independence from the EU, then they will stand candidates virtually everywhere. And the result will be as per Peterborough and in Wales - they will result in a Lib/Lab Remain coalition and we will lose Brexit, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve said we need to have some sort of accommodation with them but we are not quite at that bridge yet. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, is speaking now. He accuses Boris Johnson of acting like a dictator. And he says the Conservative party is now acting like a cult. Rees-Mogg says the public gave MPs an instruction. He says if the bill passes tomorrow, MPs will either have to accept the backstop, accept endless Brexit delays or revoke article 50 altogether. He says today\u2019s motion is \u201cthe most unconstitutional use of this house since the days of Charles Stewart Parnell, when he tried to bung up parliament\u201d. He quotes AV Dicey, the Victorian jurist, saying that political conventions are there to ensure that the will of the people gets enacted. Parliament should accept the will of the nation, he says. The approach taken today is the most unconstitutional use of this house since the days of Charles Stewart Parnell when he tried to bung up parliament. Usurping the executive\u2019s right is unconstitutional, the use of emergency debates to do so is unconstitutional and the bill itself is yet more unconstitutional Sovereignty comes from the people to parliament, it does not come to parliament out of a void. If parliament tries to challenge the people, this stretches the elastic of our constitution near to breaking point. We should recognise that the people are our masters and show us to be their lieges and servants, not to place ourselves in the position of their overlords. As we come to vote today, I hope all members will contemplate the current constitutional confusion and consider the chaos this concatenation of circumstances could create. Rees-Mogg ends by urging MPs to \u201cconsider the chaos this concatenation of circumstances could create\u201d. Rees-Mogg says the bill involves a deliberate attempt to allow an extension long enough to allow a second piece of legislation, or to allow Brexit to be revoked. He says this procedure could be used again to have a further Brexit delay. This would create a marionette government, he says. Rees-Mogg says the bill will not deliver certainty on Brexit. It is nothing but \u201clegislative legerdemain\u201d, he says. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, and the principal sponsor of the bill to be debated tomorrow if this motion passes, asks how he can say there is anything wrong with this procedure given that the Speaker has approved it. Rees-Mogg says there is a difference between irregular and improper. This procedure might not be improper, but it is irregular, he says. Here is the Labour MP Liz Kendall on Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s performance. Rees-Mogg says parliamentary rules (the ones he has accuses John Bercow of subverting) are there to protect people from tyranny. He says there is a tried and tested means of removing an unpopular government - a confidence vote. But Labour has not tabled one, because it is afraid of losing, he claims. It is not, however, for parliament to undertake the role and functions of the executive. Constitutional convention is that executive power is exercised by Her Majesty\u2019s government which has the democratic mandate to govern. That mandate is derived from the British people and represented through this House. When we look at this constitution we are protected by our rules and our orders and by our conventions ... It is those rules, those laws, those conventions that protect us from the winds of tyranny. Protesters chanting \u201cstop the coup\u201d have begun marching past the Houses of Parliament, the Press Association is reporting. Purple, red and green smoke was released at the front of the column of demonstrators who are blocking the road from Parliament Square leading up to College Green in Westminster. Rees-Mogg turns to the detail of the bill. He says the provisions that would allow another similar bill to be debated on day two of the next session of parliament, if this one does not pass the Lords, would interrupt the Queen\u2019s speech. The SNP\u2019s David Linden asks for an assurance that, if the bill passes the Commons and the Lords, the government will not try to stop it getting royal assent. Rees-Mogg says the government will follow the law. The law will be followed. This country is a country that follows the rule of law and its Government assiduously follows constitutional conventions, unlike some other members of this house. Rees-Mogg accuses Letwin of \u201cstunning arrogance\u201d. He says Letwin has misunderstood parliament. Its authority comes from the people, he argues (which is why he says it should not be challenging the referendum result). John Bercow, the Speaker, intervenes. He says he is satisfied that his judgment is correct. Although SO24 motions are normally in neutral terms, he says the SO24 procedure has been used for what he would call more \u201cevaluative motions\u201d. He cites a debate on 18 March 2013 (a debate on plans for a royal charter on press conduct) and a debate on 11 December 2018 (a debate on Theresa May shelving the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d). Both of these took place under SO24. Bercow says all he is doing is allowing parliament to debate an important issue. He insists that he will not be thrown off course, and he ends his peroration on this by quoting Boris Johnson, saying he will carry on \u201cdo or die\u201d. I have taken advice of a professional kind and I\u2019m entirely satisfied that the judgment I have made is consistent with that advice. My attitude is simply to seek to facilitate the house ... I have sought to exercise my judgment in discharging my responsibility to facilitate the House of Commons, to facilitate the legislature. I have done it, I am doing it and I will do it to the best of my ability without fear or favour - to coin a phrase, come what may, do or die. Rees-Mogg turns to the point about the Speaker\u2019s decision to allow this debate. He says he is not challenging John Bercow\u2019s impartiality. But impartiality is not the same as infallibility, he says. Dominic Grieve, a Tory rebel, intervenes. He says Rees-Mogg talked about the need for parliament to scrutinise the executive. Yet the government is proroguing parliament for longer than needed. He says the government has also not always been honest, as when it said Operation Yellowhammer was a document produced by the old government. And the government has not been honest about the reasons for prorogation, he says. When these issues are considered together, you can see why people do not trust the government, Grieve says. Rees-Mogg says Grieve is wrong. He says the decision to prorogue was routine. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, intervenes. He challenges Rees-Mogg\u2019s claim that it would be acceptable for the UK to have to follow WTO rules. That would involve high tariffs. And it would require a hard border in Ireland. He says he cannot see why Rees-Mogg thinks that would not damage the economy. Rees-Mogg says he is surprised Clarke is surprised by what he said. He has been making the case for WTO rules for some time, he says. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, is speaking for the government. He says people voted to leave the EU. MPs must respect that decision. He says today\u2019s procedure is constitutionally irregular. (He is referring to the fact that John Bercow, the Speaker, is allowing an SO24 emergency debate to pass a motion giving MPs control of the order paper tomorrow. In the past they have always been used for neutral motions with no practical effect. Earlier this year Bercow indicated that he was willing to allow the procedure to be used more creatively than it was in the past.) He says this motion risks subverting parliament\u2019s role in scrutinising the executive. Corbyn says he understands that MPs have some concerns about the Benn bill being debated tomorrow - that it is seen as trying to reverse Brexit. But that is not the case, he says. He says this bill is just about providing \u201cvital breathing space\u201d to allow MPs to find a way through this mess. He says if MPs do not back this motion, they may not get another chance. Whether people voted leave or remain, they did not vote to shut down democracy. He says he urges MPs to do what they think is right for their constituencies. As the debate goes on I will be updating some earlier posts to include direct quotes from MPs where the original post just featured reported speech. To get the updates to appear, you may need to refresh the page. Corbyn says it is wrong to say that blocking a no-deal Brexit will hold up momentum towards a Brexit deal - because there is no momentum towards such a deal. Jeremy Corbyn is now speaking for Labour. He says this is the last chance MPs will have to stop a no-deal Brexit. He says he understands that the mood is volatile. But if MPs want to stop a no-deal Brexit, they have to act now. He says MPs have faced bullying from their own side. But he says he has some words of encouragement: standing by your principles does not always damage your career prospects, he says. (Corbyn is talking about himself, he says. He became Labour leader in 2015, when no one would have predicted that even six months earlier, after a lifetime of principled opposition to many things done by governments of both parties.) Letwin says the motion today is just about allowing time for MPs to debate the bill tomorrow designed to stop a no-deal Brexit by 31 October. He says it will be hard for the government to get a deal by 31 January \u2013 the deadline for an extension set out in the Benn bill. But he says there is no chance of the government getting a deal by 31 October. It\u2019s to provide the government with the time to seek to solve this problem and to enable parliament to help to resolve an issue which has proved very difficult. I don\u2019t say it\u2019s easy to do by 31 January, but I\u2019m sure that it will not be done by 31 October. We are between a rock and a hard place, and in this instance the hard place is better than the rock. It is as simple as that. It\u2019s decision time If honourable members across the house want to prevent a no-deal exit on 31 October they will have the opportunity to do so if, but only if, they vote for this motion this evening. I hope they will do so. Letwin says he has proposed his plan because of four facts. First, the government has not come up with a plan for a Brexit deal, he says. Over the last six weeks the government has not produced a single indication of any viable proposal to replace the backstop by any alternative likely to prove acceptable to the EU. The likelihood of the government reaching a deal at the council meeting on October 17 and 18 on the terms the government itself has set is accordingly slight. Second, he says this week is the last chance MPs will have to block a no deal Brexit. Third, he says the government has said it is willing to go ahead with no-deal. And, fourth, he says a no-deal would be a serious threat to the country. He says Boris Johnson is like someone standing on one side of a canyon shouting to people on the other side that, if they do not do as he says, he will jump off. MPs are now starting the SO24 debate. Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, is moving the motion that he has tabled. See 12.24pm for an explanation of what it says. George Osborne, the Evening Standard editor and former Tory chancellor, says Nicholas Soames is following in the footsteps of his grandfather. But Churchill never was deselected by the Tories. He did, however, do a Phillip Lee and join the Liberals before the first world war. Chris Philp is now proposing his 10-minute rule bill on clean air. It probably won\u2019t take a full 10 minutes. Bone rises to make a point of order. He complains that Letwin did not follow the right procedure. Bercow tells him that Letwin did lodge his application properly. Letwin does not use his full three minutes. It is more like 30 seconds. He says this is an urgent matter, and MPs should debate it. Bercow says it is a proper matter for an emergency debate. He asks if Letwin has the support of the house for MPs. Some MPs shout \u201cno\u201d, but more than 40 MPs stand up to indicate their assent (the procedure required) and so Bercow allows the debate. He says Peter Bone was the MP shouting no. And he says more than 40 MPs were standing up. Bercow says the debate will start after the forthcoming 10-minute rule bill, and that will last for three hours, or finish at 10pm if it is still going on then. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he will now take the application for the SO24 debate. That means Sir Oliver Letwin gets three minutes to make a speech explaining why MPs must debate this. From my colleague Jessica Elgot This is from Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary. And it has attracted this response from Sir Nicholas Soames, who has confirmed that he will be voting with the rebels. This means, of course, that Boris Johnson will end up effectively deselecting Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh Here is the official Downing Street text of Boris Johnson\u2019s G7 statement. I normally write \u201cfull text\u201d here, but this is not the full text because there several passages where what the civil service call \u201cpolitical content\u201d (party political material \u2013 mostly anti Labour) has been removed. But journalists have been sent the entire text. It will appear on Hansard online later but, for the record, here is Johnson\u2019s peroration \u2013 where he claimed the Benn bill should be seen as \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d. Johnson said: Yesterday a bill was published \u2013 a bill that the leader of the opposition has spent all summer working on. This is not a bill in any normal sense of the word. It is without precedent in our history \u2013 it is a bill that, if passed, would force me to go to Brussels and beg an extension. It would force me to accept any terms offered. It would destroy any chance of negotiations or a new deal. And indeed it would enable our friends in Brussels to dictate the terms of the negotiation, that is what it does. There is only one way to describe this bill \u2013 it is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill. It means running up the white flag. I want to make clear to everybody in this house \u2013 there are no circumstances in which I will ever accept anything like it. I will never surrender the control of the negotiations in the way the leader of the opposition is demanding. We promised the people we would get Brexit done. We promised to respect the result of the referendum and we must do so now. Enough is enough. This country wants this done. They want the referendum respected. We are negotiating a deal and though I am confident of getting a deal we will leave on 31 October in all circumstances. There will be no further pointless delay. This house has never before voted to force the prime minister to surrender such a crucial decision to the discretion of our friends and neighbours overseas. What is this bill would mean is that unless we agree to the terms of our friends and partners they would be able to keep us in the EU for as long as they want and on their terms. I urge therefore this house to reject this bill tonight so that we can get the right deal for our country, deliver Brexit and take the whole country forward. Steve Baker, a leading Tory Brexiter, has confirmed that he has replaced Jacob Rees-Mogg as chair of the European Research Group, which represents those Tories most in favour of a harder Brexit. Baker was chair before being made a Brexit minister in 2017. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston In the Commons the Michael Gove statement is now over and MPs are now on the Gavin Williamson education spending statement. At this pace, there is a good chance that they will get going on the SO24 motion and the no-deal Brexit debate by around 6.30pm, which would mean the voting would start at around 9.30pm. If the SO24 motion gets passed by the Commons later, MPs will get the chance to pass all stages of the Benn bill tomorrow. It will then go to the House of Lords. Normally there are no time limits on debates in the Lords. Peers do not use programme motions, which are used in the Commons to curtail debates so that bills complete all their stages by a particular time. This led to fears that pro-Brexit peers might filibuster the bill, so that it fails to clear the Lords before prorogation. But Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, has tabled a motion to be debated tomorrow that would ensure that all stages of the Benn bill must be completed by 5pm on Friday. There had been talk of peers sitting over the weekend to deal with the bill, but this motion would kill off that prospect. The Benn bill would then go back to the Commons on Monday, when MPs would debate any Lords amendment. The Smith motion has the support of the Lib Dems, which means it is very likely to get through because there is no Conservative majority in the Lords. Commenting on her plan, Smith said: Should MPs agree to the proposed bill, it would be completely unacceptable for the government to try and use its peers to scupper that legislation. In fact, it would go against a key constitutional principle of the primacy of the elected House of Commons \u2013 the House of Lords does not block laws agreed by MPs. My business motion invites peers to debate and discuss the bill in an orderly way, including an additional sitting this Friday, to allow full consideration of the proposals before next week\u2019s scheduled prorogation of parliament. These are from Tony Connelly, RTE\u2019s Europe editor. The most striking quote is in the final tweet. This is what an EU source told Connelly about the UK\u2019s plan for an alternative to the backstop: Nothing has been put on the table, not even a proper sketch or hint of a plan. We\u2019re waiting. But for the moment there is zilch. A government spokesman has said that it is not just Tory MPs who vote with the opposition on the SO24 motion this evening, enabling the bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, who will lose the Tory whip, meaning they should be prevented from standing for the party at the general election; those who abstain will lose the whip too, the spokesman said. He explained: The prime minister would not expect people who have voted to take power away from this government and to hand it to the opposition, to be a Conservative candidate or a Conservative MP. Boris Johnson is to visit Dublin to meet Leo Varadkar on Monday, the Irish government has confirmed. A spokesman said that while Brexit would be on the agenda, the talks would not amount to negotiations on the backstop. \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate bilaterally,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe government has consistently stressed that negotiations on Brexit take place between the UK and the EU27, for which Michel Barnier speaks.\u201d The meeting comes weeks after Johnson was accused of snubbing the taoiseach by not including him in the first round of phone calls to foreign premiers after he became prime minister. In his response to Trickett, Gove criticised Labour for backing the SO24 motion. Referring to Geoffrey Howe\u2019s quote in the speech he gave after he resigned from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet, Gove says people sometime talk about the team captain breaking someone\u2019s bat before they go out to face the bowling. Gove says that Labour\u2019s approach would be so damaging to the government\u2019s strategy that it would amount to \u201cblowing up the whole pavilion\u201d. Responding to Gove for Labour, Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, says the government should publish the Operation Yellowhammer document so that people can see how damaging the government thinks a no-deal Brexit would be. Yesterday a story in the Financial Times (paywall) said that Gove had been planning to publish the document today, but that he had dropped the idea because it was too negative. Here is an extract from George Parker\u2019s story. Mr Gove, minister for no-deal planning, had been expected to publish extracts of the document on Tuesday as part of his efforts to prepare the UK for the possibility of Brexit taking place without an agreement on 31 October. Government officials worked throughout the weekend overhauling the Operation Yellowhammer document, and Mr Gove had hoped to use the work to prove that he had a grip on potential no-deal problems. But, on Monday, Mr Gove and fellow cabinet ministers decided to abandon Tuesday\u2019s publication of the document. \u201cThe meeting didn\u2019t go well,\u201d said one person close to the meeting. \u201cThe whole thing was seen as far too pessimistic about no deal.\u201d Gove concludes by saying a no-deal Brexit would pose undoubted risks and real challenges for the UK. But he says there would also be opportunities. Michael Gove is now making a Commons statement about planning for a no-deal Brexit. He says a no-deal Brexit would present difficulties, but he says people can prepare for them. He says the Operation Yellowhammer plan sets out a \u201creasonable worst-case scenario\u201d for what might happen. It is not a prediction, he says. He says today the government is announcing an extra \u00a320m of spending to ensure that traffic can flow freely in Kent in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He urges EU states to reciprocate the assurances that the UK has given for EU nationals living in the UK in the event of no deal. Boris Johnson\u2019s statement is now over. Unusually, John Bercow wrapped it up while some MPs still wanted to ask questions. That means we are running slightly ahead of the timetable I anticipated earlier. (See 2.30pm.) Here are some comments from journalists on how Boris Johnson is performing in this statement. From my colleague Jonathan Freedland From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From my colleague Peter Walker From my colleague John Crace Johnson says he expects the final deal to be agreed at the EU summit starting on Thursday 17 October. Jeremy Lefroy, a Conservative, asks if MPs will be able to pass all the required legislation between that summit and 31 October. Johnson says that is what the government is planning. He offers to ensure Lefroy gets a briefing on how this would happen. The Conservative Huw Merriman says if the Tories are going to remove the whip from MPs who rebel tonight, will Johnson also remove the whip from any MPs who do not back any deal he does bring back to the Commons. (Some of the hardline Brexiters in the European Research Group say, even with the removal of the backstop, they would still find the Brexit deal unacceptable.) Johnson confirms this would happen. \u201cWhat\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,\u201d he says. Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern asks Johnson if he has seen the comment from Gavin Barwell, Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff, about the Brexit negotiation being a sham. If it is not a sham, will Johnson publish his backstop plans? McGovern is referring to this tweet. Johnson says he thinks he has said enough on this. He says voting for the SO24 motion tonight will harm the chances of the government getting a deal. Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall asks if Johnson will abide by the law if parliament passes legislation requiring him to request an article 50 extension. Johnson says he will obey the law. But he says this provision would be a mistake. Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips says she has joined one of the legal challenges to the prorogation case because she does not want MPs not to have the chance to debate the domestic violence bill. Is it true senior civil servants refused to sign witness statements for this case? Johnson says the proper processes were gone through. Domestic violence will receive proper consideration in the Queen\u2019s speech, he says. Steve Brine, a Conservative, tells Johnson that it is wrong to say that all MPs opposed to no deal are opposed to Brexit. Does Johnson accept that? Johnson dodges the question, but says people used to say the EU would not alter the backstop. Now it is accepting it could change. Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman says his daughter used to work as a special adviser for a Labour minister. Will Johnson condemn the way Sonia Khan was sacked by Dominic Cummings as a special adviser? Johnson says he will not comment on personnel matters. Anna Soubry, the Independent Group for Change leader, also asks about the Telegraph story, and asks if it is true that Johnson rang the Telegraph editor to complain about it. Johnson again refuses to comment on the story. But he says he has not had any conversation today with any journalist about this matter. David Gauke, the former justice secretary and a Tory rebel, asks Johnson to confirm two claims in the Daily Telegraph story today (paywall). One was that David Frost, his Europe adviser, told a cabinet committee in August \u201cof the decision to \u2018run down the clock\u2019 [in the Brexit talks] and keep up the appearance of activity, which he said was \u2018important for both process and domestic handling reasons\u2019.\u201d The other claim was that Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, said at a subsequent cabinet committee meeting that it was a \u201ccomplete fantasy\u201d to think the EU would drop the backstop. Johnson says he cannot comment on leaks. Here is video of Phillip Lee crossing the floor in the Commons. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, asks Johnson to agree that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic. Johnson says he does not agree. He says there will be \u201cbumps on the road\u201d, but the UK is a great country and it can get this down. The alternative plan, backed by Jeremy Corbyn, would force the UK to accept whatever is offered by the EU, he says. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle asks if Johnson will obey any law passed by parliament on a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says the government will, of course, uphold the constitution and \u201cobey the law\u201d. However, he said earlier he would not accept what was being proposed in the legislation. (See 3.50pm.) Responding to the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds, Johnson says he believes they can get rid of the backstop. \u201cHow?\u201d MPs shout. Johnson says the shouting shows MPs do not want to get rid of it. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, says it is not just Angela Merkel saying the UK has not put forward any plans. The Irish deputy PM, Simon Coveney, said recently the UK had not put forward any plans. He asks Johnson to confirm the Daily Telegraph report saying Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, told him the government was heading for no deal. He is an extract from the Telegraph\u2019s story (paywall). At a follow-up meeting on 1 August to discuss what the strategy would mean in practice, Mr Johnson insisted again the entire backstop must go, but he was confronted by Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, who argued for potential compromises on the backstop that might be negotiable with the EU, \u2013 such as a time-limit or a unilateral exit clause \u2013 but the options were ruled out by the prime minister. Sources say Mr Cox told Mr Johnson it was a \u201ccomplete fantasy\u201d to think the EU would drop the backstop, before quickly professing his loyalty \u2013 and issuing a clear warning. \u201cI will stand with you but you should know this is the path to no deal,\u201d he told him. Johnson ignores the question about Cox, but says that MPs who vote for the SO24 motion tonight will be undermining the chances of a deal. Philip Hammond, the Tory former chancellor, says Angela Merkel said on Friday that, nine days into the 30 days set aside for a new deal, she had yet to see any new proposals from the UK. Will Johnson publish any ideas he has? Johnson says the UK will be able to get a deal within 30 days. But he says that cannot happen while parliament is threatening to block no deal. He says the first thing EU leaders ask is, \u2018Will this get through parliament?\u201d Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, welcomes Phillip Lee to her party and says doctors like Lee tell her Brexit will harm the NHS. Johnson says this government has hired 700 more doctors. The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, says Johnson may claim not to want an election. But the SNP do want one, he says. Here is the full statement from Phillip Lee explaining his defection to the Lib Dems. After a great deal of thought, I have reached the conclusion that it is not possible to serve my constituents\u2019 and country\u2019s best interests as a Conservative member of parliament. Over 27 years ago I joined the Conservative &amp; Unionist party led by Sir John Major. Since 2010, I have had the privilege of representing the Bracknell constituency. The party I joined in 1992 is not the party I am leaving today. This Conservative government is aggressively pursuing a damaging Brexit in unprincipled ways. It is putting lives and livelihoods at risk unnecessarily and it is wantonly endangering the integrity of the United Kingdom. More widely, it is undermining our country\u2019s economy, democracy and role in the world. It is using political manipulation, bullying and lies. And it is doing these things in a deliberate and considered way. It has gone so far beyond reckless as to cease to be conservative. I am dismayed at what the Conservative party has become, the role that it has played in feeding division and populism, in squandering a hard-won reputation for sound stewardship, and the blinkered direction in which it has set our country. Those are not my values. I will not implicitly condone these things by being party to them. Make no mistake: this is a time of reckoning. The challenges that our world and country face are real \u2013 but not insurmountable. We need to root how we address them in evidence and reality. Critically, we need to recognise that we will not solve climate change, counter extremism, or address our housing, health and social care needs alone. We must work with others. The opportunities to leave a better legacy are also significant. As a united country, we need to mobilise all our innovation, creativity, power and talent \u2013 not bury it under a Brexit that does not have the British people\u2019s informed consent. As a society, we need to rediscover the liberal and democratic traditions that made our country great. We should be guided by the values of justice, liberty and community. We must recognise our responsibilities to our people and planet: we are stewards of our country\u2019s and our world\u2019s limited resources. Each generation needs to define democracy for itself and so we each have a part in shaping what we want our politics and our country to stand for. Each of us must stand and be counted. That is why today I am joining Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats. I believe the Liberal Democrats are best placed to build the unifying and inspiring political force needed to heal our divisions, unleash our talents, equip us to take the opportunities and overcome the challenges that we face as a society - and leave our country and our world in a better place for the next generations. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says Johnson\u2019s strategy is obvious. He wants to set impossible conditions, attach as much blame as possible to the EU for the failure to get a deal, and then hold an election as quickly as possible, before the disadvantages of no deal become apparent. Is that correct? And can he confirm that, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will be much harder to get new deals. And any new deal with the EU will not replicate the advantages of the single market that Conservative governments helped to create. Johnson says he has long been a fan of Clarke\u2019s. He was the only member of the 2001 intake to vote for Clarke in the Tory leadership contest that year, he says. He says the best way to get a deal is to vote down the motion tonight. Johnson is responding to Corbyn. He says Corbyn was, and still is, a Bennite. (Tony, not Hilary, Johnson means.) He says Corbyn is supporting protests on the streets. Corbyn ended by saying that Boris Johnson\u2019s government had \u201cno mandate, no morals and, as of today, no majority\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is responding now. He says Boris Johnson claims to be making progress. But EU leaders say that is not the case. He says the Conservative party\u2019s in-house journal, the Daily Telegraph, reports today that the government views its renegotiation as a sham. (See 11.57am.) He asks Johnson to say when the government will publish its internal planning document about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. Some Tories are putting their careers ahead of the national interest, he says. He refers to the leadership candidates who ruled out proroguing parliament, but who have now accepted that as an option. And they are even refusing to commit to obeying laws passed by parliament. Can Johnson confirm he will obey any new law? Corbyn says the attack on democracy is unconstitutional. He condemns the rhetoric used by Johnson when he referred to a surrender bill. We are not surrendering because we are not at war with Europe. They are our partners. Corbyn condemns Johnson for using \u2018surrender bill\u2019 jibe, saying UK is not at war with EU. Johnson ends by urging MPs to reject the bill. John Bercow, the Speaker, points out that there is no vote on a bill tonight. There will just be a vote on a mechanism to allow the vote to go ahead. (He seems to be acknowledging that he will accept the request for the SO24 debate.) Johnson says never before has the Commons forced a PM to accept a bill like this. It would allow the EU to keep the UK in the EU on its own terms. Johnson says the UK will be ready for a no-deal Brexit. But he wants to return from the EU summit with a deal, he says. However, one thing would jeopardise the chances of this - MPs passing the bill to rule out no deal, and to force the UK to \u201cbeg\u201d for a delay. He says Jeremy Corbyn has spent all summer working on this bill. It is a bill without precedent, he says. It would force him to go to Brussels and beg for an extension, and it would force him to accept the terms offered, he says. He says this is \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d. It means \u201crunning up the white flag\u201d. There are no circumstances in which I will every accept anything like it. Johnson says that practical alternatives to the backstop are available. He confirms that he will meet Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, in Dublin on Monday. It is not true to say that the government is not making progress towards a deal, he says. In the Commons Boris Johnson is still making his statement. He says he thinks over the last few weeks the chances of a Brexit deal have risen. Boris Johnson claims chances of Brexit deal have risen. UPDATED: Originally this post said Johnson did not allude to Phillip Lee\u2019s defection. But I\u2019ve taken that line out, because Johnson briefly referred to it, saying he wished Lee all the best. Here is the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson on Phillip Lee\u2019s defection. I am delighted to welcome Phillip to the Liberal Democrats at this crucial time. He brings almost 10 years of parliamentary experience and decades of professional expertise. He shares our commitment to prevent a disastrous no-deal Brexit, and to stop Brexit altogether. The Liberal Democrats are growing. Phillip follows both Chuka Umunna MP and Sarah Wollaston MP in bravely crossing the floor to join us. Today, we also welcome Jane Dodds MP to parliament, following her recent victory in Brecon and Radnorshire. And these representatives join over 30,000 new members, who have joined the Liberal Democrats since our best ever results in the European elections in May. The Tory Phillip Lee has just issued this statement about his defection to the Lib Dems. Over 27 years ago I joined the Conservative &amp; Unionist party led by Sir John Major. Since 2010 I have had the privilege of representing the Bracknell Constituency. The party I joined in 1992 is not the party I am leaving today. This Conservative government is aggressively pursuing a damaging Brexit in unprincipled ways. It is putting lives and livelihoods at risk unnecessarily and it is wantonly endangering the integrity of the United Kingdom. More widely, it is undermining our country\u2019s economy, democracy and role in the world. It is using political manipulation, bullying and lies. And it is doing these things in a deliberate and considered way. That is why today I am joining Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats. I believe the Liberal Democrats are best placed to build the unifying and inspiring political force needed to heal our divisions, unleash our talents, equip us to take the opportunities and overcome the challenges that we face as a society - and leave our country and our world in a better place for the next generations. This means that Boris Johnson has lost his majority. It looks as if the Tory MP Phillip Lee has defected to the Lib Dems. This is from Politics.co.uk\u2019s Ian Dunt. Boris Johnson starts by saying that today is the 80th anniversary of Britain\u2019s entry into world war two. He says MPs know that this country still stands for democracy and the rule of law. That prompts jeering from Labour, in the light of Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament to limit the amount of time available to MPs seeking to block a no-deal Brexit. He says he made the case for free trade at the G7 summit. He says the UK is on the verge of taking back control of its trade policy by taking its own seat at the WTO. He says he wants to do a comprehensive trade deal with the US. He says he and President Trump have agreed that the NHS will not be on the table for that deal. In the Commons the new Lib Dem MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, Jane Dodds, is just taking her seat. The supreme court has confirmed a provisional date of Tuesday 17 September for any appeal hearing in the multiple legal challenges against the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Judicial review cases have been launched separately in the lower courts in Edinburgh, Belfast and London alleging that the planned suspension of parliamentary business is illegal. If any appeals are made against the rulings of the court of session and high courts in the three cases they would be joined together for a combined hearing at the supreme court in London. It would be the first time the UK\u2019s highest court has sat for an emergency application outside its normal legal terms. Many justices are understood to be away on holiday. The supreme court does not normally start hearing cases until after the formal opening of the new legal year at the beginning of October. The article 50 Brexit case heard by the supreme court in 2016 involved 11 justices hearing the high-profile case. A similar, odd number - to avoid the danger of a draw - could sit on 17 September. Alistair Burt, the former Foreign Office minister and one of the Tories committed to voting with the opposition tonight on the motion enabling the Benn bill to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has announced that he will stand down at the next election. As ITV\u2019s Emma Hutchinson reports, Burt, 64, says he is leaving earlier than planned because he does not support Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy. Under Johnson\u2019s plan to deselect MPs who rebel tonight, he would probably have been forced out anyway. (Other Tory rebels are taking a different approach. This morning Philip Hammond said he might even go to court to ensure he can stand again as a Conservative party candidate. See 8.15am.) Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s de facto chief of staff, also got involved at the meeting where Boris Johnson hoped to win over some rebel Tories this morning, HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh reports. It sounds as though his intervention was not particularly helpful. And here is the statement that Jeremy Corbyn issued after his meeting with other opposition leaders this morning about whether to vote for an election and stopping a no-deal Brexit. (See 1.31pm and 2.35pm.) Following a productive meeting of cross-party MPs this morning, we are united in our opposition to Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for a no-deal. We are confident that the legislative route we have adopted has every chance of being successful, and we are working on ways in which we can prevent Boris Johnson manipulating an election to force a no-deal Brexit. Labour wants to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and to have a general election, so we can end austerity and invest in our communities. I am confident we can have both, and we\u2019ve been in discussions about a way to achieve this. We will continue to work across parliament towards this goal and will have further meetings to this end in coming days. And this is from my colleague Heather Stewart. From my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh has more on Boris Johnson\u2019s meeting with Philip Hammond and other rebels. (See 12.55pm.) From my colleague Jessica Elgot Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, issued this statement after his meeting with Jeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders at Westminster this morning. (See 1.31pm.) Blackford said: Today\u2019s cross-party meeting was another vital and productive step in working together to prevent this rogue Tory government from inflicting lasting harm with its extreme Brexit plans. The SNP\u2019s priority is to stop a catastrophic no-deal and that is why we have co-sponsored the cross-party bill designed to take that outcome off the table \u2013 an outcome parliament has already previously rejected. We will explore every avenue and parliamentary process open to us to stop that. However, while the SNP are ready and eager for a general election, Boris Johnson must not be allowed to use an election to force through no-deal. While the SNP has been at the forefront in standing up for Scotland\u2019s interests in Westminster, the 13 Scottish Tory MPs have been notably absent. With time running out \u2013 and with every vote pivotal \u2013 I urge the group of Scottish Tory MPs to work with us in safeguarding Scotland\u2019s economic and social interests. Here is the timetable for events in the Commons this afternoon. After the first two entries, all the timings are provisional, for reasons explained below. 2.30pm: Dominic Raab takes Foreign Office questions. 3.30pm: Boris Johnson gives a statement on the G7. Commons statements normally run for about an hour, but John Bercow, the Speaker, likes to call all MPs who want to ask a question, and he regularly lets questions to the PM run for two hours or more. But assuming they wrap up after two hours, that takes us to ... 5.30pm?: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, gives a statement on no-deal Brexit preparations. 6.30pm?: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, gives a statement on education funding. 7.30pm?: Chris Philp moves a motion under the 10-minute rule for a bill on clean air. (Although called a 10-minute rule bill, the debate can last up to 20 minute, although normally these speeches last about five minutes.) 7.35pm?: Sir Oliver Letwin submits a request for an SO24 (standing order 24) emergency debate on a no-deal Brexit. After a very short speech, Bercow will either allow or disallow the debate. No one expects him to say no. 7.40pm?: MPs begin the debate on the SO24 motion. It can run for up to three hours, or until 10pm - whichever comes first. 10pm?: MPs vote on the motion. Pro- and anti-Brexit campaigners have been congregating outside the Houses of Parliament ahead of this evening\u2019s vote. Here are some pictures from the protests. This is from ITV\u2019s Joe Pike. Two Labour MPs, Jess Phillips and Alex Sobel, have formally joined the high court challenge being launched by Gina Miller in London on Thursday against the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Lawyers for the pair have lodged a claim with the court alleging that closing down parliament is an abuse of power and breaches the MPs\u2019 right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European convention on human rights. David Greene, senior partner at the law firm Edwin Coe who is representing them, said: The issues are of supreme constitutional importance. It is vital that those issues are fully developed in court. Our clients, who are members of parliament, seek naturally a political resolution in parliament to the question of whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal but believe that their entitlement as MPs to take a full part in that debate and decision is being unlawfully curtailed. They join the action to ensure that the voice of backbench MPs is heard in the question of whether the foundation of the proroguing of parliament is lawful. Philips said: When the prime minister took the decision to prorogue parliament it was a sad day for our democracy. Not only does he seek to gag parliament from its clear opposition to \u2018no deal\u2019 but he is throwing out pending legislation including the domestic violence bill. The bill is dedicated to addressing the issues faced by victims of violent crime, and those who provide the services that respond. And Sobel said: It is absolutely clear that the proroguing of parliament is a device to shut down the opposition to \u2018no deal\u2019. The intent of the prime minister to rob parliament of its constitutional rights is unlawful. As a member of parliament, I have been elected by the electorate to represent them but Boris Johnson now wants to take away from the electorate their rights that are part and parcel of our democracy by shutting me out of the constitutional decision making process in parliament. More on Boris Johnson\u2019s meeting with the Tory rebels. (See 12.55pm.) This is from ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, was one of the opposition leaders who met Jeremy Corbyn this morning to discuss tactics this week as they seek to rule out a no-deal Brexit. She has just told Sky News that she is confident that the opposition will be able to pass the Benn bill, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, by the end of this week. More significantly perhaps, she also implied the opposition parties have agreed not to vote for an early general election until the bill has become law. She said: We have to be very alert to the fact the the prime minister could be using an early general election as a way of bringing through a no-deal Brexit and to do what he really wants, which is to remain in power. We must be very alert to not accepting a general election on the terms of the prime minister which suits the prime minister and the prime minister alone ... We are very aware of the way that Boris Johnson will try to play the house. We are not going to be part of his game. And our priority is to stop no-deal Brexit. And the legislation is the way to do that. When asked if Corbyn backed this approach, she replied: \u201cWe were in agreement.\u201d Johnson cannot call an early election without opposition support. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the easiest way to get around the rule saying the next election should not take place until 2022 (five years after the last one) would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for an early election. That could not happen if opposition MPs voted against, or abstained. Alternatively, under the FTPA, the government could lose a vote of no confidence, and an election would take place if no alternative government won a confidence vote within 14 days. But Johnson would not want to tell his MPs to vote against him in a confidence motion because that could lead to someone else becoming prime minister. Those are the only two mechanisms under the FTPA that would allow an early election. Alternatively, the government could pass a new bill to amend the FTPA to allow an early election. But, given the size of Johnson\u2019s majority (one, including the DUP), this would probably only get through the Commons with opposition support. Boris Johnson held a meeting with some of the Tory rebels this morning. Those present included David Gauke, Philip Hammond, Greg Clark, Stephen Hammond, Nicholas Soames, Antoinette Sandbach, Margot James and Anne Milton, who left Downing Street without commenting to reporters. But there has been subsequent briefing. Here are some lines that have emerged. From my colleague Jessica Elgot From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott These are from my colleague Severin Carrell, who has been covering the legal challenge in Edinburgh to the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks from next week. Downing Street has described the Benn bill as a \u201cblueprint for legislative purgatory\u201d. The PM\u2019s spokesman said it would cost \u201cvast amounts\u201d, with roughly \u00a31bn a month paid to the EU for an extension, and was \u201cvery clearly in Brussels\u2019 interests not in the British interest\u201d. He said: The prime minister\u2019s mood is determined. He wants to get on with delivering on the result of the referendum and the UK leaving the EU on 31 October, ideally with a deal. We are opposed to the bill which is being brought forward because it is about crippling negotiations and chopping the legs out from under the UK position, and making any further negotiation impossible. Chris White, a former Tory adviser in the office of the chief whip and in the office of the leader of Commons, is impressed by the way the SO24 motion has been drafted. (See 11.49am and 12.24pm.) Here are some of the key points from the SO24 motion. (See 11.49am.) The motion would allow the opposition and rebel MPs to take charge of the Commons order paper tomorrow. But it would not necessarily stop PMQs or the spending review announcement going ahead because, under the terms of the motion, the debate on the Benn bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would not have to start until 3pm. Commons business starts at 11.30m, PMQs takes place at 12pm, and normally the spending review announcement would come at around 2pm. Normally it would last more than two hours. According to BuzzFeed\u2019s Emily Ashton, rather than accept a shortened timetable for the statement, the government might just announce it on paper. Under the plan the second reading debate on the Benn bill will would take place from 3pm until the second reading vote at 5pm. There would then be another two hours for amendments to be debated, with the third reading vote at 7pm. The motion ensures that, if the bill completes its passage through the Lords, the Commons has to make time for any Lords amendments to be debated, so that the bill can complete its passage through parliament. The motion says that, if the Commons and Lords both pass the bill, the Commons cannot be adjourned on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday next week until the Speaker has announced it has received royal assent. And it says, if the bill clears the Commons but not the Lords before parliament gets prorogued, a new version of the bill must be brought forward for debate on the second day of the new session of parliament, with the same fast-track procedures applying. Here are some important Brexit news lines from other publications and newspapers on Tuesday. Dominic Cummings considers the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations with the EU \u201ca sham\u201d, according to the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, Peter Foster. In private strategy meetings, Dominic Cummings, the feared Leave campaign strategist appointed as Mr Johnson\u2019s special political adviser, was frank, openly describing the EU negotiations as \u201ca sham\u201d, according to two sources. Both EU official and diplomatic sources say they are well aware they are being \u201cplayed\u201d by Downing Street, but are equally clear that the EU will always be careful not to be blamed for no deal. Both Labour and the Conservatives are set to lose seats if a general election is called, resulting in a hung parliament, according to the Huffington Post\u2019s Paul Waugh. Regression analysis on a new polling data found that the Tories would lose nearly all of their seats in Scotland to the SNP. ... of Conservative remainers who backed the party in 2017, 47% are now intending to vote for another party. A majority of these voters will now support the Liberal Democrats with the party set to gain seven seats from the Conservatives. The Tory party would keep only 77% of its supporters from the last election, with 18% going to the Brexit party or Ukip. The survey suggests that Jeremy Corbyn could suffer even more, with the net loss of 20 seats. Labour would lose 22% of its 2017 remain voters, many of them former Conservatives, to the Lib Dems and 25% of its 2017 leave voters to the Brexit party, it suggests. The European Union is considering using funds usually reserved for natural disasters to help member states cope with the fallout from a no-deal Brexit, according to the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp. Senior EU officials will discuss using cash in its Solidarity Fund to \u201cfurnish member states with financial assistance to cover heavy charges inflicted on them in the event the United Kingdom leaves without an accord\u201d. The fund was set up in 2002 to support EU national and regional governments that suffered \u201cmajor disasters\u201d after a devastating flood in central Europe. It has spent around \u00a34.5bn on some 80 \u201ccatastrophic events\u201d. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, has urged the prime minister not to sack conservative MPs who vote against the government on Brexit in a conversation with the Spectator\u2019s Katy Balls. I\u2019m really urging the government to think very carefully about taking such a dramatic step. I have made my views clear to the prime minister that we should not be a party that is trying to remove from our party two former chancellors, a number of ex-cabinet ministers \u2013 that the way to hold our party together and to get a deal is to bring them onside. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates, from the Number 10 lobby briefing. This is a response to the suggestion that Boris Johnson might agree to an election on 14 October, and then change the date after parliament has been dissolved so that the election takes place after a no-deal Brexit has happened on 31 October. Labour\u2019s Shami Chakrabarti raised this in her Today interview this morning. (See 10.01am.) Here is the full text (pdf) of the motion for the SO24 (standing order 24) debate that opposition and rebel Tory MPs hope to hold later today. This sets out the procedure that would allow them to take control of the Commons order paper to pass the Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. For the debate to go ahead, John Bercow, the Speaker, has to approve an application this afternoon. But no one is expecting him to say no. An autumn general election would be a \u201cfantastic opportunity\u201d for Scots to demand a second vote on independence, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader has said. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme, Ian Blackford said: We\u2019re faced with the issue that the people of Scotland are expressing in opinion polls that they want that referendum on independence. If there is a general election, there is a fantastic opportunity for the people of Scotland to send a very clear message to Westminster that we should be able to determine our own future. Here is the former Tory minister Sam Gyimah on why he will vote against the government today. In August 21 Conservatives, including Philip Hammond, signed a letter to Boris Johnson asking for assurances that he did not want to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. The list of signatories is a good guide as to how might rebel tonight. BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has been keeping a tally of how many Tories will actually vote against the government tonight. He has got 14 confirmed rebels, and another eight potential rebels who either have not decided who they will vote or won\u2019t say. His 14 confirmed rebels are: David Gauke, Rory Stewart, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Sir Oliver Letwin, Philip Hammond, Antoinette Sandbach, Alistair Burt, Richard Harrington, Guto Bebb, Caroline Nokes, Margot James, Sam Gyimah and Sir Nicholas Soames. My colleague Francis Perraudin has mini-profiles of the rebels here. Dominic Cummings, wearing his distinctive gilet and jeans combination, arrived early at Downing street on Tuesday at the start of a major day for the government. Keith Simpson, the MP for Broadland in Norfolk, has joined Justine Greening in announcing he will step down at the next general election. Simpson said on Radio Norfolk that he made the decision months ago but now feels like \u201cthe first officer to man the lifeboats on the Titanic\u201d. Dominic Grieve has told Sky News he thinks Boris Johnson will struggle to get two-thirds of MPs to vote for a general election, which he needs under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The former attorney general added that if the UK crashes out of the EU after 31 October, the government will spend the following weeks desperately trying to reach an agreement with the bloc. On a general election: I think that it [calling an election] is entirely dependent on Jeremy Corbyn. If he [Boris Johnson] wants to have a general election, he\u2019s got to get a two-thirds majority of the house to trigger it and really, that\u2019s entirely in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s gift. I personally have serious doubts that a general election is going to solve the issue. I think the risk is that we\u2019re going to end up with another hung parliament and no clarity of direction at all. I would prefer this matter to be resolved in a referendum. On the days following a no-deal Brexit: [If we crash out of the bloc] it\u2019s not going to be over, is it? The moment we leave the EU, every single sinew of the UK government machine will be dedicated to trying to do a deal, a trade deal with the EU from the outside. It is going to take up every week, month, day of our working lives for the next five to 10 years, and we\u2019re going to be negotiating from a position of maximum weakness and disadvantage. Here is more detail on what Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, told the Today programme earlier about Labour\u2019s stance on when it would and would not back an early general election. There has been some confusion over this because at one point yesterday Jeremy Corbyn said the party would back one under any circumstances. Then, later in the day, first the shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman (here), and then the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Tony Lloyd (here), said support for an early general election was conditional. Labour\u2019s stance is crucial because, although No 10 is saying Boris Johnson will go for an election on 14 October if he loses the vote tonight, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act an early election cannot happen without Labour\u2019s support. Chakrabarti tried to clear things up on the Today programme this morning. Some shadow ministers \u201cfreelance\u201d when they give media interviews (ie, they push their own views as much as the official party line), but Chakrabarti had good relations with Corbyn\u2019s office and is a reliable guide to the official line. This is what she said about when Labour would support an early election. So to clear it up, it\u2019s about sequencing ... What we need to ensure is that we get this legislation locked down. And that\u2019s quite hard, because remember, we\u2019ve got ministers who say that they\u2019ll ignore legislation. So that\u2019s another thing to consider. We\u2019ve got to get a locked-in guarantee that Britain would not crash out of the EU in an election campaign period. We\u2019ve also got to try as best as possible to ensure that it wouldn\u2019t be possible for the sitting, squatting, prime minister in this period to set the general election and then change the date. Chakrabarti said Corbyn would be meeting other opposition leaders in parliament this morning to discuss the matter further. When pressed on whether she was saying the election would have to take place after 31 October for Labour to support it (which was what Lloyd implied last night), she replied: We certainly need to make sure that Boris Johnson can\u2019t go in for the kind of shenanigans he\u2019s been going in for with his chums last week, where the date is perhaps moved so that you could crash out [of the EU] by default during this period of a campaign. Chakrabarti said Labour\u2019s priority was preventing a no-deal Brexit, But beyond that the party wanted an election because \u201cwe live and breathe for a general\u201d. What does this all mean? Chakrabarti seems to be setting out up to three conditions. 1) The Benn bill, designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, would have to pass. That is what getting the legislation \u201clocked down\u201d implies. But there is no chance of that bill becoming law before Wednesday, when Johnson wants to hold a vote on an early election if he loses tonight. 2) Ministers would have to promise to obey the bill. As Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, revealed in an interview on Sunday, at the moment they are not giving those assurances. And in in his statement outside No 10 yesterday, Johnson said he would never ask the EU to delay Brexit \u2013 implying he would not be bound by the law if it passed and if, under its terms, it became obligatory to seek an article 50 extension. 3) Ministers would have to give an assurance that the date of the election would not change after MPs voted for one. Lloyd implied last night that it would be best for Labour to wait until an article 50 extension had been secured, and 31 October had passed without a no-deal Brexit, before agreeing to an election. An alternative option might be to hold an election before 31 October, knowing that if Labour won, Corbyn could then request an article 50 extension (or, in extremis, revoke article 50 \u2013 although he has never said he would do that). But yesterday there were suggestions that Johnson could agree to an election on 14 October, and then change the date once parliament was dissolved to ensure it happened after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Lawyers for a group of 75 opposition MPs and peers will appear in court in Edinburgh this morning to urge a judge to prevent Boris Johnson from suspending parliament, bolstered by the support of Scotland\u2019s most senior legal figure, the lord advocate, James Wolffe QC. The case, being brought by a group of MPs led by Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC, of the Good Law Project, is the first to be heard in full of three live legal actions against the prime minister, with the others in Belfast and London. The case in Edinburgh has further significance after Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer acting for the MPs and peers, told the court last week he wanted Johnson to provide a sworn affidavit explaining why prorogation was necessary and legally sound. That surprise request has yet to be fully debated and tested in court. Wolffe will formally seek permission to take part in the Edinburgh challenge this morning but even with his backing the legal team suspect the judge, Lord Doherty, will back the UK government at this stage, leading to an immediate appeal which is expected to be heard later this week. The government lawyers insist the prime minister was acting lawfully by asking the Queen to prorogue parliament, since it is a routine procedure backed by statute; the Queen was using her royal prerogative powers as set out by the UK\u2019s constitution. The former international trade secretary Liam Fox has been speaking to the BBC for the first time since he lost his cabinet position. Q: What do you think of the vote to seize control of the order paper tomorrow to stop no deal? Fox says he regards the vote as a constitutional matter and supports the government withdrawing the whip from conservative MPs who rebel on Brexit because it\u2019s an existential issue for the government. \u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to voting against the government in a confidence vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want there to be a deal. No one is trying to remove the whip from colleagues. It would be their own behaviour in the House of Commons that would make that a reality. It\u2019s their choice.\u201d Q: Do you think Johnson is handling negotiations better than May because of the no-deal threat? Fox does not answer the question but insists the European Union believes the prime minister would take the UK out of the block with or without a deal, adding that he had assurances from the prime minister that negotiations were ongoing. Now, the SNP\u2019s Europe spokesman, Stephen Gethins. Q: What is your attitude towards a general election? \u201cWe\u2019re really keen to see a general election and see the back of this dangerous and damaging Tory government,\u201d he says, but cautions that getting no-deal Brexit off the table is the priority. Gethins says he does not trust the prime minister and wants to focus on stopping the UK crashing out the EU. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is on the Today programme now. He says if Boris Johnson were to promise a \u201cclean break\u201d in a general election, the Brexit party would support him. But that is not what Johnson is planning. Johnson wants to \u201creheat\u201d Theresa May\u2019s deal, he says. He says there is \u201cno aspect\u201d of the treaty negotiated by May that is acceptable. (Johnson\u2019s view is that, without the backstop, the rest of the deal would be acceptable.) Q: If a no-deal Brexit does lead to problems like a shortage of medicine, will you own those problems? Farage dismisses these ideas as scares. He says the people making these claims are the same people who said that leaving the exchange rate mechanism would be a disaster, or not joining the euro would be a disaster. He says, unlike others in this debate, he has worked in trade. He accepts that there would be problems in the short-term in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but he says these problems could be overcome. The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has been on the Today programme denying that there is division in the party over whether to back an election (see 6.28am). She said Labour would \u201cneed to get the sequencing right\u201d before backing an election, and would first need \u201ca locked-in guarantee that Britain would not crash out of the EU during a campaign period\u201d. Chakrabarti said if they could \u201clock things down to ensure we don\u2019t crash out\u201d then, of course, they would want a general election. \u201cWe are geared up for a general election and we want it as soon as possible.\u201d Q: What do you think of the treatment of Sonia Khan, your former special adviser who was sacked by Dominic Cummings from her job as Sajid Javid\u2019s special adviser. Hammond says her treatment was \u201cshocking\u201d. He says Khan was very professional, even though she is a Brexiter, and did not agree with him on Brexit. He says she thinks Khan would have a good case if she went to an employment tribunal. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. You can watch the highlights here: Q: Dominic Raab says the Benn bill will undermine the negotiations. Hammond says it will certainly delay it. But he says the government is being \u201cdisingenuous\u201d. Look, the government is being, frankly, disingenuous. It says on the one hand it wants to do a deal and on the other hand the backstop must be totally removed from the withdrawal agreement and we must leave on 31 October. Hammond says says \u201cthere is no progress\u201d. Boris Johnson was given 30 days by Angela Merkel to come up with a solution to the backstop. Twelve days later nothing has happened. Q: Johnson says it is the fault of the rebels. Hammond says Johnson is talking \u201cnonsense\u201d. He says \u201cno progress is being made\u201d because \u201cthe UK government has tabled no proposals\u201d. There is no progress. There are no substantive negotiations going on. No progress is being made because the UK government has tabled no proposals. I suspect the reason is that the UK government itself has concluded, as leaks have suggested, that there are no alternative arrangements that would be implementable on October 31 that would meet the EU\u2019s red lines and therefore anything the UK government does propose is likely to be rejected as unacceptable. He says there are no alternative arrangements for the backstop that would meet the UK\u2019s red lines. He says he wants to see the UK\u2019s proposals published. He wants to see them submitted to the EU, and he wants to see the EU\u2019s response. He says there is not even a UK negotiating team. Hammond says the threat to deselect rebel Tories is \u201crank hypocrisy\u201d given there are eight cabinet ministers who have defied the whip in previous votes. Hammond says he was re-adopted as a Tory candidate by his association last night. He says he does not think No 10 has the power to deselect him. There would be the fight of his life if they tried. Asked if he would challenge such a decision in the courts, he says: Possibly. A lot of my colleagues have come under immense pressure. Some have responded to that by saying, Enough, I\u2019m going. That is not going to be my approach. This is my party. I have been a member of this party for 45 years. He has been a Tory for 45 years. He says he will defend his party from incomers and entryists who are trying to turn it into a narrow sect. Some are not even Conservative party members. I am going to defend my party against incomers, entryists, who are trying to turn it from a broad church to narrow faction. People who are at the heart of this government, who are probably not even members of the Conservative Party, who care nothing about the future of the Conservative Party, I intend to defend my party against them. Q: Are you talking about Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff? Hammond says he understands that Cummings has never been a Tory member. That has not been denied. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Frances Perraudin. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor and one of the most prominent rebel Tories backing the Benn bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, is being interviewed on the Today programme now. Justin Webb is interviewing him. Q: What are you going to do? Hammond says he will support the bill. It is \u201ca very modest bill in its ambitions\u201d, he says. It seeks to extend by three months the period before the UK leaves the EU. If the government cannot renegotiate a Brexit deal, it will give the government more time. Q: Do you have the numbers? \u201cI think so,\u201d says Hammond. He says many colleagues have been \u201cincensed\u201d by No 10\u2019s tactics. Q: So you expect around 20 Tories to vote with you? Hammond says they think they will have enough. Hammond says Tory rebels have enough support to win vote on Benn bill. The former chancellor Philip Hammond is the next big Brexit name on the media rounds this morning. Last night, Runnymede and Weybridge Conservatives announced his reselection despite reported threats from No 10 that he would not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at a snap election if he voted against the government on Brexit this week. Would Conservative party HQ really overrule a local association? Some reaction to Raab\u2019s comments this morning and his refusal to confirm election plans that have been briefed to journalists by his own government. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the bill put forward by opposition and rebel Tory MPs was deeply irresponsible. The one handbrake on getting the country moving is this lingering doubt in Brussels that Brexit could be cancelled or delayed which is why this legislation is deeply irresponsible and I think no MP that wants to deliver on Brexit and wants to get a deal should vote for it. He said the government didn\u2019t want an election and that a deal with the European Union was in sight. Raab said if an election were to be called it would have been forced on the country by parliament. The prime minister is clear we don\u2019t want an election. I don\u2019t think the country wants an election. We cannot countenance any further delay because it stops the country from moving forward, so the real question is \u2013 whether it\u2019s with the shenanigans in parliament and a deeply irresponsible and counter productive bill \u2013 whether we get an election forced on the country by parliament. He was asked about briefings that a possible date for an election would be 14 October. What we are absolutely saying right now is that we don\u2019t want an election. Gavin Barwell, Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff, is up and tweeting. It doesn\u2019t make good reading for No 10. The former MP for Croydon Central has backed up reports in the Telegraph that the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations with the EU are \u201ca sham\u201d and urged the prime minister to publish his Irish backstop plans. If you\u2019ve got a spare five minutes this morning before the parliamentary action gets going, please remember to register to vote if you haven\u2019t done already. Here\u2019s the link. You might need your national insurance number handy, according to the website. The BBC\u2019s Samira Ahmed has a useful reminder for students about to head off to university or people with especially busy Mondays: register for a proxy vote. Again, here\u2019s the link. It\u2019s Frances Perraudin here, taking over the live blog for a few hours. Here\u2019s a bit more on the Justine Greening announcement. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that she would remain a Tory member but that the decision to stand down as an MP had been on her mind for some time. \u201cThis is not an overnight decision,\u201d she said. She said \u201ccommunities elect people to represent them\u201d and that she had no doubt the next MP for Putney would be pro-remain, as that was the position of the majority of her constituents. It\u2019s very clear to me that my concerns about the Conservative party becoming the Brexit party, in effect, have come to pass, so my decision is that if I really want to make a difference on opportunity and social mobility, I need to do that outside parliament. She said she didn\u2019t think the Conservative party would \u201coffer people a sensible choice at the next election\u201d. Greening said: Boris Johnson is going to offer people a general election that faces them with a choice between no deal or Jeremy Corbyn. That is a lose-lose general election for Britain and I think a far better way of resolving a path forward on Brexit is to give people a direct choice on the different options on Brexit themselves, rather than a messy general election, which I believe, yet again, will be inconclusive on a route forward on Brexit ... I\u2019m staggered that all these months and years, Jeremy Corbyn has been calling for a general election and it seems that my government is about to hand him that prize on a plate. Justine Greening, the MP for Putney, has just announced on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme she will not stand in the next election. She blamed \u201cconcerns about the Conservative party becoming the Brexit party\u201d and says she can do more for social mobility outside parliament. Some of today\u2019s front pages William Hague says election is the only way to solve Brexit crisis Press Assocation has this report: The former Conservative party leader William Hague has called for Britain to go to the polls, saying the only way to solve the Brexit crisis is by electing a new parliament. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Hague said the current parliament had shown itself to be unworkable, regardless of any strategies employed by Mr Johnson. He said: We have a parliament that cannot go backwards, forwards, or agree to sit still. It is unable to agree on the best or prepare for the worst. While we should not blame all the individuals in it, many of whom have striven to avoid this paralysis, the collective effect of this Rubik\u2019s Cube of a House of Commons is that it cannot properly serve the country in any scenario that we can now construct. It is the most seriously defunct parliament of modern times. There is only one solution to that. It is the one adopted in each of our serious constitutional crises of recent centuries. In 1910, when the Lords refused to bow to the elected government; in 1831, as the arguments raged over the great reform bill; in 1784, as the Commons rebelled against the king\u2019s choice of ministers, the argument was settled by the electorate being asked to choose a new parliament. The right course for Boris Johnson is not to prorogue parliament but to seek to dissolve it. Hague said he liked many things about the Johnson administration but \u201ca long suspension of parliament as a political tactic is not \u2026 something that I can defend\u201d. If it is so divided and incapable, and so irreconcilable with the government \u2013 all of which it is \u2013 this parliament needs to be replaced with a new one. There appears to be some division in the Labour ranks on the question of whether they would welcome a general election. Speaking at a rally in Salford last night, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour was ready to \u201ctake the fight to the Tories\u201d. He said: I am proud to lead our party, I\u2019m proud to take the fight to the Tories and I will be delighted when the election comes. I\u2019m ready for it, you\u2019re ready for it, we\u2019re ready for it, we\u2019ll take the message out there and above all we will win for the people of this country. However, Labour\u2019s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd later appeared to contradict his leader, saying Labour would first push to have legislation passed blocking a no-deal Brexit, the so-called Benn bill. \u201cWe will in fact work through the parliamentary process to make sure that this law is passed,\u201d Lloyd told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight. Obviously once we\u2019ve guaranteed that we pass October the 31st and don\u2019t have a no-deal Brexit, of course we want an election. He also said Labour would not fall for a trap set by Boris Johnson. We are not daft enough to see a tactic dictated by Prime Minister Johnson which is designed to land us with a no-deal Brexit and to fall for that. Will we fall for Boris Johnson\u2019s trick, no we won\u2019t. Boris Johnson is a man who has got form for reneging on his promises. Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull North, Diana Johnson, tweeted this morning that she \u201cwill not be supporting any attempt by the PM to force a General Election at this time of national crisis.\u201d Need more of your senses engaged with Brexit news? The Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Freedland has joined Anushka Asthana on our daily podcast Today in Focus to discuss a pivotal week ahead in British politics. Good morning and welcome to politics live on what is shaping up to be a day of high political drama. A coalition of cross-party MPs are expected to put forward legislation today that would force Boris Johnson to request a delay to Brexit. The bill, which the MPs hope to push through parliament at high speed if they seize control of the Commons timetable, would require Johnson to extend departure until 31 January, unless MPs backed a deal or approved no deal. However, Johnson issued an ultimatum to rebel MPs saying that if they were to push ahead with the bill, he would call a snap general election next month \u2013 something Jerebyn Corbyn says he is delighted about. Johnson made the announcement in a televised address outside No 10 that was punctuated by protesters crying out \u201cstop the coup\u201d. He said there were \u201cno circumstances\u201d under which departure from the EU would not happen on 31 October. Johnson said the backbench bill, signed by the former chancellor Philip Hammond, the ex-justice secretary David Gauke and others, would \u201cchop the legs out\u201d from the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations. Today could be a very significant day, as the success or failure of the vote on the bill slated to be brought before parliament will have a huge impact on the shape of the weeks to come.
