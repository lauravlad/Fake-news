He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know about you, Mr Speaker elect, but as you survey this house from your eminence, with a characteristic beam that has brought you such deserved popularity, I don\u2019t know what you think but I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who are no longer with us \u2013 but I think this parliament is a vast improvement on its predecessor.</p> \n   <p>And indeed Mr Speaker, I would say it is one of the best parliaments this country has ever produced. with more female members than ever before, with more black and minority ethnic members than ever before, and it is also Mr Speaker \u2013 incarnated in your person \u2013 a vastly more democratic parliament. Because this parliament is not going to waste the time of the nation in deadlock and division and delay. On Friday of this week this parliament is going to put the withdrawal agreement in the popty ping as we say in Wales, and then this new democratic parliament, this people\u2019s parliament, is going to do something.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>During the election campaign, Johnson claimed to have learned that \u201cpopty ping\u201d was the Welsh for microwave, even <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/32LYRFTf8hSR9xknCxYXl7T/seven-welsh-words-that-are-well-worth-knowing\">though this is apparently a myth</a>. Johnson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And Mr Speaker I wonder if you can guess what it is that this parliament is going to do. What is it going to do? I wonder if you can guess what this parliament is going to do once we put the withdrawal agreement back. We are going to get Brexit done and even your parrot, Mr Speaker, would have been able to cite that one by now. </p> \n   <p>And we are going to get on with delivering on the priorities of the British people, transforming the NHS, investing massively in education, in police, uniting and levelling up across the country and across the whole UK. And it is my belief and the belief of most honourable members in this house that we should resist the calls of those who would break up that United Kingdom. And as the parliament of the UK we should politely and respectfully defend that partnership and that union. </p> \n   <p>And I can tell the house that after three and a half years of wrangling and division, we in this government will do whatever we can to reach out across the house to find common ground, to heal the divisions of our country, and to find a new and generous spirit in which we conduct all our political dealings with one another that will last beyond this immediate season of Christmas goodwill.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a628f6b13734a3c0537636f21ab7dca0b11689c1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a628f6b13734a3c0537636f21ab7dca0b11689c1/84_0_3340_2004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking in the Commons this afternoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in the Commons this afternoon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T19:14:55.959Z\">at 7.14pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df90bd18f087e8308e5fd4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T17:21:27.041Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Downing Street has announced some new government appointments.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Mike Freer</strong> and <strong>Iain Stewart</strong>, who were both government whips, remain as whips but both get promotions within the whips\u2019 office.

But Fox argued that, internationally, this sort of approach was going out of fashion. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s a wider debate here, and this discussion is part of it. At the WTO meeting in Buenos Aires there was quite a debate about how do we take forward global trade. Is it by aligning all our regulations? That\u2019s what the EU would call harmonisation, a very legalistic model. Or do we go for outcome-based equivalence? In other words, we agree what the standards and outcomes should look like, but we can find our own way, in our own laws and regulations, to get there. That\u2019s the wider debate.</p> \n   <p>The EU very much favours that very legalistic model. The rest of the world favours a more flexible model.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fox was also asked if he thought the NHS would be at risk from a trade deal with the US. He said there was no chance of this whatsoever and that this was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had been dismissed as such by the voters.</p> \n  <p>He said it was now the \u201cnorm\u201d to insert \u201cexemption clauses\u201d into trade deals to protect the running of public services. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That is the norm now, and we have always said that the Government will retain its right to regulate public services in the national interest.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s news: Jeremy Corbyn apologised to his remaining MPs for Labour\u2019s general election defeat. The party\u2019s leader admitted personal responsibility as he faced the parliamentary Labour party on Tuesday evening. Keir Starmer, indicated he was likely to run for the Labour leadership. The shadow Brexit secretary set out his stall in a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian on Tuesday. Barry Gardiner also declined to rule out standing for the deputy leadership. The Conservative party announced a broad-brush review of discrimination after Boris Johnson broke his promise to hold an inquiry specifically into Tory Islamophobia. The party appointed a former equality and human rights commissioner to lead the review. Downing Street warned businesses to prepare for life outside EU\u2019s customs regime \u201cin all circumstances\u201d. The spokesman also refused to comment on the fall in the pound on Tuesday morning, that followed the ruling out of a Brexit extension. You can see a more detailed summary of the lobby briefing with journalists here. Nicola Sturgeon indicated she would not drop her calls for a second Scottish independence referendum. After receiving short shrift from the prime minister, the SNP leader said the vast majority of Scotland had backed either pro-EU or pro-independence parties. She also called for cross-party support for the move. Boris Johnson delivered his first speech to the Commons since the general election. Boris Johnson told MPs he thought this parliament a \u201cvast improvement on its predecessor\u201d. And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more, Zoe Williams and Heather Stewart have tonight\u2019s main story: Keir Starmer has set out his pitch for the Labour leadership with a call for his party not to lurch to the right as a result of last week\u2019s devastating election result, my colleagues Zoe Williams and Heather Stewart write. While the leadership race has not yet formally been launched, the shadow Brexit secretary confirmed to the Guardian that, as widely expected in Westminster, he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. In a wide-ranging interview, Starmer said Labour did not do enough to tackle the Conservatives\u2019 central election pledge to \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 nor sufficiently deal with antisemitism, and urged his party to return to being a \u201cbroad church\u201d. He insisted Labour could win the next general election; but only if it sticks to its values. There\u2019s no hiding from it. It is a devastating result, but it\u2019s important not to oversteer. The case for a bold and radical Labour government is as strong now as it was last Thursday. We need to anchor ourselves in that. I want trust to be restored in the Labour party as a progressive force for good: and that means we have to win. But there\u2019s no victory without values. There are conflicting reports about whether or not parliamentarians have been calling on Corbyn to quit immediately at this evening\u2019s meeting. The Labour MP, Lloyd Russell-Moyle has said explicitly that there has been no such clamour. But BBC Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt has this: And here\u2019s a little more detail from the meeting: The prime minister has spoken to his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, who congratulated him on his general election win this evening. A No 10 spokeswoman has said: They agreed to continue to work closely together as Commonwealth partners on issues such as girls\u2019 education, climate change and trade. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves said she told the meeting the party must radically change and get a leader \u201cthat actually wants to win\u201d. If we want to change the lives of the people we came into politics to serve, then we\u2019ve got to win power and that\u2019s not been possible two times under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. We need radical change, we need a party and a leader the country can trust, we need economic policies that add up and we need somebody that actually wants to win because they know that it\u2019s only through power that we can change the lives of people. Jess Phillips, viewed as a possible leadership candidate by some, has played down the ferocity of the PLP meeting, though she said it was largely critical of Corbyn. It was no worse than it always is. It\u2019s just people saying what they think. There are a couple of people being supportive. She said she read a text from Melanie Onn, the former Labour MP who lost her Great Grimsby seat to the Tories, about \u201chow she had been let down by the leadership and the frontbench and that nobody had bothered with Grimsby\u201d. Phillips said: There are lots and lots of complaints about how nobody has called any of the people who lost. However, her Labour colleague Dame Margaret Hodge said Corbyn faced a hostile reaction. She told reporters that \u201con the whole, it was fury, despair, miserable and I just felt that the top table had corporate amnesia\u201d. They talked about vetting new members and everybody laughed. There\u2019s fury that he didn\u2019t go to visit the right constituencies ... there was fury over the level of organisation. Lloyd Russell-Moyle said Labour MPs\u2019 criticism of Corbyn centred on his leadership, his Brexit position and his manifesto for lacking an \u201coverarching narrative\u201d. Not one person said go right now. They all recognise that he has apologised and that he wants to go as soon as possible, and that the duty was to save the party and do it in an orderly way. People were emotional, very emotional. Here\u2019s a little more on Creagh\u2019s comments about Jeremy Corbyn: She told Channel 4 News she had confronted him in Westminster because, in her view, he\u2019d \u201cenabled a hard Brexit\u201d and \u201cfive years of austerity\u201d. Creagh blamed Corbyn for Labour\u2019s losses, adding: \u201cThis was Jeremy\u2019s manifesto [...] Jeremy\u2019s NEC [Labour\u2019s governing body].\u201d She added that the views she\u2019d heard expressed about his policies on the doorsteps could not be broadcast pre-watershed. And she said: In Jeremy, we have a man without honour and without shame. Another Labour MP on his way out of the meeting says Corbyn\u2019s leadership came up time and time again in the meeting. He said Margaret Beckett, who was acting leader after John Smith died, made a particularly noteworthy contribution, saying the leadership should not be worried about protecting its legacy when thinking about a new leader; what mattered was who would be best placed to win, she told the meeting. The MP said several colleagues also said antisemitism had been a problem, and had to be addressed. He acknowledged that some MPs spoke out in support of Corbyn. But, referring to MPs like Claudia Webbe (see 7.15pm), he said people just elected in safe seats were not best placed to understand the party\u2019s problems. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. \u201cWell cheerful,\u201d says an MP, ironically, commenting on the mood at PLP on the way out - but then she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s no better or worse than it always is.\u201d Earlier one member of the PLP was complaining about the leader\u2019s office not being in touch with MPs who lost their seats. See 6.53pm.Channel 4 News has had an interview with Mary Creagh, who has been making the same complaint. Creagh lost her seat last week. Another MP mutters \u201cmadness, pure madness\u201d as he walks past journalists after leaving the PLP meeting. On the way out one long-serving MP tells journalists that the meeting consisted of \u201cdreary contributions from the leadership and absolutely no acknowledgment of what went wrong\u201d. More from Paul Waugh Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comments about being sorry and taking responsibility for Labour\u2019s defeat are significant because, when he spoke at his election count in the early hours of Friday morning, and when he gave a TV interview later in the day, he expressed little contrition over what had happened. But in an open letter in the Sunday Mirror at the weekend he did say he was sorry about the result. However, in a separate article for the Observer, he did not use the word \u201csorry\u201d or \u201capologise\u201d, and just said he regretted what had happened. These are from my colleague Kate Proctor. I didn\u2019t see the Labour peer Stewart Wood go in for the PLP meeting (it\u2019s for peers as well as MPs), but here are his thoughts, in an article for HuffPost, on what Labour needs to do to recover. Wood worked as an adviser to Gordon Brown when he was PM, and then as an adviser to Ed Miliband. The door opens as a peer leaves the room. While it\u2019s open we can hear a woman (I did not recognise her voice) say: Our leadership have not got in touch with many of the MPs ... We have heard quite a few complaints in recent days that Corbyn\u2019s office has not been in touch with MPs who lost their seats. When she finished she got a round of applause. More from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, who is ahead of everyone else when it comes to getting updates from inside the room. In some non-Labour news, the Conservatives have announced their long-promised review into discrimination in the party. As expected, it does not focus just on Islamophobia, even though during the leadership contest Boris Johnson appeared to sign up to the idea of an Islamophobia-specific inquiry when Sajid Javid bounced him and other candidates into agreeing to the proposal during a TV debate. Here is an extract from the Conservative party news release. The Conservative party have today announced the appointment of Prof Swaran Singh to lead the independent review into improving party handling of complaints of all forms of discrimination and prejudice, including Islamophobia. This independent review will look at how we can improve our processes \u2013 to make sure that any instances are isolated, and that there are robust processes in place to stamp them out as and when they occur. Until 2019, Professor Singh was a commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. He is currently the professor of social and community psychiatry at the University of Warwick. Good use of the word \u201csmattering\u201d here from Paul Waugh ... There was some applause for Lavery, but it was relatively short and half-hearted. From my colleague Kate Proctor She\u2019s right. It is Ian Lavery speaking. I am on a bench on the other side of the corridor (colleagues are nearer the door), but even from here I can tell it\u2019s Lavery. But I can\u2019t make out what he\u2019s saying. That seems a good excuse, while we wait, to flag up this recording of Neil Kinnock telling a PLP meeting in 2016 why he thought Jeremy Corbyn should go. This story contains the text of what he said, plus audio. From the Telegraph\u2019s Harry Yorke earlier Another, rather muffled, round of applause ... From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh (who has a source inside, I presume, rather than excellent hearing) Journalists in the corridor are whispering in the hope of being able to hear better. But we can\u2019t hear what is being said inside. The doors are quite thick, and the doorkeeper is being quite strict about not letting reporters stand too close to them. Now a burst of laughter from inside ... One of the Commons doorkeepers has just come past asking journalists to stand \u201caway from the door\u201d. The meeting has started. From the corridor we cannot hear what is being said, but we can hear applause. We\u2019ve had two bursts of applause so far. I\u2019m outside committee room 14 in the House of Commons, where the PLP (parliamentary Labour party) is holding its first meeting since the general election. The meeting is due to start, and it seems to be standing room only inside. Jeremy Corbyn has already gone in. Outside there are around two dozen journalists. Here is the substance of what Boris Johnson told MPs earlier. It was only a very short speech, but it was his first as prime minister to the House of Commons, and he used it to deliver a message about his agenda. He told MPs: I don\u2019t know about you, Mr Speaker elect, but as you survey this house from your eminence, with a characteristic beam that has brought you such deserved popularity, I don\u2019t know what you think but I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who are no longer with us \u2013 but I think this parliament is a vast improvement on its predecessor. And indeed Mr Speaker, I would say it is one of the best parliaments this country has ever produced. with more female members than ever before, with more black and minority ethnic members than ever before, and it is also Mr Speaker \u2013 incarnated in your person \u2013 a vastly more democratic parliament. Because this parliament is not going to waste the time of the nation in deadlock and division and delay. On Friday of this week this parliament is going to put the withdrawal agreement in the popty ping as we say in Wales, and then this new democratic parliament, this people\u2019s parliament, is going to do something. During the election campaign, Johnson claimed to have learned that \u201cpopty ping\u201d was the Welsh for microwave, even though this is apparently a myth. Johnson went on: And Mr Speaker I wonder if you can guess what it is that this parliament is going to do. What is it going to do? I wonder if you can guess what this parliament is going to do once we put the withdrawal agreement back. We are going to get Brexit done and even your parrot, Mr Speaker, would have been able to cite that one by now. And we are going to get on with delivering on the priorities of the British people, transforming the NHS, investing massively in education, in police, uniting and levelling up across the country and across the whole UK. And it is my belief and the belief of most honourable members in this house that we should resist the calls of those who would break up that United Kingdom. And as the parliament of the UK we should politely and respectfully defend that partnership and that union. And I can tell the house that after three and a half years of wrangling and division, we in this government will do whatever we can to reach out across the house to find common ground, to heal the divisions of our country, and to find a new and generous spirit in which we conduct all our political dealings with one another that will last beyond this immediate season of Christmas goodwill. Downing Street has announced some new government appointments. Mike Freer and Iain Stewart, who were both government whips, remain as whips but both get promotions within the whips\u2019 office. Freer moves up to Comptroller HM Household, and Stewart moves up to Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury. Nusrat Ghani becomes a full junior transport minister. Previously she had a paid job as a whip which she combined with an unpaid job as transport minister. Now she gets a salary for her transport post. (There is a legal limit to how many paid ministers a PM can have in government.) Douglas Ross becomes an unpaid Scotland Office minister, combining that with being an unpaid whip. Maria Caulfield becomes a government whip. On the subject of the Tories and anti-elitism, the polling company YouGov has published some research today looking at which groups voted for which parties. It suggests that, at least on the basis of where their support comes from, the Conservatives can now claim to be more of a working class party than a middle class party. It says: The Conservatives comfortably outperformed Labour across all social grades, further evidence that class is no longer a key indicator of how people vote. In fact, the Conservatives actually did better amongst C2DE voters (48%) than they did amongst ABC1 voters (43%). Labour performed the same amongst both social grade groups (33%). Lord Ashcroft published some separate polling on Friday that came to much the same conclusion. For much of the 20th century Labour was the party of the working class and the Conservatives were the party of the middle class. In recent years, class stopped being the main determinant of voting behaviour (age and education are now the key factors), but even in 2017 Labour was still doing better, proportionally, among working class voters than among middle class voters. The fact that it is the Conservatives who are now doing better, proportionally, with this demographic potentially has huge implications, and it helps to explain why Boris Johnson has been so keen to argue that he is no longer leading \u201cthe Tory party of the old days\u201d and that instead it\u2019s a \u201ctotally different party\u201d. A Downing Street source has confirmed that Boris Johnson and his ministers will not be attending the Davos World Economic Forum this year. The source implied that this was more to do with the government wanting to focus on getting Brexit done, than it wanting to burnish its populist credentials by snubbing the annual gather for the global financial elite, although one suspects No 10 would not mind too much if the move were reported that way. In the Commons MPs are now swearing the oath of allegiance, one by one. Before the process started, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, told them they would be unable to speak or vote in debates until they were sworn in - and that they could not get paid either. MPs take the oath in order of seniority. The whole process may not finish until Thursday. Here is the full text of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s statement to the Scottish parliament earlier. And here are the main points she made. Sturgeon said that, particularly in the light of the election result, taking Scotland out of the EU against its will was \u201ccompletely and utterly unsustainable\u201d. The election was comprehensively won in Scotland by the SNP ... In fact, the Conservatives have now lost 17 consecutive Westminster elections in Scotland \u2013 stretching back to 1959. But in spite of that, we face a majority Tory government implementing a manifesto that Scotland rejected. Furthermore, 74% of votes in Scotland were cast for parties that either supported remaining in the EU or were in favour of a second EU referendum. 90% of seats were won by pro EU or pro EU referendum parties. But regardless, we are set to be dragged out of the EU against our will. Such a democratic deficit is not just undesirable, it is also completely and utterly unsustainable. She said later this week she would publish an argument as to why the Scottish government should have the right to call an independence referendum. It is essential therefore that a future outside of Europe and governed by an increasingly right wing Conservative government is not foisted upon Scotland. Instead, we must have the right to consider the alternative of independence. That is why, later this week, in line with repeated election mandates \u2013 reinforced once again on Thursday \u2013 I will publish the detailed democratic case for a transfer of power from Westminster to this parliament to allow for an independence referendum that is beyond legal challenge. This parliament will also vote on the final stage of the referendums (Scotland) bill which puts in place the framework for a future referendum. She said she hoped there would be cross-party support for this proposal. A new, Brexit focused Tory government presents risks that few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution. So I hope in the coming days and weeks we will see a similar coming together around the idea of Scotland\u2019s right to choose a better future. She said the delay in the UK budget caused problems for the Scottish government. This parliament is required to deliver a budget before the start of the next financial year, and Scotland\u2019s local authorities would expect to set their budgets in late February or early March. At this point, the UK government has not confirmed when it will produce its own budget \u2013 and with it the block grant adjustments for Scotland \u2013 but it may not be until March. While contingency planning and alternative options have been under consideration for some time, meeting this timetable will require parties to work together. From ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has told Euronews\u2019 Darren McCaffrey that the EU will do \u201cthe maximum\u201d to ensure that the UK and the EU can conclude their future partnership negotiation by the end of next year. In the Commons the sitting has been suspended. Later MPs will return to start swearing in. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says he is pleased to congratulate Lindsay Hoyle on behalf of the expanded SNP group in the Commons. And Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, says that if Britain had a proportional representation system, his group would be the third largest, with 70 MPs. He says he hopes Hoyle will bear this in mind. Corbyn congratulates new MPs. He says all MPs represent a community. That is a strength of the Commons. He says a majority of Labour MPs are now women. And 20 of the 26 new Labour MPs are women, he says. He says he hopes the Speaker will continue to take the mental health of MPs seriously. He finishes by urging Lindsay Hoyle to stand firm against abuses by the executive. In doing so, he will be standing up not just for MPs, but for the people they represent. Democracy is not a given. It is something we have to defend and extend. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He joins Johnson in recalling the London Bridge terror attack. He says MPs should remember what David Merritt said about his son Jack, who was killed on that day. He congratulates Johnson on winning the election. And he pays tribute to Labour MPs who lost their seats, particularly Dennis Skinner. Corbyn says Johnson will be judged by whether he keeps his promises. And he says Labour will hold the government to account. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He is opening a short session allowing party leaders to congratulate Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Johnson says this parliament \u201cis a vast improvement on its predecessor\u201d. In fact, it is one of the best this country has produced. It has more female MPs than ever before and more BAME MPs than ever before. And it is more democratic, he says. He says this parliament is going to pass the withdrawal bill. And he invites the Speaker to guess what parliament will do: it will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, he says. He says even Hoyle\u2019s parrot (Hoyle has a menagerie of pets, mostly named after parliamentarians) would have guessed that. He says the government will do whatever it can to reach out across the House, to find common ground and to heal the divisions facing this country. MPs have passed the motion by acclamation. Sir Lindsay Hoyle is taking the chair. There is now a mini-debate on the motion to approve Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker. Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy is proposing the motion. She says new MPs will find out out how friendly and supportive he can be. Joking about his taste for Yorkshire tea, she tells an anecdote about how Hoyle (a proud Lancastrian) once said there were only two good things about Yorkshire; its tea, and the M62 leading out of it. She says in the Speaker\u2019s chair (he was deputy Speaker before his promotion) Hoyle has always been fair and unpartisan. In the Commons MPs have just been to the Lords chamber and back to hear a royal commission instruct them to elect a Speaker. Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the Commons, is chairing proceedings and he proposes the election of Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker. (Or re-election - Hoyle was first elected at the end of the last parliament.) Hoyle says he has served two days as Speaker. It made his election a lot easier, he says. (He represents what was a relatively marginal seat.) He says it will be a privilege to serve as Speaker. He promises to be fair. In his speech at dawn on Friday Boris Johnson said he hoped that Steve Bray, the anti-Brexit campaign best known for his costume and for shouting \u201cStop Brexit\u201d loudly outside the Houses of Parliament on a regular basis, would finally call it a day. Johnson told a Tory audience. And I say respectfully to our stentorian friend in the blue, twelve-star hat: \u2018That\u2019s it, time to put a sock in the megaphone, and give everybody some peace.\u2019 Bray doesn\u2019t seem to be taking much notice. He is outside parliament today, and he\u2019s been shouting too. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Experts from the Centre for European Reform thinktank have been giving interviews today about the government\u2019s decision to rule out an extension to the Brexit transition period. Sam Lowe, a trade specialist at the CER, described it as \u201cdomestic virtue signalling\u201d. And Charles Grant, the CER\u2019s director, said that if Boris Johnson refuses to be bound by EU regulations, getting a trade deal will become much more complicated. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves Back in London MPs are in the Commons chamber for the election of Speaker. The chamber is more or less packed, although at the back row on the opposition benches there are empty seats. Sturgeon says this is a watershed moment for Scotland. Later this week she will take the next steps to secure Scotland\u2019s right to choose its future, she says. Sturgeon has now finished. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is making a statement to the Scottish parliament. She says the SNP comprehensively won the election. The Conservatives have successfully lost 17 elections in Scotland, she says, going back to 1959. She says that 90% of seats in Scotland were won by pro-EU or pro-referendum parties. She says this situation is \u201cnot just undesirable\u201d but \u201ccompletely and utterly unsustainable\u201d. She says she is pressing ahead with her call for the right to hold a second referendum. Referring to Scottish Labour, she says there are some signs that people opposed to a second independence referendum are changing their minds. But she says she accepts that favouring a second referendum is not the same as favouring independence. And she says that she accepts some SNP voters do not back independence. The Copeland MP Trudy Harrison has been appointed Boris Johnson\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, the BBC\u2019s Richard Moss reports. Mairead McGuinness, first vice-president of the European parliament and an MEP for Ireland\u2019s Fine Gael party, told the World at One that EU insiders were \u201ccautious\u201d about whether it would be possible to negotiate the UK-EU future partnership by the end of next year, as Boris Johnson wants. Asked if this timescale was realistic, she said: All things are possible, but we are all a bit cautious about whether it can effectively be completed within an 11-month period ... From the European Union side we know it is a long stretch to complete everything in 11 months, and I think all negotiators involved in trade will say that. It really then comes down to what the United Kingdom wants to achieve in that period of time, and that we don\u2019t know entirely yet because the negotiations have not begun. She also said that including provisions in the withdrawal agreement bill to rule out an extension to the Brexit transition amounted to going back on the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson negotiated with the EU, because that did include provisions for a possible extension, but she implied she did not see this as a problem. An estimated 800,000 EU citizens in the UK have yet to apply to remain in the country after Brexit, new Home Office figures suggest. And around 900,000 EU citizens who have already applied to stay will have to apply again because they have been granted temporary leave to remain, known as \u201cpre-settled status\u201d. This is granted to applicants who have been in the country for fewer than five years or those whom Home Office deems not to have sufficient evidence of being in the country for five years or more. Today\u2019s Home Office figures (pdf) show 2.6m applications for settled status have been made so far, but the government estimates there are around 3.4 million EU citizens in the UK. The Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said: EU citizens have made an enormous contribution to the UK and we want them to stay. 2.6 million applications to the EU settlement scheme have already been submitted and I encourage people to keep applying. EU citizens have until at least 31 December 2020 to apply to remain in the country post-Brexit. The Home Office said in its statement it had completed the process on 2.2m applications, leaving a backlog of 400,000 applications. It also said it had granted status to 305,600 EU citizens in November, showing how efficiently it can deal with straightforward applications. Of concern to lawyers and academics monitoring the process will be the high proportion granted pre-settled status. Of the 2.2m applications already concluded, 41% (around 900,000) were granted this status. Barristers, including the immigration specialist Colin Yeo, have raised concerns that some EU citizens may be entitled to settled status but accept pre-settled status for convenience even though it limits their rights. These are from Darren McCaffrey from Euronews. He is quoting Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP, co-leader of the Greens-European Free Alliance and a member of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to make it illegal for the government to extend the Brexit transition period beyond 11 months has been described as \u201cstrange\u201d by Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. And here are some more lines from the No 10 lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that, as well as ruling out an extension to the Brexit transition, the government was also ruling out having a transition after December 2020 to allow time for new UK-EU trading arrangements agreed in the future partnership deal to be implemented. When asked if this could happen, the spokesman replied: I don\u2019t believe that is the case. The prime minister is absolutely clear that the implementation period is not going to be extended. The spokesman said businesses should prepare for the fact that the UK will be leaving the customs union and the single market. He said: In all circumstances we are leaving the single market and customs union, which means we are leaving the EU regime which is associated with that. Businesses will need to prepare for life outside the EU\u2019s customs regime in all circumstances. The spokesman refused to comment on the fall in the pound this morning, in the light of the announcement about an extension to the transition being ruled out (see 9.06am), saying No 10 did not comment on currency fluctuations on principle. The spokesman said some new non-cabinet government appointments would be announced this afternoon. These are appointments to fill gaps created by MPs leaving parliament. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said Johnson had a conversation this morning with Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European commission. The spokesman said: The president congratulated the prime minister on his success in the election and they agreed to work together with great energy to agree a future partnership by December 2020. Asked if Von der Leyen expressed any doubts about whether it would be possible to conclude the UK-EU trade deal by the end of next year, the spokesman said both sides had agreed in the political declaration that they should reach an agreement on the future partnership by the end of of next year. Von der Leyen has tweeted about the call, but in her tweet she did not say anything about wrapping up the talks by the end of next year. A survey of LabourList readers has Rebecca Long-Bailey very narrowly ahead of Sir Keir Starmer as the favourite candidate for next Labour leader. Angela Rayner, who is now not expected to run, is in third place. Almost 20,000 people took part, but this is a self-selecting survey of readers who may not be party members and who may not have a vote in the contest, and so it would be unwise to read too much into its findings. Polling companies find it hard to poll members of a particular political party, but YouGov has carried out polls of Labour members and its research in 2016 provided a reasonably good guide to the outcome of that year\u2019s leadership contest. In July this year YouGov did survey more than 1,000 Labour members and ask them who would make a good leader. Starmer, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry came out top. Here are the figures. I\u2019m off to the No 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm. At least two bookmakers have sent out press releases today about the odds they are offering on the next Labour leader, with Rebecca Long-Bailey the favourite, followed by Lisa Nandy and then Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. Starmer\u2019s opponents, as well as criticising his stance on Brexit, have been arguing that the next leader should be a woman, as well as an MP from outside London. But Jenny Chapman, who worked for Starmer in the shadow Brexit team and who lost her Darlington seat in the election, has been giving interviews today saying saying gender and regional background should be not factors in the contest. She made this argument in an article for the Daily Mirror and she told the Today programme: I spent the last couple of months talking to folks on the doorstep in Darlington and getting very clear messages back, as you can imagine. What people are saying is that they want a leader that they feel could be the prime minister. It was about, \u2018do I trust this person with my mortgage, with the future, with my children, with my pension?\u2019 And I think that Keir has the qualities that they\u2019re looking for. Nobody on doorsteps of Darlington said the next leader has to have ovaries or a northern accent, and I think that\u2019s such a patronising attitude to think that presenting someone who speaks the northern accent means you\u2019re going to win support in the north. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has been on BBC News this morning. There were two interesting lines in his interview. Gardiner hinted that Labour would vote against the withdrawal agreement bill if the government holds a second reading vote on Friday. He said that the decision to remove provisions protecting workers\u2019 rights from the bill (see 9.37am) would make it even less attractive than the original version of the bill, that Labour opposed in October. He said: The withdrawal agreement, if it is now countenancing the rights and protections which the previous agreement, which did get a majority in parliament contained within it, the protection for workers\u2019 rights and the protections for the environment, given that [Boris Johnson] is now taking that out, is something that is less attractive to us as a party than even the one before. Gardiner did not rule out standing for the Labour deputy leadership. Asked if he would be a candidate, as some reports have suggested, he replied: I have not made any decision on that at all ... It is speculation. In an interview for the Today programme this morning Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s main rival in the 2015 leadership contest, said that the party\u2019s Brexit policy was a problem at the election. He explained: We\u2019ve always been a coalition between traditional supporting working class communities and let\u2019s say a university-educated liberal left. Labour has not been speaking to both sides of that coalition for some time. And, actually, with the position taken on Brexit at the recent election, it was almost as if they were thwarting the views of people who had been our traditional supporters. Labour has got to speak to both sides of that coalition. Burnham refused to say which candidate he would be backing in the forthcoming leadership contest. He also said that voters in the north should be \u201cwary\u201d of accepting Boris Johnson\u2019s promises, saying that the PM could not simply offer infrastructure improvements that were \u201cdecades away\u201d to keep his new northern voters on side. He said: The north definitely does need new infrastructure. The rail chaos \u2013 that we see this morning even, with more cancellations across the north \u2013 is due to Victorian infrastructure more than anything. But they can\u2019t say that they are doing everything to the north by simply promising infrastructure in the distant future. They have got to deal with the here and now. More than 140,000 EU citizens applied last month to live and work in the UK after Brexit, PAA Media reports. The Home Office said it received 142,300 applications for the EU settlement scheme in November, compared with more than half a million submitted in the previous month. This takes the total number received by the end of November to almost 2.6 million (2,592,800). Overall, the number of applications finalised in that time was more than 2.2 million (2,230,900), according to the Home Office figures (pdf). Of these, 59% were granted permanent leave to remain in the country, called settled status, and 41% were granted pre-settled status \u2013 which means they have temporary leave to remain and would need to apply again for permanent permission at a later date. Sky News has just broadcast some footage of Boris Johnson addressing cabinet for the first time. He told his ministers: The voters of this country have changed this government and our party for the better, and we must repay their trust now by working flat out to change our country for the better. And we should have absolutely no embarrassment about saying we are a people\u2019s government, this is a people\u2019s cabinet, and we are going to be working on delivering the priorities of the British people. And that\u2019s what they want us to do. And we must recognise that people lent us their votes at this election. It was a quite extraordinary, it was a seismic election, but we need to repay their trust and work 24 hours a day, work flat out, to deliver. Of course, the first 100 days were very busy - 140 days, or whatever it was; you may remember it was a very frenetic time \u2013 but you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet, folks. We are going to have to work even harder, because people have a high level of expectation, and we must deliver for them. At this point, treating the cabinet like a bit like a primary school class, Johnson asked his colleagues how many new hospitals they were going to build. Forty, they chanted back at him. (No one was brave enough to point out that it would be more accurate to say just six.) Johnson also asked them to tell him how many new nurses they would hire, and new police officers they would recruit. Then he went on: But there is a huge, huge agenda of delivering social justice, of addressing every problem from social care to homelessness, to levelling up and uniting across our country, with better infrastructure, better education and technology. That\u2019s what we want to do. We are Conservatives; we believe in extending opportunity across the whole of the United Kingdom, and that is what we are going to devote ourselves to. Johnson ended his opening statement by referring to today\u2019s employment figures (see 9.53am), joking about taking the risk of \u201csounding more North Korean than normal\u201d. The economy continued to be robust, he said, but the government would take steps to strengthen it. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet\u201d was a Ronald Reagan catchphrase, and Johnson may have been quoting him deliberately. Reagan drew the political map of American by winning the support of blue-collar workers who had previously voted for the other party (\u201cReagan Democrats\u201d) and, although seen as a leader with a poor grasp of detail, he exuded can-do optimism, which people seemed to like. The government has repeatedly said that it does not intend to lower standards on workers\u2019 rights, consumer rights or environmental protection after Brexit. (See 9.37am.) The EU will also wants to ensure that it does not get undercut by the UK in the future, but a key issue in the UK-EU trade talks will be what rules are agreed to ensure this happens. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Liam Fox, the former Conservative international trade secretary, admitted that the EU would start by pushing for \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d - an agreement that, when the EU tightens standards, the UK would follow suit. But Fox argued that, internationally, this sort of approach was going out of fashion. He explained: There\u2019s a wider debate here, and this discussion is part of it. At the WTO meeting in Buenos Aires there was quite a debate about how do we take forward global trade. Is it by aligning all our regulations? That\u2019s what the EU would call harmonisation, a very legalistic model. Or do we go for outcome-based equivalence? In other words, we agree what the standards and outcomes should look like, but we can find our own way, in our own laws and regulations, to get there. That\u2019s the wider debate. The EU very much favours that very legalistic model. The rest of the world favours a more flexible model. Fox was also asked if he thought the NHS would be at risk from a trade deal with the US. He said there was no chance of this whatsoever and that this was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had been dismissed as such by the voters. He said it was now the \u201cnorm\u201d to insert \u201cexemption clauses\u201d into trade deals to protect the running of public services. He went on: That is the norm now, and we have always said that the Government will retain its right to regulate public services in the national interest. That\u2019s what we said in the election. That\u2019s what we will do. What the Labour Party said about the NHS was a lie then, and it\u2019s irrelevant now. During his round of interviews this morning Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, also insisted that the government would protect employment rights when the UK left the EU. He said a bill to this effect would be in the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. UK unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 44 years in the three months to October, as the number of unemployed women hit a record low, PA Media reports. However, the reduction in unemployment came as wage growth stalled over the period and the number of job vacancies also shrank. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits decreased by 13,000 to 1.28 million for the quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. It meant the rate of unemployment stayed flat at 3.8%, surpassing analyst expectations, which had forecast an increase to a 3.9% rate of unemployment. This was largely driven by a decrease in the unemployment rate for women, which fell to a record low of 3.5% for the period. Meanwhile, the number of people in work increased by 24,000 to 32.8 million for the quarter, while the proportion of people in employment stayed flat at 76.2%. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has been giving interviews this morning (although not to the Today programme, which is still subject to a No 10 ministerial boycott). As my colleague Kate Proctor reports, on BBC Breakfast Gove refused to explicitly rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition - although he repeatedly insisted that this was not something people needed to worry about anyway, because both sides were committed to reaching a deal before the end of next year. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has said that it was a mistake for Jeremy Corbyn not to say what side he would take in the second referendum Labour was planning to hold on Brexit. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, recorded during the Labour conference in September and broadcast in Kuenssberg\u2019s documentary, The Brexit Storm Continues, going out tonight, Thornberry said: I think Jeremy is trying to find a compromise but if he goes into an election saying \u2018I don\u2019t have a view\u2019 on the single biggest decision that we have to make \u2013 I think \u2013 what worries me is that every single interview he does will all be about Brexit. Asked if Labour could win if Corbyn adopted that position, Thornberry said: Well, I think it makes it more difficult and that\u2019s why I\u2019m really pushing this because I want Jeremy in No 10. Thornberry also said she wanted Labour to be more overtly pro-remain. At the time Corbyn was refusing to say which side he would back in a second referendum. During the election campaign he refined his position, saying he was taking a deliberate decision in advance to stay neutral. Thornberry is likely to stand for the Labour leadership and Brexit is likely to be a key issue in that context. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies, who are rallying behind the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey as their candidate, argue that agreeing to a second referendum was a mistake (although Long-Bailey herself has yet to express a view on this topic.) The biggest threat to Long-Bailey may come from the candidate attracting most Labour remain supporter, either Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, or Thornberry herself. Both Starmer and Thornberry strongly argued for a second referendum, and said that in such a poll they would back remain. On Friday, in a statement in Downing Street after his surprise and overwhelming election victory, Boris Johnson offered an olive branch of sorts to people who voted remain. Addressing specifically those who still wanted to stay in the EU, he said \u201cwe in this one-nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe.\u201d It was hard to know what he meant by that, and this morning many remainers will be concluding \u201cnot much\u201d following the overnight announcement from No 10 that its new version of the withdrawal agreement bill will ban the government from seeking an extension to the Brexit transition. This is a concession to Brexiters and, although it could be argued that the intention is just to intensify pressure for the UK-EU trade deal to be finalised by the end of 2020, it does raise the prospect of the UK falling out of the transition into a no-deal Brexit this time next year if agreement cannot be reached. That is the conclusion of the financial markets. The pound has been falling this morning, wiping out all the gains it made after the election result was announced. This is from the BBC\u2019s economics editor Faisal Islam. My colleague Graeme Wearden has full coverage on his business live blog. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has condemned the government\u2019s move, saying that it is \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d and will put jobs at risk. The government wants to hold a vote on the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill on Friday. Starmer\u2019s comment implies that Labour will vote against it, but the party\u2019s election defeat has opened an intense debate about its Brexit position and others in the party will be arguing that the party should not vote against the bill at second reading. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs a political cabinet, followed by a normal cabinet meeting. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is due to address the Scottish parliament about the consequences of the election. 2.30pm: The Commons assembles for the first time since the election. MPs will re-elect Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker, and then the swearing-in of MPs starts. 6pm: Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the parliamentary Labour party. The shadow cabinet is also due to meet at some point this morning. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. We plan to publish a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>To paraphrase the Who\u2019s Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again, a song about the nature of the boss class, meet the new culture secretary, same as the old culture secretary. Having recently resigned as both an MP and the cabinet member for Digital Culture Media and Sport, Nicky Morgan was given a peerage to continue, after yesterday\u2019s mini-reshuffle, her ministerial role from the Lords.</p> <p>Traditionally, when a new cultural overlord is appointed, there is a media ritual of probing what, in the field of arts, they might know or like. Do they prefer Coronation Street or The Archers, a film by Richard Curtis or Greta Gerwig? We already know, though, that Morgan listens to Classic FM while doing her red boxes, greatly enjoys the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan productions by a company in her former constituency of Loughborough, and that her department tweeted congratulations to Phoebe Waller-Bridge for winning an Emmy for Fleabag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a1ba95c8bf0895dd8e6f56dea28a7154ebb80527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ba95c8bf0895dd8e6f56dea28a7154ebb80527/0_0_1758_2198/800.jpg\" alt=\"Everything is tactical \u2026 Boris Johnson\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everything is tactical \u2026 Boris Johnson\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, this time, the bigger question is not what we can expect from the secretary, but what may be in store for her department. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, is essentially a more feral version of Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It. For Cummings, everything is tactical \u2013 and Morgan\u2019s continuation feels like a two-part move.</p> <p>In the short term, it avoids a new culture secretary being heavily probed about the future of the BBC, which is the most urgent DCMS responsibility. (Although she wouldn\u2019t have been at risk from Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, as Cummings has apparently banned ministers from appearing on it.) We already know that Morgan is \u201copen-minded\u201d on this. However, as a peer can\u2019t speak in the Commons, having to delegate a junior minister to answer questions there, it is probably too radical even for a Cummings-Johnson administration to attempt to reform the BBC \u2013 and take other major cultural decisions \u2013 through a secretary who can\u2019t be challenged by MPs.</p> <p>Therefore, the strong expectation is that Morgan, who said she left politics to have a \u201cnormal family life\u201d, is putting that wish on hold only until a promised bigger reshuffle on 1 February, the day after the UK is expected to leave the EU. Westminster expectation is that this will re-allocate not just ministerial incumbents but the departments themselves.</p> <p>In the light of this, it seems striking that the 2019 Conservative manifesto had no separate chapter or even a paragraph dedicated to culture, as has generally been the case. Ideas for an \u201carts premium\u201d and \u201ccultural capital programme\u201d (both explained below) appeared in the Education and Environment sections respectively. Spun at the time as the consequence of a deliberately slimmed-down manifesto, it now seems a possible harbinger of a division of the brief across other departments.

      "bodyText": "To paraphrase the Who\u2019s Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again, a song about the nature of the boss class, meet the new culture secretary, same as the old culture secretary. Having recently resigned as both an MP and the cabinet member for Digital Culture Media and Sport, Nicky Morgan was given a peerage to continue, after yesterday\u2019s mini-reshuffle, her ministerial role from the Lords. Traditionally, when a new cultural overlord is appointed, there is a media ritual of probing what, in the field of arts, they might know or like. Do they prefer Coronation Street or The Archers, a film by Richard Curtis or Greta Gerwig? We already know, though, that Morgan listens to Classic FM while doing her red boxes, greatly enjoys the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan productions by a company in her former constituency of Loughborough, and that her department tweeted congratulations to Phoebe Waller-Bridge for winning an Emmy for Fleabag. So, this time, the bigger question is not what we can expect from the secretary, but what may be in store for her department. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, is essentially a more feral version of Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It. For Cummings, everything is tactical \u2013 and Morgan\u2019s continuation feels like a two-part move. In the short term, it avoids a new culture secretary being heavily probed about the future of the BBC, which is the most urgent DCMS responsibility. (Although she wouldn\u2019t have been at risk from Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, as Cummings has apparently banned ministers from appearing on it.) We already know that Morgan is \u201copen-minded\u201d on this. However, as a peer can\u2019t speak in the Commons, having to delegate a junior minister to answer questions there, it is probably too radical even for a Cummings-Johnson administration to attempt to reform the BBC \u2013 and take other major cultural decisions \u2013 through a secretary who can\u2019t be challenged by MPs. Therefore, the strong expectation is that Morgan, who said she left politics to have a \u201cnormal family life\u201d, is putting that wish on hold only until a promised bigger reshuffle on 1 February, the day after the UK is expected to leave the EU. Westminster expectation is that this will re-allocate not just ministerial incumbents but the departments themselves. In the light of this, it seems striking that the 2019 Conservative manifesto had no separate chapter or even a paragraph dedicated to culture, as has generally been the case. Ideas for an \u201carts premium\u201d and \u201ccultural capital programme\u201d (both explained below) appeared in the Education and Environment sections respectively. Spun at the time as the consequence of a deliberately slimmed-down manifesto, it now seems a possible harbinger of a division of the brief across other departments. So Morgan may be the last culture secretary, at least in the current form. But even if the DCMS goes away, the issues facing it will not. Here are the priority emails in the inboxes of whoever gets the political responsibility for them in the next few months. Cultural imports The most immediately tricky responsibility is the question of visa and immigration arrangements, after Brexit, for the numerous artists, orchestras and theatre companies that currently travel easily through waiver and reciprocation schemes. The 11-month transition period after 31 January, in which protocols will likely remain unchanged, gives a little leeway. But with concert halls and opera houses planning many years ahead, firm answers will be needed soon about how to get an orchestra in to the UK from 2021. Phone lines will be burning from the Barbican and South Bank to whoever is in charge. The Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 2022 The Tory manifesto commitment to create a successor to the 1951 Festival of Britain \u2013 celebrating UK-wide creativity in arts and business \u2013 would once have seemed the easy part of the arty brief, a less athletic equivalent of the 2012 London Olympics that was the DCMS\u2019s favourite ever job. But with the Conservatives holding only six of 59 seats in Scotland, and the DUP estranged from its former Tory allies over Brexit, the Johnson government has only a technical mandate in half of the UK, while separatist rhetoric is rising. In these circumstances, a celebration of the union seems certain to be subject to sarcasm and protest, and even potentially terrorism. Broadcasting The biggest issues in television, radio and digital are the form and funding of the BBC, and whether Channel 4, which few voters may even realise is still owned by the state, should be privatised. Channel 4\u2019s unique status \u2013 funded by advertising revenue, but owned by the state \u2013 is still defensible. Having no shareholders, unlike other ad-funded networks, its programming decisions are not motivated by maximising profit, nor is it vulnerable to takeover or merger, as has happened to several ITV companies. It seems improbable, though, that a right-wing majority government \u2013 especially one infuriated by C4 coverage of the election, which included replacing no-show Johnson with an ice sculpture in a climate change debate \u2013 will continue to tolerate a Channel 4 that has executives earning vastly more than the most senior ministers. Whoever is in charge of TV in 2022 will get to carry out the \u201chalf-term review\u201d mentioned in the current Royal Charter, under which the BBC is run until 2027. Before that, they will have to decide whether to extend or replace Sir David Clementi as chair of the BBC board when his four-year term expires in March 2021, meaning that consultation or recruitment would have to start early next year. Clementi has so far seemed bewilderingly invisible to many in broadcasting and politics. Appointed to oversee and scrutinise the BBC board, he seems to have become its kindly carer, making no apparent intervention even over such contentious matters as the Cliff Richard libel pay-out and gender-equal pay. With Johnson having already pledged a review of the BBC licence fee, it seems improbable that Clementi and the organisation will emerge untouched. The BBC has two protections. Backbenchers and members of the Lords can more easily justify rebellion against policies that were not included in a manifesto. The Tories\u2019 2019 document contained no plans to reform the corporation or licence fee, and only two brief references to the BBC \u2013 requiring it to meet the cost of free licence fees for the over-75s and to spread British culture abroad. So the introduction of reforms not set before the electorate would risk huge opposition. The terms of the \u201chalf-term review\u201d of the BBC also specifically rule out changes to the licence fee before 2027 \u2013 although, if the nature of the UK were to have changed significantly, through secession or devolution of broadcasting (currently run from Westminster), the current Charter, which assumes a corporation serving Britain, would seem untenable. But, in the coming debates, BBC bosses need to be careful not to define \u201cBBC independence\u201d as being allowed to do whatever it wants, without scrutiny or censure. The arts premium The Conservative manifesto pledged that Johnson\u2019s government wants \u201cyoung people to learn creative skills and widen their horizons, so we will offer an \u2018arts premium\u2019 to secondary schools to fund enriching activities for all pupils\u201d. It also included \u201cthe largest cultural capital programme in a century, of \u00a3250m. This will support local libraries and regional museums. We will maintain support for creative sector tax reliefs and free entry to the UK\u2019s national museums.\u201d So the administration is promising some money for the arts, although there seems some question about which ministers will get to spend it. The last DCMS secretary? As the \u201carts premium\u201d would be enacted by the Department of Education, one clear possibility is that the Arts and Sports parts of the DCMS will be subsumed into an Education and Culture super-ministry. Since another problem often raised in creative circles is an educational issue \u2013 the fear that student fees are preventing actors and artists from poorer backgrounds from pursuing courses \u2013 there may be some logic in putting the same people in charge of classrooms and the arts.

Regional/populist culture As a result of interventions by recent governments (Tory and Labour), Channel 4 now has a corporate HQ in Leeds, and the BBC expanded its premises and presence in Salford, Edinburgh and Cardiff. As the Johnson majority was won through gains in the North and Midlands \u2013 attributed by Cummings to the southern establishment not understanding passions higher up the map \u2013 the top half of England would logically be targeted by all spending, including money on the arts.

She can mix it too \u2013 witness her appearance on C4\u2019s 18-30 debate. Rayner is the potential Labour leader the Tories most fear. Let\u2019s hope Labour gets it right at this critical time.<br><strong>Adrian Quinn</strong><br><em>Chepstow, Monmouthshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 At last, the perfect opportunity has arisen for the Labour party to resurrect itself. It can present a new image that will be truly transformational, demonstrating that it understands that real democracy requires gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment at its centre. It should adapt the Kurdish model of \u201cco-chairs\u201d, a man and a woman heading every decision-making body. <br><strong>Margaret Owen </strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The paramount question that should be asked of any candidate for the Labour leadership is whether they support proportional representation. As far as I am aware, none of those being touted as potential leaders has ever voiced support. Labour, perhaps even more than the Tories, is institutionally and historically wedded to the idea that under first-past-the-post it is possible to win a decent majority with less than 40% of the vote.</p> <p>Essentially, the political spectrum in England involves two great camps \u2013 the conservative centre-right and the social-liberal centre-left. The problem for the latter is that while its opponents organise around one political party, the Tories, it is fragmented between Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens. This fragmentation is further compounded in Scotland and Wales. The injustice of the FPTP system is especially acute in Scotland where an overwhelmingly centre-left and heavily anti-Brexit majority is ignored by a dominant English nationalist hegemony.</p> <p>It is possible, with the loss of its heartlands and the breakdown of personal identification through class, that Labour is now unable to win a majority on its own. A commitment to PR by a new leader would immediately bring hope to the anti-Tory majority.<br><strong>Brian Wilson</strong><br><em>Glossop, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have nothing against Rebecca Long-Bailey as a person but politically she is a charisma vacuum with a voice that sends you to sleep.

Media savvy, with a background and experience to appeal to the north, along with Keir Starmer as deputy, she can give hope back to those left behind by the election result. She can mix it too \u2013 witness her appearance on C4\u2019s 18-30 debate. Rayner is the potential Labour leader the Tories most fear. Let\u2019s hope Labour gets it right at this critical time. Adrian Quinn Chepstow, Monmouthshire \u2022 At last, the perfect opportunity has arisen for the Labour party to resurrect itself. It can present a new image that will be truly transformational, demonstrating that it understands that real democracy requires gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment at its centre. It should adapt the Kurdish model of \u201cco-chairs\u201d, a man and a woman heading every decision-making body. Margaret Owen London \u2022 The paramount question that should be asked of any candidate for the Labour leadership is whether they support proportional representation. As far as I am aware, none of those being touted as potential leaders has ever voiced support. Labour, perhaps even more than the Tories, is institutionally and historically wedded to the idea that under first-past-the-post it is possible to win a decent majority with less than 40% of the vote. Essentially, the political spectrum in England involves two great camps \u2013 the conservative centre-right and the social-liberal centre-left. The problem for the latter is that while its opponents organise around one political party, the Tories, it is fragmented between Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens. This fragmentation is further compounded in Scotland and Wales. The injustice of the FPTP system is especially acute in Scotland where an overwhelmingly centre-left and heavily anti-Brexit majority is ignored by a dominant English nationalist hegemony. It is possible, with the loss of its heartlands and the breakdown of personal identification through class, that Labour is now unable to win a majority on its own. A commitment to PR by a new leader would immediately bring hope to the anti-Tory majority. Brian Wilson Glossop, Derbyshire \u2022 I have nothing against Rebecca Long-Bailey as a person but politically she is a charisma vacuum with a voice that sends you to sleep. Labour needs a passionate, charismatic personality \u2013 Jess Phillips is my choice \u2013 if it is to stand a chance of gaining power.

Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe plan to start the process before Christmas and will do so in the proper, constitutional way, in discussion with the Speaker.\u201d Under Johnson\u2019s plan Britain is to leave the EU on 31 January once the bill passes, at which point the transition phase with the EU kicks in. During this period, the UK will remain in the EU\u2019s customs union and single market but the government will not have voting rights in the bloc\u2019s institutions. There has been provision for the UK and EU to jointly agree, on a one-off basis, to extend that period by a further period of up to two years, under article 132 of the withdrawal agreement, which was hugely unpopular with with some Conservative MPs keen on a hard Brexit on World Trade Organization terms. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said Johnson\u2019s election victory and majority in the Commons means the likelihood of the UK crashing out of the European Union has decreased. \u201cThe worst-case scenario is effectively a no-deal, disorderly Brexit. The probability of that scenario has gone down because of the election result and the intention of the new government,\u201d Carney said, speaking in a press conference after the publication of the central bank\u2019s financial stability report. \u201cThe scenario itself and the risks that we protect the system against has not itself changed, it\u2019s just become less likely.\u201d After reports of Johnson\u2019s planned extension law emerged on Monday night, the pound fell more than 0.5% in early Asian trading. It fell as low as $1.3236 \u2013 down 0.7% from late US market levels. The 109 new Tory MPs attended a private party with the prime minister on Monday night to celebrate taking their seats, some in places that had been held by Labour for close to a century. They also posed for a photograph in parliament\u2019s Westminster Hall. Their first major task as MPs will be giving the withdrawal agreement bill its first reading, a formality not involving a debate, and then the second reading, which involves a debate as well as a vote. Having both on the same day will need the formal approval of the new Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. \u201cWe will present a bill which will ensure we get Brexit done before the end of January. It will reflect the agreement made with the EU on our withdrawal,\u201d the No 10 spokesman said. \u201cThe PM made clear during the general election campaign that he would be aiming for a Canada-style free trade agreement with no political alignment.\u201d While it is understood in Brussels that Johnson was unlikely to ask to extend the transition period, senior sources have suggested the EU itself could have sought to take the political pain out of such a move by asking for extra time. Officials in Brussels have discussed such an option in recent days but the prime minister\u2019s initiative would remove that safety net. Such is the scale of the negotiation, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has already said that a number of key areas will have to be dealt with after 2020, including aviation and any special arrangements for the UK\u2019s financial services sector. A failure to agree on state aid and environmental standards, among others, would lead to a tough and likely protracted negotiation on the level of tariffs that would be applied to goods crossing the channel. The block on an extension also piles on the pressure on the government to have the right infrastructure ready at ports through which goods move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.",
