By the time the next Treasury questions is due, he is likely to be out of the cabinet. Hammond himself admitted that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that he would remain at the Treasury under the next PM.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that, under a no-deal Brexit, there would be no money available for longterm tax cuts or spending increases.</strong> He told MPs:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve built up around \u00a326/27bn of fiscal headroom and the purpose of having that headroom is precisely in order to protect the UK economy from the immediate effects of a possible no-deal exit. </p> \n   <p>But I have no doubt whatsoever that in a no-deal exit we will need all of that money and more to respond to the immediate impacts of the disruption of a no-deal exit, and that will mean there is no money available for longer-term either tax cuts or spending increases. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said a no-deal Brexit could cost the exchequer \u00a390bn. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me go further, the government\u2019s analysis suggests that in a disruptive no-deal exit there will be a hit to the exchequer of about \u00a390bn.

You would not guess it from the rather dull headline the paper has put on it - in the paper edition, \u201cWe Tories face a tough choice, but for me one candidate stood out\u201d - but that might have something to do with the fact that the Telegraph is enthusiastically backing Boris Johnson, its star columnist, for next PM, and Hague is effectively arguing Johnson could destroy the Conservative party.</p> \n  <p>Hague backs Hunt for Tory leader - although he also says a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous. Perhaps the column was written before Hague read Hunt\u2019s speech yesterday, in which Hunt significantly hardened up his Brexit stance, saying that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/01/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-hunt-proposes-6bn-no-deal-bail-out-for-farmers-and-fishing-industry-live-news?page=with:block-5d1a08138f082cc21811b7c7#block-5d1a08138f082cc21811b7c7\">he would start his premiership on the assumption that a no-deal Brexit was the most likely outcome. </a></p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from Hague\u2019s article.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hague warns that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy could prove fatal to the Conservative party.</strong> Near the start of his column he says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The whole idea of a broad, centre-Right party, which has an unbroken history in this country from Robert Peel to Theresa May, is <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/06/17/no-circumstances-should-tories-form-alliance-brexit-party/\">now under threat</a>. Serious mistakes in the coming months could be terminal for the world\u2019s most enduring political force.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And then later he explains that Johnson\u2019s determination to deliver Brexit by 31 October in all circumstances, despite parliament\u2019s opposition to no-deal, could lead to a general election which would be disastrous for the Tories. He explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For the fundamental problem with willingly threatening a no-deal Brexit, or saying it will happen at the end of October, come what may, is that this new prime minister has no guaranteed majority in the House of Commons. Faced with that reality, the grotesque expedient of somehow ignoring a majority in parliament \u2013 which would mean at worst an election and, even at best, the complete inability to pass any legislation afterwards \u2013 has reared its head.</p> \n   <p>Boris has demonstrated his strong convictions by saying <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/06/23/three-long-years-since-voted-leave-can-must-will-do-october/\">\u201cdo or die\u201d</a> and refusing to rule out <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/06/27/theresa-may-warns-boris-johnson-against-proroguing-parliament/\">the proroguing of parliament</a>. But in doing so, however much I wish him well if he is elected, he has lost my vote, because \u201cdo and then die\u201d could very easily be the outcome.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hague says a no-deal Brexit could be disastrous for the economy, for the union and for the Conservative party. </strong>He explains:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is of course a second criterion, namely who can best take party and country out of the spectacular mess that the process of leaving the EU has become. The Conservatives face immense twin dangers, although many in the party are focused on only one of these without realising the full scale of the other.</p> \n   <p>Behind them is the Brexit party in full cry, threatening electoral calamity if the promised exit hasn\u2019t happened soon. But ahead of them is a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/04/08/prime-minister-has-point-no-deal-brexit-could-unravel-united/\">no-deal Brexit, with its unknown consequences</a>. It is as if a flock of sheep is running full tilt from the wolves while little realising it might be heading for a cliff. For the Tory party to ignore the pleas of manufacturing businesses and farms, risk placing the union in greater jeopardy, and leave the country in the humiliating position of starting endless new negotiations in a less advantageous position, is a combination that is dangerous indeed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ironically, Hunt\u2019s \u201cheading for a cliff\u201d metaphor is exactly the same as one used by the SNP yesterday - although the SNP version was more colourful; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/01/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-hunt-proposes-6bn-no-deal-bail-out-for-farmers-and-fishing-industry-live-news?page=with:block-5d1a370b8f088a7392737113#block-5d1a370b8f088a7392737113\">Kirsty Blackman described Johnson and Hunt as the \u201cThelma and Louise of Brexit\u201d</a>. But the SNP is opposed to both Johnson and Hunt. Hague has concluded Hunt would be the best Tory leader because Hague thinks he would be best placed to achieve a Brexit deal, even though yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/01/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-hunt-proposes-6bn-no-deal-bail-out-for-farmers-and-fishing-industry-live-news?page=with:block-5d1a08138f082cc21811b7c7#block-5d1a08138f082cc21811b7c7\">Hunt stressed his willingness to manage without a deal.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hague casts doubt on whether Johnson has the ability to run government effectively.</strong> He says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Jeremy Hunt ... is one of the most talented ministers with whom I have shared the cabinet table. One of the reasons he was health secretary for so long was that his <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/05/22/jeremy-hunt-has-just-needed-truly-great-prime-minister/\">senior colleagues did not believe anyone else could handle it</a>. In the coalition government, I watched him, through one winter after another, deal with the strains on the NHS with steady and unflappable competence. Good humoured and rational in all circumstances, he is definitely someone you want with you in a crisis ...</p> \n   <p>All governments can only function properly if the occupant of No 10 masters the machinery of it for themselves. They cannot be aloof from it. Whether the civil servants run down the corridors depends on the 24-hour-a-day grip, focus and drive of the man or woman at the top. I hope Boris Johnson can deliver that, but I know for sure that Jeremy Hunt can.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, said that negative claims about the impact of a no-deal Brexit had been \u201cwildly over-done\u201d. (See 1.59pm.) His comment coincided with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, telling MPs that a no-deal Brexit would cost the Treasury \u00a390bn. (See 12.58pm.) The Hammond figure is from this chart in the Treasury\u2019s assessment of the economic impact of Brexit (pdf) published last year. Philip Hammond has strongly hinted he could vote against a new Conservative government to block a no-deal Brexit. He used what could be his last Commons appearance as chancellor to warn about the dire economic consequences of such a course. Belfast could be turned into a Singapore-style tax-free zone under proposals being considered by Boris Johnson. Labour has criticised the government for failing to order an independent inquiry into the anti-Corbyn briefing by civil servants published in the Times on Saturday. (See 3.48pm.) Nigel Farage and his Brexit party MEPs turned their backs during the playing of the European anthem at a ceremony to mark the opening of the European parliament. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has called for a mandatory levy on gambling firms to fix the \u201cbroken\u201d industry. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. In an interview with ITV Jeremy Hunt, the Tory leadership contest, has effectively conceded that a no-deal Brexit could be as bad as the financial crisis. When asked if he thought that the economic shock from no-deal could be as bad as it was from the 2008 financial crisis, Hunt replied: The Bank of England\u2019s predictions are that it wouldn\u2019t be quite that bad, but it could be very serious if we get this wrong. One senior MP who thinks a no-deal Brexit is now more likely (see 4.52pm) is Nick Boles, who left the Conservative party and now sits as an independent because he was in despair at how hardline his colleagues were over Brexit. He was one of the MPs most involved in efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit. But, as Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Hutton reports, now he is almost in favour, on that \u201cit\u2019ll serve them right\u201d principle. Boris Johnson has reaffirmed his opposition to any Brexit deal involving a hard border in Ireland or Northern Ireland being taken out of the UK\u2019s customs territory. These are from Mujtaba Rahman, the former European commission official who leads on Brexit analysis for the Eurasia consultancy. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has tweeted this defending the decision of his MEPs to turn their backs as the European anthem, Ode to Joy, was being played in the European parliament this morning. Pippa Crerar, the Daily Mirror\u2019s political editor, thinks Labour\u2019s call for an independent inquiry into the anti-Corbyn briefing by civil servants (see 3.48pm) is misguided. Labour has costed the pledges being made by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in the Tory leadership contest. No opposition costing exercise is worth much unless it produce an enormous, multi-billion figure, and Labour has managed to calculate that, between them, Johnson and Hunt are proposing spending worth \u00a3100bn. According to Labour, Johnson is the most spendthrift, with his manifesto costing \u00a357bn. Hunt\u2019s plans would cost a meagre \u00a343bn, it says. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said in a statement: The combined unfunded spending promises amounting to \u00a3100bn being thrown around by both Johnson and Hunt once again prove that austerity was a political choice for the Conservatives and not an economic necessity. Unlike Labour, these Tory candidates can\u2019t account for where their spending will come from. While trying to outdo each other on who is more likely to pursue a no-deal Brexit, and who can make the largest and most reckless commitments, both Johnson and Hunt are putting our economy at risk and can\u2019t be trusted to follow through on their promises to invest. Labour claims that the government\u2019s refusal to order an independent inquiry into the anti-Corbyn briefing by civil servants to the Times suggests the establishment is \u201cclosing ranks to protect its own\u201d. In a statement following the Downing Street lobby briefing (see 11.37am), Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: The refusal of the government to launch an independent investigation into this clear and unprecedented breach of civil service neutrality at a senior level, shows every sign of the establishment closing ranks to protect its own. When senior civil servants, who are obliged to be impartial, instead spread disinformation about the leader of the opposition, it is an attack on our democratic system. In these circumstances, nothing less than a thorough investigation, independent of the Cabinet Office, will restore confidence. On Saturday the Times carried an investigation into how Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office operates. An inside page spread (paywall), under the headline \u201cJeremy Corbyn: Bullying, plots and paranoia . . . inside his chaotic bunker\u201d, focused on claims that he is dominated by bullying advisers, and it featured a series of quotes from unnamed Labour figures. But Labour was particularly infuriated by the related front page story, which concentrated on alleged concerns about Corbyn\u2019s health expressed by unnamed senior civil servants. The story (paywall) started: \u201cSenior civil servants have become increasingly concerned about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s health and warned that he may be forced to stand down as Labour leader because he is not up to the job \u201cphysically or mentally\u201d. And the story featured these two quotes from civil servants. One senior civil servant said: \u201cWhen does someone say [he] is too ill to carry on as leader of the Labour party let alone prime minister? There must be senior people in the party who know that he is not functioning on all cylinders.\u201d Another said: \u201cThere is a real worry that the Labour leader isn\u2019t up to the job physically or mentally but is being propped up by those around him. There\u2019s growing concern that he\u2019s too frail and is losing his memory. He\u2019s not in charge of his own party.\u201d Labour has described these comments about Corbyn\u2019s health as \u201cmanifestly untrue\u201d. From the BBC\u2019s Darran Marshall Earlier I said that when Boris Johnson was asked about the restoration of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, he sounded as if he did not really know much about it. (See 12.45pm.) The New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire agrees. Mark Devenport, BBC Northern Ireland\u2019s political editor, thinks so too. Here are the main points from the Belfast Tory leadership hustings. Boris Johnson, the favourite in the contest, said that negative claims about the impact of a no-deal Brexit had been \u201cwildly over-done\u201d. (See 1.59pm.) His comments coincided with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, telling MPs that a no-deal Brexit would cost the Treasury \u00a390bn. (See 12.58pm.) Johnson said that one of the benefits of Brexit would be that it would enable the UK to set up a network of free ports. When a questioner asked about the possibility of having a network of tax-free zones in Northern Ireland, Johnson replied enthusiastically: Well, that\u2019s the sort of thing we can do, but only once we leave the EU. We could do free ports. It would be a massive boost to this economy, but only once we come out. I will have about six of them, by the way. We should definitely be doing free ports and tax-free zones. They have delivered around the world. I think there are around 130 countries that have them. We don\u2019t, because of our membership of the EU. And there are plainly areas that would benefit from them. As my colleague Rob Davies reports, last year a European parliament report said free ports can facilitate \u201cillegal activity\u201d such as tax evasion and money laundering. Johnson said he did not know why people depicted him as a rightwing populist and blamed \u201chysteria\u201d for this characterisation of his position. The Tory broadcaster Iain Dale, who was chairing the proceedings, asked him why he was seen as a rightwing populist when his record suggested he was \u201cabout as liberal as you can get\u201d. Johnson replied: Well, I know. I don\u2019t know where it all comes from. It\u2019s complete hysteria. But there you go. People will say all sorts of extraordinary things and you just have to keep trying to correct them. Johnson reaffirmed his support for the idea of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Asked about the idea, he said: I\u2019m an enthusiast for that idea. I think it\u2019s a good idea. But, again, that is the kind of project that should be pursued by a dynamic Northern Ireland government, championed by local people, with local consent and interest, backed by local business, and mobilised by the politicians of Northern Ireland. That\u2019s what should happen. The last time Johnson floated this idea a retired offshore engineer shot it down with a memorable letter to the Sunday Times describing the proposal as \u201cabout as feasible as building a bridge to the moon\u201d. Johnson accused the EU of exerting \u201cmoral blackmail\u201d over the UK in relation to the Irish backstop. He said: Under no circumstances, whatever happens, will I allow the EU or anyone else to create any kind of division down the Irish Sea or attenuate our union. That is why I resigned over Chequers. It is a terrible moral blackmail it puts on the UK government. We can\u2019t have that. The way to protect the Union is to come out the EU whole and entire. Solve the border issues where they belong in the FTA (free trade agreement) we are going to do. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Johnson\u2019s rival in the contest, said that he has privately opposed the backstop idea in cabinet. He said: I do recognise that we are never going to have a deal to leave the EU with the backstop. So it has to change or it has to go. I was one of the people who argued against accepting the backstop in the cabinet, but I think it is important the prime minister has a loyal foreign secretary so I kept those discussions private. Johnson and Hunt both said it was primarily for Northern Ireland to decide if it wanted to liberalise its laws to allow abortion and same-sex marriage, in line with the rest of the UK. Neither of them backed the idea of London acting unilaterally to change the law, and they both said this showed the need for the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive to be revived. Hunt said it was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for Northern Ireland politicians to be not doing their jobs while they were still being paid. He said: It is totally unacceptable that politicians who are paid to run the NHS, to run the schools, to promote inward investment are not turning up to work and doing their job. We have to be absolutely clear this is a big abdication of responsibility. They need to get to delivering what was a fundamental tent of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, which was that devolved assembly. But Hunt did not explicitly call for MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) to lose their pay while the assembly remains suspended. MLAs have already received a partial pay cut, but they do still get some of their salary. Hunt said there would be \u201cserious consequences\u201d if China failed to honour the terms of the 1984 joint declaration signed with the UK on Hong Kong. He said: We expect that legally-binding agreement to be honoured and if it isn\u2019t there will be serious consequences. Asked what those consequences would be, he said: You have to allow me some latitude as foreign secretary to make a decision on that when the appropriate time comes. But I want to be absolutely clear that our values are not negotiable and that we expect all countries to honour their legal agreements with the United Kingdom ... We do want calm but we want the government of Hong Kong and the government of China to understand that what makes Hong Kong special is the freedoms of its people. Boris Johnson has been tweeting from Belfast. And this is what Boris Johnson said at the Belfast hustings about a no-deal Brexit. (See 12.58pm.) He called it at one point a WTO Brexit (which is what Nigel Farage calls no-deal.) Johnson said: I think we should be very positive about Brexit, and we should not be terrified of a no-deal Brexit. We should not be terrified of coming out on WTO terms. We will make sure we look after the agricultural interest ... whatever is necessary to protect farmers. We will make sure that just-in-time supply chains are protected, and I think a lot of the negativity about a WTO Brexit has been wildly over-done. People say that there won\u2019t be any clean drinking water, and the planes won\u2019t fly, and there won\u2019t be milk solids and glucose and whey to make Mars bars. Do you really believe that? It is total nonsense. I prophesy very confidently that we will have a successful Brexit, the planes will fly, there will be clean drinking water, and there will be whey for the Mars bars, because where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a whey, as I never tire of saying. Turning back to Treasury questions, here are the top lines from what could be Philip Hammond\u2019s last parliamentary question time as chancellor. By the time the next Treasury questions is due, he is likely to be out of the cabinet. Hammond himself admitted that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that he would remain at the Treasury under the next PM. He said that, under a no-deal Brexit, there would be no money available for longterm tax cuts or spending increases. He told MPs: We\u2019ve built up around \u00a326/27bn of fiscal headroom and the purpose of having that headroom is precisely in order to protect the UK economy from the immediate effects of a possible no-deal exit. But I have no doubt whatsoever that in a no-deal exit we will need all of that money and more to respond to the immediate impacts of the disruption of a no-deal exit, and that will mean there is no money available for longer-term either tax cuts or spending increases. He said a no-deal Brexit could cost the exchequer \u00a390bn. He said: Let me go further, the government\u2019s analysis suggests that in a disruptive no-deal exit there will be a hit to the exchequer of about \u00a390bn. That will also have to be factored in to future spending and tax decisions. He would not rule out voting with Labour to block a no-deal Brexit. When John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, asked Hammond if he would vote with Labour on a no-confidence motion to stop no-deal, he replied: I think at this stage in my career I won\u2019t speculate on my future actions. What I would say is that the government\u2019s analysis shows that a no-deal exit would mean that all the regions, nations, and sectors of the UK\u2019s economy would have lower economic output compared to today\u2019s arrangements and compared to the white paper scenario that the government set out. It is important that we all understand that preparing for no-deal, which is a perfectly sensible thing to do because it might happen to us without our volition, preparing for no-deal is not the same as avoiding the effects of no-deal. Hammond also said at other points during the session: As I have consistently said in this house I don\u2019t believe that a no-deal exit would be in the interests of this country and I will do everything I can to make sure that we avoid a no-deal exit ... I think I have been consistently clear that I believe leaving with a no-deal exit will be bad for the UK, bad for the British economy, bad for the British people. We cannot however rule out that that could happen because it is not entirely in our hands, but I do agree that it would be wrong for a British government to seek to pursue no-deal as a policy and I believe that it will be for the House of Commons of which I will continue proudly to be a member to ensure that that doesn\u2019t happen. During the session McDonnell also gave Hammond a book as a leaving present. Explaining what it was, McDonnell said: I gave his predecessor a little red book as a present [Mao\u2019s little red book], we have another red book, but this is a guide to London\u2019s rebel walks and we hope he\u2019ll enjoy it in his leisure periods. Johnson ends by saying he wants a cross-party agreement to find a solution to the adult social care problem. And that\u2019s it. The hustings are over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What about having tax-free zones in Belfast? Johnson says he is in favour. But we can only do this when we are out of the EU, he says. He says he wants to establish six free ports around the UK. Johnson says the DUP have been \u201cindispensable\u201d in preventing the country being government by Jeremy Corbyn. Q: Do you get frustrated at being portrayed as a rightwing populist, when by your record you are as liberal as they got? Johnson agrees that it is strange. He says it is \u2018hysteria\u201d. Johnson dismisses claims he is a rightwing populist as \u201chysteria\u201d. Before he became London mayor lots of lefties threatened to leave the country if he were elected. After eight years most of them were working for him, or at least backing him, he says. Q: What would you do to Tory MPs who do not accept the result of the referendum. The question gets a round of applause. Johnson says he would show them as much love as possible. The party needs to unite, he says. He says the party has to deliver Brexit. We either do this or we\u2019re doomed. Johnson says he is the candidate with the support of more than half of Tory MPs. The live feed is back up. Q: Can you be sure parliament won\u2019t stop you leaving on 31 October without a deal? Boris Johnson says MPs will take their responsibilities seriously. They can carry on haemorrhaging votes. Or they can do the responsible thing? He says this is existential for both parties. Iain Dale says Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, is on his LBC programme tonight. What should Dale ask him? Johnsons says Dale should ask him if he wants to deliver on the referendum result, and let the government do lots of good Conservative things, or allow a Corbyn government. The live feed has gone down. I\u2019m afraid I will have to rely my colleague Rory Carroll, Twitter and the wires for coverage of the rest of what Boris Johnson has to say. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: How will you get a positive Brexit for Northern Ireland? Johnson says there should be more positivity about Brexit. A lot of the negativity about a WTO Brexit has been wildly over-done. Q: What about plans for a fixed link between Northern Ireland and Britain? Johnson says there is a plan for a fixed link with Scotland. He is in favour of it. But he says it is for the Northern Ireland assembly to champion this idea. Q: Do you watch Game of Thrones? Johnson says he has watched some of it, but he did not get into it. Q: Do you identify with a GoT character? Or a Star Wars one (also filmed in Northern Ireland)? Johnson says he does not know Got well enough to identify with a character. But he does identify with \u201cthe guy with the lightsaber\u201d. Iain Dale says: \u201cLuke Skywalker.\u201d Johnson explains why. He says lightsabers are made in his constituency, Uxbridge. He has one in his office. Q: Should the Conservative party organise properly in Northern Ireland? Johnson says today\u2019s meeting looks quite organised. He says he thinks he is the only candidate who has addressed a meeting of Northern Ireland Conservatives. Q: Should abortion and same-sex marriage be allowed in Northern Ireland? This is primarily a matter for the people of Northern Ireland, he says. That is why the assembly should be revived. Q: What do you say to Lyra McKee\u2019s partner who says the UK government should legislate for same-sex marriage here? Johnson says he understands her point of view. But he thinks it is for Northern Ireland to decide this. Johnson says he wants the UK to come out of the backstop altogether. He says the withdrawal agreement as it stands is \u201ca dead letter\u201d. Some bits of it, like citizens\u2019 rights, could be disaggregated. He says the British came up with the backstop plan. That was because many on the British side wanted to stay in the customs union. So the backstop represents the \u201cincoherence\u201d of the British stance: wanting to leave the EU, but stay in the customs union. Q: What about a snap referendum in Northern Ireland on staying in the customs union? Johnson says the only thing that would snap would be people\u2019s patience. The thing to do is to get on and deliver Brexit. The Conservative party will not recover as a fighting force until we get Brexit over the line. Iain Dale asks his first question. Q: I asked my taxi driver on the way here what he would like to ask. He wanted to know why the MLAs were being paid. What would you do to get the assembly up and running again? Johnson says he would urge all sides to get the assembly back running again. Q: What are the problems? Johnson says people know what the problems are. Compromise is needed. Q: What would you do? Johnson says he would do what needs to be done. (He does not sound as if he really knows much at all about the reasons for the Northern Ireland assembly being suspended.) Boris Johnson is doing his opening speech now. He recalls giving a speech in Bangor. At the time the Tories were facing difficulties. There are problems now, but this time the party can turn it around. He says the Tories need to deliver Brexit. But they need to come out together, to keep the UK united. He says, if he becomes prime minister, he will brand himself as minister for the union. He says the party needs to stand up for Conservatism. Their ideas are the right ideas. They have to stand up for wealth creators, and get their mojo back. If the Tories deliver Brexit, they will win back support from the Brexit party and the Lib Dems. He says Jeremy Corbyn has sympathised with the UK\u2019s enemies and been quite \u201cshameless\u201d in his support of the IRA. That is a good reason to keep him away from power, even before you consider his economic plans. Corbyn\u2019s nationalisation plans would cost the country \u00a3300bn, Johnson claims. From Sky\u2019s David Blevins Q: What more can we do to protect Christians being persecuted around the world? Hunt says there has been \u201ca bit of a blind spot\u201d in foreign policy. Whether through political correctness, or awkwardness about the UK\u2019s colonial past, the UK has not championed the cause of Christians being persecuted. The Middle East used to be 20% Christian. Now it is 5%. He says British aid is often going places where Christians are being persecuted. The Bishop of Truro has been carrying out a review on what more could be done for the Foreign Office. He says this will be published next week. And that\u2019s all from Hunt. Q: Nigel Farage is a highly competent operator. We need all the help we can get. Is there any chance of using his expertise? Hunt says the question was phrased in a seductive way. But he is going to disappoint the questioner. He says Farage wants a different outcome, a WTO Brexit. That would be bad for Northern Ireland, he says. Q: Will the Northern Ireland secretary remain a full member of your cabinet? Yes, says Hunt. Q: Do you agree we have been blind to what China is doing to its people? Do we have a moral duty to speak up for the people of Hong Kong? This question gets a round of applause. Hunt says he was asked about this on Sky News. He has never had to fight for his freedom, he says. He says his father fought in the cold war; his generation knew what it was like to put your life on the line. China is lifting lots of people out of poverty. And we wish them well with that, he says. But he says we can never compromise on our values. Since last year the situation in China has got worse. We cannot support the violence in Hong Kong, but China must understand the concerns of the people of Hong Kong, particularly over the extradition bill. People fear being extradited to mainland China if they speak out. Q: What can the UK actually do? Hunt says Hong Kong is part of China. But its freedoms re guaranteed by the legally binding agreement between China and the UK. If those freedoms are not honoured, there will be \u201cserious consequences\u201d. Q: What will they be? Hunt says he does not want to say. He needs some flexibility. Q: Do you think students should be able to register with more than on GP, so they can visit a GP when they are at home from university? Hunt says he thinks students should be able to visit GPs during the university holidays. But he mentions other policies that might appeal to young people. The interest rate on student loans could be cut, he says. But there are values issues too, like climate change. Young people want to see politicians doing more on climate change, he says. Q: What will you do to ensure that Northern Ireland does not lose out from the loss of EU money? What is happening to the shared prosperity fund? Hunt says that he wants to ensure more spending does not just go to London and the south of England. Hunt says the Tories have been complacent about the union. They need to work harder to maintain it. Some of the things that can be done are symbolic, like visiting Northern Ireland more often. Q: Would you ask the party chairman to involve the party in Northern Ireland more? Hunt says he would be open to that. Q: Can you rule out a Northern Ireland-only referendum on the backstop? Yes, says Hunt. Hunt says he would renew the confidence and supply deal with the DUP. Q: The last deal with the DUP cost \u00a31bn. Will you give them another \u00a33bn for the rest of this parliament? Hunt says the government agreed to give \u00a31bn to Northern Ireland. He hopes the DUP will support the government on Brexit. From my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll Hunt is now taking questions from the audience. Q: Yesterday you said your negotiating team would include the DUP, but not Conservatives from Northern Ireland. Why? Hunt says he would include the DUP because he needs a team that can get a deal through parliament. Q: Should the Conservatives organise properly in Northern Ireland? Hunt says he would like to see the Conservatives properly functioning in Northern Ireland, with candidates in the assembly. Q: Should abortion be changed in Northern Ireland? Hunt says if he lived in Northern Ireland he would want the law changed. He says that is why the assembly should be revived. Q: Do you want the law changed to allow gay marriage in Northern Ireland? Hunt says you need a great deal of social consent to change the law on something like this in Northern Ireland. He says he hopes the law does change. And he says public opinion can move quickly. Q: With your speech yesterday, are you trying to \u201cout-Boris Boris\u201d? Not at all, says Hunt. He says he always argued in cabinet for more intense no-deal planning. He says he wants a deal. But people admire the UK because it is a democracy, and the politicians do what the public want. Q: What is the difference between your deadline and Boris Johnson\u2019s? Hunt says, if parliament takes the no-deal option off the table, it\u2019s off the table. But he wants to give the EU a reasonable amount of time to decide if it will do a deal. Q: How would you get a Brexit deal without a backstop? Hunt says everyone agrees they don\u2019t want a hard border. The objection to the backstop is that the UK could be trapped in it. He says he argued against it in cabinet. But he thinks the PM deserves a loyal foreign secretary, and did not air his difference of opinion. He says he thinks technology is the answer. Q: The EU does not accept that? Hunt acknowledges that. But he says he thinks it does provide an answer. The broadcaster Iain Dale is chairing the hustings. Q: How would you revive the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive? Hunt says it is totally unacceptable that MLA (members of the legislative assembly) are being paid when they are not sitting and not doing their job. He says he would put in the time personally to get the assembly back up and running. Hunt suggests MLAs should not be paid while the assembly is suspended. Q: Why has it not happened already? Talks have been going on for 10 weeks. Hunt says the fact that the talks are happening is a start. Hunt is now running through his four non-Brexit priorities. First, he would fire up the economy. Second, he wants the UK to \u201cwalk tall\u201d in the world. Third, he wants the Tories to be the government that abolishes illiteracy, because a quarter of primary school pupils leave school without being able to read to the expected standard. And, fourth, he wants to ensure the Tories beat Jeremy Corbyn. Hunt is now delivering his standard stump speech. He says the government has to deliver Brexit. He has spoken to farmers in Northern Ireland about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. That is why he announced plans for a no-deal package to help farmers, he says. (See 11.08am.) But no-deal is not his first choice, he says. Jeremy Hunt is on stage now. He says he was culture secretary in 2012 when his department negotiated the tax credit for the film industry that brought Game of Thrones to Northern Ireland. He also says, as foreign secretary, he knows how much people admire Northern Ireland for the peace process. In Belfast it looks as if Jeremy Hunt is going first. A Hunt campaign video is now being played. In the Commons Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is taking questions. He told MPs that, although the spending review this year is meant to cover three years, the next government might just decide to have a one-year one. He also said he would do everything possible to stop a no-deal Brexit. From the BBC\u2019s Darran Marshall Jeremy Hunt has posted this on Twitter. The Tory leadership hustings in Belfast is due to start soon. There will be a live feed at the top of the blog once its underway. There are already been six official hustings already - we\u2019ve covered the Birmingham one here, the digital one here, the Bournemouth one here, and the Exeter one here - and so by this stage we should be facing diminishing returns. It becomes less likely that the candidates will say anything new. The Conservatives only have a few hundred members in Northern Ireland. But finding a solution to the backstop is at the heart of attempts to get a Brexit deal through parliament, and the hustings may through up some interesting lines on this. An investigation has been launched into whether senior civil servants said they thought Jeremy Corbyn was \u201ctoo frail\u201d to be prime minister, Downing Street has said. As the Press Association reports, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the morning lobby briefing: The Cabinet Office is investigating this potential breach of the civil service code fully and fairly just as it would any other. If we are able to identify an individual responsible we will take disciplinary action. And Sir Ed Davey, a candidate to be Lib Dem leaders, has praised his party\u2019s delegation of MEPs. He claims they will heal the divide in the UK. But the Lib Dem MEPs were wearing teeshirts with \u201cStop Brexit\u201d on the front and \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d on the back. Opposing Brexit is one legitimate ambition. Uniting the country is another. But trying to do both at the same time may not be particularly realistic ... Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, says his MEPs are \u201ccheerfully defiant\u201d in Strasbroug this morning. Yesterday Jeremy Hunt announced plans for a \u00a36bn bail out for farmers and the fishing industry in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But, as Anna Hill, presenter of the BBC\u2019s Farming Today, says, WTO rules could make payment of subsidies of this kind illegal. @DmitryOpines is Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former Australian trade negotiator, who set up the ExplainTrade.com website. He explains the potential problems for Hunt in a Twitter thread starting here. And here are some of his tweets. According to the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp, the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage said this morning that the Conservatives would be swept away by a \u201cturquoise takeover\u201d (ie, the Brexit party) if they failed to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. Here is a video clip of the protest by Brexit party MEPs in the European parliament. From the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge Boris Johnson is expected to take part in the BBC\u2019s televised debate with Jeremy Hunt on Tuesday 16 July, a source in his camp says. Jeremy Hunt is claiming that the BBC only scheduled the debate for 16 July - after most Tory members are expected to have cast their votes - because Johnson would not have accepted an earlier invitation. (See 9.59am.) Hunt implies the BBC should have ignored Johnson\u2019s objections, scheduled an earlier debate, and empty-chaired him if he did not turn up. Channel 4 empty chaired Johnson when he refused to attend its debate in mid June, but in the past BBC editors have always been reluctant to empty chair candidates who stay away, because it looks like editorialising. Here is more on the first session of the new European parliament. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming Here is the Brexit party MEP Jonathan Bullock responding to Antonio Tajani, the European parliament\u2019s president, saying they would be happy to stand for the anthem of another country. And this is from Richard Corbett, leader of the Labour MEPs, on the Brexit party protest. Jeremy Hunt has accused the BBC of \u201ccaving\u201d in to the Boris Johnson campaign because it is planning a Tory leadership debate two weeks today, by which time most members will probably have voted. Postal ballots go out at the end of this week, and the assumption is that most members will return them within 48 hours. The European parliament is meeting for the first time this morning since the European elections. The UK is sending 29 Brexit party MEPs to Strasbourg (where the parliament is sitting this week), but they marked the opening by turning their backs during the playing of Ode to Joy, the European anthem. This is from ITV\u2019s James Mates: William Hague, the former Conservative party leader and former foreign secretary, has written a candid column (paywall) in the Daily Telegraph today about the Tory leadership contest. You would not guess it from the rather dull headline the paper has put on it - in the paper edition, \u201cWe Tories face a tough choice, but for me one candidate stood out\u201d - but that might have something to do with the fact that the Telegraph is enthusiastically backing Boris Johnson, its star columnist, for next PM, and Hague is effectively arguing Johnson could destroy the Conservative party. Hague backs Hunt for Tory leader - although he also says a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous. Perhaps the column was written before Hague read Hunt\u2019s speech yesterday, in which Hunt significantly hardened up his Brexit stance, saying that he would start his premiership on the assumption that a no-deal Brexit was the most likely outcome. Here are the main points from Hague\u2019s article. Hague warns that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy could prove fatal to the Conservative party. Near the start of his column he says: The whole idea of a broad, centre-Right party, which has an unbroken history in this country from Robert Peel to Theresa May, is now under threat. Serious mistakes in the coming months could be terminal for the world\u2019s most enduring political force. And then later he explains that Johnson\u2019s determination to deliver Brexit by 31 October in all circumstances, despite parliament\u2019s opposition to no-deal, could lead to a general election which would be disastrous for the Tories. He explains: For the fundamental problem with willingly threatening a no-deal Brexit, or saying it will happen at the end of October, come what may, is that this new prime minister has no guaranteed majority in the House of Commons. Faced with that reality, the grotesque expedient of somehow ignoring a majority in parliament \u2013 which would mean at worst an election and, even at best, the complete inability to pass any legislation afterwards \u2013 has reared its head. Boris has demonstrated his strong convictions by saying \u201cdo or die\u201d and refusing to rule out the proroguing of parliament. But in doing so, however much I wish him well if he is elected, he has lost my vote, because \u201cdo and then die\u201d could very easily be the outcome. Hague says a no-deal Brexit could be disastrous for the economy, for the union and for the Conservative party. He explains: There is of course a second criterion, namely who can best take party and country out of the spectacular mess that the process of leaving the EU has become. The Conservatives face immense twin dangers, although many in the party are focused on only one of these without realising the full scale of the other. Behind them is the Brexit party in full cry, threatening electoral calamity if the promised exit hasn\u2019t happened soon. But ahead of them is a no-deal Brexit, with its unknown consequences. It is as if a flock of sheep is running full tilt from the wolves while little realising it might be heading for a cliff. For the Tory party to ignore the pleas of manufacturing businesses and farms, risk placing the union in greater jeopardy, and leave the country in the humiliating position of starting endless new negotiations in a less advantageous position, is a combination that is dangerous indeed. Ironically, Hunt\u2019s \u201cheading for a cliff\u201d metaphor is exactly the same as one used by the SNP yesterday - although the SNP version was more colourful; Kirsty Blackman described Johnson and Hunt as the \u201cThelma and Louise of Brexit\u201d. But the SNP is opposed to both Johnson and Hunt. Hague has concluded Hunt would be the best Tory leader because Hague thinks he would be best placed to achieve a Brexit deal, even though yesterday Hunt stressed his willingness to manage without a deal. Hague casts doubt on whether Johnson has the ability to run government effectively. He says: Jeremy Hunt ... is one of the most talented ministers with whom I have shared the cabinet table. One of the reasons he was health secretary for so long was that his senior colleagues did not believe anyone else could handle it. In the coalition government, I watched him, through one winter after another, deal with the strains on the NHS with steady and unflappable competence. Good humoured and rational in all circumstances, he is definitely someone you want with you in a crisis ... All governments can only function properly if the occupant of No 10 masters the machinery of it for themselves. They cannot be aloof from it. Whether the civil servants run down the corridors depends on the 24-hour-a-day grip, focus and drive of the man or woman at the top. I hope Boris Johnson can deliver that, but I know for sure that Jeremy Hunt can. I therefore have to lean very heavily towards voting for him. We\u2019ve got a Tory leadership elections hustings this morning, so there is a lot more of this to come. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: New MEPs take their seats in the European parliament in Strasbourg for the first time. Morning: EU leaders meet in Brussels again to continue their debate about who should hold the top jobs in the EU. They have already been talking for 20 hours without reaching agreement. Around 11.30am: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt take part in a Conservative leadership election hustings in Belfast. 11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 12.30pm: Nick Boles, the independent MP who left the Tories over Brexit, speaks at an Institute for Government event. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

Top stories Today is the day that was not supposed to happen. The Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats are expected to make a big splash when their MEPs take up their seats in the new European parliament. At the weekend Nigel Farage pre-empted that reminder of support for Brexit in England by unveiling 100 candidates for the next general election. Pressure from the Brexit party seems to be having an impact on the Conservative party leadership contest, with the two candidates battling to out-Brexit each other. Jeremy Hunt was criticised heavily for suggesting he would be happy to sacrifice some businesses to the long-term national interest. Make UK, which represents the manufacturing sector, said this was \u201cthe height of irresponsibility\u201d. Outlining a 10-point plan for no deal, Hunt said he would cancel August leave for civil servants and make a decision by 30 September on whether a deal was possible. But it was the candidates\u2019 spending plans, including a reduction in income tax and stamp duty, a pay increase for public sector workers and an emergency fund for vulnerable businesses, that drew the most stinging criticism.

The former Treasury minister Lord Young said he viewed the \u201cincreasingly generous\u201d pledges by the two candidates \u201cwith alarm\u201d as they were being made out of fiscal headroom that was only designed to last for the first year after a negotiated Brexit. What next? Both leadership candidates have been building their Brexit negotiating and transition teams. According to the Sunday Times (paywall), Johnson\u2019s plans are being drawn up by Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Times also reported that Hunt would replace Olly Robbins, who is leaving the civil service, with Craig Falconer, who as chief trade negotiator in the Department for International Trade is possibly the most underused official in Whitehall. Insiders say the Johnson team has been looking at whether to mothball the Brexit department and merge it with the DIT. Last week the Brexit department suffered a blow when the official in charge of no deal, Tom Shinner, 33, quit to join the private sector. And over in Europe? Frans Timmermans, a self-confessed Anglophile who is fluent in seven languages, had appeared to be in pole position to take over from Jean-Claude Juncker as European commission president. But EU leaders were scheduled to meet again on Tuesday after a council summit ended without agreement. Angela Merkel said the EU had to take into account the views of the smaller countries who did not support Timmermans. \u201cIt should not lead to tensions that will determine years and years to come. Brexit is looming on the horizon. Other important issues are on the table. I think we need to treat each other with care,\u201d she said on Monday. Best of the rest Theresa May makes veiled attack on Boris Johnson. No-deal Brexit could trigger a flurry of profit warnings in November. Alternative arrangements report shows the \u201cbedlam\u201d that Brexit will cause in Northern Ireland. Tory Brexit rebel Sarah Wollaston \u201cprepared to step down\u201d to help a remain alliance. Johnson vows push on Australia-style immigration system. Many note that he and Jeremy Hunt both say they will break with May\u2019s rigid target to get immigration under 100,000. Rift (again) in Labour party over backing for second referendum. Johnson would set up a \u201cunion\u201d unit to deliver Brexit in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and add \u201cminister for the union\u201d to the job title of PM. Top comment Gordon Brown has said the United Kingdom is under threat from \u201cdivisive nationalisms\u201d. Scottish nationalism plus English nationalism plus Welsh nationalism plus Ulster nationalism does not add up to a United Kingdom. Four nations united only by nationalism will not sustain the United Kingdom. It means a house divided that cannot stand for long.
