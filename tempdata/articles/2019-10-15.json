The party has tabled an amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech requesting that any deal brought back from Brussels by the prime minister is put to another public vote. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of remain and have been the leading voice in the People\u2019s Vote campaign. \u201cBoris Johnson is determined to have a general election, but the best way to resolve the Brexit chaos is to have a people\u2019s vote and give the British people the final say about their future. \u201cThe best deal we have is as members of the European Union and we want to give the people the chance to choose to stop Brexit.\u201d Johnson\u2019s legislative agenda was set out on Monday during the state opening of parliament. MPs are now in the midst of five days to debate on the Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 which contained 26 bills \u2013 and will vote on whether to pass it early next week, possibly Tuesday. With no majority and the expectation that Labour and the SNP will vote it down, the government is likely to struggle to get it through parliament. The amendment brought by the Lib Dems if selected by the Speaker could be a significant moment in the Commons as it is another chance to show whether there is a majority for a second referendum. Another referendum on Brexit was rejected during indicative votes held in April. The Lib Dems have said they back another vote on EU membership but, should they win a majority of seats at a general election, they would immediately revoke the government\u2019s decision to trigger article 50 and the UK would remain in the bloc. They have weathered significant criticism amid claims the party\u2019s position is undemocratic. However, Swinson has stated that revoking article 50 is the right course of action because a no-deal Brexit would be like \u201cburning your house down\u201d. MPs who support a second Brexit referendum believe they are nearing a majority, but they remain apprehensive as it would involve winning over many of about 40 Labour MPs who either opposed or abstained on the issue at the last parliamentary vote. Ruth Smeeth was one of four MPs from heavily leave-backing constituencies who defied the Labour whip in order to vote against a second referendum. She quit her frontbench role, working for the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, saying that Britain \u201cneeded to leave, and leave with a deal\u201d.

Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s speech to the SNP conference.</p> \n  <p>And here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sturgeon confirmed that before the end of this year she would ask the UK government to approve another independence referendum. </strong>She said a vote for independence had to be legal.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The process by which we choose Scotland\u2019s future must be capable of actually achieving independence.</p> \n   <p>It must allow majority support to be expressed clearly and unambiguously.</p> \n   <p>It must be legal.</p> \n   <p>And it must have the recognition of the international community.</p> \n   <p>Why?</p> \n   <p>Because our job is not just to deliver a referendum.</p> \n   <p>Our job is to deliver independence</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said the Brexit plan being proposed by Boris Johnson was particularly disadvantageous to Scotland.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If there is to be a deal, it seems inevitable that it will include a process to allow Northern Ireland to decide if and for how long it will stay aligned to the single market and customs union.</p> \n   <p>And that\u2019s exactly as it should be.</p> \n   <p>But think about what that will mean.</p> \n   <p>Wales will have voted to leave.</p> \n   <p>England will have voted to leave.</p> \n   <p>Northern Ireland will be given a say over its future.</p> \n   <p>Scotland will be the only country in the UK to be taken out of the EU against our will and with no say over our future relationship with Europe.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She insisted that the SNP would reject not just the politics of Johnson/Trump-style \u201ccrude populism\u201d, but its methods too. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Politics today is dominated \u2013 in too many countries \u2013 by strongman leaders with inflated egos and an overbearing sense of entitlement ...</p> \n   <p>We oppose the politics of Johnson and Trump.</p> \n   <p>But let us be clear today that we reject their methods too.</p> \n   <p>Crude populism tramples on the rights of minorities and tears at the very fabric of our democracy.</p> \n   <p>That is not for us.</p> \n   <p>That is not who we are.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said the SNP would reject Vote Leave\u2019s tactics in the independence campaign.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will win our independence.</p> \n   <p>But not the Brexit way.</p> \n   <p>Not by undermining democracy, demonising those who disagree, and plastering lies on the side of a bus.</p> \n   <p>We will win by inspiring and persuading.</p> \n   <p>So let us resolve today that how we campaign for independence will always reflect the open, tolerant, inclusive and democratic nation we are determined to build.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Scotland was large enough to be a successful independent country.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Seven out of the ten wealthiest developed countries are of a size similar to or smaller than Scotland.</p> \n   <p>From Luxembourg to Ireland from Austria to Switzerland and Norway, countries of our size lead the world.</p> \n   <p>And they tend to be happier as well.</p> \n   <p>Eight out of ten of the world\u2019s happiest countries have populations similar to or smaller than ours.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said if the SNP won the 2021 Holyrood elections it would expand childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said the Scottish government would legislate to offer more protection to the victims of domestic violence.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need to change the reality that for women and their children, often the only way to escape an abuser is to flee their home.</p> \n   <p>For too many, that results in the victims of abuse becoming homeless.</p> \n   <p>So I can announce today that within this parliamentary term, we will introduce a new law to establish emergency protective orders.</p> \n   <p>It should not be the victims of abuse who lose their homes, it should be the perpetrators.</p> \n   <p>And these orders will help to ensure that is the case.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She announced \u00a327m in funding for schemes to promote walking and cycling.</strong> This came in a passage in which she praised the teenage climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg and said the government had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to leave a healthy planet for the next generation.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

But she offered little on what happens when Westminster says no to her request \u2013 as Boris Johnson has said he will on numerous occasions and Labour has swithered about, most recently with John McDonnell saying there would be no pact with the SNP over a second vote. </p> \n  <p>Instead Sturgeon threw the responsibility back on Westminster, insisting: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties \u2013 what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also repeated her warning to Jeremy Corbyn in the event of Labour seeking SNP support in another hung parliament: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you don\u2019t respect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don\u2019t even bother picking up the phone.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>While none of this was new, these are perhaps the messages for the people in the hall. She started with a scathing attack on the \u201ccrude populism\u201d sweeping the globe, singling out Donald Trump and Johnson for especial derision. I\u2019d suggest that this is a message for beyond the hall. Already SNP ministers have spent conference insisting on the importance of a legal and internationally recognised independence referendum. This attack on populism, and the reassurance that the SNP thinks and acts differently, is likewise an attempt to project the image of an outward-looking, international, serious party, particularly to voters anxious not just at Brexit chaos but also this rightwing populist trend.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon got particular laughs for this passage towards the end of the speech, as she called for Scotland to \u201creclaim our independence\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m utterly sick of Westminster.

Labour have won the last 26 general elections here.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson appears to be on the brink of reaching a Brexit deal after making major concessions to EU demands over the Irish border. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs that he is not yet in a position to confirm whether or not there will be an emergency sitting on Saturday. Referring to the talks in Brussels, he said: The issue there is that a Saturday sitting is an extremely unusual process dependent on events, but the events that may require that Saturday sitting have not yet reached their fruition. And it is only after that point has been reached that it would be sensible to confirm what exactly will be happening on Saturday, but of course it will be my aim to bring an announcement to the house as soon as possible with that regard. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that it is \u201cnot sustainable\u201d for Westminster to refuse Scotland another independence referendum. In her speech closing the SNP conference she said that the Brexit plan being proposed by Boris Johnson was particularly unfair to Scotland because it would be the only part of the UK being taken out of the EU against its will. (See 5pm.) She confirmed that she would formally ask the UK government before the end of this year for permission to hold a new independence referendum (a requirement for a referendum to have legal force). And she claimed that Westminster politicians were starting to accept a referendum would have to take place. She said: The Westminster refusal [to allow a referendum] is not sustainable. We can already see the cracks appearing. The Labour leaderships in London and Wales have recognised our right to choose. They make Scottish Labour look even more ridiculous than normal. The other parties are so lacking in confidence that a referendum can be blocked that they\u2019re now trying to rig the question. Just like us, they know there is going to be a referendum. And they know that when there is, Scotland will choose independence ... Some polls suggest that an election might result in a hung parliament. The SNP will never put the Tories into power. But I have a message for any Westminster party that wants SNP support. If you don\u2019t respect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don\u2019t even bother picking up the phone. Extinction Rebellion has said it will fight a ban on activists protesting in London in court, as the capital\u2019s mayor, a key ally of the police, distanced himself from the crackdown. The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the global financial system is backing carbon-producing projects that will raise the temperature of the planet by over 4C \u2013 more than double the pledge to limit increases to well below 2% contained in the Paris agreement. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand Here is the Times\u2019 Kenny Farquharson on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s speech. Here are more quotes from what Leo Varadkar said to reporters in Ireland. He said: I\u2019m going to get a briefing this evening. The situation may have changed in the past few hours but the gap was still quite wide on the issue of customs. Asked about the potential for an extension to article 50, he said: If we can get to an agreement on Thursday or Friday and if the House of Commons is able to vote in favour in an indicative vote in favour of that agreement on Saturday, it may not even be necessary to consider an extension, but it\u2019s too early to make an assessment at this stage. While there was a gap, Varadkar said he and Johnson had agreed a landing zone at their three-hour meeting in Wirral last Thursday. What I said last week was that I saw a pathway towards agreement and there is a difference between a pathway and agreement. What we discussed was those key stumbling blocks \u2013 consent and democracy, customs and the wider issues of the north-south east-west relationship. I think we had a broad meeting of minds and landing zone in mind, but actually turning that into a legal agreement is a different thing, and that\u2019s the kind of work that is under way. Here is the full text of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s speech to the SNP conference. And here are the main points. Sturgeon confirmed that before the end of this year she would ask the UK government to approve another independence referendum. She said a vote for independence had to be legal. The process by which we choose Scotland\u2019s future must be capable of actually achieving independence. It must allow majority support to be expressed clearly and unambiguously. It must be legal. And it must have the recognition of the international community. Why? Because our job is not just to deliver a referendum. Our job is to deliver independence She said the Brexit plan being proposed by Boris Johnson was particularly disadvantageous to Scotland. If there is to be a deal, it seems inevitable that it will include a process to allow Northern Ireland to decide if and for how long it will stay aligned to the single market and customs union. And that\u2019s exactly as it should be. But think about what that will mean. Wales will have voted to leave. England will have voted to leave. Northern Ireland will be given a say over its future. Scotland will be the only country in the UK to be taken out of the EU against our will and with no say over our future relationship with Europe. She insisted that the SNP would reject not just the politics of Johnson/Trump-style \u201ccrude populism\u201d, but its methods too. Politics today is dominated \u2013 in too many countries \u2013 by strongman leaders with inflated egos and an overbearing sense of entitlement ... We oppose the politics of Johnson and Trump. But let us be clear today that we reject their methods too. Crude populism tramples on the rights of minorities and tears at the very fabric of our democracy. That is not for us. That is not who we are. She said the SNP would reject Vote Leave\u2019s tactics in the independence campaign. We will win our independence. But not the Brexit way. Not by undermining democracy, demonising those who disagree, and plastering lies on the side of a bus. We will win by inspiring and persuading. So let us resolve today that how we campaign for independence will always reflect the open, tolerant, inclusive and democratic nation we are determined to build. She said Scotland was large enough to be a successful independent country. Seven out of the ten wealthiest developed countries are of a size similar to or smaller than Scotland. From Luxembourg to Ireland from Austria to Switzerland and Norway, countries of our size lead the world. And they tend to be happier as well. Eight out of ten of the world\u2019s happiest countries have populations similar to or smaller than ours. She said if the SNP won the 2021 Holyrood elections it would expand childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds. She said the Scottish government would legislate to offer more protection to the victims of domestic violence. We need to change the reality that for women and their children, often the only way to escape an abuser is to flee their home. For too many, that results in the victims of abuse becoming homeless. So I can announce today that within this parliamentary term, we will introduce a new law to establish emergency protective orders. It should not be the victims of abuse who lose their homes, it should be the perpetrators. And these orders will help to ensure that is the case. She announced \u00a327m in funding for schemes to promote walking and cycling. This came in a passage in which she praised the teenage climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg and said the government had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to leave a healthy planet for the next generation. From HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh Here are the full quotes from Leo Varakdar when he spoke to journalists a few minutes ago. He said: I have to go back to the office now and get a briefing from Brussels but the initial indications are that we are making progress, that the negotiations are moving in the right direction but whether we will be able to conclude or revise a withdrawal agreement which is, after all, an international treaty, in time for the summit on Thursday, that is as of now unclear ... The prime minister said to me if we could come to an agreement between the EU and the UK, I think he was confident he could get it through the House of Commons. Of course there are a few hurdles between now and then. First we have to come to an agreement at negotiator level, then it has to be agreed at European council and third by the House of Commons. So a few more hurdles to get over. More from Leo Varadkar. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister), has been speaking to journalists. He was meant to be talking about a new road in County Mayo, but obviously Brexit came up. These are from Laura Kuenssberg and John Campbell from the BBC. Nicola Sturgeon has just finished her SNP conference speech. She was relaxed and jokey, enjoying numerous ovations, despite not actually saying much new about the central question of independence. She confirmed that she would ask the Westminster government for the legal powers, a section 30 order, to hold another referendum by the end of the year and that she wants to hold that referendum next year. But she offered little on what happens when Westminster says no to her request \u2013 as Boris Johnson has said he will on numerous occasions and Labour has swithered about, most recently with John McDonnell saying there would be no pact with the SNP over a second vote. Instead Sturgeon threw the responsibility back on Westminster, insisting: The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties \u2013 what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future? She also repeated her warning to Jeremy Corbyn in the event of Labour seeking SNP support in another hung parliament: If you don\u2019t respect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don\u2019t even bother picking up the phone. While none of this was new, these are perhaps the messages for the people in the hall. She started with a scathing attack on the \u201ccrude populism\u201d sweeping the globe, singling out Donald Trump and Johnson for especial derision. I\u2019d suggest that this is a message for beyond the hall. Already SNP ministers have spent conference insisting on the importance of a legal and internationally recognised independence referendum. This attack on populism, and the reassurance that the SNP thinks and acts differently, is likewise an attempt to project the image of an outward-looking, international, serious party, particularly to voters anxious not just at Brexit chaos but also this rightwing populist trend. Sturgeon got particular laughs for this passage towards the end of the speech, as she called for Scotland to \u201creclaim our independence\u201d. I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m utterly sick of Westminster. I\u2019m sick of Brexit. And I\u2019ve had more than enough of people like Jacob Rees-Mogg lording it over us while lounging across the benches of the House of Commons as if he owns the place. The people of Scotland are seeing all of this for what it is. A broken political system. Boris Johnson appears to be on the brink of reaching a Brexit deal after making major concessions to EU demands over the Irish border, my colleague Daniel Boffey and Jon Henley report. The Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge has more on what Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told EU ministers at the general affairs council meeting this morning. Speaking in Paris, a senior French official advised \u201cextreme prudence\u201d about the chances of any deal being reached this week. It\u2019s not the Irish who will make the deal. Yes, there are better atmospherics but what matters is the content and we have seen nothing yet. Whatever it is, we will want to look at it in very serious detail. Asked what would happen if this week\u2019s EU summit concluded on Friday with no formal accord on a legal text but an agreement to keep talking, the official said France would consider a new Brexit extension carefully as long as one was requested. Paris has previously said it would only approve a fresh delay for a major democratic development such as an election or a second referendum. It will very much depend on the nature of that agreement, on our estimation of whether or not it will actually work and be operable, on whether it looks likely to be approved by the British parliament, on what the European parliament thinks of it. That\u2019s a lot of hurdles to clear. We are still not clear of a no deal by accident. Anti-Brexit campaigner Joanna Cherry, who has received plaudits for her dogged court actions on article 50, prorogation and the Benn act, and been tipped as a future SNP leader, has given to an interview to Holyrood magazine that will delight SNP-watchers for its detail. Cheekily published a few hours before Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s closing speech to SNP conference in Aberdeen, Cherry reveals to editor Mandy Rhodes that she received just one congratulatory text from Sturgeon following her win at the supreme court, and that she has only sat down with the FM once since she became an MP in 2015, concluding: I don\u2019t know her very well. She\u2019s running the country; I\u2019m down in Westminster ... So, I\u2019m not complaining that I\u2019m not Nicola\u2019s best mate. In what can only be interpreted as a sideswipe at the current SNP leader, she goes on to describe Alex Salmond as a friend and \u201cthe greatest leader the party\u2019s ever had\u201d, adding that she trusts the Scottish courts to do justice in his forthcoming sexual assault trial. Asked directly about SNP leadership, Cherry reportedly consults her notes before saying: I\u2019d love to play a leadership role in a future independent Scotland, but leadership doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being the leader of the party or being the first minister. There\u2019s lots of leadership roles, and I want to play my part, but no woman should ever write herself off as a potential leader. I\u2019ve worked very hard in my role and I know I\u2019ve got quite a big public profile now and I\u2019m popular with the party membership, but there isn\u2019t a vacancy for an SNP leader. She adds that speculation is \u201ca set-up by journalists\u201d. But she refuses to rule herself out, explaining: That\u2019s why some people think I\u2019ve got a big ego, because I don\u2019t say: \u2018Oh no, it couldn\u2019t possibly be little old me.\u2019 That is what women are expected to do, but if I was a man of my age, with my professional background, people would take it for granted that I might want a leadership role, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t have to apologise for it. But other EU experts are picking up more negative indications. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has posted a detailed Twitter thread on the Brexit talks. It starts here. And here are her conclusions. Bloomberg is reporting that UK and EU negotiators are \u201cclosing in on a draft Brexit deal\u201d. This is from Bloomberg\u2019s Paul Dobson. The pound has gone up following the publication of this story. In Aberdeen Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is delivering her speech to the SNP conference. I will post a summary when I\u2019ve read the full text. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. My colleague Ben Quinn published a good story yesterday explaining why a December polling day would cause such problems for election administrators. PoliticsHome\u2019s Alain Tolhurst says the Sedwill advice would mean that, unless MPs vote for an election by the end of next week, we could be waiting until February for an election. Here is a useful Twitter thread on Brexit from Mujtaba Rahman, the Brexit analyst for the Eurasia consultancy. It starts here. Here are two of his tweets. And here is his conclusion. Boris Johnson has actually won a vote in the House of Commons. It was on a statutory instrument relating to air quality (pdf), and the government won by 280 votes to 204 \u2013 a majority of 76. There was some merriment in the Commons as the result was announced because this was such an unusual event. \u201cI realise this is a unique moment,\u201d said Eleanor Laing, the deputy Speaker, who was in the chair. Johnson has been prime minister for almost three months now and that was the first proper vote he has won in the Commons. Technically he has won one other vote, on an amendment to the Benn Act designed to give MPs a vote on the Theresa May Brexit plan. But that amendment, which was defeated by 495 votes to 65, was opposed by Labour MPs as well as by most Tories, and so it was not a government v opposition contest. In an interview with Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live Amber Rudd, the former Tory cabinet minister who now sits as an independent after resigning the whip over Brexit, said she saw \u201ca whiff of sexism\u201d in the way some Brexiter Tories were supporting Boris Johnson after they forced Theresa May out of power. She explained: There are certain behaviours that particularly men in politics want to see, that women don\u2019t so much, that Boris [Johnson] did adopt, which has given the ERG [European Research Group] members a lot of confidence. For instance, I was very opposed to the prime minister expelling 21 colleagues from the party as members of parliament, and I felt very strongly that Ken Clarke, who had been in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet, should have a place in Boris Johnson\u2019s party. But [Johnson] took a different view, and I thought that was a very aggressive thing to do, and unnecessary, and has had the effect of radicalising the 21 - which I have now joined. That sort of aggressive behaviour, though, may be the sort of thing that a group of ERG men, particularly, wanted to see. In the interview Rudd also said she had not yet decided whether or not she will stand as an independent candidate at the the next election in a new constituency. She has already ruled out standing again in Hastings and Rye, where she had a majority of just 346 at the last election. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has delivered a short business statement. We thought he might announce details of the sitting planned for Saturday, but instead he just announced that after the Queen\u2019s speech debate tomorrow there will be a short debate under section 3(2) of the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation Act). Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, asked if Rees-Mogg could clarify what would happen on Saturday. Rees-Mogg said a Saturday sitting would be a very rare occurrence. He said he could not announce plans for one yet because that would be dependent on the outcome of talks that are still taking place. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin A no-deal Brexit could \u201cerode\u201d the international reputation of British universities, according to the credit rating agency S&amp;P, by cutting them off from EU staff and research activity. It says: Any potential negative effects of a no-deal Brexit on UK universities will materialise in the long term rather than imminently. Isolation from EU research projects, uncertainty about work permit conditions, and the pound depreciating further against the euro could render UK universities less attractive to EU academics. Over time, this could erode the global reputations of some UK universities, especially those below the top tier. On the other hand, a weaker sterling in a no-deal scenario could attract overseas students to UK universities and somewhat boost their competitiveness. German government sources remain sceptical on whether the UK will follow up on hints at flexibility around its red lines with sufficient legal detail by tomorrow. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to brief heads of state with a progress report on Wednesday afternoon. After last week\u2019s meeting between Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson, officials in Berlin are optimistic the British government is actively trying to reach a deal, and that it is no longer ruling out compromises it has ruled out in the past. At the same time, there is a belief that all possible solutions to the Irish border questions have already been played through over the last three years \u2013 and that the reasons they were rejected the first time around haven\u2019t gone away. After Emmanuel Macron spoke to Boris Johnson by phone this morning, \u00c9lys\u00e9e officials stressed that there must be complete clarity tonight on whether or not a Brexit withdrawal agreement is possible. An official said talks would continue today, adding: We want to be able to evaluate the situation tonight. The European council will then act on that evaluation. France said technical negotiations would not take place at the summit itself on Thursday and Friday. \u201cThere won\u2019t be long nights of discussions on a text at the European council.\u201d Asked about the possibility of extending article 50, the French official said now was not the moment to speculate on possible scenarios in the future, but added: There would have to be a justification for any extension, there couldn\u2019t be an abstract extension. More from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg A \u201ctechnical extension\u201d is the term being used to apply to what would happen if the UK and the EU can agree the outline of a deal before 31 October, but need more time to pass the legislation and tie down the legal detail. In practice a technical extension is just an extension, but it would be acceptable to the EU on the grounds that it had a clear purpose and there have been suggestions that some people in No 10 believe Boris Johnson could justify it to the voters on the grounds that Brexit was happening \u201cin spirit\u201d (my paraphrase) on 31 October, if not in practice. A number of cabinet ministers were seen going into No 10 on Tuesday afternoon, the Press Association is reporting. They included: the chancellor, Sajid Javid; the foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab; the international trade secretary, Liz Truss; the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom; and culture secretary, Nicky Morgan. And on the subject of polling, the latest ITV/Cardiff University Welsh barometer poll gives the Conservatives a significant lead over Labour in Wales. It puts the Tories on 29% (up 5 points from the same poll in July) and Labour on 25% (up 3). Here are the figures. At the 2017 general election Labour won 49% of the vote in Wales, and the Conservatives just 34%. In his analysis of the figures Prof Roger Awan-Scully from Cardiff University says Brexit helps to explain the shift over the last two years. He says: What the poll shows above all, though, are the stark divisions in Wales \u2013 as across most of Britain \u2013 on the issue of Brexit. Among 2016 Remain voters, the Conservatives are in a distant fourth place, while the Brexit Party wins literally zero percent support; among 2016 Leavers, the Conservatives win nearly half of all support (49%) and the Brexit Party the bulk of the remainder (another 29%) ... What these figures suggest is that any general election occurring soon would open the possibility of profound changes in Welsh politics. Labour have won the last 26 general elections here. You don\u2019t manage that without having some serious staying power, so it would take a brave person to bet heavily against them doing so once more. But the tectonic plates may be shifting. The Irish taoiseach (prime minister), Leo Varadkar, is enjoying a huge rise in his personal approval ratings in Ireland following his meeting with Boris Johnson in Wirral last Thursday, which revived hopes of a Brexit deal being reached, the Irish Times is reporting. Here is an extract from Pat Leahy\u2019s story. Mr Varadkar sees his personal rating jump by 15 points since May, ending an 18-month long period of decline. More than half of all voters (51 per cent) now say they are satisfied with Mr Varadkar\u2019s performance as taoiseach, his best rating in a year ... In addition, there is strong approval for the government\u2019s handling of both the economy and Brexit. More than half of all voters (54 per cent) say the government is doing a good job on handling the economy while six out of 10 voters (60 per cent) approve of the government\u2019s handling of Brexit. On making a compromise on the backstop, however, voters are almost evenly split \u2013 a small majority among those who expressed a preference (47 per cent) suggested that the government should not compromise on the backstop to achieve a deal, even if this risks a hard border, with 42 per cent in favour of compromise. By comparison, in Britain only about 20% of voters think their government is handling Brexit well. Here is a chart from YouGov. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has joined those criticising the Metropolitan police for announcing a city-wide ban on the Extinction Rebellion protests in London last night. Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, is to take an unpaid job as chair of ITV\u2019s new Mental Health Advisory Group, PA Media is reporting. The body, which is being set up following the deaths of participants of the Jeremy Kyle Show and Love Island, is intended to advise on how to protect the mental wellbeing of participants and audiences on ITV shows. Conservative party leaflets obtained by the BBC suggest the party is preparing for a delay to Brexit, the BBC is reporting. The text of one leaflet says: \u201cWithout a strong majority government, we can\u2019t deliver Brexit\u201d \u2013 even though Boris Johnson is theoretically committed to delivering Brexit by 31 October, without a majority and ahead of a general election. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, told LBC this morning that, if Boris Johnson can agree a Brexit deal with the EU, the government will have the votes to get it through the Commons. He said: If a deal is agreed with the European Union, it will get through, in my view, the House of Commons because everybody\u2019s desperate to finish this. He also claimed that if MPs voted for the deal in principle \u2013 something that could happen on Saturday, assuming the UK and the EU do agree a deal \u2013 passing the legislation to implement it would be easy. He said: If the meaningful vote goes through, then the legislation will merely be the ratification in domestic law of the treaty and that, I think, is a relatively easy bill to pass if, if there is a deal. These are from Newsnight\u2019s diplomatic editor, Mark Urban. And here are two other lines from the No 10 lobby briefing. Boris Johnson is urging Uefa to impose tougher penalties on football clubs with racist fans. These are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn and the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young. And Johnson himself has just tweeted on this. The UK is suspending arms exports to Turkey for use in Syria, No 10 has announced. This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. Boris Johnson told French president Emmanuel Macron that UK officials would \u201ccontinue to work hard\u201d on securing a Brexit deal, Downing Street said. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the morning lobby briefing: The prime minister had a call with President Macron of France this morning in which they discussed the progress of the Brexit talks. The prime minister said that in advance of the EU council, UK officials would continue to work hard on securing a deal. The PM and the president also expressed their deep concerns at the Turkish incursion and agreed to continue to stay in close contact. The spokesman characterised the call as a \u201cconstructive\u201d and \u201cgood discussion\u201d which lasted \u201c20 minutes or so\u201d. Here is my colleague Daniel Boffey\u2019s story on the latest from the Brexit talks. And this is how it starts. Michel Barnier has set Boris Johnson a midnight deadline to concede to EU demands and agree to a customs border in the Irish Sea or be left with nothing to take to the Commons. According to sources, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator told ministers that, as it stood, there was no prospect of a deal being signed off by leaders at a summit on Thursday, before a special sitting of the UK parliament on Saturday. Legal text had yet to be tabled by the British negotiators, Barnier told ministers in Luxembourg. He advised the EU capitals he would announce on Wednesday whether negotiations on an agreement would have to continue into next week. Barnier warned that the starting point for a deal had to be the Northern Ireland-only backstop, keeping it in the EU\u2019s single market for goods and erecting a customs border in the Irish Sea, a proposal previously rejected by Theresa May. After the meeting, Belgium\u2019s deputy prime minister, Didier Reynders, told reporters: \u201cIf we have an agreement tonight it will be possible to go to the [European] council and then again to the British parliament. But it\u2019s not easy, we have some red lines, they are well known by all the partners. I\u2019m hoping it will be possible today to make some progress.\u201d RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly has more from the briefing from Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy PM. Coveney was speaking after he and other EU ministers were briefed by Michel Barnier at the general affairs council. Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, told journalists that Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said this morning he was seeking a Brexit deal with Britain by the end of the day. Speaking after Barnier briefed EU ministers, Asselborn said: There is some optimism, he is trying for a deal tonight ... Otherwise, we will most probably need another summit later this month. Reuters has sent out this snap headline. FRENCH OFFICIAL SAYS A DEAL ON BREXIT IS POSSIBLE, EVERYBODY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, BUT CAN\u2019T SAY IF \u201cLANDING\u201d WILL BE POSSIBLE TONIGHT And this is from Reuters\u2019 Guy Faulconbridge. This is from Reuters\u2019 Gabriela Baczynska. Here is more from the Simon Coveney briefing. From Euronews\u2019s Shona Murray From Independent News\u2019s Kevin Doyle From RT\u00c9\u2019s Tony Connelly Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, posted this on Twitter after his appearance at the general affairs council. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg This is from Sky\u2019s Sophia McBride. She is quoting Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy PM. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, told Good Morning Scotland earlier that the EU27 might refuse to grant a Brexit extension out of sympathy for Boris Johnson. Referring to the Benn act, which requires the PM has to ask for an extension if no Brexit deal has been agreed by 19 October, Jack said: [Johnson] can make it very clear that he doesn\u2019t want to ask for that extension, that he\u2019s being forced to ask for that extension, and some European leaders may sympathise with him on that and feel that it\u2019s unfair that he should have to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do. If one of our European partners decides \u2013 and it could well be the French president \u2013 to use his veto and decides enough is enough, in that situation we would be leaving. Asked if Johnson should resign if he has to delay Brexit, having promised repeatedly that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October, Jack replied: He absolutely should not resign. The prime minister fully intends for us to leave by October 31. He will stand by that. Jack also faced embarrassment when it was put to him that the Queen\u2019s speech yesterday failed to mention Scotland. \u201cFair point,\u201d he replied. But he said there were 21 bills in the speech that applied in whole or in part to Scotland. Angela Merkel has likened the attempt to find a solution for the inner-Irish border to \u201csquaring the circle\u201d. Speaking at a summit for Germany\u2019s mechanical engineers in Berlin, the chancellor reiterated this morning that her government would push for a solution until the last possible moment, but also said the negotiations had got \u201cvery complicated\u201d since it had become clear that Britain wanted to leave the customs union. For the third time in just over a month, Merkel repeated a line that has raised some eyebrows in the UK: in Britain, Merkel said, \u201cthe European Union will have a further competitor right on the European Union\u2019s doorstep\u201d. In a strongly pro-EU speech, Merkel made the case for multilateral institutions, pointing towards the current shutdown of the World Trade Organization\u2019s dispute settlement court in Geneva as an example of the risks that came with countries ploughing down their own path single-mindedly. This is from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming. Fleming might be referring to this tweet from the Daily Mail\u2019s David Churchill. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has finished addressing EU ministers at the general affairs council. From Bloomberg\u2019s Nikos Chrysoloras From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming From the broadcaster Georg von Harrach And this is what George Ciamba, the Romanian Europe minister, said about Brexit as he arrived at the general affairs council meeting. Of course we cannot jeopardise the single market. It is very important that any kind of solution should be realistic, practical and at the same time we could not jeopardise the principles of the single market. Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, France\u2019s Europe minister, told reporters as she arrived at the EU general affairs council meeting that France would consider a Brexit extension, but that just allowing more time would not provide a solution. This is from France 24\u2019s Stuart Norval. UPDATE: Here is the full quote from Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin. Time alone is not a solution. However, if a significant political change takes place in the UK then that could potentially justify a discussion on an extension if we were asked for it. A significant political change is the prospect of an election, a referendum, something that changes the political dynamic so that the triangle between the government, parliament and the British people could align with each other a bit more. We believe that time alone will not solve the complexity of what is at stake. Here is longer version of what the German Europe minister Michael Roth said when he arrived at the EU general affairs council. Asked if he thought a deal was close, he replied: I\u2019m not quite sure if a deal is close. But we are trying to do our utmost best to find such a good deal because a hard Brexit would be a disaster, not just for the UK but for the EU27 ... We are extremely flexible. The integrity of the single market is key. The Good Friday agreement is key for us. And I hope that our friends in London understand our clear messages. Asked if he was optimistic, he said he was always an optimist. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is attending the EU general affairs council in Luxembourg. As he arrived he said: The talks are ongoing. We need to give them space to proceed. But detailed conversations are under way and a deal is still very possible. The Dutch foreign affairs minister, Stef Blok, gave a relatively downbeat assessment of the prospects of a Brexit deal when he arrived for the EU general affairs council meeting in Luxembourg earlier. Asked what had to happen for there to be a deal this week, he replied: The UK proposal contained some steps forward, but not enough to guarantee that the internal market will be protected. Of course consumers, companies in the Netherlands, have to be assured that there will not be byways through the Northern Irish border for products out of the European Union. It is up to the UK to confirm ... that the integrity of the single market will be protected. From Bloomberg Nathalie Loiseau, the French former Europe minister in President Macron\u2019s government who now sits as an MEP, told the Today programme that it was important to get the legal details of any new UK-EU plan for Northern Ireland properly sorted out. Asked if she could see a scenario in which the broad outline of an agreement was reached, with legal texts coming later, she replied: An agreement can only be detailed, credible, sustainable. And we have to have clarity on every single aspect. She also said any agreement \u201chas to be able to last\u201d. The backstop plan agreed with Theresa May took \u201ctwo years of hard work and goodwill\u201d to negotiate, she said. She went on: You don\u2019t replace it in one minute. This is a very serious issue. It has consequences on lives of many people on both sides of the Channel. So goodwill, yes, but to rush to a deal in any circumstance, certainly not. Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister and an enthusiastic Brexiter (unlike Jeremy Hunt, who voted remain in 2016), took a different view when he was interviewed on Today this morning. He said he did not think a Brexit delay would be necessary. He said: I don\u2019t think an extension is necessary. If both sides wish to secure a deal, a deal can be secured. It\u2019s a matter of political will. Where there\u2019s a will there is a way, and that has never been more true than in the case of Brexit. Jeremy Hunt has said it will be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to get a Brexit deal through without an extension. The former foreign secretary, who was Boris Johnson\u2019s main rival in the Tory leadership contest in the summer, told the Today programme: I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get a deal, with all the legislation, through parliament by October 31 which is why I didn\u2019t want to offer that guarantee during the leadership campaign in the summer. But I still hope it happens. And I still think, for the first time, if there is a deal and, frankly if we needed an extension of a few days I think people would just feel the end is in sight and that\u2019s the important thing. Asked whether there would be a deal by the end of the month and if it would get through parliament, Hunt said: I think one of the mistakes that we made is to think that the difficulty in getting a deal is about malevolence from the EU, when actually there is a certain bureaucratic inertia in the way the EU operates. Because it is, frankly, a nightmare to get 27, 28 countries to agree on anything. So I\u2019ve always thought that there just won\u2019t be a way to overcome that inertia unless Ireland decides they want a deal. And if Ireland is hanging out and saying: \u2018We can\u2019t leave with what\u2019s on the table\u2019, then I think the rest of the EU countries will follow suit. I think what\u2019s encouraging about the last week is that the Irish seem to have changed their calculations and worked out that if they had to face Boris Johnson with a majority in parliament after a general election that might be someone who is actually harder to deal with than the Boris Johnson they have now. Tytti Tuppurainen, Finland\u2019s Europe minister, told reporters as she arrived at the EU general affairs council that the EU was preparing for \u201call possible scenarios\u201d: Hopefully we will have a deal, but we have also to prepare ourselves for a no deal, and also have to be ready to consider another extension. So all the options are open, and today we are going to hear the latest news from Michel Barnier. Finland holds the rotating presidency of the EU, and yesterday the Finnish prime minister, Antti Rinne, said it was too late to reach an agreement on Brexit before the EU summit starting on Thursday. \u201cI think there is no time in a practical or legal way to find an agreement before the EU council meeting.\u201d Asked if she agreed with her boss, Tuppurainen did not say no, but she did not back up his assessment either. I know there have been intensive talks between the United Kingdom and our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Today he will update us on where we are going. We have to use every minute that we have in order to avoid the no-deal situation that would be very harmful to us all. Asked if EU ministers would discuss extending article 50 (ie, extending Brexit) today, Tuppurainen said not \u201cas such\u201d and that this would be a matter for leaders to discuss at the summit. But she also stressed that the UK would have to request an extension: Later this week, [at] the European summit, the leaders will probably assess a possible extension. But it has to be a request from the government of the United Kingdom, of course. Michael Roth, Germany\u2019s Europe minister, told reporters he was \u201cnot quite sure\u201d whether a Brexit deal was close, as he arrived for the EU general affairs council meeting in Luxembourg. But he also said a no-deal Brexit would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d. These are from RT\u00c9\u2019s Tony Connelly. When Michel Barnier spoke to journalists this morning, he stressed the need for the UK to provide \u201clegal text\u201d. (See 8.46am.) But British sources have been playing down the significance of the next text. Reuters have just sent out this. Brexit talks between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued until late on Monday and will begin again on Tuesday morning but that is routine and nothing to get excited about, a British source close to the negotiations said. \u201cTalks took place until 11pm last night and are due to begin again this morning,\u201d the source said. \u201cAs part of the talks process, there is of course back and forth and new texts have been shared by both sides repeatedly \u2013 that\u2019s what a negotiation is,\u201d the source said. \u201cThis is routine, nothing to get excited about.\u201d EU ministers in Luxembourg have just started a meeting of the general affairs council, the body that prepares the groundwork for the EU summit starting on Thursday. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is briefing them on the progress in the Brexit talks. Speaking to reporters as he arrived, he gave a balanced assessment, saying an agreement was \u201cdifficult\u201d but \u201cstill possible this week\u201d. He said: Our team are working hard ... This work has been intense all over the weekend and yesterday because, even if the agreement will be difficult \u2013 more and more difficult, to be frank \u2013 it is still possible this week ... Reaching an agreement is still possible. Obviously any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the United Kingdom and the whole of the European Union. Let me add also that it is high time to turn good intentions into a legal text. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: The Commons Brexit committee takes evidence from Northern Ireland specialists. 9.30am: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 10am: Officials from the Jo Cox Foundation give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee on hate crime. After 11.30am: The Queen\u2019s speech debate resumes in the Commons, focusing on foreign affairs. 3pm: Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, gives evidence to the Commons business committee. 3.15pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, gives her keynote speech at the end of the Scottish National party conference in Aberdeen. 5.10pm: Press conference at end of EU general affairs council. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although mostly I will be focusing on Brexit. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

There is so much chaos contained in that sequence of events: under what terms would the UK leave? Under what terms would Scotland and the UK separate? How would Scotland rejoin? And how long would all this take?</p> <p>The only thing you could say for certain is that nobody will be as well off, individually or collectively, as they would have been had the Conservative party washed its laundry in private. Perhaps that goes without saying, but it still seems important that history doesn\u2019t record this destructive phase as culpritless, like a typhoon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/09/independence-scotland-inevitable-scot-nicola-sturgeon\">Independence for Scotland is inevitable \u2013 we need a plan for it | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless, there are some things Scottish people could be reasonably sure of: in 2016, it was considered very unlikely that they could rejoin the EU without England; some nation with its own independence issues \u2013 Spain the most obvious \u2013 would surely veto that. That is no longer the case. The Spanish foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said explicitly at the end of last year that <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-scotland/spain-would-not-oppose-future-independent-scotland-rejoining-eu-minister-idUKKCN1NP25P\" title=\"\">Scotland would be accepted</a>.</p> <p>As important is the Brexiters\u2019 mood music: three years ago it was assumed that their intense nationalism and nostalgia made them the natural defenders of the United Kingdom. The opposite was true: they had no respect for the Good Friday agreement; most leavers were <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/17/brexit-important-keeping-uk-together-public-say-poll-telegraph/\" title=\"\">prepared to see the breakup of the UK</a>. Worse still, these radical stances tumbled out without the ghost of a plan, giving the unavoidable impression that no ardent Brexiter had even considered the voters of Northern Ireland or Scotland or Wales.</p> <p>It is completely understandable that in Scotland support for independence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/snp-sturgeon-to-request-fresh-scottish-independence-referendum-within-weeks\" title=\"\">reached an all-time high of 50% last week</a>. It is, likewise, reasonable for the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to push hard for a second referendum in 2020, the roadmap for which has been widely discussed at the Scottish National party\u2019s conference in Aberdeen.</p> <p>But it is easy to forget, since its result was the status quo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/18/scotland-independence-referendum-family-divide\" title=\"\">how bitter the 2014 referendum was</a>: there was a strong sense among many expat Scottish people living in England \u2013 who didn\u2019t have voting rights \u2013 that independence was a narrow, nationalistic project, dressed up as a grand social one. This debate has been made irrelevant by the crisis in English politics. There is nothing narrow or nationalistic about wanting to separate from a government that actively seeks its own economic destruction.</p> <p>It is perfectly reasonable to look back at the joint pledge to give Scotland more powers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/16/cameron-miliband-clegg-pledge-daily-record\" title=\"\">made by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg</a> just before the referendum \u2013 and say \u201cthis hasn\u2019t been met\u201d (only 9% of Scots think it has). Perhaps the insufficiencies of the Scotland Act in March 2016 were due to a lack of enthusiasm in Westminster for deeper devolution. Now, however, the one thing every party leader can agree on is the absolute constipation of the British state. Who, given the chance, would not try to escape? On pessimistic days, I\u2019d vote for an independent London that could rejoin the EU.</p> <p>But Sturgeon\u2019s immediate tactical hurdle segues into a fundamental contradiction. Her plan is to force a general election via a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson. She then plans to use her leverage with whoever emerges as the largest party to bring about a second independence referendum next year.</p> <p>Realistically, the SNP stands no chance of exerting that pressure on a minority Conservative government, which would be implacably opposed, and wouldn\u2019t be relying on a prop-up from the SNP in the first place. So she\u2019s throwing that gauntlet down for the Labour party, which has often let slip the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/corbyn-westminster-should-not-block-second-scottish-independence-vote\" title=\"\">softer stance on an indy ref</a> of \u201cnot now, but maybe at some time in the future\u201d. Sturgeon\u2019s argument relies heavily on the very area where it is weakest: the Scottish people must have a vote because 50% of them want seismic constitutional change. But 50% don\u2019t. </p> <p>Further, she relies on the inevitability of Brexit to give momentum to the case for independence, yet a Labour government would have a people\u2019s vote as its first order of business. The result, if it went remain, would suck the air out of Sturgeon\u2019s enterprise.</p> <p>Most importantly, the case for Yes in 2014 was a radical, progressive one: the SNP flipped from Tartan Tories to leftwing crusaders; grassroots groups such as Common Weal made a powerful case for social renewal based on equality, pluralism and justice, if only Scotland could throw off the yoke of the self-interested, austerity-obsessed government in Westminster.</p> <p>Were the campaign replayed, this time against a British prime minister holding the same progressive values, they\u2019d be fighting in the cracks: not whether to nationalise, but what to nationalise first; not whether to go carbon-neutral, but wind or solar; not whether to have a humane benefits system, but whose sense of humanity was the keenest. It would be an ugly and pointless scene, in which narrow nationalism might well emerge as the most solid ground, and lofty talk of \u201csovereignty\u201d the best call to arms. And we\u2019ve all seen where that ends.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d is the most intelligent answer to a question: 45% of Scots think Scotland would be better off economically as an independent country within the EU than as part of a post-Brexit UK; 35% disagree; and 20% don\u2019t know, because how could you? There is so much chaos contained in that sequence of events: under what terms would the UK leave? Under what terms would Scotland and the UK separate? How would Scotland rejoin? And how long would all this take? The only thing you could say for certain is that nobody will be as well off, individually or collectively, as they would have been had the Conservative party washed its laundry in private. Perhaps that goes without saying, but it still seems important that history doesn\u2019t record this destructive phase as culpritless, like a typhoon. Nevertheless, there are some things Scottish people could be reasonably sure of: in 2016, it was considered very unlikely that they could rejoin the EU without England; some nation with its own independence issues \u2013 Spain the most obvious \u2013 would surely veto that. That is no longer the case. The Spanish foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said explicitly at the end of last year that Scotland would be accepted. As important is the Brexiters\u2019 mood music: three years ago it was assumed that their intense nationalism and nostalgia made them the natural defenders of the United Kingdom. The opposite was true: they had no respect for the Good Friday agreement; most leavers were prepared to see the breakup of the UK. Worse still, these radical stances tumbled out without the ghost of a plan, giving the unavoidable impression that no ardent Brexiter had even considered the voters of Northern Ireland or Scotland or Wales. It is completely understandable that in Scotland support for independence reached an all-time high of 50% last week. It is, likewise, reasonable for the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to push hard for a second referendum in 2020, the roadmap for which has been widely discussed at the Scottish National party\u2019s conference in Aberdeen. But it is easy to forget, since its result was the status quo, how bitter the 2014 referendum was: there was a strong sense among many expat Scottish people living in England \u2013 who didn\u2019t have voting rights \u2013 that independence was a narrow, nationalistic project, dressed up as a grand social one. This debate has been made irrelevant by the crisis in English politics. There is nothing narrow or nationalistic about wanting to separate from a government that actively seeks its own economic destruction. It is perfectly reasonable to look back at the joint pledge to give Scotland more powers \u2013 made by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg just before the referendum \u2013 and say \u201cthis hasn\u2019t been met\u201d (only 9% of Scots think it has). Perhaps the insufficiencies of the Scotland Act in March 2016 were due to a lack of enthusiasm in Westminster for deeper devolution. Now, however, the one thing every party leader can agree on is the absolute constipation of the British state. Who, given the chance, would not try to escape? On pessimistic days, I\u2019d vote for an independent London that could rejoin the EU. But Sturgeon\u2019s immediate tactical hurdle segues into a fundamental contradiction. Her plan is to force a general election via a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson. She then plans to use her leverage with whoever emerges as the largest party to bring about a second independence referendum next year. Realistically, the SNP stands no chance of exerting that pressure on a minority Conservative government, which would be implacably opposed, and wouldn\u2019t be relying on a prop-up from the SNP in the first place. So she\u2019s throwing that gauntlet down for the Labour party, which has often let slip the softer stance on an indy ref of \u201cnot now, but maybe at some time in the future\u201d. Sturgeon\u2019s argument relies heavily on the very area where it is weakest: the Scottish people must have a vote because 50% of them want seismic constitutional change. But 50% don\u2019t. Further, she relies on the inevitability of Brexit to give momentum to the case for independence, yet a Labour government would have a people\u2019s vote as its first order of business. The result, if it went remain, would suck the air out of Sturgeon\u2019s enterprise. Most importantly, the case for Yes in 2014 was a radical, progressive one: the SNP flipped from Tartan Tories to leftwing crusaders; grassroots groups such as Common Weal made a powerful case for social renewal based on equality, pluralism and justice, if only Scotland could throw off the yoke of the self-interested, austerity-obsessed government in Westminster. Were the campaign replayed, this time against a British prime minister holding the same progressive values, they\u2019d be fighting in the cracks: not whether to nationalise, but what to nationalise first; not whether to go carbon-neutral, but wind or solar; not whether to have a humane benefits system, but whose sense of humanity was the keenest. It would be an ugly and pointless scene, in which narrow nationalism might well emerge as the most solid ground, and lofty talk of \u201csovereignty\u201d the best call to arms. And we\u2019ve all seen where that ends. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>When a pharmaceutical company raised the price of an essential medicine to unacceptable levels, there was only one thing for pharmacist Marleen Kemper to do: start making it herself. When Kemper was in primary school, she had watched two of her classmates get ill. One had a brain tumour, the other contracted an infection in his gut. Both of them died.</p> <p>Kemper was about 10 at the time, and knew she did not want to see another friend perish. She told her parents she wanted to do something that would prevent others dying. She wanted to be a doctor.</p> <p>But training is hypercompetitive in the Netherlands, where Kemper grew up. She didn\u2019t quite have the grades. She liked chemistry, so chose a career in pharmacy instead. She studied for six years and did a residency for another four. She is now a highly respected hospital pharmacist based at Amsterdam UMC\u2019s Academic Medical Centre, a cavernous building crafted out of concrete on the south-east fringe of the Dutch capital.</p> <p>To understand what happened next, you have to understand several things about Kemper. Two of those things date back to her childhood. One was that early experience of losing friends to illness, which instilled in her an urge to do everything she can to make sick people better. The second is that, although she is highly accomplished, Kemper is self-admittedly hard-headed, and has always had a rebellious streak. Sometimes she likes to shock people.</p> <p>Which leads into the third, more recently acquired trait: a steely determination to do right by her patients, whatever the cost. And the cost can be great. In 2017, when the price of a drug used to treat a rare genetic disorder skyrocketed, Kemper was not happy. The result was a dispute that is still going on today, and has spread beyond the walls of the UMC hospital. It has also spread beyond the city of Amsterdam, and beyond even the borders of the Netherlands.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Most of us never have to worry about chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), one of the two primary bile acids produced by the liver. But, for a tiny number of people, a rare genetic trait means they end up short. Having this gene variant prevents the body from creating sterol 27-hydroxylase, a liver enzyme. Without it, the liver won\u2019t convert enough cholesterol into CDCA. The result is an overabundance of other bile acids and substances, which are then pumped out of the liver and through the body, causing untold damage.</p> <p>The illness that results is called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, or CTX. It can cause cataracts, dementia, neurological problems and seizures \u2013 but it can be treated. Since the 1970s, the pharma industry has been able to produce CDCA, and so people who need it can supplement their shortage. The system worked well; the drug was relatively cheap for such a niche illness. A year\u2019s treatment cost about \u20ac30,000 (\u00a326,000) per patient \u2013 until suddenly it didn\u2019t.</p> <p>In 2017, Leadiant Biosciences, which was supplying CDCA to these patients in the EU, raised the price of its version of the drug \u2013 known as CDCA Leadiant \u2013 to more than \u20ac150,000 per patient per year.</p> <p>The price increase soon had an effect. The Netherlands has an insurance-based health system, and in April 2018, Dutch insurers, who had been paying for 50 or so patients across the country to receive the drug, balked at the increase and refused to pay. Patients who were unable to pay themselves would have gone without treatment, so Kemper \u2013 whose hospital was one of the treatment centres for CTX \u2013 stepped in. Amsterdam UMC would produce the medicine for these patients itself, at cost price.</p> <p>She was upset, she admits. \u201cPatients have a medical need. If those patients with CTX don\u2019t get their medication, they get neurological implications, they get complications with their cholesterol and dementia, epilepsy \u2026 it is an essential medicine.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone wanting to manufacture a drug must get a marketing authorisation to do so. But Leadiant had become the only game in town, the owner of exclusive rights to manufacture CDCA commercially in the EU. Still, there was a solution. Under EU rules, pharmacies can make (or \u201ccompound\u201d) a prescribed drug on a small scale for their patients.</p> <p>So Kemper began researching where she could find the ingredients to make CDCA. It was difficult: in the pursuit of better margins, vast numbers of manufacturing companies have closed their factories across the world and concentrated their efforts in China, where the costs of producing pharmaceutical ingredients are lower. Just one European company manufactures the ingredients to EU standards.</p> <p>Kemper approached them and they declined to supply her the raw material. In the end, she found a Chinese manufacturer instead. She went to the hospital\u2019s executive board and gained approval to manufacture the drug. It cost the pharmacy \u20ac28,000 per patient, per year \u2013 pretty much exactly the same as the price of the drug beforehand.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>CDCA was not initially used to treat CTX. It was originally developed to treat gallstones. This main use of the drug \u2013 which, from the mid-70s, had been sold in the Netherlands as Chenofalk \u2013 became outmoded when the standard procedure to deal with troublesome gallstones became to simply cut out the gallbladder entirely.</p> <p>At the turn of the millennium, Dutch doctors started using Chenofalk \u201coff-label\u201d (ie for a use different from that stated on its official licence) to treat CTX \u2013 a practice that carried on for several years. At this time, in the mid-2000s, a year\u2019s supply of Chenofalk cost less than \u20ac500.</p> <p>But in 2008, Leadiant acquired the rights to Chenofalk, and developed its own version, known as CDCA Leadiant. Then, nine days before Christmas 2014, it succeeded in getting its version classified as an \u201corphan medicine\u201d for treating CTX. That classification gave Leadiant the exclusive right to manufacture its CDCA drug commercially in Europe for the next 10 years. In 2015, Leadiant took Chenofalk off the market. In 2017, the price of CDCA Leadiant \u2013 by now the only remaining CDCA option on the market \u2013 was increased from around \u20ac30,000 per patient per year to about \u20ac150,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4dde3372dc5ef8568af294a7636094096029f76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dde3372dc5ef8568af294a7636094096029f76a/0_0_4800_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"illustration by Jake Hollings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Introduced by EU regulation in the year 2000, orphan drug classification is given to drugs that treat serious illnesses that affect fewer than five in every 10,000 people in the EU. Its purpose is to help companies recoup the costs of developing treatments that would otherwise be unlikely to generate a profit. Without it, the pharma industry would not be incentivised to seek new drugs for the rarest diseases. But, in this case, CDCA was already known as a CTX treatment, with Chenofalk having been used off-label to treat it for years. Kemper believes that Leadiant is getting the financial benefits of orphan designation, but for a drug that had gone through development and been released to market long ago. \u201cThere were publications already in the 1980s,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no patents, nothing. It\u2019s really bizarre.\u201d</p> <p>Kemper is not the only one concerned about the price rise and CDCA\u2019s orphan drug status. In September 2018, a lobby group, the Dutch Pharmaceutical Accountability Foundation, asked the Dutch competition authority to investigate the price increase. And this spring Test Achats, a nonprofit consumer-protection organisation in neighbouring Belgium, lodged a complaint against Leadiant with the Belgian Competition Authority.</p> <p>\u201cWe noticed that in 2005, the price for the treatment of a patient in one year was around \u20ac500. Now it\u2019s more than \u20ac150,000,\u201d explains Laura Marcus, legal counsel to Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the sick person but also for the Belgian health system, which is paying most of the [cost of the] treatment.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When a drug company raises the price of its product, and a hospital pharmacy decides not to accept the increase but instead endeavours to compound its own version, undercutting the drug company\u2019s price, things tend to get interesting.</p> <p>In June 2018, Kemper had a phone call from the Dutch health inspectorate. It had received a letter of concern \u2013 who it came from, Amsterdam UMC doesn\u2019t know, although the health inspectorate has said it was acting in response to an enforcement request from Leadiant \u2013 with a long list of things for the investigators to check.</p> <p>Kemper took the news in her stride. She had expected a rocky road. \u201cAs a pharmacist, I am a professional and I know what I\u2019m doing, and we have standards for compounding,\u201d she explains. So she was not worried when, that summer, a team of four inspectorate monitors turned up at the door of her pharmacy in Amsterdam. Two were there to take samples of the raw materials she was using to compound CDCA, and to ensure that all the correct processes were being followed. They rifled through the reams of paperwork and procedures that Kemper had spent hours developing for her staff to follow, while the other two inspectors combed through coverage of the case to ensure that Kemper and her team were not advertising their work, which is prohibited for medicines that have not been given market authorisation.</p> <p>The lab checked out: its processes were up to standard and the paperwork was all in order. But in July Kemper got a phone call that floored her: the inspectorate\u2019s analysis of the raw materials her pharmacy was using to compound the CDCA had discovered that they were not up to snuff. Two components found in it were above allowed limits.</p> <p>\u201cAs a professional you think: what did I miss? It was very emotional, a bit heavy,\u201d she says. In consultation with the board of directors at the hospital, Kemper decided to immediately withdraw the product from patients; the health insurers said they would step in and cover putting the patients back on the Leadiant version of the drug.</p> <p>Kemper personally called the 50 or so patients she was providing with the drug. \u201cThe first one was hard,\u201d she admits. \u201cI expected they\u2019d be angry or something like that. But no, no one [was]. The patients said: \u2018Well, please go on with this job.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Dutch inspectorate has said that Kemper can resume compounding CDCA provided she can find a raw material that does not contain impurities \u2013 something Kemper is keeping tight-lipped about.</p> <p>So, if she can get the materials she needs, Kemper is hopeful to be able to continue compounding CDCA in the future.</p> <p>But for now, it is back to square one \u2013 paying the full price for CDCA Leadiant.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>These events have had wider consequences. What was initially a dispute inside the Netherlands has bled across borders, with Belgian patients with CTX now being affected. It started with a conversation between the Dutch and Belgian health ministers shortly after Kemper\u2019s production of CDCA was halted, says Thomas De Rijdt, head of pharmacy at University Hospitals Leuven. The Dutch minister wanted to know from his Belgian counterpart why Belgian hospitals were able to make the same drug without any issues.</p> <p>\u201cFor Belgium, we have about 10 patients,\u201d De Rijdt says. \u201cThey are helped with the preparations from our hospital and the University Hospital in Antwerp.\u201d</p> <p>These hospitals had been compounding CDCA capsules for CTX patients for years. Leuven had sourced raw materials that had been tested and approved by a laboratory accredited by the Belgian government. But when the case in the Netherlands entered conversation at diplomats\u2019 dinners, the Belgian government wanted to double-check that its raw materials were OK.</p> <p>It ran a second battery of tests \u2013 with a different accredited laboratory \u2013 which came back with a problem. A single impurity was found. The government ordered a quarantine of the raw material and recalled all the CDCA it had made.</p> <p>\u201cThe patients had to return all their medication,\u201d says De Rijdt. Recalling every capsule of the drug from Belgium, and freezing the work of the only two suppliers in the country, meant that people with CTX were suddenly left without any medicine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/09/why-do-new-medicines-cost-so-much-and-what-can-we-do-about-it\">Why do new medicines cost so much, and what can we do about it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you know the disease, you know you can deteriorate very quickly,\u201d says De Rijdt. This was a problem. So, he says, the hospital pharmacists, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance, the health minister and the pharmaceutical inspectorate hit upon a solution. For a year, the Belgian government would reimburse the costs of Leadiant\u2019s drug, allowing those patients to still be treated. (Normally the government only reimburses a portion of a person\u2019s health costs, and the rest is paid for by the patient or insurance.) Over the course of that year, the relevant authorities would then work together to adapt the requirements a raw material must comply with \u2013 to allow versions of drugs with minor impurities, providing they pose no threat to the patient.</p> <p>\u201cWe have bought time to find a solution with the compounding, because we think by compounding we can save healthcare a lot of money for the same quality of therapy,\u201d says De Rijdt. He hopes to have a solution by the end of this year.</p> <p>But in early September, things took another turn. Wouter Beke, the Belgian consumer affairs minister, used his price-regulation powers to bring down the price of CDCA Leadiant to just over \u20ac3,600 a month \u2013 roughly a quarter of the amount Leadiant was charging. If the drug becomes more cheaply available in Belgium, says De Rijdt, then it could end up being exported and available at a lower price elsewhere.</p> <p>But exactly how this will pan out remains unclear. In the meantime, Beke has urged the Belgian Competition Authority to prioritise investigating Leadiant, following the complaint lodged by Test Achats.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Debate over what constitutes a fair price for drugs is not anything new. Nor is it limited to Europe. Because of his willingness to play the bad guy in the press (and an odd moment when he bought a Wu-Tang Clan record), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-shkreli\" title=\"\">Martin Shkreli</a> has attracted more criticism on drug pricing than perhaps anyone else. In 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals, of which Shkreli was CEO, raised the price of its recently acquired antimalarial drug Daraprim, also used to treat Aids-related illnesses. A pill went from $13.50 to $750 overnight \u2013 a 55-fold increase.</p> <p>Shkreli\u2019s capitalist tendencies were criticised by almost everyone. This was unlike the situation with CDCA Leadiant \u2013 there was no argument that the increase was to cover Daraprim\u2019s development costs \u2013 and Shkreli himself was unrepentant: \u201cIf there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don\u2019t think that that should be a crime,\u201d he told reporters.</p> <p>But the Daraprim situation was just the highest-profile example of a contest that is going on constantly between big pharmaceutical companies seeking to profit from drugs, and medical staff on the frontline who worry that such profit-seeking does damage to patients needing treatment. (For what it\u2019s worth, a competitor to Turing Pharmaceuticals announced soon after that it would produce a compound drug containing the same active ingredient in Daraprim \u2013 pyrimethamine \u2013 for $1 a pill, rather than the $750 Shkreli wanted to charge.)</p> <p>One front in this battle has recently opened up in the US. In May, more than 40 states filed an <a href=\"https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2019/05/13/44-ags-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-pfizer-teva-for-allegedly-fixing-prices-of-generic-drugs/?slreturn=20190914084109\" title=\"\">antitrust lawsuit</a> against some of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of generic drugs, alleging that they have colluded to fix the price of more than 100 medicines over a number of years. When prices should go down after a drug\u2019s market exclusivity ended, the antitrust lawsuit claims that many prices have instead shot up \u2013 in some cases by more than 1,000%.</p> <p>Back in Europe, the consumer organisation <a href=\"https://www.consumersinternational.org/members/euroconsumers/\" title=\"\">Euroconsumers</a> \u2013 of which Test Achats is part \u2013 is investigating the prices of other drugs beyond CDCA. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a few problems with a few other drugs,\u201d says Laura Marcus of Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s often about drugs that are able to cure or deal with rare diseases. For sure, it\u2019s not only CDCA.\u201d</p> <p>No one doubts that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/09/why-do-new-medicines-cost-so-much-and-what-can-we-do-about-it\" title=\"\">developing drugs costs money</a>. A 2016 paper in the Journal of Health Economics estimated that the average cost of developing a prescription drug to the point of reaching the market is nearly $2.6bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa464bc9852739d006d25ce25b8984e40a7b5341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa464bc9852739d006d25ce25b8984e40a7b5341/0_0_3000_4000/750.jpg\" alt=\"illustration by Jake Hollings\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But the lack of hard, openly available statistics on the cost of drug development is something that many people, including Marcus and Marleen Kemper, want to change. \u201cIn most of the cases, society is willing to pay some price,\u201d says Kemper, \u201cbut now the discussion is: what is an acceptable price?\u201d</p> <p>Marcus acknowledges that Leadiant has to cover its costs, but does not believe that can explain the price of CDCA rising to more than \u20ac150,000 \u2013 \u201cthe profit cannot be that high\u201d. When I ask her how much profit she thought Leadiant was making from the drug, she admits she doesn\u2019t know: \u201cThat\u2019s what the Belgian Competition Authority is opening an inquiry for \u2013 to know more about the costs the company has to bear.\u201d However, when the price for CDCA has surged so much, \u201cnothing justifies it, because there was no new research, no new nothing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Leadiant rejects this. Although CDCA had been authorised in the past, the company says that \u201cthe active pharmaceutical ingredient as well as the manufacturing of the finished product needed to be upgraded\u201d to make sure that its version was compliant with current EU standards. These, Leadiant says, are more extensive and significantly more strict today than they were when earlier CDCA drugs were developed.</p> <p>Leadiant says that its CDCA \u201cis not a \u2018copy\u2019 of an old product\u201d. The very fact that it gained orphan drug status proves this, it argues. The company also says that \u201cthere was no robust evidence that CDCA was effective in CTX until Leadiant produced the data\u201d. Demonstrating this, it says, required \u201centirely new studies, creating new data sets\u201d \u2013 which make up \u201cthe largest ever collection of clinical data for CTX\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCDCA Leadiant has been developed and brought to market at substantial cost,\u201d the company says. \u201cOur pricing is justified by our costs and investments.\u201d</p> <p>But the problem is not just that Leadiant\u2019s drug is so expensive: potential alternatives have disappeared. Willemijn van der Wel, a lawyer working at the European law firm AKD, has written about Leadiant\u2019s connection to competitors who previously produced CDCA. After buying the marketing authorisations for other products that contained CDCA, he says, \u201cLeadiant began to withdraw these alternative CDCA products from the market, until only one CDCA medicinal product remained\u201d. Marcus has also queried what has happened to these products that might have been competitors to Leadiant\u2019s. But, she says, it is not clear what is behind their CDCA monopoly.</p> <p>Leadiant, though, says that it is willing to negotiate a lower price for its drug with the Dutch Ministry of Health and Dutch insurance companies. \u201cThe only reason an improvement has not been determined yet, is that the insurers have been uninterested or unwilling to enter into any substantive negotiations,\u201d it claims. (Leadiant did not respond to follow-up questions asking for more details of the negotiations, or what level of price reduction the company was offering.) It also emphasises that it has not taken legal action against the UMC hospital for seeking to compound its own CDCA, but that it is \u201cinvolved in a legal discussion with the Dutch Inspectorate about the interpretation of EU and Dutch medicines law\u201d.</p> <p>Regardless of the outcome of such discussions, something needs to be done. Having pharmacies self-compound medicines is not a sustainable model \u2013 it might reduce incentives for developing drugs for rare conditions.</p> <p>It also exposes patients to risk, Leadiant argues. Pharmacies do not have to have their compounding processes checked by the European Medicines Agency or the national regulator. \u201cThere is no product control by any independent regulatory authority before or after compounding,\u201d Leadiant says.</p> <p>When it comes to market authorisation and orphan drugs, Leadiant says, \u201cit should not be about small or large scale, but safe scale\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Marleen Kemper\u2019s husband warned her that taking on Leadiant would be difficult. \u201cHe said: \u2018With this initiative, don\u2019t be naive,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe pharmaceutical industry is very powerful, so you really have to have back-up from the [hospital] board\u201d \u2013 which she had. More than a year into her attempt to make her own version of the drug, she is recognising just how deeply dug in both sides are.</p> <p>She is at pains to point out that she is not against the pharmaceutical industry: \u201cWhat people forget is that the industry is responsible for a lot of innovation.\u201d But if drug pricing means that patients potentially get left behind? \u201cThen I\u2019m getting angry,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But righteous anger alone cannot sustain someone in a months-long case involving lawyers and regulators, not least when they are also raising a family, running part of a pharmacy that is actively studying hundreds of drugs, and doing their job keeping patients supplied with medicine.

      "bodyText": "When a pharmaceutical company raised the price of an essential medicine to unacceptable levels, there was only one thing for pharmacist Marleen Kemper to do: start making it herself. When Kemper was in primary school, she had watched two of her classmates get ill. One had a brain tumour, the other contracted an infection in his gut. Both of them died. Kemper was about 10 at the time, and knew she did not want to see another friend perish. She told her parents she wanted to do something that would prevent others dying. She wanted to be a doctor. But training is hypercompetitive in the Netherlands, where Kemper grew up. She didn\u2019t quite have the grades. She liked chemistry, so chose a career in pharmacy instead. She studied for six years and did a residency for another four. She is now a highly respected hospital pharmacist based at Amsterdam UMC\u2019s Academic Medical Centre, a cavernous building crafted out of concrete on the south-east fringe of the Dutch capital. To understand what happened next, you have to understand several things about Kemper. Two of those things date back to her childhood. One was that early experience of losing friends to illness, which instilled in her an urge to do everything she can to make sick people better. The second is that, although she is highly accomplished, Kemper is self-admittedly hard-headed, and has always had a rebellious streak. Sometimes she likes to shock people. Which leads into the third, more recently acquired trait: a steely determination to do right by her patients, whatever the cost. And the cost can be great. In 2017, when the price of a drug used to treat a rare genetic disorder skyrocketed, Kemper was not happy. The result was a dispute that is still going on today, and has spread beyond the walls of the UMC hospital. It has also spread beyond the city of Amsterdam, and beyond even the borders of the Netherlands. * * * Most of us never have to worry about chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), one of the two primary bile acids produced by the liver. But, for a tiny number of people, a rare genetic trait means they end up short. Having this gene variant prevents the body from creating sterol 27-hydroxylase, a liver enzyme. Without it, the liver won\u2019t convert enough cholesterol into CDCA. The result is an overabundance of other bile acids and substances, which are then pumped out of the liver and through the body, causing untold damage. The illness that results is called cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, or CTX. It can cause cataracts, dementia, neurological problems and seizures \u2013 but it can be treated. Since the 1970s, the pharma industry has been able to produce CDCA, and so people who need it can supplement their shortage. The system worked well; the drug was relatively cheap for such a niche illness. A year\u2019s treatment cost about \u20ac30,000 (\u00a326,000) per patient \u2013 until suddenly it didn\u2019t. In 2017, Leadiant Biosciences, which was supplying CDCA to these patients in the EU, raised the price of its version of the drug \u2013 known as CDCA Leadiant \u2013 to more than \u20ac150,000 per patient per year. The price increase soon had an effect. The Netherlands has an insurance-based health system, and in April 2018, Dutch insurers, who had been paying for 50 or so patients across the country to receive the drug, balked at the increase and refused to pay. Patients who were unable to pay themselves would have gone without treatment, so Kemper \u2013 whose hospital was one of the treatment centres for CTX \u2013 stepped in. Amsterdam UMC would produce the medicine for these patients itself, at cost price. She was upset, she admits. \u201cPatients have a medical need. If those patients with CTX don\u2019t get their medication, they get neurological implications, they get complications with their cholesterol and dementia, epilepsy \u2026 it is an essential medicine.\u201d Anyone wanting to manufacture a drug must get a marketing authorisation to do so. But Leadiant had become the only game in town, the owner of exclusive rights to manufacture CDCA commercially in the EU. Still, there was a solution. Under EU rules, pharmacies can make (or \u201ccompound\u201d) a prescribed drug on a small scale for their patients. So Kemper began researching where she could find the ingredients to make CDCA. It was difficult: in the pursuit of better margins, vast numbers of manufacturing companies have closed their factories across the world and concentrated their efforts in China, where the costs of producing pharmaceutical ingredients are lower. Just one European company manufactures the ingredients to EU standards. Kemper approached them and they declined to supply her the raw material. In the end, she found a Chinese manufacturer instead. She went to the hospital\u2019s executive board and gained approval to manufacture the drug. It cost the pharmacy \u20ac28,000 per patient, per year \u2013 pretty much exactly the same as the price of the drug beforehand. * * * CDCA was not initially used to treat CTX. It was originally developed to treat gallstones. This main use of the drug \u2013 which, from the mid-70s, had been sold in the Netherlands as Chenofalk \u2013 became outmoded when the standard procedure to deal with troublesome gallstones became to simply cut out the gallbladder entirely. At the turn of the millennium, Dutch doctors started using Chenofalk \u201coff-label\u201d (ie for a use different from that stated on its official licence) to treat CTX \u2013 a practice that carried on for several years. At this time, in the mid-2000s, a year\u2019s supply of Chenofalk cost less than \u20ac500. But in 2008, Leadiant acquired the rights to Chenofalk, and developed its own version, known as CDCA Leadiant. Then, nine days before Christmas 2014, it succeeded in getting its version classified as an \u201corphan medicine\u201d for treating CTX. That classification gave Leadiant the exclusive right to manufacture its CDCA drug commercially in Europe for the next 10 years. In 2015, Leadiant took Chenofalk off the market. In 2017, the price of CDCA Leadiant \u2013 by now the only remaining CDCA option on the market \u2013 was increased from around \u20ac30,000 per patient per year to about \u20ac150,000. Introduced by EU regulation in the year 2000, orphan drug classification is given to drugs that treat serious illnesses that affect fewer than five in every 10,000 people in the EU. Its purpose is to help companies recoup the costs of developing treatments that would otherwise be unlikely to generate a profit. Without it, the pharma industry would not be incentivised to seek new drugs for the rarest diseases. But, in this case, CDCA was already known as a CTX treatment, with Chenofalk having been used off-label to treat it for years. Kemper believes that Leadiant is getting the financial benefits of orphan designation, but for a drug that had gone through development and been released to market long ago. \u201cThere were publications already in the 1980s,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no patents, nothing. It\u2019s really bizarre.\u201d Kemper is not the only one concerned about the price rise and CDCA\u2019s orphan drug status. In September 2018, a lobby group, the Dutch Pharmaceutical Accountability Foundation, asked the Dutch competition authority to investigate the price increase. And this spring Test Achats, a nonprofit consumer-protection organisation in neighbouring Belgium, lodged a complaint against Leadiant with the Belgian Competition Authority. \u201cWe noticed that in 2005, the price for the treatment of a patient in one year was around \u20ac500. Now it\u2019s more than \u20ac150,000,\u201d explains Laura Marcus, legal counsel to Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the sick person but also for the Belgian health system, which is paying most of the [cost of the] treatment.\u201d * * * When a drug company raises the price of its product, and a hospital pharmacy decides not to accept the increase but instead endeavours to compound its own version, undercutting the drug company\u2019s price, things tend to get interesting. In June 2018, Kemper had a phone call from the Dutch health inspectorate. It had received a letter of concern \u2013 who it came from, Amsterdam UMC doesn\u2019t know, although the health inspectorate has said it was acting in response to an enforcement request from Leadiant \u2013 with a long list of things for the investigators to check. Kemper took the news in her stride. She had expected a rocky road. \u201cAs a pharmacist, I am a professional and I know what I\u2019m doing, and we have standards for compounding,\u201d she explains. So she was not worried when, that summer, a team of four inspectorate monitors turned up at the door of her pharmacy in Amsterdam. Two were there to take samples of the raw materials she was using to compound CDCA, and to ensure that all the correct processes were being followed. They rifled through the reams of paperwork and procedures that Kemper had spent hours developing for her staff to follow, while the other two inspectors combed through coverage of the case to ensure that Kemper and her team were not advertising their work, which is prohibited for medicines that have not been given market authorisation. The lab checked out: its processes were up to standard and the paperwork was all in order. But in July Kemper got a phone call that floored her: the inspectorate\u2019s analysis of the raw materials her pharmacy was using to compound the CDCA had discovered that they were not up to snuff. Two components found in it were above allowed limits. \u201cAs a professional you think: what did I miss? It was very emotional, a bit heavy,\u201d she says. In consultation with the board of directors at the hospital, Kemper decided to immediately withdraw the product from patients; the health insurers said they would step in and cover putting the patients back on the Leadiant version of the drug. Kemper personally called the 50 or so patients she was providing with the drug. \u201cThe first one was hard,\u201d she admits. \u201cI expected they\u2019d be angry or something like that. But no, no one [was]. The patients said: \u2018Well, please go on with this job.\u2019\u201d The Dutch inspectorate has said that Kemper can resume compounding CDCA provided she can find a raw material that does not contain impurities \u2013 something Kemper is keeping tight-lipped about. So, if she can get the materials she needs, Kemper is hopeful to be able to continue compounding CDCA in the future. But for now, it is back to square one \u2013 paying the full price for CDCA Leadiant. * * * These events have had wider consequences. What was initially a dispute inside the Netherlands has bled across borders, with Belgian patients with CTX now being affected. It started with a conversation between the Dutch and Belgian health ministers shortly after Kemper\u2019s production of CDCA was halted, says Thomas De Rijdt, head of pharmacy at University Hospitals Leuven. The Dutch minister wanted to know from his Belgian counterpart why Belgian hospitals were able to make the same drug without any issues. \u201cFor Belgium, we have about 10 patients,\u201d De Rijdt says. \u201cThey are helped with the preparations from our hospital and the University Hospital in Antwerp.\u201d These hospitals had been compounding CDCA capsules for CTX patients for years. Leuven had sourced raw materials that had been tested and approved by a laboratory accredited by the Belgian government. But when the case in the Netherlands entered conversation at diplomats\u2019 dinners, the Belgian government wanted to double-check that its raw materials were OK. It ran a second battery of tests \u2013 with a different accredited laboratory \u2013 which came back with a problem. A single impurity was found. The government ordered a quarantine of the raw material and recalled all the CDCA it had made. \u201cThe patients had to return all their medication,\u201d says De Rijdt. Recalling every capsule of the drug from Belgium, and freezing the work of the only two suppliers in the country, meant that people with CTX were suddenly left without any medicine. \u201cIf you know the disease, you know you can deteriorate very quickly,\u201d says De Rijdt. This was a problem. So, he says, the hospital pharmacists, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance, the health minister and the pharmaceutical inspectorate hit upon a solution. For a year, the Belgian government would reimburse the costs of Leadiant\u2019s drug, allowing those patients to still be treated. (Normally the government only reimburses a portion of a person\u2019s health costs, and the rest is paid for by the patient or insurance.) Over the course of that year, the relevant authorities would then work together to adapt the requirements a raw material must comply with \u2013 to allow versions of drugs with minor impurities, providing they pose no threat to the patient. \u201cWe have bought time to find a solution with the compounding, because we think by compounding we can save healthcare a lot of money for the same quality of therapy,\u201d says De Rijdt. He hopes to have a solution by the end of this year. But in early September, things took another turn. Wouter Beke, the Belgian consumer affairs minister, used his price-regulation powers to bring down the price of CDCA Leadiant to just over \u20ac3,600 a month \u2013 roughly a quarter of the amount Leadiant was charging. If the drug becomes more cheaply available in Belgium, says De Rijdt, then it could end up being exported and available at a lower price elsewhere. But exactly how this will pan out remains unclear. In the meantime, Beke has urged the Belgian Competition Authority to prioritise investigating Leadiant, following the complaint lodged by Test Achats. * * * Debate over what constitutes a fair price for drugs is not anything new. Nor is it limited to Europe. Because of his willingness to play the bad guy in the press (and an odd moment when he bought a Wu-Tang Clan record), Martin Shkreli has attracted more criticism on drug pricing than perhaps anyone else. In 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals, of which Shkreli was CEO, raised the price of its recently acquired antimalarial drug Daraprim, also used to treat Aids-related illnesses. A pill went from $13.50 to $750 overnight \u2013 a 55-fold increase. Shkreli\u2019s capitalist tendencies were criticised by almost everyone. This was unlike the situation with CDCA Leadiant \u2013 there was no argument that the increase was to cover Daraprim\u2019s development costs \u2013 and Shkreli himself was unrepentant: \u201cIf there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don\u2019t think that that should be a crime,\u201d he told reporters. But the Daraprim situation was just the highest-profile example of a contest that is going on constantly between big pharmaceutical companies seeking to profit from drugs, and medical staff on the frontline who worry that such profit-seeking does damage to patients needing treatment. (For what it\u2019s worth, a competitor to Turing Pharmaceuticals announced soon after that it would produce a compound drug containing the same active ingredient in Daraprim \u2013 pyrimethamine \u2013 for $1 a pill, rather than the $750 Shkreli wanted to charge.) One front in this battle has recently opened up in the US. In May, more than 40 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against some of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of generic drugs, alleging that they have colluded to fix the price of more than 100 medicines over a number of years. When prices should go down after a drug\u2019s market exclusivity ended, the antitrust lawsuit claims that many prices have instead shot up \u2013 in some cases by more than 1,000%. Back in Europe, the consumer organisation Euroconsumers \u2013 of which Test Achats is part \u2013 is investigating the prices of other drugs beyond CDCA. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a few problems with a few other drugs,\u201d says Laura Marcus of Test Achats. \u201cIt\u2019s often about drugs that are able to cure or deal with rare diseases. For sure, it\u2019s not only CDCA.\u201d No one doubts that developing drugs costs money. A 2016 paper in the Journal of Health Economics estimated that the average cost of developing a prescription drug to the point of reaching the market is nearly $2.6bn. But the lack of hard, openly available statistics on the cost of drug development is something that many people, including Marcus and Marleen Kemper, want to change. \u201cIn most of the cases, society is willing to pay some price,\u201d says Kemper, \u201cbut now the discussion is: what is an acceptable price?\u201d Marcus acknowledges that Leadiant has to cover its costs, but does not believe that can explain the price of CDCA rising to more than \u20ac150,000 \u2013 \u201cthe profit cannot be that high\u201d. When I ask her how much profit she thought Leadiant was making from the drug, she admits she doesn\u2019t know: \u201cThat\u2019s what the Belgian Competition Authority is opening an inquiry for \u2013 to know more about the costs the company has to bear.\u201d However, when the price for CDCA has surged so much, \u201cnothing justifies it, because there was no new research, no new nothing,\u201d she says. Leadiant rejects this. Although CDCA had been authorised in the past, the company says that \u201cthe active pharmaceutical ingredient as well as the manufacturing of the finished product needed to be upgraded\u201d to make sure that its version was compliant with current EU standards. These, Leadiant says, are more extensive and significantly more strict today than they were when earlier CDCA drugs were developed. Leadiant says that its CDCA \u201cis not a \u2018copy\u2019 of an old product\u201d. The very fact that it gained orphan drug status proves this, it argues. The company also says that \u201cthere was no robust evidence that CDCA was effective in CTX until Leadiant produced the data\u201d. Demonstrating this, it says, required \u201centirely new studies, creating new data sets\u201d \u2013 which make up \u201cthe largest ever collection of clinical data for CTX\u201d. \u201cCDCA Leadiant has been developed and brought to market at substantial cost,\u201d the company says. \u201cOur pricing is justified by our costs and investments.\u201d But the problem is not just that Leadiant\u2019s drug is so expensive: potential alternatives have disappeared. Willemijn van der Wel, a lawyer working at the European law firm AKD, has written about Leadiant\u2019s connection to competitors who previously produced CDCA. After buying the marketing authorisations for other products that contained CDCA, he says, \u201cLeadiant began to withdraw these alternative CDCA products from the market, until only one CDCA medicinal product remained\u201d. Marcus has also queried what has happened to these products that might have been competitors to Leadiant\u2019s. But, she says, it is not clear what is behind their CDCA monopoly. Leadiant, though, says that it is willing to negotiate a lower price for its drug with the Dutch Ministry of Health and Dutch insurance companies. \u201cThe only reason an improvement has not been determined yet, is that the insurers have been uninterested or unwilling to enter into any substantive negotiations,\u201d it claims. (Leadiant did not respond to follow-up questions asking for more details of the negotiations, or what level of price reduction the company was offering.) It also emphasises that it has not taken legal action against the UMC hospital for seeking to compound its own CDCA, but that it is \u201cinvolved in a legal discussion with the Dutch Inspectorate about the interpretation of EU and Dutch medicines law\u201d. Regardless of the outcome of such discussions, something needs to be done. Having pharmacies self-compound medicines is not a sustainable model \u2013 it might reduce incentives for developing drugs for rare conditions. It also exposes patients to risk, Leadiant argues. Pharmacies do not have to have their compounding processes checked by the European Medicines Agency or the national regulator. \u201cThere is no product control by any independent regulatory authority before or after compounding,\u201d Leadiant says. When it comes to market authorisation and orphan drugs, Leadiant says, \u201cit should not be about small or large scale, but safe scale\u201d. * * * Marleen Kemper\u2019s husband warned her that taking on Leadiant would be difficult. \u201cHe said: \u2018With this initiative, don\u2019t be naive,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe pharmaceutical industry is very powerful, so you really have to have back-up from the [hospital] board\u201d \u2013 which she had. More than a year into her attempt to make her own version of the drug, she is recognising just how deeply dug in both sides are. She is at pains to point out that she is not against the pharmaceutical industry: \u201cWhat people forget is that the industry is responsible for a lot of innovation.\u201d But if drug pricing means that patients potentially get left behind? \u201cThen I\u2019m getting angry,\u201d she says. But righteous anger alone cannot sustain someone in a months-long case involving lawyers and regulators, not least when they are also raising a family, running part of a pharmacy that is actively studying hundreds of drugs, and doing their job keeping patients supplied with medicine. At times, Kemper has felt frustrated and worn down by the effort of taking on the price rise \u2013 but she vows to continue. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll stop and quit doing it because it\u2019s too much work, too emotionally draining.\u2019 But due to the support, I think we\u2019ll go on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to be solved, for the patients.\u201d Kemper is determined that she is going to provide affordable care for her patients by following the letter of the law. \u201cI\u2019m using the rules,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not cheating.\u201d Leadiant, she accepts, has used the rules and followed them to serve its own purposes. So she will too. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to make medication for patients. They don\u2019t like it? So what. I\u2019m following the rules.\u201d This article was first published by Wellcome on Mosaic and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.
