      "bodyText": "\u2022 The Democratic Unionist party is locked in what its deputy leader described as a\u201dconstructive dialogue\u201d to try to reach an agreement to allow it to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, including with the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Downing Street is convinced the support of the DUP is key to unlocking the backing of many Conservative Brexiters when May brings her deal to the House of Commons on Tuesday for the third time. The discussions, believed to be at the Cabinet Office, are taking place on Friday and expected to continue into the weekend. They are likely to cover the role of any future Northern Ireland assembly if the Irish backstop were used \u2013 one of the issues senior DUP leaders have asked for further clarification about. \u2022 David Lidington has insisted Theresa May\u2019s cabinet will continue to work together \u201cvery constructively\u201d, despite eight senior ministers, including the Brexit secretary, voting against an extension to article 50. Steve Barclay voted against a motion tabled by the government, even though he had spoken in favour of it at the dispatch box just minutes earlier. Others who rejected the idea of an extension were Penny Mordaunt, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling. \u2022 The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, has been tipped as the frontrunner to replace the party\u2019s outgoing leader, Vince Cable, who has announced plans to step down from the party in May. Cable, a former business secretary in the coalition government, announced that he would set a timetable for his departure at the party\u2019s spring conference this weekend. \u2022 Ireland will want to avoid a series of \u201crolling cliff edges\u201d if the UK requests a delay to its exit from the EU, the country\u2019s finance minister has said. Paschal Donohoe said London would need to convince the EU27 that an extension to article 50 would not further risk economic disruption. \u201cI believe it is highly important that we do all we can to avoid being in a scenario of rolling cliff edges \u2026 particularly from a financial market stability perspective and economic stability, we need to be aware of that,\u201d he said. There had been a \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d between the DUP and the government, said the party\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds following his talks with the attorney general and ministers. He added that the talks would continue to also focus on the issue of the so-called \u2018Stormont Lock\u2019 and how it can be provided for. The lock in question relates to a series of assurances on Northern Ireland and its place in the UK, which the government published in January. Those commitments give a restored Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont - which has not sat for two years - a say on any future laws that the European Union may pass if the backstop comes into force. A government paper promised that this \u201cStormont lock\u201d on the backstop would be a legally binding commitment. However, the DUP immediately rejected the paper when it was first put forward in January, dashing hopes that the party would get behind May for the first vote on her Brexit deal. The DUP\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, has emerged from discussions with the government and said that the party is still seeking to have its concerns \u201cassuaged\u201d about the Northern Ireland backstop before it can support Theresa May\u2019s deal. The party, which in 2017 squeezed \u00a31bn extra for Northern Ireland over the next two years as part of its confidence and supply deal to support the government, is not seeking more money as part of the talks, Dodds. Dodds said that the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, was in the talks but \u201cnothing more\u201d should be read into the fact that he was present along with the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. Michael Gove, a key Brexiteer member of the cabinet and Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, was also present for the talks. \u201cNo, we are not discussing more cash,\u201d said Dodds, in answer to questions from the press. \u201cIt\u2019s about Brexit and how we can protect Northern Ireland\u2019s economic and political future,\u201d said the MP. The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, has been tipped as the frontrunner to replace the party\u2019s outgoing leader Vince Cable, who announced plans to step down from the party in May. Cable, the former business secretary in the coalition government, announced that he would set a timetable for his departure at the party\u2019s spring conference this weekend. Three MPs were expected to be in the running \u2013 Swinson, the former cabinet minister Ed Davey and the party\u2019s education spokeswoman, Layla Moran. Swinson, a coalition business minister, was highly likely to announce her candidacy, according to multiple sources. One, who is close to Swinson, said: \u201cJo loves the party and is passionate about wanting it to succeed. She hears the calls for her to stand very clearly, and I would put money on her going for it.\u201d We\u2019re hearing suggestions that Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, is going to be saying something in a while about his party\u2019s talks with the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, Dodds and colleagues are locked in intensive talks with Cox and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, try to reach an agreement to allow them to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. When he\u2019s going to appear, or what he\u2019ll say.. \u2018Ulster says Yes?\u2019 .. \u2018we\u2019ll keep talking?\u2019 .. we don\u2019t know yet. The Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, has been explaining that extraordinary decision he took last night to vote last night AGAINST the government\u2019s motion extending article 50, after he wound up the debate by making the case FOR it. Doorstepped by the BBC\u2019s Tom Barton, Barclay said that it had to do with the motion having two parts: Barclay wound up last night\u2019s debate by telling MPs: \u201cIt is time for this house to act in the national interest, it\u2019s time to put forward an extension that is realistic\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Chief Political Correspondent suggests that a fourth Brexit Secretary may be on the cards. He might be taking it easy on the hard stuff in preparation for the beginning of his big March to Leave tomorrow but Nigel Farage will surely find some use for some politically-charged beer mats that have been left on his desk at the European Parliament. Richard Corbett, the leader of their Labour group in the European Parliament, tweeted a picture of the mats produced by the pro-remain guerrilla marketing activists, ByDonkeys. The Democratic Unionist party is locked in intensive talks to try to reach an agreement to allow it to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, including with the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Downing Street is convinced the support of the DUP is key to unlocking the backing of many Conservative Brexiters when May brings her deal to the House of Commons on Tuesday for the third time. The discussions, which are taking place on Friday and expected to continue into the weekend, are likely to cover the role of any future Northern Irelandassembly if the Irish backstop were used \u2013 one of the issues senior DUP leaders have asked for further clarification about. Hammond is also attending a meeting in Downing Street on Friday with the DUP, first reported by the Sun, and the government is said to also be looking at what domestic legal guarantees could be offered to the party. While MPs bicker over the terms of the UK\u2019s divorce from the EU, British citizens in Brussels who have been worrying about the impact on their lives there have been taking out Belgian citizenship. The Belgian government\u2019s statistics service, StatBel, this week released figures this week showing a spike in Brits becoming Belgians after the 2016 Brexit referendum. The Associated Press has been speaking to a few of them, including lobbyist Brian O\u2019Riordan, who described how he has been feeling: \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of bizarre feeling, this sense of disempowerment, helplessness watching it all happen, not really understanding why.\u201d That uncertainty finally pushed him over the edge, according to the AP. He has lived in Belgium for two decades and speaks French to his two border collie dogs all the while being happy to be British. But with Brexit looming, he shifted his pension savings out of Britain and took Belgian citizenship. In 2015, 127 Britons took Belgian citizenship. The following year the number soared to 506. In 2017, 1,375 of the 23,000 Brits living in Belgium a whopping 6 percent adopted Belgian nationality. Much of the talks between the DUP and the government are revolving around the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly - which is currently suspended - in the event of the backstop being used. That\u2019s according to UTV\u2019s Political Editor, Ken Reid. If the role of the assembly is being discussed, that\u2019s quite new and potentially separate from the question of whether or not the backstop will need to be used, and whether it is time limited. Are they ready to jump? Northern Ireland has had no functioning elected government since power sharing DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in collapsed in January 2017. Civil servants are left to run things but cannot make key decisions. How that can change is an altogether different can of worms from the current Brexit impasse. Either way, if you want to know more you could do worse than read this piece from Rory Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent, about the simmering resentment in Northern Ireland as Stormont sits empty: A DUP MP, Jim Shannon, has said that the party will not be changing its minds on May\u2019s deal unless there are legally binding changes to ensure that the backstop is limited. \u201cThat is what we have been asking for over the past two years to be honest with you and we can\u2019t understand why the government has not been able to understand that,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s World at One. He warned however: \u201cIf nothing has chaned then our opinoin has not changed.\u201d It looks like the government is putting its back into convincing the Democratic Unionists to come on board. This from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: The DUP may or may not be on the move, but Theresa May has also received a boost after Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over Brexit policy last year, indicated she could vote for the deal next week. McVey was speaking to the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson for his politics blog. Asked if MPs would \u201chold their noses and vote\u201d for Mrs May\u2019s deal - which is expected to return to the Commons next week - the former minister said: \u201cYes. They will. I don\u2019t know what the number is, but they will have to do that if they... want Brexit.\u201d Austria would be in favour of granting Britain a \u201cshort extension\u201d to Brexit, according to Karin Kneissl, Austria\u2019s Minister for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs. However, it remains to be seen whether other EU states would also agree and it is very difficult to say where a longer one would be granted, she told BBC\u2019s Politics Live. \u201cA Longer extensions of course coincides with the European Parliamentary elelctions and this cause a problem,\u201d said Kneissl. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an issue of the British participating in elections. It\u2019s about the presidency of the parliament and we could enter into a debate about parliamentary legitimacy and we could enter into a debate about parliamentary legitimacy.\u201d Is the DUP about to budge from their opposition to May\u2019s deal? The party is holding \u201congoing and significant discussions with Government\u201d over Brexit, the Press Association reports. The BBC\u2019s Political Editor picked up on this last night too: The question of whether third vote on the withdrawal agreement should - or will - be ruled out by the Speaker, John Bercow, continues to be debated. There are those who argue passionately that he has to do so for the sake of democracy: Then there\u2019s this view from Jo Maugham, a QC and Director of the Good Law Project, who tweets three reasons for why Bercow should not. Here\u2019s the second and third: As Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government told Sky News on Thursday however: \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s the speaker\u2019s discretion. Though he should follow the will of the House.\u201d Ireland will want to avoid a series of \u201crolling cliff edges\u201d if the UK requests a delay to its exit from the EU, the country\u2019s finance minister has said. Paschal Donohoe said London would need to convince the EU27 that an extension to article 50 would not further risk economic disruption. \u201cI believe it is highly important that we do all we can to avoid being in a scenario of rolling cliff edges \u2026 particularly from a financial market stability perspective and economic stability [perspective], we need to be aware of that,\u201d he said. Theresa May is expected to ask the EU for an extension next week at the European Council summit after MPs voted overwhelming to delay Brexit until 30 June amid chaotic scenes in the House of Commons on Thursday evening. Donohoe said the taoiseach Leo Varadkar had made it clear Ireland \u201cwould provide generous response\u201d but that London needed to spell out what it wanted from any extension. A delay of anything from a few months to as long as 21 months have been mooted in recent weeks with some EU leaders such as the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutter questioning the point of any extension if the UK was not clear about the Brexit it wanted. MPs have gathered in the House of Commons for a minute\u2019s silence in memory of those killed in the New Zealand terror attack. Speaker John Bercow led tributes to the victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings, telling the chamber the pause in proceedings at 11am was in \u201csolidarity\u201d with the people of New Zealand and Muslims around the world. Labour MP Wes Streeting, co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims, said what had happened in Christchurch would be felt deeply by UK communities. In the wake of \u201cIslamophobia and anti-Muslim prejudice not just in this country but right across the world\u201d, he said \u201con behalf of the whole House, you are not alone in confronting prejudice and hatred\u201d. The risk of the backstop being weaponised by European governments to force the UK to make concessions on unrelated issues is now much less, according to a new paper from the Policy Exchange thinktank. Readers might recall that Macron said in November that the UK will be trapped in a customs union after Brexit unless Downing Street offers European fishermen full access to British waters during the coming trade negotiations. Three lawyers who have penned \u2018A Second Look at the UK\u2019s Legal Position in Relation to the Backstop\u2019 argue anumber of points made earlier in the week during Attorney General Geoffrey Cox\u2019s fateful legal take on the backstop \u201cmay have been lost, overlooked, or not fully appreciated\u201d. They emphasise the force of \u201cgood faith\u201d obligations in international law, while also adding: While the AG\u2019s assessment on legal risk for the UK in the event of EU compliance with its obligations (and absent a fundamental change of circumstances) is correct, the risk of the backstop being used as leverage for the next phase of the negotiations in order to lock the UK into a backstop-like arrangement indefinitely has receded significantly. Frayed nerves? Wondering if you have the right number of tins of beans stashed away in the attic? Spare a thought for the Guardian\u2019s Westminster sketchwriter John Crace. Here\u2019s a snippet from his digested week (online here): Wednesday A nightmare. A day when I basically had to rip up three-quarters of the sketch I\u2019d already written and start again from scratch with barely 40 minutes to the latest deadline. My nerves can\u2019t take much more of this. I\u2019m a broken man. I\u2019d thought for once in the ongoing Brexit shitshow that we were in for a relatively quiet day. That May had surely now found a vote she couldn\u2019t possibly lose. After all, a government motion to take a no-deal Brexit off the table was something on which every MP, with the exception of a few delusional members of the ERG, who demanded the certainty of businesses in their constituencies going bust on 29 March, could agree. Some folks have been asking below the line on the blog about whether the Speaker, John Bercow, will allow May to bring her rejected deal back to Parliament for another attempt to get it passed. When, asks @Aphex on Twitter, will we know what his decision is on this matter? The short answer is that we probably won\u2019t know definitively until Tuesday next week Those interested in the same question might also be intrigued by a recent exchange between a Westminster committee and the just-retired clerk of the House, who suggested it was not for the Speaker to apply \u201ctheological\u201d rules in the face of political reality. There is a general rule against being asked to decide again on the same question in the same Session, Sir David Natzler, told the Exiting the EU Committee in October. He added: If it was a different document, obviously there would be a different motion. I do not know; I would not want to speculate. If it was exactly the same document and they came back three months later for another bite, I do not think the procedures of the House are designed to obstruct the necessary business of Government in that way in such a crucial thing. I hope that is helpful. He went on: I do not want to speculate on various things the chair might do, but the chair is there to facilitate the business of the House, not to operate a series of strange theological rules, with no disrespect to theology. They are there for a purpose, and it is the purpose that has to be looked at. I suspect a re-run of the Geldof versus Farage \u2018Battle of the Thames\u2019 isn\u2019t quite on the cards yet, but a group of fishing boats has set off on the River Tyne to protest against the Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit plans. The flotilla (if that\u2019s quite the right word), which comes the day before Farage starts out on his March to Leave, from Sunderland to London, has been organised by a group call Fishing for Leave. After setting off from North Shields the flotilla made its way towards Newcastle\u2019s Quayside through the choppy waters of the Tyne. A battered trawler was driven on the back of a lorry by road, heading for a meeting point. A Fishing For Leave spokesman said: \u201cThe terms of the Withdrawal Agreement are an existential threat to fishing and a total betrayal of Brexit and Britain. \u201cIt means a second surrender of our industry and coastal communities and places a constitutional bomb under democracy.\u201d David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy prime minister has insisted Theresa May\u2019s cabinet will continue to work \u201cvery constructively\u201d together, despite eight senior ministers, including the Brexit secretary, voting against an extension to article 50. Steve Barclay voted against a motion tabled by the government, even though he had spoken in favour of it at the dispatch box just minutes earlier. Others who rejected the idea of an extension included Penny Mordaunt, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling. Lidington, who is the Cabinet Office secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI\u2019ve been working very constructively with Steve Barclay since his appointment a couple of months ago despite the fact that he and I were vigorously on opposite sides of the debate during the referendum, and we are continuing to work very constructively together today and in the days to come.\u201d The motion called for a three-month delay to Brexit \u2013 or a potentially much longer one, if parliament does not back the prime minister\u2019s deal next week. That will now become government policy. (read on) European Press Reaction \u2022 \u201cAt long last, MPs now have to decide where they stand,\u201d said Die Zeit in Germany after the Commons voted in favour of a short extension to article 50 on Thursday evening, having earlier in the week rejected both Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and no deal. \u201cEmpty promises to voters and pithy speeches in parliament will no longer cut it. The drama currently being played out in Westminster represents, at long last, the painful intrusion of reality into Britain\u2019s Brexit debate.\u201d \u2022 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitungreckoned the UK\u2019s \u201cbattered prime minister may perhaps have slightly more reason for hope than before. Who knows, it could just be that the Brexit drama in London will come to an end soon after all.\u201d \u2022 France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration rejoiced that at long last one thing looked more or less likely: \u201cBritain will not be leaving the EU on 29 March.\u201d Except, it added, the country was traversing a period \u201cso utterly extraordinary, so totally unprecedented, in which all the existing logic of votes and established political forces has been so completely overturned, that nothing, nothing at all, can any longer be predicted.\u201d \u2022 Le Monde warned that the \u201capparent bright spot\u201d masked \u201ca weakening of May\u2019s authority that is alarming not just for her political survival but for the democratic functioning of the country\u201d. She had \u201clost control of her party and cabinet to the extent that 188 Conservative MPs and eight ministers voted against the government\u2019s motion to postpone Brexit\u201d, the paper pointed out. In Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds, the commentator Rafa de Miguel said the hardcore Brexiters were like \u201cenraged children who despise any gift that is not the one they want\u201d. Having twice rejected May\u2019s deal, parliament was now completely confused: \u201cYes to Brexit but no to no deal; No to May\u2019s plan but also to any other solution.\u201d \u2022 In Dublin, the Irish Times said that after the \u201cchaos and humiliation of a double defeat in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Theresa May had a relatively good day\u201d on Thursday. But the paper\u2019s commentator, Stephen Collins, was brutal on what the week\u2019s events in Westminster had revealed. After the chaos, contradictions and incompetence, European media have spotted a glimmer of light at the end of the Brexit tunnel. That\u2019s according to the Guardian\u2019s John Henley, who has been reviewing reaction to the past 48 hours on the continent (below). On past form, of course, it will soon be extinguished, but the endgame seems \u2013 at least for now \u2013 to be approaching. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog by the way. As regulars know, the best way to get my attention is to tweet me. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll at Bloomberg HQ Labour took a city council seat from an independent in the latest local by-elections. The party\u2019s gain came in a contest in the Coxford ward of Southampton City Council caused by the resignation of an independent councillor. Voting was: Lab 668, C 529, Lib Dem 450, Socialist Alternative 368, Integrity Southampton 178, Ind 174, Ukip 123, Green 53. The turnout was 25%. Elsewhere, Labour comfortably held two seats: one at Croydon (Norbury &amp; Pollards Hill ward) and one at Durham (Wingate division). Mr Hogan added that MPs in Westminster were behaving in an unacceptable way. \u201cThey have had a long time to do all of this up until now and leaving it until the eleventh hour is creating instability and uncertainty for their own people, but also for Irish people and for the European Union generally. \u201cThat is certainly not an acceptable way of political behaviour from the mother of parliaments.\u201d He said he would not pre-judge whether European leaders would be prepared to offer Mrs May a Brexit extension. Mr Hogan also insisted the EU stood ready to support Irish farmers who might be adversely impacted by Brexit but urged those in the sector to \u201cremain calm\u201d until the final shape of Brexit was clear. \u201cWe are well advanced for all scenarios including very difficult situations for farmers in Europe generally and indeed for Irish farmers because we are very exposed, particularly in the beef sector,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThe European Union is ready to help them at the appropriate time when we see what the conclusions of the negotiations in London are.\u201d Mr Hogan said there was not yet a market crisis - characterising the situation as only a \u201cpolitical crisis\u201d. He said Irish farmers had weathered previous troubled periods, such as mad cow and foot and mouth diseases, with EU help. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t talk ourselves into a crisis.\u201d EU Commissioner Phil Hogan believes the UK\u2019s no-deal tariff plans - proposals that would see no import duties levied on goods entering Northern Ireland across the border - are likely to breach World Trade Organisation rules. Mr Hogan, who is commissioner for agriculture and rural development, claimed the plans unveiled by Whitehall this week were \u201cpolitical\u201d and designed to \u201cchange in the news cycle from the political chaos on London\u201d. \u201cI think they are incompatible with WTO rules,\u201d he said after arriving at an agriculture conference in Dublin. He added: \u201cI think the timing of it was unfortunate and it was a deliberate attempt to put Ireland more on the agenda, as if it wasn\u2019t on the agenda already.\u201d My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll is at Bloomberg HQ Jeremy Corbyn sends his condolences following the New Zealand shootings Andrew Adonis reacting to David Lidington\u2019s comments David Lidington has denied the Government was falling apart after seven Cabinet ministers including Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay voted against the Prime Minister\u2019s motion on delaying EU withdrawal. He told the Today programme: \u201cIt was a free vote in that division yesterday. Now, what happens this morning is that the entire Cabinet has accepted the position that Parliament voted for last night. I\u2019ve been working very constructively with Steve Barclay since his appointment a couple of months ago despite the fact that he and I were vigorously on opposite sides of the debate during the referendum, and we are continuing to work very constructively together today and in the days to come.\u201d Mr Lidington said he believed that Leave-backing ministers had used the free vote as \u201can opportunity to register how unhappy they were with being in the position where we don\u2019t really have an option as a country except to seek an extension of our time in the European Union\u201d. He said that leaving on March 29 with no deal remains the \u201clegal default position\u201d but the likelihood of it happening had \u201cdiminished\u201d after this week\u2019s votes. He said he was still hoping that the UK will \u201cleave as soon as possible in an orderly fashion\u201d by MPs backing Mrs May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement next week. Theresa May\u2019s effective deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, said the Christchurch attacks highlighted the need to \u201cstamp out\u201d Islamophobia. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cOn behalf of the whole British Government, I\u2019m sure that the whole British people would want to share the sense of shock and grief that must be felt throughout New Zealand today. \u201cOur hearts go out particularly to the families of those who\u2019ve lost people in New Zealand and also feelings of strong solidarity with Prime Minister Ardern and her government in New Zealand.\u201d While I don\u2019t want at this early stage to comment on what the motivation of the criminals concerned might have been, Islamophobia is an evil. I know that there will be Muslim constituents of mine and Muslim British fellow-citizens throughout the country who will be worried about the reports from New Zealand and the implications for their own safety. \u201cAll of us as a country, wherever we came from, whatever our ancestry, whatever our political loyalties may be, need to demonstrate a sense of solidarity and friendship with our British Muslim fellow-citizens. \u201cThey are part of our country, they contribute so much to life in so many respects in the United Kingdom. They are welcome here, they are valued parts of our community and we need to demonstrate that friendship and solidarity and be very clear - across any political parties - we need to stamp out Islamophobia and take action against it wherever it is found.\u201d Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said Labour was pursuing cross-party discussions in the search for \u201csomething which can become the consensus that Parliament solidifies around\u201d as a solution to Brexit. Mr Gardiner said parties should be ready to accept that \u201cnone of us may think this entirely suits what we might ideally have liked and put forward, but this is a way of uniting the country\u201d. We have always said that it will be the case that the option of a further public vote is there to stop a no-deal, to stop a bad deal. I believe that we should still try to achieve a deal and that\u2019s what we are now working for in the Labour front bench.\u201d Mr Gardiner said the extension to Brexit sought by Theresa May last night was only delivered because of Labour votes. \u201cIt was only because the Labour Party voted with Theresa May that the extension went ahead, because the Government could not get its own Cabinet ministers to back that extension, which was its own policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is extraordinary and that\u2019s why Parliament must now take back control.\u201d Activist Gina Miller has ruled out putting her name in the ring for the Lib Dem leadership contest after Sir Vince Cable announced he will step down in May to make way for a \u201cnew generation\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today: \u201cNo, no, no, I\u2019m definitely not doing that.\u201d Theresa May has sent her condolences after40 people were killed in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch. Activist and businesswoman Gina Miller believes the moment to call for a second referendum is \u201cwhen all else fails\u201d. I don\u2019t think last night was the time to lay down this amendment,\u201d she told the Today programme. \u201cYesterday was about extension and the day before was about taking no-deal off the table. \u201cYou have to try to exhaust all the other options first, and if Parliament can\u2019t resolve it, it\u2019s at that point that it goes back to the people.\u201d An amendment calling for a fresh public vote, tabled by The Independent Group\u2019s Sarah Wollaston, lost by 334 votes to 85 last night with Jeremy Corbyn telling Labour MPs to abstain. Barry Gardiner also said Labour will back a second referendum. We in the Labour party lost the referendum, we campaigned to Remain. \u201cIf it\u2019s [second referendum] the only way to stop a no deal or a bad deal\u201d. Speaking on the Today programme, Labour MP Barry Gardiner said the party\u2019s mission is to bring unity following a turbulent week, citing last night\u2019s Question Time programme. \u201cTo see people in the audience arguing so aggressively with each other, that is what is happening now with Brexit. That is what Labour is trying to do with these cross party talks.\u201d Good morning everyone, I am Nadeem Badshah and will be taking over the politics blog from my colleague Kate Lyons More tweets from MPs are pouring in in support of those in New Zealand affected by the horrific shootings that resulted in the deaths of 40 people at two mosques in Christchurch. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has compared the UK\u2019s handling of Brexit to a sketch from Monty Python. Speaking ahead of the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, Wolff said: \u201cFor some time I found it really tragic but the tragic has somehow changed into real good entertainment. \u201cEvery evening I watch the House of Commons and I\u2019m not quite sure whether it\u2019s a Monty Python thing or what is really happening. \u201cFor us, we have 26 nations in our company and we are living from the \u2018just in time\u2019 principle of getting goods in.\u201d There are seven F1 teams based in the UK and bosses including Wolff and McLaren chief executive Jonathan Neale have previously expressed concern about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the sport. Christian Horner, principal of Red Bull Racing, added: \u201cTrying to follow what on earth is going on in British politics at the moment is rather difficult for all of us. \u201cIt will be business as normal, we will wait and see what and if and when Brexit does happen, and when it happens then we\u2019ll deal with it. \u201cBut of course you try and put as many \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios in place as you can to protect the operation of your business.\u201d For the first time in what feels like a very long time (can it really just be four days?), a key Brexit motion is not on the agenda for the House of Commons. Finally. Theresa May had found a vote she could win. A narrow two-vote victory. A largely pyrrhic victory, as the government had won on a motion to extend article 50 it had never actually wanted to put to the house in the first place. Even when the Leader In Name Only is winning, she still contrives to lose. Another crank of the pathos handle. The government still just about had control of the parliamentary timetable. For a few more days at least. Not that Lino took any pleasure in the result. No smile escaped her lips, no signifier of relief. Just a hunched figure, lost in a near catatonic state. She clearly hates her life almost as much as she hates many of her colleagues. Hating is one of the few things she does well. The body language between her and Philip Hammond was of a couple who had long since realised there had never been two of them in this relationship. She left long before the final result was declared. With Lino\u2019s voice on either life support or a damage limitation exercise \u2013 take your pick \u2013 it had been left to the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, to open the latest Brexit debate the government had been hoping to avoid. He looked like a man who knew he had drawn the short straw. Tom Watson, deputy Labour leader, has also tweeted his concern for the people of New Zealand at this time. Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, is speaking now and has confirmed that 40 people have been killed in the two shootings in Christchurch. A truly shocking event and by far the worst shooting event New Zealand has suffered. A recap of last night\u2019s vote In case you missed it, here is the result of last night\u2019s vote, as parliament opted overwhelmingly to request an extension to article 50. The prime minister is now expected to bring her twice-defeated Brexit deal back to parliament on Tuesday, after she narrowly retained control of the next steps of the process. The votes, the last in a series of vital parliamentary decisions on Brexit over several days, mean that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU should not now take place before 30 June and gave the prime minister a window to resuscitate her plan. Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay wound up the debate for the government, saying: \u201cIt is time for this house to act in the national interest, it\u2019s time to put forward an extension that is realistic\u201d. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: \u201cThis evening the Brexit secretary voted against his government\u2019s own motion on Brexit, which earlier in the day he had defended in the House of Commons. That\u2019s the equivalent of the chancellor voting against his own budget. This is a government that has completely lost control.\u201d Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has tweeted this morning about the horrific attack in Christchurch today, in which an as-yet unconfirmed number of people were killed when a shooter or shooters targeted two mosques. Our rolling coverage of that event is here. The vote to delay Brexit for a yet-to-be-determined length of time has been met in the papers today with a mix of incredulity, calls for more time and speculation as to whether it will boost May\u2019s hand in negotiations. Theresa May\u2019s hopes of winning over Eurosceptics and the DUP to back her deal have been dealt a fresh blow after the \u201cStar Chamber\u201d of Brexiteer lawyers rejected a further attempt to allay their concerns about the backstop. The group of lawyers, led by veteran Tory Sir Bill Cash, said the suggestion that the UK could use the Vienna Convention - the international treaty that lays down the rules about treaties - to unilaterally pull out of the backstop was \u201cbadly misconceived\u201d. The panel of lawyers, which significantly also includes DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, rejected supplementary legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. The Attorney General\u2019s advice hinges on Article 62 of the Vienna Convention, which says that if there has been \u201ca fundamental change of circumstances\u201d following the conclusion of a treaty \u201cwhich was not foreseen by the parties\u201d, then the countries involved would be allowed to withdraw from it. But the Brexit-backing lawyers said \u201cgiven the high burden that a state must meet to use it, and given the extreme reluctance of international courts and tribunals to accept it\u201d the Vienna Convention route \u201csupplies no assurance whatsoever that the UK could terminate the Withdrawal Agreement in a lawful manner\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the day\u2019s politics news. This is Kate Lyons bringing you all the Brexit news until Andrew Sparrow and Matthew Weaver join later on to take you through the day. What a week it has been. A week of votes and humiliating defeats, ruptured cabinets, unheeded whips and prime ministerial flip-flopping. I don\u2019t blame you if your head is aching and you\u2019re ready to dive into the weekend and never come back from it. But, of course, it is not over. After parliament voted last night to ask for a delay to Brexit, meaning the UK would not leave on 29 March, May will bring her deal back to Parliament for a third time next week. MPs also overwhelmingly rejected an amendment calling for a second referendum, quashing the hopes of those who thought a People\u2019s Vote might put an end to the current crisis. Labour ordered its MPs to abstain, believing the timing to be wrong, and only 85 MPs voted for a referendum that would have had remain as an option, which led to five Labour frontbenchers resigning as shadow ministers.

These are evidence-based matters that continue to vex many remainers and fair-minded Brexiteers.</p> <p>While it is indeed critical to move forward, it is also essential to be clear about what has already happened. Democracy depends on transparency and truth.

The UK would have obvious difficulties trying to rely on article 62 to get out of the backstop because \u201ccrucially, a continuation of the backstop would not be a fundamental change of circumstances within the meaning of the VCLT\u201d.</p> <p>That analysis is both legally correct and should be clear enough for even the most confused of our current MPs to understand.

It is already established that the leave campaign overspent in the critical last days before the vote, and (as reported by Carole Cadwalladr among others) that many questions are still to be asked about the origins of that overspend. These are evidence-based matters that continue to vex many remainers and fair-minded Brexiteers. While it is indeed critical to move forward, it is also essential to be clear about what has already happened. Democracy depends on transparency and truth. Despite our political leaders\u2019 determined efforts to gloss over, and refuse to confront, the serious irregularities of the 2016 referendum, it is clear that the future of the UK (and of Europe itself) cannot be built on the shifting sands of deception. The enforcement agencies must now move rapidly to disclose what they know, and to take appropriate action on it; and a public inquiry must also now be established to examine the 2016 irregularities and breaches of the law. Most specifically, did the illegal leave money distort the vote? Did the prime minister know about the leave campaign irregularities before she triggered article 50? And, if so, what significance does this fact have for us now? Hilary Burrage London \u2022 The question raised of the Brexit secretary in the House of Commons on Tuesday by Jacob Rees-Mogg on \u201chow article 62 of the Vienna convention could be used\u201d to enable a unilateral exit by the UK of the Northern Irish backstop (May\u2019s final warning to Tory rebels: back me or lose Brexit, 14 March) has already been clearly answered in the House of Commons research briefing paper (number 08463) published on 21 December 2018. In that paper MPs were told that article 62 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), which enables a party to terminate or suspend the operation of a treaty where there has been a \u201cfundamental change of circumstances\u201d, can only be relied on in very limited circumstances. The UK would have obvious difficulties trying to rely on article 62 to get out of the backstop because \u201ccrucially, a continuation of the backstop would not be a fundamental change of circumstances within the meaning of the VCLT\u201d. That analysis is both legally correct and should be clear enough for even the most confused of our current MPs to understand. Attempts to rely on article 62 would be doomed to failure. Michael McParland QC Barrister, and author of The Rome I Regulation on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Oxford University Press, 2015) \u2022 How far does the Guardian carry a responsibility for mediation and reconciliation (May\u2019s final warning to Tory rebels: back me or lose Brexit, 14 March)? Its dramatic language when reporting on Thursday\u2019s votes \u2013 \u201chumiliated\u201d (a matter of opinion, she just looked ill to me); \u201cParty split exposed\u201d (some years ago); \u201cdefiant reply\u201d etc \u2013 only serves to exasperate and not heal the Brexit angst. Whatever your view on the UK leaving the EU, there\u2019s not a single individual who can reconcile our irreconcilable views, so John Crace\u2019s character assassination of May is childish (Sketch, 15 March). Neither will any outcome make it all go away. I don\u2019t think the Guardian would be going beyond its remit in lobbying politicians to attend citizens\u2019 assemblies, guided by experts in psychology and kenosis (be they counsellors, teachers or Quaker elders) to help us listen, be heard and resolve to act for the common good, even where our definitions of it seem diametrically opposite. Libby Ruffle Waldringfield, Suffolk \u2022 Having been defeated twice by thumping majorities, Mrs May now seeks to bring her identical Brexit proposal back for a third roll of the dice. Yet if we the people ask for a second referendum it is a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Why the double standard?

They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far-reaching action. Governments cannot sit back, leaving major decisions to market forces. It hasn\u2019t worked and it never will. Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/uk-student-climate-network-manifesto-declare-emergency\">A manifesto for tackling the climate change crisis | UK Student Climate Network</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Climate change presents terrible risks. But because it demands such massive change and government action, it\u2019s also an opportunity to transform our economy, making it cleaner, healthier and fairer. Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero-carbon emission economy by 2050. We plan to achieve that by ushering in a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d.</p> <p>We have the plans to create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs in the renewable energy sector. That will help meet our target of 60% of energy to come from low-carbon sources within 12 years. The next generation will be trained in the skills needed to work in offshore wind, tidal lagoons and solar energy. Transport currently accounts for a quarter of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in public transport and cycle paths we will reduce our reliance on carbon-emitting vehicles. All new homes built will be zero-carbon too.</p> <p>The UK is home to some of the least populated areas of Europe, and under a green industrial revolution they will be allowed to thrive, not destroyed. Every national and local park in this country has been a victory won by communities through struggle. In the 1930s, working-class people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/apr/17/kinder-scout-mass-trespass-anniversary\" title=\"\">staged a mass protest</a> fighting their way up Kinder Scout in Derbyshire to fight for the \u201cright to roam\u201d, paving the way for the establishment of our national parks years later by a Labour government. And it was Labour\u2019s postwar prime minister Clement Attlee who said that the countryside was not just \u201ca means of producing food, but part of our great national heritage of beauty\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn, Labour: It\u2019s past time all of us stopped looking the other way By taking to the streets today to make their voices heard, young people are educating us about how important tackling climate change is to their generation. They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far-reaching action. Governments cannot sit back, leaving major decisions to market forces. It hasn\u2019t worked and it never will. Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis. Climate change presents terrible risks. But because it demands such massive change and government action, it\u2019s also an opportunity to transform our economy, making it cleaner, healthier and fairer. Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero-carbon emission economy by 2050. We plan to achieve that by ushering in a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d. We have the plans to create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs in the renewable energy sector. That will help meet our target of 60% of energy to come from low-carbon sources within 12 years. The next generation will be trained in the skills needed to work in offshore wind, tidal lagoons and solar energy. Transport currently accounts for a quarter of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in public transport and cycle paths we will reduce our reliance on carbon-emitting vehicles. All new homes built will be zero-carbon too. The UK is home to some of the least populated areas of Europe, and under a green industrial revolution they will be allowed to thrive, not destroyed. Every national and local park in this country has been a victory won by communities through struggle. In the 1930s, working-class people staged a mass protest fighting their way up Kinder Scout in Derbyshire to fight for the \u201cright to roam\u201d, paving the way for the establishment of our national parks years later by a Labour government. And it was Labour\u2019s postwar prime minister Clement Attlee who said that the countryside was not just \u201ca means of producing food, but part of our great national heritage of beauty\u201d. Building on this legacy, a Labour government will ensure that farming conserves and creates safe habitats for birds, insects and other wild animals, and encourages the growth of wildflowers. Labour has a strong record of international leadership on the environment, and action on climate change will be at the heart of our development and trade policies. We have a role not just in protecting and promoting biodiversity in the UK but protecting it in other countries and in the oceans that connect us.

      "bodyText": "David Lidington has insisted Theresa May\u2019s cabinet will continue to work together \u201cvery constructively\u201d, despite eight senior ministers, including the Brexit secretary, voting against an extension to article 50. Steve Barclay voted against a motion tabled by the government, even though he had spoken in favour of it at the dispatch box just minutes earlier. Others who rejected the idea of an extension were Penny Mordaunt, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling. Lidington, who is the Cabinet Office secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI\u2019ve been working very constructively with Steve Barclay since his appointment a couple of months ago despite the fact that he and I were vigorously on opposite sides of the debate during the referendum, and we are continuing to work very constructively together today and in the days to come.\u201d The motion called for a three-month delay to Brexit \u2013 or a potentially much longer one, if parliament does not back the prime minister\u2019s deal next week. That will now become government policy. Lidington said the delay could end up being more than a year, if no deal is agreed in the next few days. \u201cThose are the indications which the Brussels institutions of the EU \u2013 the commission, the council secretariat and certain member state governments \u2013 have been giving to us.\u201d He added: \u201cI hope that MPs of all parties will be over this weekend just reflecting on the way forward.\u201d Conservative MPs were given a free vote on the government\u2019s motion on Thursday, reflecting deep divisions over the best way forward, with just a fortnight to go before the planned exit day. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, compared Barclay\u2019s actions to a chancellor voting against their own budget. Lidington said: \u201cIt was a free vote in that division yesterday. Now, what happens this morning is that the entire cabinet has accepted the position that parliament voted for last night.\u201d He said he believed Brexit-supporting ministers had used the free vote as \u201can opportunity to register how unhappy they were with being in the position where we don\u2019t really have an option as a country except to seek an extension of our time in the European Union\u201d. May is now expected to bring her deal back on Tuesday for a third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d \u2013 and Downing Street is meanwhile engaged in intensive efforts to win over the Democratic Unionist party and members of the Conservative European Research Group. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has drafted fresh legal advice on how the UK could exit the Irish backstop, if there had been \u201can unforeseen and fundamental change of circumstances\u201d \u2013 though it appears not yet to have won over many Brexiters. May will also come under pressure to offer up a timetable for her departure, as a way of convincing Eurosceptics in her party they could replace her, before the crucial next stage of Brexit negotiations.",

Bad news: this isn\u2019t The Thick of It, it\u2019s a hammy disaster film, and every escape you run to is blocked with rubble. To date, parliament has rejected Theresa May\u2019s botched deal, Labour\u2019s alternative proposals, no deal and a second referendum. So what now?</p> <p>The cause of a second referendum is a noble one. There are those of us who fear it would escalate an already gruesome culture war and deliver the same result, but a desire to press a \u201cplease just make this all go away\u201d button is more than understandable. It is a cause ill-served, then, by charlatans for whom a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d is primarily a means to beat Labour, not an end in itself. Chuka Umunna, the de facto leader of the Independent Group, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/chuka-umunna-remain-campaigners-must-drop-calls-for-new-brexit-vote-a3410601.html\" title=\"\">had declared</a> that he had \u201cno time for calls for a second referendum because I think it comes across as disrespectful to those who voted to leave\u201d.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Independent Group (TIG), of which he is a member, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/14/mps-amendments-for-the-brexit-article-50-extension-vote\" title=\"\">tabled an amendment</a> opposed by the official People\u2019s Vote campaign on the basis that, as things stand, it would be defeated and therefore undermine their cause. But TIG couldn\u2019t allow a minor distraction such as the future of the country to get in the way of a pre-written press release slamming Labour for treachery. Labour ordered its troops to abstain on this futile amendment, and yet still a majority of parliament voted against. A pernicious myth, peddled by disparate political factions for self-serving purposes, that Jeremy Corbyn is simultaneously weak and impotent, and in possession of a shiny \u201cstop Brexit\u201d red button, died yesterday. If Labour\u2019s leadership backed a new referendum \u2013 a prospect most Britons currently oppose \u2013 as things stand, parliament would decisively reject it.</p> <p>It is easy to feel resigned to the idea there is no exit from this burning house. It is, however, untrue. Most MPs would back a compromise: a customs union and close alignment with the single market. The extension of article 50 now endorsed by parliament must surely now provide the time and space to settle on this accommodation. It will cause dissatisfaction amongst both remainers and leavers, but, to be blunt, it is a bit late for that. There is one primary obstacle: a flailing prime minister terrified of the history books, which will remember her solely for unnecessarily evaporating her parliamentary majority, and then splitting the Tories. May\u2019s desperation to preserve her own party, at any cost, is the main peril now facing our crisis-ridden nation. In the meantime, drunk on adrenaline and ideology, her Brexiteers wait for the whole house to burn.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Her benighted ministry, a protracted wrestle with David Cameron for the title of \u201cworst prime minister on their own terms since Lord North lost the American colonies\u201d, stutters on thanks to Tory paralysis and cowardice. When did British politics become a plotline that would have been rejected by the creators of The Thick of It on the grounds that satire has to be believable to be funny? Sadly, long before May\u2019s Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay took to the dispatch box to plead with MPs to vote to extend article 50, then marched off to the division lobbies to vote against it. Our house is on fire \u2013 the Tories are the arsonists, manically splashing more petrol on the flames lapping at their own feet \u2013 and it is natural to want to locate an exit. Bad news: this isn\u2019t The Thick of It, it\u2019s a hammy disaster film, and every escape you run to is blocked with rubble. To date, parliament has rejected Theresa May\u2019s botched deal, Labour\u2019s alternative proposals, no deal and a second referendum. So what now? The cause of a second referendum is a noble one. There are those of us who fear it would escalate an already gruesome culture war and deliver the same result, but a desire to press a \u201cplease just make this all go away\u201d button is more than understandable. It is a cause ill-served, then, by charlatans for whom a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d is primarily a means to beat Labour, not an end in itself. Chuka Umunna, the de facto leader of the Independent Group, had declared that he had \u201cno time for calls for a second referendum because I think it comes across as disrespectful to those who voted to leave\u201d. Yesterday, the Independent Group (TIG), of which he is a member, tabled an amendment opposed by the official People\u2019s Vote campaign on the basis that, as things stand, it would be defeated and therefore undermine their cause. But TIG couldn\u2019t allow a minor distraction such as the future of the country to get in the way of a pre-written press release slamming Labour for treachery. Labour ordered its troops to abstain on this futile amendment, and yet still a majority of parliament voted against. A pernicious myth, peddled by disparate political factions for self-serving purposes, that Jeremy Corbyn is simultaneously weak and impotent, and in possession of a shiny \u201cstop Brexit\u201d red button, died yesterday. If Labour\u2019s leadership backed a new referendum \u2013 a prospect most Britons currently oppose \u2013 as things stand, parliament would decisively reject it. It is easy to feel resigned to the idea there is no exit from this burning house. It is, however, untrue. Most MPs would back a compromise: a customs union and close alignment with the single market. The extension of article 50 now endorsed by parliament must surely now provide the time and space to settle on this accommodation. It will cause dissatisfaction amongst both remainers and leavers, but, to be blunt, it is a bit late for that. There is one primary obstacle: a flailing prime minister terrified of the history books, which will remember her solely for unnecessarily evaporating her parliamentary majority, and then splitting the Tories. May\u2019s desperation to preserve her own party, at any cost, is the main peril now facing our crisis-ridden nation. In the meantime, drunk on adrenaline and ideology, her Brexiteers wait for the whole house to burn. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",
