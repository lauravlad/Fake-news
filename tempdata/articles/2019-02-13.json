They are the healers \u2013 100% convincing, 100% certified by a gaggle of secret Facebook users.</p> <p>He asks: \u201cWhat\u2019s the guarantee of your chemo, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>I have perfected my retort during sleepless nights.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>In life there are no guarantees but you have a curable cancer. Yes, there will be side effects but we can manage them. No, I can\u2019t guarantee a cure, but I\u2019d recommend evidence-based treatment any day over the magnet that purportedly draws out cancer cells. And while we are there, it\u2019s not my chemotherapy.

As I talk him through his various options from least to most intensive, I remember the patient who swapped chemotherapy for essential oils, the one who chose to \u201cburn\u201d the tumour out and the one who suggested I become a sales representative for a life-saving juice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In an era where fake news abounds, why should cancer medicine be immune?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t convince me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have the facts, you get to decide,\u201d I reply.</p> <p>I used to think that these second opinions were illuminating for patients and nudged them towards change. But what I have learnt in the last few years is that cancer patients in search of alternative cures are more deeply entrenched than ever in their beliefs. Thanks to the rise of social media, the ability to filter out conflicting viewpoints and a bevy of supporters for every outrageous idea, these people arrive convinced about their theories. Arguing with them is a fool\u2019s errand.</p> <p>Despite the longest consultations, carried out by disadvantaging other needy patients, these patients are often the most dissatisfied because oncologists like me speak our truths with less conviction than the quacks who promise the world but deliver nothing except a lonely death in an unfamiliar emergency room in front of a bewildered family.</p> <p>In an era where fake news abounds, why should cancer medicine be immune?</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.asco.org/research-progress/reports-studies/national-cancer-opinion-survey\">survey</a> commissioned by the American Society of Clinical Oncology spoke to more than 4,000 American adults, a quarter of whom were current or former cancer patients. Nearly 40% of those surveyed \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d agreed that cancer can be cured via oxygen, diet and herbs alone. This is despite the fact that patients who solely choose alternative therapies have a greater than twofold risk of mortality, and those with early-stage cancers such as those of the breast and bowel face a four to sixfold increase in mortality compared with those who have standard therapy.</p> <p>It is tempting to think that modern patients with access to multiple vetted channels of information and, equally, many sources of health warnings, will use them to their advantage. Today\u2019s youth are thought to be especially savvy and discerning.

      "bodyText": "\u201cTell me why I should have your chemotherapy when I can be healed naturally!\u201d His face is set, his arms defensively squared. His friend carries a pamphlet that features a suspiciously healthy woman with glamorous hair and a glowing complexion. This is the urgent appointment of the day, for whom other patients were hastily shuffled to make room. I know I shouldn\u2019t take the bait but, like an addict, I have the urge to say: Go ahead then, be healed. And I will almost certainly see you again, emaciated, ruined, lamenting the fact that it\u2019s too late. Thankfully, the code of conduct glides in. I imagine his dread. I remember my position. And I say: \u201cTell me more.\u201d I hear about the man who uses waves, the woman who boosts immunity and the seller of pure herbs. They are the healers \u2013 100% convincing, 100% certified by a gaggle of secret Facebook users. He asks: \u201cWhat\u2019s the guarantee of your chemo, anyway?\u201d I have perfected my retort during sleepless nights. In life there are no guarantees but you have a curable cancer. Yes, there will be side effects but we can manage them. No, I can\u2019t guarantee a cure, but I\u2019d recommend evidence-based treatment any day over the magnet that purportedly draws out cancer cells. And while we are there, it\u2019s not my chemotherapy. Your taxes fund my job but I don\u2019t profit from giving you chemo. But how many times have I heard that if oncologists hectored a little less and listened a little more, we might win more hearts? So I bite my tongue again, thinking of the alarmed nurse who begged me to change his mind. As I talk him through his various options from least to most intensive, I remember the patient who swapped chemotherapy for essential oils, the one who chose to \u201cburn\u201d the tumour out and the one who suggested I become a sales representative for a life-saving juice. \u201cYou don\u2019t convince me.\u201d \u201cYou have the facts, you get to decide,\u201d I reply. I used to think that these second opinions were illuminating for patients and nudged them towards change. But what I have learnt in the last few years is that cancer patients in search of alternative cures are more deeply entrenched than ever in their beliefs. Thanks to the rise of social media, the ability to filter out conflicting viewpoints and a bevy of supporters for every outrageous idea, these people arrive convinced about their theories. Arguing with them is a fool\u2019s errand. Despite the longest consultations, carried out by disadvantaging other needy patients, these patients are often the most dissatisfied because oncologists like me speak our truths with less conviction than the quacks who promise the world but deliver nothing except a lonely death in an unfamiliar emergency room in front of a bewildered family. In an era where fake news abounds, why should cancer medicine be immune? A survey commissioned by the American Society of Clinical Oncology spoke to more than 4,000 American adults, a quarter of whom were current or former cancer patients. Nearly 40% of those surveyed \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d agreed that cancer can be cured via oxygen, diet and herbs alone. This is despite the fact that patients who solely choose alternative therapies have a greater than twofold risk of mortality, and those with early-stage cancers such as those of the breast and bowel face a four to sixfold increase in mortality compared with those who have standard therapy. It is tempting to think that modern patients with access to multiple vetted channels of information and, equally, many sources of health warnings, will use them to their advantage. Today\u2019s youth are thought to be especially savvy and discerning. Alas, the survey found that nearly half of those under the age of 53 thought that cancer can be cured by alternative therapies alone. Even among people directly affected by cancer, a quarter believed in alternative therapy over standard treatments. If anyone was relying on family to help them see the light, more than a third of caregivers for cancer patients shared the misguided belief in alternative cures. Enzymes, waves and magnets do not cure cancer, and they cost the patient every step of the way. Small bottles of unknown and frequently adulterated or plainly toxic substances cost hundreds of dollars, not to mention every consultation that pretends to read the eyes and sense the energy to cure cancer, even as the patient worsens. How do I know? Because dying patients relate these stories in a last attempt to prevent their fellow patients being duped. It has been received wisdom that oncologists can see off quackery through good communication but I\u2019m afraid that isn\u2019t so. Oncologists have been properly entangled in a web of fake news. Their authority has been undermined and their expertise ridiculed by a determined, global and hard-to-track battalion of quacks and their acolytes. Greater vigilance, stronger regulation and improved health literacy might help, but the pull of alternative cures is strong. Make no mistake.

      "bodyText": "The editor of an online newspaper in the Philippines has been arrested on charges of cyber-libel as part of what the country\u2019s journalists\u2019 union said was a campaign of intimidation against voices critical of President Rodrigo Duterte. Speaking from the headquarters of news website Rappler on Wednesday before she was taken away by four plainclothes officers, Maria Ressa said she was not intimidated. \u201cThese legal acrobatics show how far the government will go to silence journalists, including the pettiness of forcing me to spend the night in jail,\u201d she added. The charge of cyber-libel, which Ressa denies, was filed by the justice department and the warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest issued by a Manila court judge on Tuesday. After she was arrested, Ressa was taken to the National Bureau of Investigations, which is under the Department of Justice, where she was to be held overnight. \u201cThe filing of this case is preposterous and baseless,\u201d said Rappler in a statement. \u201cIf this is another of several attempts to intimidate us, it will not succeed, as past attempts have shown.\u201d The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines described the arrest as a \u201cshameless act of persecution by a bully government\u201d. \u201cIt is clear this is part of the administration\u2019s obsession to shut Rappler down and intimidate the rest of the independent Philippine media into toeing the line,\u201d the NUJ said in a statement. The charges against Ressa relate to a story published on Rappler\u2019s website in May 2012 that alleged ties between a Philippine businessman, Wilfredo D Keng, and a high court judge. The controversial cyber-libel law under which she is being prosecuted, was enacted four months after the story was written. The libel case was first brought in 2017, but initially dismissed by the NBI. It was reopened in 2018. Ressa\u2019s arrest comes just two months after she turned herself in to authorities over charges of tax evasion at Rappler. Speaking on her release on bail in December, Ressa accused the Philippine government of trying to intimidate and harass journalists and \u201cweaponising the rule of law\u201d against its critics. Rappler, which is one of the most influential news sites in the Philippines, has also been one of the news outlets most critical of Duterte\u2019s administration since he took power in 2016. In particular, it has scrutinised his government over the brutal war on drugs, which officially has taken more than 5,000 lives, though human rights groups allege the true figure is more than double that. In response, Duterte\u2019s administration has instigated seven separate cases against Rappler. The government banned Rappler\u2019s political reporter from the presidential palace. It has ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate Rappler for being \u201cforeign-owned\u201d, even going as far as revoking its licence, in a case that went all the way to the court of appeal. In November, the Department of Justice confirmed it was charging Rappler with three counts of failure to file returns, and one count of tax evasion \u2013 all charges that Ressa denies. The charges carry heavy fines and jail sentences of up to 10 years. Ressa\u2019s refusal to back down has won her plaudits around the world. She was named a Time magazine person of the year in 2018, and won the 2018 Knight International Journalism award and this year\u2019s prestigious Press Freedom award, given by the Committee to Protect Journalists. Butch Olano, the director of Amnesty International Philippines, described Ressa\u2019s arrest as \u201cbrazenly politically motivated, and consistent with the authorities\u2019 threats and repeated targeting of Ressa and her team\u201d. \u201cIn a country where justice takes years to obtain, we see the charges against her being railroaded and the law being used to relentlessly intimidate and harass journalists for doing their jobs as truth-tellers,\u201d Olano said.",

PSG won Tuesday\u2019s first leg with a dominant display. Pogba was sent off for a second booking towards the end, ruling him out of the return on 6 March. Draxler, asked whether this was a big advantage to the French champions, said: \u201cYes, I think so because for me Paul is the best player of Manchester United. A very important player for the team and you could see he is fantastic. That is why we are very happy he will not play the second leg.\u201d PSG were able to beat United with ease despite the absence of Neymar and Edinson Cavani. \u201cIf two players like this are missing, everyone is talking about that, that is normal,\u201d Draxler said. \u201cFor sure, we are better if Cavani and Neymar are not missing.

Really nice.</p> <p><strong>But they have lost a little rhythm of late. </strong>A couple of weekends ago, a 3-3 draw at home to Werder Bremen in the cup led to defeat on penalties.

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s your lot. A huge second-half performance by Tottenham Hotspur. The leaders of the Bundesliga were swept aside, and now Spurs have one foot in the quarters. Just one solid night\u2019s work at the Westfalenstadion in three weeks\u2019 time should do it. Our man Daniel Taylor was at Wembley, and here\u2019s his report. Thanks for reading! Nighty night! And here\u2019s the report of Ajax 1-2 Real Madrid \u2026 And here\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino, who really earned his corn tonight at half-time. \u201cIt was a fantastic second half. It was a very difficult game from the beginning, and difficult to find our best positions in both directions. We struggled to play the way we wanted to play. But afterwards we played with more confidence. In the second half, we played a very good game. Against a very good side like Dortmund, in the Champions League, it is still difficult and there is still a lot of work to do. 3-0 is a very good result but we need to think how we can finish the job. We have an unbelievable squad, the only problem we have is I can only pick 11, not 22.\u201d Jadon Sancho comes out to speak. \u201cAw, I don\u2019t have any words for the second half. We tried our best but tonight Tottenham was the better team. First half we played really well, but in the second we dropped a bit and lost focus. Next leg we have to keep focus for the whole game. Jan Vertonghen is a good player, but hopefully next time we can handle it a bit better. But I\u2019m happy to be home and play in front of my friends and family, I\u2019m happy to be here. We\u2019re still in it, still focused, and will go into the next leg thinking we can score enough goals.\u201d The 18-year-old Dortmund winger an impressive interviewee, despite his obvious disappointment. Here\u2019s the man of the moment - the man of the match - Jan Vertonghen. \u201cWe were not creating too many chances, they had the better of the game in the first half. But in the second they dropped off a bit, and our early goal helped us. They were happy with 1-0 so we could continue attacking. It was just one of those nights. A great cross by Serge for the goal, who saw me running.\u201d His pal Heung-Min Son adds: \u201cJan is technically unbelievable, he could play any position. I am happy for him with his one goal and one assist. The cross for my goal was unbelievable, unreal, I just had to touch the ball. I feel sorry because when I scored I didn\u2019t run to him! I am honoured to play with him and he can play striker for me!\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that Spurs have only reached the quarter finals of the European Cup or Champions League on two occasions before. The glory, glory team of Blanchflower, White and Mackay made it to the semis in 1962, while a Crouchigol took Harry Redknapp\u2019s team past Milan and into the quarters in 2011. Nobody at Spurs will be counting their chickens, but a third appearance at the business end of this tournament is well within their reach now. Easy to forget now that Spurs were second best in the first half, albeit not by any great distance. However they were wonderful in the second period and simply blew Dortmund away! Heung-Min Son and Christian Eriksen both excelled, but the plaudits will go to stand-in wing-back Jan Vertonghen, whose front-foot display as an ersatz winger in the second period was quite something to behold. And he didn\u2019t neglect his defensive duties either, allowing Dortmund not a sniff after the restart. Mauricio Pochettino walks off smiling quietly, another tactical plan having come together. How about that Jan Vertonghen, huh. 90 min +1: Victor Wanyama comes on for Moussa Sissoko. It\u2019s a party atmosphere at Wembley. 90 min: Just two minutes of stoppage time to come. Guerreiro hits a first-time curler towards the top left from 25 yards. If it had been on target, it was a goal because Lloris wasn\u2019t getting there. But Dortmund aren\u2019t getting an away goal that would give them a desperately needed boost ahead of the second leg. Inches wide. 89 min: Son Heung-Min - who would be man of the match on any other day, but you\u2019re not getting that award off Jan Vertonghen - makes way for Erik Lamela. 87 min: Raphael Guerreiro comes on for Jadon Sancho. The Bundesliga leaders don\u2019t know what\u2019s hit them. Tottenham have been quite outstanding since the restart! What a second-half showing this is from Spurs! Eriksen works his way down the left and earns a corner. He takes the set piece himself, and loops it into the six-yard box, where Llorente nips in ahead of Diallo and heads neatly towards the bottom right and in! Wembley\u2019s roof now spinning over the Severn Bridge. 84 min: Lucas Moura makes way for Fernando Llorente. The Wembley roof is now frisbeeing halfway down the M4. Vertonghen has been the star of the show tonight, and now he\u2019s set the seal on it! Aurier, deep on the right, loops a cross into the centre where Vertonghen has made a striker\u2019s run. It\u2019s a perfect cross, dropping right in front of Vertonghen, and he powers a first-time sidefoot past Burki. Who needs Harry Kane when you\u2019ve got Jan Vertonghen? 82 min: Son is sent scampering into space down the left by Winks, quarterbacking from deep, but can\u2019t quite summon the energy to power towards the Dortmund area. He\u2019s forced to check back and the move breaks down. 80 min: Sancho was a jet-heeled sensation in the first half, but he\u2019s not been so proactive in the second. He\u2019s got a chance to race at the Spurs back line, but turns tail this time and though his skill earns a free kick off Sissoko, it\u2019s in the middle of the park and not much use to Dortmund at all. 78 min: And here\u2019s Wayne Ziants: \u201cI don\u2019t know about the game, but I\u2019m thrilled by the fact that every Dortmund player in the starting XI has between five and seven letters in his name. The side picks itself.\u201d Oh Schmelzer! How could you! 77 min: Dortmund make the first change of the evening, replacing Dan-Axel Zagadou with Marcel Schmelzer. 76 min: Eriksen\u2019s flat delivery goes through a thicket of players and finds its way to Moura, bombing in from the left. Moura lashes towards the top right; the ball is blocked by Delaney\u2019s back, and out for a corner. There\u2019s a quick VAR check for a handball shout against Delaney, but nothing\u2019s doing. And then from the second corner, Moura blazes over the bar from distance, and that\u2019s the end of all that. 75 min: Vertonghen digs out a deep cross from a tight spot on the left. Son recycles on the other flank, and tees up Eriksen, whose low shot from the edge of the box is deflected out for a corner on the right. Eriksen to take himself. 73 min: Dortmund take a turn to probe this way and that. Dahoud tries to flick Pulisic clear down the inside-left channel, but the ball breaks to Lloris who can clear and set Spurs away on the break. Moura romps down the left, with Son free on the right. Hakimi is the only Dortmund player back! But the defender does exceptionally well to deny Moura the chance to flick a pass inside for Son, and eventually the ball is sent back to Burki, who tidies up. 71 min: Spurs ping it around the midfield with such style that the crowd break into spontaneous applause at their crisp triangulations. Of course, almost immediately, Alderweireld gives up possession with a clunker of a pass. Timing is everything in comedy. 69 min: A lot of space for Dahoud, 25 yards from goal, teed up by Delaney. But his shot, an attempted thread into the bottom right, has no oomph whatsoever. Lloris snaffles without drama. 67 min: Dortmund continue to toil. Their fans continue to make a wonderful noise. Their drummers have been going metronomically all night. Jaki Liebezeit would be proud. 65 min: Aurier powers his way down the right. He\u2019s got Moura in the middle, but his low cross is hooked away by Toprak. That\u2019s great defending. Spurs are causing Dortmund all manner of bother here. 63 min: Vertonghen\u2019s wing wizardry continues. Now he whips low into the Dortmund box from the left, Son very nearly bundling home from close range. But three yellow shirts bundle Son and the ball out for a corner instead. And the set piece comes to nothing. Spurs - and in particular Vertonghen and Son - have been superb since the restart. 62 min: Pulisic dribbles into the Spurs box from the left. For a second it looks like it\u2019s going to open up for him, but Sanchez pressurises him from behind and the ball clanks between his legs. Spurs clear. That\u2019s the first time Dortmund have looked dangerous since the restart. 61 min: Alderweireld rakes a long pass down the left to release Eriksen in acres. Dortmund were fast asleep! Eriksen tears into the box, and merely has to find Son in the middle for a tap-in. But his cross is headed out just in time by Zagadou. The resulting corner nearly leads to a goal as well, Eriksen\u2019s delivery from the left nearly flicked into the top left by Alderweireld. But Burki gathers. 59 min: That wonderful assist has got Vertonghen\u2019s juices flowing. He channels his inner Tom Finney, dribbling his way down the left, cutting inside, and shaping for a shot. He should probably slip in Son, but gets caught up in the mood and sends a shot over instead. 58 min: However the Dortmund fans are still giving it all they\u2019ve got. They\u2019re contributing to a fine atmosphere at Wembley. 57 min: The Spurs press is so much more intense in this second half. Dortmund continue to labour as a result. 55 min: It takes a while to find a ball so the free kick can be taken. It\u2019s not worth the wait, Eriksen blootering witlessly, uncharacteristically, into the Dortmund wall. 53 min: Dortmund are understandably a bit flat since that early second-half blow. They\u2019re struggling to string more than a couple of passes together. Spurs want to make hay while the sun shines. Vertonghen tears down the left and slips a pass inside for Son, who Cruyff turns Delaney and is clipped on his heel for the trouble. A booking for Delaney, and a free kick in an extremely dangerous position to the left of the D. 51 min: Eriksen tries to find Moura with a raking pass down the middle. Just a little too much juice on the ball, allowing Burki to gather. 49 min: Wembley has erupted, the roof currently spinning over Hanger Lane roundabout. A superb start to the second half, and it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how Dortmund - who were on balance, just about, the better team in the first half - respond to that. Just over a minute into the second half, and Spurs lead! Alderweireld launches long down the left. Moura flicks a header into the box, but Burki gathers. No matter, because Spurs are back at Dortmund again, Vertonghen tight on the left touchline. The big defender curls a perfect cross into the centre, inches over Zagadou\u2019s head. It drops to Son, who sidefoots powerfully into the top left! A fine run and finish by Son, but what a cross from Vertonghen! We\u2019re back! Spurs get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. For those of you who can\u2019t be bothered to click, the answer is no. And that\u2019s that for the first 45. Interesting rather than exciting, though both teams will wonder how they haven\u2019t scored. Lucas Moura and Dan-Axel Zagadou have both gone very close, while Jadon Sancho has been a handful. 45 min: ... Dortmund nearly score! They take it short, Sancho chips to the far post, Zagadou rises highest and should plant a header home from close range. But the ball takes a slight deflection off Foyth, and Lloris is able to get over and palm away with a strong hand. Great save! Another corner follows, but that comes to nought. 44 min: Goetze barges his way through a couple of challenges down the right and earns a corner. From which ... 42 min: Hakimi goes on a power wander down the right. He looks for Goetze in the middle, but the ball takes a huge deflection off Vertonghen and loops into the arms of Lloris. 40 min: Sancho was livid at the lack of any decision from the referee there. You can\u2019t blame him. But it was a wonderful, exhilarating run by the English youngster, who has been the star turn in this first half. 38 min: Sancho tears down the inside-right channel, gliding into the centre. Sissoko, having been burned for speed, cynically clips Sancho\u2019s foot. It\u2019s got to be a free kick to the right of the D, and a booking for Sissoko, but the referee waves play on. That\u2019s a very poor decision. Sissoko and Spurs have got away with one there. 37 min: An odd cameo from Burki, who has the ball at his feet, lets it clank between his legs, spins through 360 degrees in confusion, then rediscovers his poise well enough to scoop a pass over Moura towards Toprak in the left-back position. From the ridiculous to the sublime. 36 min: Eriksen finds Son free down the left. He enters the box and hits a hard cross-cum-shot towards Moura in the middle. Burki, at the near post, kicks away from danger. 35 min: Delaney has a crack from a position to the left of the D. It\u2019s heading into the bottom left. Lloris gets down well, though can only parry straight back into the box. Sanchez can\u2019t quite clear; Sancho can\u2019t quite shoot. Spurs eventually clear their lines. 34 min: This is a little better from Spurs, as Moura nearly fashions space for a shot 25 yards out. Then Vertonghen whips a cross in from the left; Zagadou clears. Finally Aurier and Foyth combine crisply on the right touchline; Foyth cuts one back for Eriksen, who blazes a wild first-time effort over the bar from the edge of the box. 32 min: Son tries to trick Zagadou down the right with an elaborate dummy. It nearly comes off but he runs out of pitch. Still nothing quite working for the hosts. 30 min: But then they\u2019re not getting any help from the referee either. Hakimi stands on Vertonghen\u2019s toe, near the left-hand corner flag, but Spurs aren\u2019t awarded a free kick in a dangerous position. Instead Dortmund nearly open them up from the resulting goal kick, Goetze close to setting Sancho off on another of his searing scampers on the right. Not quite. 29 min: Alderweireld creams a long pass down the inside-left, hoping to release Son. But Toprak calmly flicks a header back to Burki and that\u2019s that dealt with. Spurs are not clicking in the final third right now. 27 min: A much-needed period of sterile domination for Spurs. They\u2019re going nowhere, but they\u2019ve pushed Dortmund back after a period in which the visitors were beginning to ask some awkward questions. 25 min: Not much happening for Spurs right now. Moura drops deep in the hope of making something happen, but his play is nervous and fidgety and he gives up possession with some loose control and a poor ball forward. 23 min: Sancho runs at Spurs down the inside-right again, and in tandem with Goetze causes all sorts of bother in the box. Fortunately for Spurs, they\u2019re able to crowd the pair out in numbers, and an eventual shot squirts softly through the thicket and into the arms of Lloris. Dortmund are beginning to look extremely dangerous. 21 min: Sancho is sent scampering clear down the right wing, thanks to a first-time pass from Dahoud. For a second it looks as though he\u2019ll make it into the box for a shot, turning Sanchez this way and that. But he decides to cross, and his low ball, intended for Goetze, is cut out well by Foyth. 20 min: Vertonghen clears Pulisic\u2019s free kick with ease, but Witsel immediately comes back at Spurs and sends a low fizzer towards the bottom left. Lloris is behind it all the way and gathers confidently. 19 min: Sissoko slides in clumsily on Hakimi as the right-back races down the wing. This is a free kick just to the right of the Spurs box, which is now loaded with Dortmund players. 18 min: The visitors enjoy another period of sterile domination. This match has had a nice back-and-forth swing so far, with both teams enjoying periods of possession. Nice. 16 min: Dortmund have had a sniff now, and it\u2019s suddenly enlivened them. Goetze slips a pass down the inside-right channel that should release Sancho, but the young striker takes a heavy touch that allows Vertonghen to come across and clear. He should have made it to the area for a shot on goal. 15 min: Foyth over-elaborates on the left-hand edge of his own box. Goetze strips him of possession and sets up Pulisic for a dribble into the area. He\u2019s faced with a tight angle, and has Sancho in the middle, waiting to tap home. But he tries to beat Lloris, who isn\u2019t getting beaten at his near post and kicks away. 14 min: Passes aren\u2019t sticking right now. Sanchez plays a poor one forward, Sancho intercepts, looks for Goetze, falls over. 12 min: Good work by Aurier, who chases an Eriksen pass down the right and earns Spurs the first corner of the match. Eriksen takes. Foyth fresh-air kicks, and Dortmund can break upfield. Pulisic turns on the jets down the left and Aurier pulls him back by the elastic of his trousers. That\u2019s another first for Aurier: the first yellow of the game. 10 min: And it\u2019s giving Dortmund something to think about. Winks bursts into space in the middle of the park, and should release Son down the inside-right channel, but overhits the pass. Not by much; small margins. 9 min: After a slow-ish start, Spurs are beginning to get more into the game. They enjoy an extended period of possession for the first time this evening. 7 min: Spurs nearly take the lead in spectacular style! Delaney\u2019s header upfield isn\u2019t all that. Sanchez returns it, and the ball drops towards Moura, just inside the box on the left. Moura takes the ball down with one touch, then creams a diagonal volley inches wide of the top right! So closde. Burki wasn\u2019t getting to that. 6 min: Delaney slips a clever ball down the inside-left channel, into acres, but Pulisic was a bit slow to read it. Foyth plays it back to Lloris, who gives Spurs fans a shudder, nearly getting closed down by Sancho. But he gets it away. 4 min: Dortmund are enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession in these early exchanges, but nearly all of it is in their half. Goetze and Pulisic try to get positive down the left, but Foyth is in charge of this situation and clears. 2 min: Dortmund spend some more time knocking the ball around at the back. Then Delaney scoops a pass forward down the left for Sancho, who briefly threatens to drop a shoulder and scoot past Foyth, but Spurs hold their shape well and eventually the ball\u2019s won back. Early signs that Dortmund aren\u2019t planning to sit back all evening. And we\u2019re off! The visitors get the party started, as Wembley erupts again in noise. Roars pinging off the walls. Dortmund stroke it around the back awhile, then gift the ball to Winks, who combines with Vertonghen to send the ball out for a throw. Everyone just happy to get their first touch. A minute\u2019s silence before kick-off. It\u2019s in tribute to England\u2019s 1966 World Cup goalkeeping hero Gordon Banks, who passed away yesterday, and the tragic Emiliano Sala. It\u2019s perfectly observed, then it segues into warm applause. A touching moment. RIP. The teams are out! A wonderful European atmosphere at Wembley, not least because the Dortmund fans have been in situ for ages and have been giving it plenty. Tottenham Hotspur sport their world-famous lilywhite shirts, while Dortmund are in their equally storied yellow and black. It\u2019s an aesthetic treat, my old association-football-loving pals. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes! A relaxed Mauricio Pochettino speaks to BT Sport! \u201cI am always positive. Of course we have the utmost of respect for our opponent, Borussia Dortmund is a fantastic team and will be very competitive. But I believe in my players. It will be different, we cannot compare to last season, the momentum, the circumstance, the situation is different. We believe we need to be at our best if we want to win. The competitive level is so high, with the Premier League it is the best competition, and we need to be 100 percent focused. We have tried to provide the team with fresh legs. I trust and believe in all the players and hope I am right in my selection. People can talk after, but we always try to be right and prepare so we can win today.\u201d A reminder that VAR is in use for the first time in the Champions League this week. All the officials have been issued with a nicely typeset leaflet explaining how the VAR team will \u201cconstantly check for clear and obvious errors related to the following four match-changing situations: goals, incidents in the penalty area, red cards, and mistaken identity.\u201d Two matches in, and there\u2019s been no major controversy that would lead you to question whether the whole thing is worth the effort yet. But give it time. Older readers may recall Andy Townsend\u2019s Tactics Truck, from 2001 ITV light-entertainment vehicle The Premiership. The set-up\u2019s not a million miles away from that. Tragedy + time = comedy. Pennant watch: Tottenham\u2019s crest is a stone-cold design classic, but the same can\u2019t be said of this pennant. Some major leading issues with the text squeezed in at the top, it\u2019s all over the place. Note that while the commemorative flag hangs from a solid silver hook, keeper and captain Hugo Lloris\u2019s shirt is on something of a shoogly peg. A cheap and cheerful metaphor for his recent form. Both sides make four changes from their weekend XIs. Of the team named for the 3-1 win over Leicester City, Tottenham drop Kieran Tripper, Danny Rose, Oliver Skipp and Fernando Llorente to the bench. Their places are taken by Serge Aurier, Toby Alderweireld, Juan Foyth and Lucas Moura. Jan Vertonghen will play left wing-back as Spurs start with a back three. Dortmund drop Raphael Guerreiro, Maximilian Philipp, Lucasz Piszczek and Julian Weigl from the team that capitulated against Hoffenheim. Thomas Delaney, Omer Toprak, Dan-Axel Zagadou and Chelsea-bound Christian Pulisic take their places. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Sanchez, Foyth, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Sissoko, Winks, Eriksen, Son, Lucas Moura. Subs: Gazzaniga, Trippier, Rose, Lamela, Wanyama, Llorente, Skipp. Borussia Dortmund: Burki, Hakimi, Zagadou, Toprak, Diallo, Witsel, Delaney, Sancho, Dahoud, Pulisic, Gotze. Subs: Hitz, Guerreiro, Balerdi, Philipp, Wolf, Schmelzer, Bruun Larsen. Referee: Antonio Jesus Lopez Nieto (Spain). According to their sporting director Michael Zorc, Borussia Dortmund have eschewed former coach Jurgen Klopp\u2019s \u201cheavy metal football\u201d in favour of a \u201cmodern jazz approach\u201d built around bandleader Lucien Favre\u2019s inventive new 4-2-3-1 arrangement. Nice! On the wings, Jadon Sancho and Jacob Bruun Larsen. Playing full back, Achraf Hakimi. Axel Witsel and Mario Gotze in midfield. Theydon Bois on guitar. Clam on bass. The North Rhine-Westphalia Big Band are certainly locked into a groove this season. They\u2019re leading the Bundesliga, top scorers with 54 goals, currently on course for their first title since 2012. They only conceded two goals en route to winning Group A, keeping five clean sheets in six games. There\u2019s a good vibe about the place. Really nice. But they have lost a little rhythm of late. A couple of weekends ago, a 3-3 draw at home to Werder Bremen in the cup led to defeat on penalties. Then last weekend they let a three-goal lead slip in the last 15 minutes at home to Hoffenheim in the league, allowing Bayern Munich to close the gap at the top to five points. They\u2019re not exactly nodding out on stage, but it\u2019s a worry nonetheless. Tottenham\u2019s season meanwhile has been driven along by some extremely experimental polyrhythms. They were forced to stage a great escape to get out of the groups after a dismal start; they were recently knocked out of both domestic cups in a grisly four-day stretch; and they\u2019re in the thick of the race for the Premier League, with Harry Kane and Dele Alli soon to return rested and fresh. Great! So this is a close one to call. Form\u2019s no guide. Neither is the recent head-to-head, with Dortmund knocking Spurs out of the Europa League 5-1 on aggregate in 2016, and Spurs winning home and away in the Champions League groups last season. This tie is perfectly pitched. It\u2019s on! The session begins at: 8pm GMT.",

Needless to say, he thinks it was a great decision, even though he appears very confused indeed about why it was given.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s report of Tottenham 3-0 Dortmund \u2026 Thibaut Courtois speaks: Speaking to BT Sport after the game, the Real Madrid goalkeeper is asked about the big VAR decision in the first half. Needless to say, he thinks it was a great decision, even though he appears very confused indeed about why it was given. He thinks it was for a non-existent offside in the pahse of play (Matthij\u2019s de Ligt\u2019s header) before his rick that led to Nicolas Tagliafico heading the ball past him. Broadcasting\u2019s Danny Baker has had his say on the major talking point from tonight\u2019s match. While I largely agree with him, the problem about tonight\u2019s decision lies more with the offside rule than anything to do with VAR. If it requires forensic examination of a TV screen by several people to definitively decide that a player is offside by the width of a few pixels in the build-up to a goal, then the offside law is an ass. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! An entertaining match draws to a close and Real Madrid take a 2-1 lead back to the Bernabeu thanks to their late smash-and-grab. Despite a heroic effort from Ajax, whose players look devastated, goals from Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio either side of Hakim Ziyech\u2019s strike in the 75th minute give Real the advantage. 90+2 min: Chance!!! Put through on goal with only Thibaut Courtois to beat, Kasper Dolberg scuffs his shot horribly under pressure from a defender. 90 min: Sergio Ramos is one yellow card from a booking and decides he\u2019ll sit out the next match to wipe his slate clean. He sticks out a leg and upends Kasper Dolberg and the ref duly obliges him by taking his name. Anyway, back to the goal. With Madrid on the attack, Marco Asensio escaped from his Donny van de Beek at the far post to prod home a wonderful cross that Carvajal had curled through the Ajax penalty area from the right flank. Oh, for the love of God. The ref has to consult with his VAR team again, as they examine another possible foul in the build-up. The players don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, the fans don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on ... after a short pause long enough to be extremely irritating, he points to the centre-circle and the goal stands. Madrid retake the lead as the game enters its knockings. Of course they do. 85 min: Real Madrid substitution from a few minutes ago: Vinicius Junior off, Mariano Diaz on. 83 min: A yellow card for Lucas Vazquez, who is booked for a cynical foul on David Neres. 82 min: Asensio tries his luck again from distance, but this effort is blocked by Matthijs de Ligt. 81 min: Onana concedes a corner, with a hideously bad clearance. To be fair to him, the ball took a ferocious bobble off a discarded plastic pint glass that had blown, or been thrown on to the pitch. 79 min: Marco Asensio tries a speculative shot and it\u2019s a fine effort which surprises Andre Onana and goes into the side-netting. It stands!!! I\u2019m not sure why it wouldn\u2019t have, but there were a few nervy moments as Real\u2019s players complained about a challenge they thought was illegal in the build-up to the goal. It was a fairly straightforward finish for Ziyech, who got in front of his man to slot home a ball squared to him by Neres from the left. It\u2019s all square in Amsterdam, as Hakim Ziyech equalises for the home side!!! But wait, Real\u2019s players are surrounding the referee ... 74 min: Kasper Dolberg is straight into action, firing high over the bar after making a nicely angled run to stay onside and latch on to a neat through ball. 72 min: Ajax substitution: Lasse Schone makes way for his compatriot Kasper Dolberg. Real Madrid substitution: Karim Benzema off, Marco Asensio on. 71 min: Hakim Ziyech takes the free-kick and it\u2019s on target, but doesn\u2019t trouble Courtois a jot. 70 min: Sergio Reguilon, the young Madrid native who is keeping Marcelo out of the Real Madrid side, is booked after conceding a free-kick a few yards outside his own penalty area and is booked. It\u2019s 27 metres from goal and in a wonderful position. 68 min: Kasper Dolberg is about to come on for Ajax. Standing on the touchline receiving final instructions from Erik ten Hag, the young Dane looks about 12 years old. 64 min: Daley Blind plays a lovely ball into the Real Madrid penalty area, trying to pick out Tagliafico in a good position. Carvajal shields the ball well, holding off the Ajax left-back, allowing Thibaut Courtois to collect the ball. 62 min: That\u2019s heartbreaking for Ajax, but monotonously predictable from Real Madrid, who were dismal in the first half, but have been going through the gears in the opening 15 minutes of the second. 60 min: Real substitution: Gareth Bale off, Lucas Vazquez on. Brilliant play from Vinisius, who gets in behind Mazraoui down the touchline, cuts inside into the penalty area and tees up Benzema, who smashes the ball past Andre Onana. 58 min: Real\u2019s spell of uninterrupted possession is interrupted by a Vinicius foul on Mazraoui, who wins a free-kick for his team. 57 min: Bale plays the ball out wide to vinicius on the left flank as Real enjoy a spell of uninterrupted possession. 55 min: Luka Modric overcooks a pass meant for Gareth Bale down the inside right. As fast as he is, the Welsh winger can\u2019t prevent the ball from rolling out of play. 53 min: Hakim Ziyech is booked for flying into a challenge on Gareth Bale. He is now one of six Ajax players currently walking what is known in the trade as the \u201cdisciplinary tightrope\u201d, one yellow card away from triggering an automatic ban. 50 min: Neres beats the offside trap to latch on to a ball from deep. Taking the ball wide, he brings a smart save out of Courtois with a rasping drive. A corner for Ajax, from which nothing comes. 50 min: A pooor throw-out from Onana gifts possession to Real Madrid, with Carvajal taking advantage. A period of sustained pressure from Real leads to Carvajal teeing up Benzema on the edge of the box. His shot arrows towards the bottom right-hand corner, but Onana throws himself to his left to save. 49 min: Carvajal picks out Bale running up the inside right. His squared ball towards Benzema is intercepted and cleared. 47 min: No changes in personnel on either side at half-time, by the way. 46 min: Ajax get the ball rolling for the second half after bossing Real Madrid for the opening 45 minutes. They\u2019ve been outstanding and Real have been poor, but the deadlock remains unbroken. More on that VAR decision: It seems a certainty that Dusan Tadic was adjudged to be offside and interfering with play when Matthias de Ligt headed the ball goalwards. Very, very unfortunate for Ajax. It was so tight that VAR, which we\u2019re told will only take seconds, took two minutes and 50 seconds to clear that one up. The players go in for the break, with several of Ajax\u2019s number looking absolutely furious. They scored and celebrated what seemed to be a perfectly legitimate goal, only to have it ruled out after what seemed like an eternity after the referee had interacted with his video assistant refereeing team and then forensically studied the goal on his own pitchside monitor. The Ajax players and the fans who have come to see them have no idea why the goal was ruled out. Courtois will be relieved to be off the hook. 45+1 min: Ajax win a free-kick for a Carvajal foul on Tagliafico between penalty area and touchline. Lasse Schone ties his luck with an ambitious shot, but Courtois saves easily. 44 min: VAR is far from perfect, but it could easily be a lot less imperfect. It\u2019s completely ridiculous that nobody in the stadium or watching on TV knows why that goal was ruled out. For what it\u2019s worth, the goal looked fine to me. Critics of VAR will have a field day with this one. Ajax won a couple of corners in quick succession and at one, Mattijs de Ligt directed a powerful header goalwards. Thibaut Courtois failed to catch it and the ball cannoned off him, up into the air. With the goalkeeper off his line, Tagliafico headed into an unguarded net from seven or eight yards out. Following a very long pause for VAR intervention, the referee appears to rule it out for either offside - Dusan Tadic was standing in front of Courtois when the \u201cgoal\u201d was scored, possibly in an offside decision and seems to have been judged to have interfered with play. That looks a harsh decision. 39 min: Or do they? There\u2019s a pause in play as the referee calls for some VAR intervention, before heading over to the touchline to check his monitor for himself. Ajax go in front, deservedly so, largely thanks to a monumental flap by Thibaut Courtois. 36 min: CHANCE!!! Tadic is instrumental in a sequence of slick passes on the edge of the Real box that leads to Mazraoui finding himself on the right side of the Real Madrid penalty area with the ball at his feet. With only Courtois to beat, he shoots straight at the goalkeeper. 35 min: Casemiro recovers sufficiently to be on hand to play the ball out of defence following more good work from Dusan Tadic, who is popping up everywhere. 33 min: Andy van de Beek is penalised for raking his studs down the achilles of Casemiro. That looked a sore one. 30 min: Bale and Carvajal combine down the right flank, before the Welshman unleashes another long range effort. Onana saves. Ajax promptly launch the ball forward for Tadic, who is winning his fair share of the long balls occasionally lofted his way. 27 min: Neres is quite deliberately shoved off the ball in the area between the left side of the Madrid penalty area and the touchline by Dani Carvajal, but doesn\u2019t get a free-kick. It\u2019s a strange one, because as two-armed shoves in the back go, it wasn\u2019t exactly subtle. 25 min: CHANCE!!! Dusan Tadic does well to hold off Sergio Ramos as he runs on to a through-ball into the Real Madrid penalty area. Firing first time, he rifles the bouncing ball off the cross-bar. So close for Ajax. 24 min: David Neres tries to wriggle his way through the Real Madrid box for Ajax, but Sergio Ramos momentarily dispossesses him. Moments later, the left-winger plays a give-and-go to Tadic on the edge of the box, but the return pass has far too much weight on it and the ball rolls out of play for a goal kick. 22 min: Daley Blind floats a long ball over the top for Tadic to chase, but Real\u2019s defence clear up with ease. 20 min: Even playing the ball out from the back, Ajax\u2019s players look very comfortable on the ball and completely unphased by the status of their opponents, the defending European champions. Real\u2019s, by contrast, are giving the ball away with uncharacteristic frequency. 18 min: Dusan Tadic is penalised for putting his arm across the face of Nacho and knocking him to the ground as the pair contest a high clearance from Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana. 16 min: Ajax go forward, with Tadic playing the ball wide to Nicolas Tagliafico on the left. His cross is intercepted and cleared by Nacho, who is in for Raphael Varane, who is feeling poorly. 14 min: Vinicius scorches down the left wing at a ferocious lick, cuts inside and unleashes a shot. Good save from Andre Onana, who puts the ball over the bar for a corner. Toni Kroos sends the ball into the penalty area and finds Gareth Bale, but his header is weak and straight at the goalkeeper. 10 min: Hakim Ziyech goes down in the penalty area under a challenge from Nacho \u2013 or possibly Casemiro \u2013 and appeals for a penalty, but none is forthcoming. The intensity with which Ajax are playing, smothering Real inside their own half with a relentlessly heavy press, is very impressive. One obvious question, though: for how long will will they be able to keep it up? 8 min: Rampaging Ajax right-back Noussair Mazraoui combines well with Tadic down the insight right, playing a give-and-go after making a lung-busting run. In behind the Real defence, Mazraoui stumbles as he shapes to shoot and pulls his low diagonal effort well wide of the far post. 6 min: A good interception by Casemiro on the edge of his own penalty area puts an end to a promising Ajax attack and the midfielder releases Vinicius Junior on the counter. The young Brazilian hares up the field with the ball at his feet and passes wide to Gareth Bale on the right. His long range effort is saved easily by Andre Onana. We\u2019ve had a good, entertaining start. 5 min: A good start from Ajax, who are employing a very high press against Real Madrid. Dani Carvajal clearly doesn\u2019t like it up him and has a moan at the referee after Neres gets a bit too rough when trying to hustle and harry him off the ball. 4 min: Lasse Schone plays the ball over the top for Donny van der Beek to chase, but he puts too much welly on his pass and Thibaut Courtois is quick off his line to gather. 3 min: Tadic tries to play David Neres in behind with a back-heel, but his cunning plan is anticipated by Gareth Bale, who is back defending. 1 min: The Ajax fans are in full voice as play begins. Their team is playing without a recognised centre-forward tonight, with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Kasper Dolberg both on the bench. With 22 goals to his name already this season, former Southampton midfielder Dusan Tadic is playing through the middle for them. 1 min: Real Madrid lose the toss and kick-off, their players wearing black shirts, black shorts and black socks. The players of Ajax wear white shirts with a thick red stripe down the middle, white shorts and white socks. After a tribute to the late Emiliano Sala, play begins. Not long now: Dutch violinist Andr\u00e9 Rieu finishes entertaining the crowd, takes his bow and makes way for the players of Ajax and Real Madrid. They\u2019re not quite ready and following a long conversation about something or other with referee Damir Skomina, Matthijs de Ligt turns back to his team-mates. From the visitors\u2019 dressing room, the players of Real Madrid emerge wearing red hoodies over their shirts. Out on to the pitch they go ... kick-off is just moments away. VAR: a quick reminder: In the event of clear and obvious errors, Video Assistant Referees will be available to help the referee make decisions regarding goals, incidents in the penalty area, red cards and instances of mistaken identity. So, Gareth Bale starts for Real. As does Vinicius Junior. Meanwhile in the Ajax ranks, 19-year-old Matthijs de Ligt will become the youngest player ever to skipper a team a team in the Champions League knockout stages. Bully for him. Ajax: Onana, Mazraoui, de Ligt, Blind, Tagliafico, De Jong, Schone, van de Beek, Ziyech, Tadic, David Neres. Subs: Lamprou, Kristensen, Veltman, Sinkgraven, Huntelaar, Dolberg, de Wit. Real Madrid: Courtois, Carvajal, Nacho, Sergio Ramos, Reguilon, Kroos, Casemiro, Modric, Bale, Benzema, Vinicius Junior. Subs: Navas, Vallejo, Mariano, Marcelo, Lucas, Asensio, Ceballos. Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia) Erik ten Hag speaks \u201cFrenkie [de Jong] is fit; he is looking forward to the game, just like we all are,\u201d said the Ajax manager, of the young star who will move to Barcelona in the summer and will endear himself to supporters of his next club with a good performance against Real. \u201cTop teams can play very offensively, but also shut up tight and then break at pace,\u201d said ten Hag of tonight\u2019s opponents. \u201cReal Madrid have a very experienced team, with guys like [Sergio] Ramos, [Toni] Kroos, [Luka] Modri\u0107 and [Karim] Benzema, but also a good mix. It is going to be a great challenge for us to achieve something positive. We know we can be strong on this stage, and certainly in Amsterdam.\u201d Santiago Solari speaks Talking ahead of tonight\u2019s game, the Real Madrid manager wasn\u2019t slow in bigging up their opponents. \u201cThey\u2019re having a good season,\u201d he said. \u201cThey link up well and are very dynamic, with good players. You have to respect every opponent. I hope we produce a performance as serious as we did three days ago.\u201d While Ajax have been enjoying a good season, their form has dipped of late. Second behind PSV Eindhoven in the Eredivisie, they lost to Heracles over the weekend and recently found themselves on the wrong of a 6-2 drubbing at the hands of Feyenoord. Early team news Neither side have any suspensions, but Ajax are without striker Hassane Bande, who is injured. There are have been questions over the fitness of Frenkie de Jong, although his manager, Erik ten Hag, insists the youngster is fine. For Madrid, Jesus Vallejo and Luca Zidane are sidelined with hamstring issues, while Marcos Llorente and Isco are also out. Vinicius Junior is expected to start ahead of Gareth Bale, whil Sergio Reguillon may be preferred at left-back ahead of Marcelo. The Johan Cruijff ArenA is the venue as Ajax host Real Madrid for the first leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie. Unbeaten in 12 Champions League matches \u2013 three rounds of qualifying and six group games \u2013 so far this season, Ajax finished runners-up in Group E behind Bayern Munich. Despite losing twice in the group stages, Real Madrid advanced as winners of Group G. Kick-off tonight is at 8pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

He was doing keepie-ups, still wanting to entertain the crowd after another of those occasions when it can be difficult to remember Spurs did not sign anyone in the last transfer window, or the one before that, are not even playing in what they can genuinely call a home stadium and have Harry Kane and Dele Alli among their absentees.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/14/mauricio-pochettino-son-heung-min-spurs-champions-league-last-16-dortmund\">Mauricio Pochettino salutes Son and Spurs \u2018heroes\u2019 after Dortmund win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Once again Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s players showed their qualities of togetherness, resilience and, at times, great skill. They keep doing it, rising to the challenge, absolutely determined to show they can outdo teams with bigger reputations in the Champions League and more experience of European football at its highest level. Son was their first scorer and his hard running and intelligent forward play set the tone.

      "bodyText": "At the end of a hugely satisfying night for Tottenham Son Heung-min walked off the pitch with his shirt untucked, the ball at his feet and a look of boyish joy on his face. He was doing keepie-ups, still wanting to entertain the crowd after another of those occasions when it can be difficult to remember Spurs did not sign anyone in the last transfer window, or the one before that, are not even playing in what they can genuinely call a home stadium and have Harry Kane and Dele Alli among their absentees. Once again Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s players showed their qualities of togetherness, resilience and, at times, great skill. They keep doing it, rising to the challenge, absolutely determined to show they can outdo teams with bigger reputations in the Champions League and more experience of European football at its highest level. Son was their first scorer and his hard running and intelligent forward play set the tone. Jan Vertonghen, a revelation in his left wing-back role, was next and, finally, it was the substitute Fernando Llorente heading in a corner to put Spurs in a position of command. The last two goals came in the 83rd and 86th minutes, turning a narrow lead into a resounding one, and a side who had barely scraped through the group stage are now one solid display away from reaching the quarter-finals. Spurs had dominated against the team who, to recap, are holding off Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga champions in each of the last six years, at the top of the German league. Pochettino talked about it being one of the great occasions from the last two seasons as tenants at Wembley and, from here, it would need a spectacular collapse if his team are unable to finish the job at the Signal Iduna Park on 5 March.

      "body": "<p>About halfway through Skint Britain: Friends Without Benefits (Channel 4), the first of a three-part documentary series tracking the impact of replacing multiple separate welfare payments with the consolidated one known as universal credit (UC), you could honestly feel you were going mad.</p> <p>First, there was the basic fact that in a system that already leaves people living hand-to-mouth or, if they are lucky, paycheck to paycheck (because various modern forms of employment, fact fans, do not do anything so retro as keep you out of poverty! Let\u2019s hear it for progress!), the switch to UC leaves them without a payment for the first five weeks. If you are in a position to manage without income for five weeks, lucky you. And if you can\u2019t imagine being in quite the opposite position \u2013 if you can\u2019t imagine not even being within hailing distance of that position or knowing a single other person who is \u2013 shame on you, and would you like to take up a prominent position of your choosing in the cabinet whenever you fancy? They are looking for just your sort. There is footage, amid the shots of Nathan going hunting with his dog in the fields around Hartlepool to supplement the starvation rations he and his girlfriend are on while they await their money, of Theresa May bruiting across the Commons that the Tory party is the party that understands the working class. </p> <p>Second, there is the sight of a man going hunting for rabbits and squirrels in England in 2019, to supplement his aforementioned starvation rations. I must say, typing it isn\u2019t making me feel any less discombobulated.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the sight of people trying to log the mandatory 35 hours of job-searching to qualify for their credit, in a place where two hours would be enough for a fingertip \u2013 fruitless \u2013 search of every nook and cranny of employment possibility. \u201cThere used to be the chicken factory,\u201d remembers one middle-aged woman. \u201cThere used to be the cake factory.\u201d Not any more.</p> <p>There\u2019s the recommendation by the jobcentre that Nathan become an IT technician. \u201cBut I can\u2019t read or write!\u201d he points out, not unreasonably.</p> <p>On and on it goes, the madness.

      "bodyText": "About halfway through Skint Britain: Friends Without Benefits (Channel 4), the first of a three-part documentary series tracking the impact of replacing multiple separate welfare payments with the consolidated one known as universal credit (UC), you could honestly feel you were going mad. First, there was the basic fact that in a system that already leaves people living hand-to-mouth or, if they are lucky, paycheck to paycheck (because various modern forms of employment, fact fans, do not do anything so retro as keep you out of poverty! Let\u2019s hear it for progress!), the switch to UC leaves them without a payment for the first five weeks. If you are in a position to manage without income for five weeks, lucky you. And if you can\u2019t imagine being in quite the opposite position \u2013 if you can\u2019t imagine not even being within hailing distance of that position or knowing a single other person who is \u2013 shame on you, and would you like to take up a prominent position of your choosing in the cabinet whenever you fancy? They are looking for just your sort. There is footage, amid the shots of Nathan going hunting with his dog in the fields around Hartlepool to supplement the starvation rations he and his girlfriend are on while they await their money, of Theresa May bruiting across the Commons that the Tory party is the party that understands the working class. Second, there is the sight of a man going hunting for rabbits and squirrels in England in 2019, to supplement his aforementioned starvation rations. I must say, typing it isn\u2019t making me feel any less discombobulated. Then there\u2019s the sight of people trying to log the mandatory 35 hours of job-searching to qualify for their credit, in a place where two hours would be enough for a fingertip \u2013 fruitless \u2013 search of every nook and cranny of employment possibility. \u201cThere used to be the chicken factory,\u201d remembers one middle-aged woman. \u201cThere used to be the cake factory.\u201d Not any more. There\u2019s the recommendation by the jobcentre that Nathan become an IT technician. \u201cBut I can\u2019t read or write!\u201d he points out, not unreasonably. On and on it goes, the madness. And it is maddening. Tested beyond endurance, the documentary\u2019s subjects frequently scream down the phone at the person delivering the latest twist in the tale of no benefits. Did you, like Terri, miss your phone interview with a job coach because the lines were busy? Sanctioned. Even more delay, even less money.

With tension mounting among anti-Brexit Labour MPs and grassroots members, several junior shadow ministers have told the Guardian they are prepared to resign their posts if Corbyn doesn\u2019t whip his MPs to vote for a pro-referendum amendment at the end of the month. Corbyn has been struggling to balance the conflicting forces in his party over Brexit, as the clock ticks down towards exit day on 29 March.. Many party members and MPs would like him to take a lead in seeking to block Brexit before time runs out \u2013 but some frontbenchers are equally adamant they could never support a referendum. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Corbyn, risked stoking the conflict in the party on Wednesday when he argued that stopping Brexit was \u201cnot the best option for our nation\u201d. \u201cMy view is that, having had a 2016 referendum where the people have voted to come out of the EU, to try and deflect away from that threatens the whole democratic fabric on which we operate,\u201d he told Peston on ITV. \u201cI\u2019m saying that in reality it is not the best option for our nation.\u201d The party\u2019s conference policy, thrashed out in a late-night meeting chaired by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, suggests that if it has failed to secure a general election \u201cLabour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d. And it includes the line: \u201cIf the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.\u201d Since the prime minister\u2019s deal was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament last month, Labour has continued to engage with the government after Corbyn initially declined a meeting with May. The pair exchanged letters last week setting out their respective Brexit positions, and senior Labour figures met ministers on Tuesday. Starmer and the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, were accompanied by Corbyn\u2019s close advisers Seumas Milne and Andrew Fisher as they met the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington. A Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cKeir Starmer and Jon Trickett had a frank and serious exchange with Stephen Barclay and David Lidington following Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s five-demands letter to Theresa May. \u201cStarmer and Trickett set out Labour\u2019s five demands and pushed the government to change its red lines.\u201d Senior Labour sources said they believed the meeting had gone well, and expect a follow-up session to be held next week.

There could also be a straightforward \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d amendment when May brings an amendable vote to MPs on 27 February. Several frontbenchers, including the shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, and the shadow business minister, Chi Onwurah, will speak at a Love Socialism, Hate Brexit rally at parliament before the vote on Thursday. The rally is being promoted by the pro-referendum group Another Europe is Possible. Lewis previously quit as shadow defence secretary in order to rebel against the triggering of article 50, but has since returned to the Labour frontbench. He said last week: \u201cI\u2019m on the frontbench because I live in hope that the party will get to the bit of our conference policy where it supports a people\u2019s vote.\u201d Even some shadow frontbenchers opposed to a second referendum are coming to the view that the party needs a \u201ccathartic moment\u201d to whip for a new referendum and prove that the plan has no parliamentary majority, with more than 20 Labour MPs likely to oppose. One sceptical shadow minister said the February deadline would be the time for \u201cpeak agitation\u201d. Tensions over the party\u2019s Brexit policy have been simmering since Corbyn made his offer of a Brexit compromise in a letter to May last week, prompting former leadership candidate Owen Smith to suggest he could quit the party if Labour eventually backed a Brexit deal. Anger spilled into the open on Wednesday. The MP Neil Coyle claimed the party was losing members and councillors, and could yet lose MPs over its Brexit policy. One Labour MP, Geraint Davies, tabled an amendment attempting to bring forward the crunch point for the Labour leadership by calling for a referendum on May\u2019s deal but it was not directly connected with that of Kyle and Wilson. \u201cIt\u2019s very premature,\u201d one MP said.

      "bodyText": "Catering staff earning as little as \u00a37.83 an hour danced and sang outside their work at the business department as they staged a 26-hour strike in protest at what they described as poverty pay. Many of the outsourced catering team at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) earn no more than the minimum wage, well below the \u00a310.55 that the Living Wage Foundation calculates is necessary for an adequate life in the capital. They were joined by cleaners, porters, receptionists and security guards at the department who are fighting for enough money to survive without hardship. Ana Joaquim, from Wood Green, who is originally from Portugal, earns \u00a38.50 an hour as a barista at BEIS, which outsources its catering to a company called Aramark. \u201cWe are living in poverty in this company,\u201d she said. \u201cThey pay the minimal national wage; we are not entitled to 28 days\u2019 holiday.\u201d Her colleague Novlette Hurd, from Wandsworth, who is originally from Jamaica, earns even less \u2013 \u00a38.19 per hour \u2013 despite 21 years\u2019 service at the department. \u201cWe can\u2019t live because, for starters, I\u2019ve got dependent children and it\u2019s just not going anywhere,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to shop for my son since Christmas and I have to save for months just to take him shopping. \u201cThe \u00a38.19 I\u2019m getting, I\u2019m only getting it because before they asked me to supervise, so there\u2019s 50p extra \u2013 it was \u00a37.79. Like, you think, why do I bother to work? It just makes you desperate some days. You just get up and you think: does it make sense to go to work?\u201d The strike, which began on Wednesday and continues until Thursday at 7pm, comes after joint strike action on 22 January, when support staff in the United Voices of the World union at the Ministry of Justice joined the BEIS workers for a one-day strike and demonstration in Westminster. The business secretary, Greg Clark, who is responsible for workers\u2019 rights nationally, has been leading talks with trade unions and Labour MPs to try to win support for the government\u2019s Brexit deal. However, the public-sector union PCS, which represents the support staff, said his department has repeatedly refused to negotiate with them on an increase in pay to the London living wage and a return to the terms and conditions support staff enjoyed before they were outsourced. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of PCS, said: \u201cOur members are determined to do whatever it takes industrially, to get decent pay and conditions at work. The private contractors Aramark and Engie should be ashamed of themselves for not paying staff the London living wage. \u201cBEIS who awarded the contracts to these companies also share the responsibility for resolving this dispute. Ministers need to step in and ensure that outsourced workers are paid the same as other BEIS colleagues and ultimately bring the jobs back in-house.\u201d A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cAll our staff are valued members of the BEIS team and all deserve a fair and competitive wage, whether directly employed or working for our contractors. \u201cFollowing a review of contractor pay, the department has agreed with its contractors that they will align the pay of their cleaning, catering, mailroom and security staff with pay rates for workers in comparable roles.\u201d",

During its mission, the rover found tiny iron-rich spheres nicknamed \u201cblueberries\u201d at the crater that suggested a wet past, while its analyses of clay minerals near the Endeavour crater confirmed parts of Mars were once covered in neutral water, and could have been a habitable environment. It also came across the first meteorite ever to be discovered on another planet. In addition, the rover has sent back stunning images, including capturing a Martian \u201cdust devil\u201d twisting across the planet\u2019s surface and panoramic shots that provided breathtaking views of Martian craters. Another aspect of Opportunity\u2019s legacy is the number of people who were inspired to pursue careers in science through following the rover\u2019s trek, Fraeman said. \u201cThere really are hundreds if not thousands of students who, just like me, witnessed these rovers and followed along their mission, from the images released to the public over the last 15 years and then because of that went on to pursue careers in science.\u201d \u201cIt has been a fantastically successful mission which has completely outlived its shelf life,\u201d said Professor Andrew Coates, a planetary scientist at University College London\u2019s Mullard Space Science Laboratory. \u201cOne of those core things about Opportunity was it landed in this crater which was in sight of sedimentary types of rocks and that was the first time that sort of thing had been seen on Mars,\u201d said Coates. \u201cPeople compared it at the time to an interplanetary hole in one.\u201d Professor John Bridges from the University of Leicester, who is part of the team working on Nasa\u2019s continuing Curiosity rover project and the European Space Agency\u2019s ExoMars mission, said Opportunity had a fantastic roll call of achievements. He added that with its twin the rover had been key in changing the idea of Mars from being a lump of basalt in space to having a very different geological history, showing the importance of lakes and other features. \u201cIt really sort of [turned] upside down our view of Mars and how it has evolved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was showing us what the Mars crust is made of.\u201d Coates, who is also lead scientist for the panoramic camera instrument on the ExoMars rover \u2013 recently named Rosalind Franklin \u2013 which is set to be launched in 2020, said the discoveries of Opportunity, and later the Curiosity rover, have been important for the development of new missions. \u201cThe next step now of course is to drill and look for signs of life, and that is exactly what we are doing with the ExoMars rover, drilling up to 2 metres underneath the surface,\u201d he said. The final attempt at communication with Opportunity on Tuesday night was, it seems, an emotional affair. Dr Tanya Harrison, a planetary scientist who worked on the mission, tweeted: \u201cThere were tears. There were hugs. There were memories and laughs shared.\u201d Mike Seibert, who was also part of the team, paid tribute to the rover nicknamed \u201cOppy\u201d, saying \u201cGoodbye old friend\u201d and noting that the rover was the longest lasting surface mission yet. Coates said Opportunity\u2019s demise was bittersweet. \u201cIt is a matter of both celebration for what it was able to achieve and in the broad context of Mars exploration, but also tinged with sadness, losing an old friend.\u201d",

The same is true of cocaine particularly.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Ofsted said: \u201cWe support the right of headteachers to exclude where it is in the interests of pupils in the school, however our proposed new education inspection framework also emphasises the importance of creating an inclusive school culture.<br><br>As part of the new framework we plan to check the work of schools in supporting pupils who are excluded for a fixed period of time. We also propose that inspectors will evaluate the way pupil referral unit leaders help keep their pupils safe, since they are particularly vulnerable to be exploited by county line gangs.\u201d<br></p>",

A school found to be using suspensions or fixed-term exclusions \u201cinappropriately\u201d would only then be able to achieve a \u201crequires improvement\u201d grade at most. \u201cOfsted are starting to address issues better and recognising a broad range of issues that vulnerabilities can lead to,\u201d Jones said. The report also suggested there was a need for longer-term funding for charities working in this area. It also said that the Modern Slavery Act and national referral mechanism should continue to be reviewed to see how this legislation and process could better help children in need of support. Jones said that while education and keeping children supported in schools was important, the biggest driver of the county lines drugs phenomenon was demand. \u201cPeople want drugs. If you decriminalised class As [drugs] you would reduce demand and if you did that you would reduce the ability of these groups to earn money, that is what is driving it \u2026 the drug markets in London were saturated and people became aware of those who want drugs outside of London,\u201d Jones said. He added: \u201cIt is hard to believe these drug gangs are simply feeding hardcore problem drug users, they must also be tapping into the recreational market which is bigger than people think. There are some that use crack at weekends, and it is not just the image of drug-depraved junkies in an alley but it could be someone who goes to work on a Monday. The same is true of cocaine particularly.\u201d A spokesman for Ofsted said: \u201cWe support the right of headteachers to exclude where it is in the interests of pupils in the school, however our proposed new education inspection framework also emphasises the importance of creating an inclusive school culture. As part of the new framework we plan to check the work of schools in supporting pupils who are excluded for a fixed period of time. We also propose that inspectors will evaluate the way pupil referral unit leaders help keep their pupils safe, since they are particularly vulnerable to be exploited by county line gangs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 14 February. Top stories The former One Nation senator Brian Burston has accused Pauline Hanson of making unwanted sexual advances dating back decades. The One Nation leader used a speech in the Senate on Tuesday night to accuse an unnamed senator of \u201cserious sexual harassment\u201d, with Burston confirming on Wednesday that he was the politician involved. But he told News Corp oHanson had \u201chit on me\u201d at the first party AGM in 1998, and had propositioned him after he was elected in 2016. Hanson dismissed the allegations. Guardian Australia has seen a complaint of sexual harassment made against Burston late last year, as part of a settled unfair dismissal claim. It alleges he made an inappropriate advance on a distressed staff member. Scott Morrison is expected to update parliament on Closing the Gap targets today, with progress made in key areas including life expectancy, employment and child mortality. But a coalition of peak Indigenous organisations are preparing to pressure state and federal governments for a greater share of funding after the release of the 2019 report card, which found only two of the seven targets were on track. The group is hoping to sign an agreement with the Council of Australian Governments by the end of this month outlining a tripartite agreement to update the targets, four of which have expired. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists have found that water flows at key environmental sites in the Murray-Darling basin are unimproved or worse than before the basin plan was implemented. The scientific report, released on Wednesday, looked at two key sites identified when the plan was put in place in 2010. They have found that environmental flows are not meeting the government\u2019s own objectives for improving the health of the river at these sites. At one site flows have actually declined, compared with pre-plan days. World A former US air force intelligence officer who defected to Iran in 2013 has been charged with espionage, giving away the identity of a US agent and other secrets. Monica Witt worked as a cryptologist and a counter-intelligence investigator for more than 10 years. \u201cIt is a sad day for America when one of its citizens betrays our country,\u201d said the assistant attorney general for national security, John Demers. Scientists believe they have identified about 60,000 cases of depression in adults under 35 in the UK, and more than 400,000 in the US, that could be avoided if adolescents did not smoke cannabis. The results linked cannabis use to a greater likelihood of later developing clinical depression, having suicidal thoughts or making a suicide attempt if smoked in the vulnerable teenage years when the brain is undergoing rapid change and growth. Two suspected former secret service officers from the Syrian government have been arrested in Germany on allegations of carrying out or aiding torture and crimes against humanity. The arrests follow years of investigation assisted by the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights. Hardline Brexit supporters are threatening to inflict yet another Commons defeat on Theresa May, because they fear the government is effectively ruling out leaving the EU with no deal. Members of the Tory European Research Group are unhappy with the wording of a No 10 motion because it endorses parliament\u2019s vote against any Brexit without a withdrawal agreement. Buying organic food is among the actions people can take to curb the global decline in insects, according to leading scientists. Urging political action to slash pesticide use on conventional farms is another, say environmentalists. Opinion and analysis After losing the vote on the refugee medical evacuation bill on Tuesday, Scott Morrison has \u201cchosen to push off the loss by launching a sonic boom on border protection\u201d, writes Katharine Murphy. In doing so, she says, he has declined the chance to send a clear message to people smugglers about the facts of the medical evacuations bill and to rebuke clearly misleading statements from members of his team, including Tony Abbott. \u201cBy this point, it was clear we were so far down the truthy tunnel that we would all require a map, a floodlight and some grappling hooks to find our way back.\u201d Trump\u2019s Iran summit shows just how far he is from the rest of the western allies, and Britain, France and Germany clearly don\u2019t like his tub-thumping. But that may not be enough to stop him, writes Simon Tisdall. \u201cDoes Mike Pompeo realise what a foolish figure he cuts as he shambles around Europe, spouting risible tosh about Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to a \u201cnew liberal order\u201d and America as \u201cforce for good\u201d in the Middle East? It seems he does not.\u201d Sport The West Indies bowler Shannon Gabriel has been banned for four ODIs after allegedly making a homophobic slur to Joe Root. Gabriel has been sanctioned for his part in an on-field exchange with Root on day three of the third Test in St Lucia, which ended with the England captain telling the 30-year-old: \u201cDon\u2019t use it as an insult. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay.\u201d Lewis Hamilton has delivered an ominous warning to his Formula One rivals by vowing to improve on his 2018 championship-winning campaign. As he enters the first campaign of the new two-year Mercedes deal which will earn him \u00a340m a season, he says he is ready to continue his dominance of the sport. Thinking time: Hakeem al-Araibi: power, politics, football and the will of the people The plight of Hakeem al-Araibi, a 25-year-old Bahraini dissident, football player, refugee and Australian resident, who was detained in a Thai jail cell for 77 days as Bahrain petitioned for his extradition, was slow to gather widespread attention.

The Adelaide Advertiser reports that more than half of year 1 students are failing to meet the state\u2019s first basic language test, with close to 600 not able to read a single word correctly. The ABC takes a look at the vast distances flowers have travelled to florists in Australia, which local growers say represents unfair competition and a constant biosecurity threat. The majority of flowers for sale this Valentine\u2019s Day will have been imported from as far afield as Kenya, Ecuador and Singapore. Coming up A senate inquiry report into the government\u2019s $5bn jobactive program is expected to be tabled in parliament highlighting flaws with the program aimed at getting Australians back into work. Hakeem al-Araibi, the Bahraini refugee footballer detained in Thailand will be in Canberra today to meet the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and foreign minister, Marise Payne. He will also play in a specially arranged game of football. Supporting the Guardian Thank you to all our generous supporters who enable us to keep reporting on the critical stories.

      "body": "<p>Sinn F\u00e9in has urged Theresa May and Ireland\u2019s taoiseach Leo Varadkar to plan for a referendum on a united Ireland in event the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal.</p> <p>Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, which has seven seats in Westminster, made the same call in an hour-long meeting on Wednesday with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as part of a campaign to lay the grounds for a border poll to decide the future of the island.</p> <p>\u201cIn the event there is a no-deal Brexit then the Irish question looms very large, because if that happens there will be an absolute imperative, a democratic imperative, to put the issue of Irish unity to the people by way of referendum,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be an irresistible democratic necessity and so we have said to Jeremy today, just as we have said to Mrs May, and to an taoiseach and others, that there is a need now to begin planning, diplomatically politically, so that every contingency is considered including in the event of crash to trigger, as per the Good Friday agreement, a referendum.\u201d</p> <p>She said Sinn F\u00e9in would be keen to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 referendum, by establishing a consultative process to tackle some of the central questions first.</p> <p>She declined to say when a referendum could be held: \u201cWe\u2019re not prescriptive about this; but this is not like calling an election, and saying, polling day is in six weeks\u2019 time. You\u2019re not doing it that way. That\u2019s not real.\u201d</p> <p>But when asked whether it would be within an electoral cycle, she said: \u201cCertainly: it would be within parameters such as those.

That\u2019s a deplorable way \u2013 in our view a very reckless way \u2013 for a British prime minister to conduct her business,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>She said she told May in a meeting in Belfast last week that her U-turn on the backstop and decision to seek \u201calternative arrangements\u201d was an \u201cact of bad faith\u201d, particularly as she had been \u201cextolling the virtues of the backstop\u201d when they met in December.</p> <p>\u201cThere may have been a time when the prime minister might have been given a fool\u2019s pardon in terms of knowledge deficit of what Ireland needed what was required to safeguard the Good Friday agreement in all of its parts, but that ship has long sailed,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not an act of ignorance, this is, as far as we are concerned is an act of belligerence, and I know it\u2019s strong language, but I think her action merits that language.\u201d</p> <p>The Good Friday agreement provides for a border poll if at any time it appears to the secretary of state that \u201ca majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the UK and form part of a united Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald has already suggested to Varadkar that a forum be convened to scope out all the issues, including the costs of a united Ireland; the impact on economies on both sides of the border; the health services, pensions, taxation and currency.</p> <p>Unionists would be an important part of the forum.</p> <p>\u201cWe know unionism will argue for the union, and they\u2019re entitled to do that, and that\u2019s their plan A,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>\u201cBut at this stage, unionism needs to have a plan B, and we think that the unionist voice can be a very energising and a very challenging voice in that process \u2013 and that\u2019s necessary,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said no-deal Brexit was not the only reason to consider a referendum but it was \u201can accelerant\u201d.</p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in supports May\u2019s deal because it guarantees the backstop, to which the DUP are so implacably opposed.</p> <p>The Irish government is not supporting McDonald\u2019s calls for a border poll.</p> <p>Her remarks come as the former Irish prime minister who sealed the Good Friday agreement with Tony Blair told MPs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/northern-ireland-belfast-finchley-not-same-bertie-ahern-brexit-committee\">Northern Ireland was constitutionally different to Scotland and Wales</a>, and that was not understood by Brexiters.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does frustrate me and others is there is a view that Northern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> so still intrinsically linked to the UK in a way that ignores the Good Friday agreement and that\u2019s the bit that really upsets us, because it is not,\u201d Bertie Ahern said. </p>",

Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, which has seven seats in Westminster, made the same call in an hour-long meeting on Wednesday with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as part of a campaign to lay the grounds for a border poll to decide the future of the island. \u201cIn the event there is a no-deal Brexit then the Irish question looms very large, because if that happens there will be an absolute imperative, a democratic imperative, to put the issue of Irish unity to the people by way of referendum,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cIt would be an irresistible democratic necessity and so we have said to Jeremy today, just as we have said to Mrs May, and to an taoiseach and others, that there is a need now to begin planning, diplomatically politically, so that every contingency is considered including in the event of crash to trigger, as per the Good Friday agreement, a referendum.\u201d She said Sinn F\u00e9in would be keen to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 referendum, by establishing a consultative process to tackle some of the central questions first. She declined to say when a referendum could be held: \u201cWe\u2019re not prescriptive about this; but this is not like calling an election, and saying, polling day is in six weeks\u2019 time. You\u2019re not doing it that way. That\u2019s not real.\u201d But when asked whether it would be within an electoral cycle, she said: \u201cCertainly: it would be within parameters such as those. It\u2019s within what is a workable, and what is an agreed timeframe.\u201d McDonald underlined her party\u2019s exasperation at the prime minister\u2019s decision to reopen the issue of the Irish backstop, which Sinn F\u00e9in supports, in a bid to win a majority for her deal in the House of Commons. She said when May visited Belfast last week, she explained her decision to seek changes to the backstop \u2013 but not what changes she wanted. \u201cThis is crazy: this is six weeks out, and you might as well be looking into a hole as to try and ascertain what it is that Mrs May is proposing. That\u2019s a deplorable way \u2013 in our view a very reckless way \u2013 for a British prime minister to conduct her business,\u201d McDonald said. She said she told May in a meeting in Belfast last week that her U-turn on the backstop and decision to seek \u201calternative arrangements\u201d was an \u201cact of bad faith\u201d, particularly as she had been \u201cextolling the virtues of the backstop\u201d when they met in December. \u201cThere may have been a time when the prime minister might have been given a fool\u2019s pardon in terms of knowledge deficit of what Ireland needed what was required to safeguard the Good Friday agreement in all of its parts, but that ship has long sailed,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThis is not an act of ignorance, this is, as far as we are concerned is an act of belligerence, and I know it\u2019s strong language, but I think her action merits that language.\u201d The Good Friday agreement provides for a border poll if at any time it appears to the secretary of state that \u201ca majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the UK and form part of a united Ireland.\u201d McDonald has already suggested to Varadkar that a forum be convened to scope out all the issues, including the costs of a united Ireland; the impact on economies on both sides of the border; the health services, pensions, taxation and currency. Unionists would be an important part of the forum. \u201cWe know unionism will argue for the union, and they\u2019re entitled to do that, and that\u2019s their plan A,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cBut at this stage, unionism needs to have a plan B, and we think that the unionist voice can be a very energising and a very challenging voice in that process \u2013 and that\u2019s necessary,\u201d she said. She said no-deal Brexit was not the only reason to consider a referendum but it was \u201can accelerant\u201d. Sinn F\u00e9in supports May\u2019s deal because it guarantees the backstop, to which the DUP are so implacably opposed. The Irish government is not supporting McDonald\u2019s calls for a border poll. Her remarks come as the former Irish prime minister who sealed the Good Friday agreement with Tony Blair told MPs that Northern Ireland was constitutionally different to Scotland and Wales, and that was not understood by Brexiters. \u201cWhat does frustrate me and others is there is a view that Northern Ireland so still intrinsically linked to the UK in a way that ignores the Good Friday agreement and that\u2019s the bit that really upsets us, because it is not,\u201d Bertie Ahern said.",

      "bodyText": "A suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying personnel affiliated to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards on Wednesday, killing 27 people and wounding 20 others. A Sunni extremist group linked to al-Qaida and which operates in Pakistan reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred in the south-east of Iran. The bombing happened on the day that a conference convened by the US in Warsaw was to include discussions on what Washington says is Iran\u2019s malign influence across the wider Middle East. It also came two days after Iran marked the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and four decades of tense relations with the west. The state-run IRNA news agency said the attack took place in Sistan and Baluchistan province, which has a large, mainly Sunni, ethnic Baluchi community which straddles the border with Pakistan. The Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that a vehicle loaded with explosives had targeted a bus carrying affiliated border guards. The Fars news agency said the attack was claimed by Jaish al-Adl, a jihadist group formed in 2012 as a successor to the Sunni extremist group Jundallah, which had waged a deadly insurgency against Iranian targets. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described the conference convened by the US as the Warsaw Circus, and said it was \u201cno coincidence that Iran is hit by terror on the very day\u201d that the talks began. Zarif tweeted: \u201cEspecially when cohorts of same terrorists cheer it from Warsaw streets &amp; support it with twitter bots?

Three members of a bomb squad sent to the scene of an explosion in its capital, Zahedan, were wounded on 29 January when a second device blew up as they were trying to defuse it, police said at the time. Two people were killed and about 40 wounded in the port city of Chabahar early December in an attack Zarif blamed at the time on \u201cforeign-backed terrorists\u201d, a reference to Sunni Muslim extremists. Militants disguised as soldiers opened fire on a military parade in the oil-rich south-western city of Ahvaz in September, killing 24 people and wounding more than 60.

He thought he heard something homophobic and dealt with it. He was cool, calm, collected \u2013 and right.</p> <p>It should not be a big deal, nearly 20 years into the 21st century, that a leading sportsman calls out homophobia. Women\u2019s sports are way ahead on this front. In 2016, Kate Richardson-Walsh led England\u2019s hockey team to Olympic gold, three years after marrying one of her teammates, Helen. In 2017, cinemas showed a movie, Battle of the Sexes, that was partly about a gay love affair Billie Jean King had in the 1970s when she was the world No 1 in women\u2019s tennis.</p> <p>Forty years on, no professional male footballer in Britain has ever come out during his career. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/28/steven-davies-gay\" title=\"\">A cricketer has \u2013 Steve Davies,</a> the Somerset and former England wicketkeeper.

And the circumstances help too: he was not giving a press conference, he was not being paid to promote anything, he was just being natural. He is, by all accounts, a decent person and he showed it even in the heat of battle. Afterwards he was statesmanlike, insisting that what was said on the field should stay there. It was a bit late for that but Root was being magnanimous towards Gabriel. He could have been following Michelle Obama\u2019s advice: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d</p> <p>By speaking out, Root joins the select club of men in British sport who have stood up for social tolerance.

We have to stand strong as a game to make sure that does not happen.\u201d</p> <p>Southgate has also said there were \u201cracial undertones\u201d to the Brexit vote.

      "bodyText": "Cricketers call it sledging, or chirping: the business of trying to undermine your opponent with verbal abuse. It\u2019s a dismal habit that shows us sport at its most small-minded and should have been banned long ago. But this week it has done the world a favour. In the Test in St Lucia, the West Indies bowler Shannon Gabriel was bad-mouthing the England captain, Joe Root. What Gabriel said the stump microphone did not catch but it did bring us Root\u2019s reply: \u201cDon\u2019t use it as an insult. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay.\u201d Root was on his way to a much-needed century but his return to form was overshadowed by his remark. \u201cBoy do I applaud Joe Root\u2019s reaction here,\u201d said Nasser Hussain, once England captain himself, now Sky Cricket\u2019s most trenchant voice. \u201cFor me his 12 words as a role model will be in the end more important than a Test hundred or possible victory.\u201d St Lucia is one of nine Caribbean nations where homosexuality remains illegal (unlike Gabriel\u2019s homeland, Trinidad and Tobago) but the cultural backdrop makes no difference to Root\u2019s position. He thought he heard something homophobic and dealt with it. He was cool, calm, collected \u2013 and right. It should not be a big deal, nearly 20 years into the 21st century, that a leading sportsman calls out homophobia. Women\u2019s sports are way ahead on this front. In 2016, Kate Richardson-Walsh led England\u2019s hockey team to Olympic gold, three years after marrying one of her teammates, Helen. In 2017, cinemas showed a movie, Battle of the Sexes, that was partly about a gay love affair Billie Jean King had in the 1970s when she was the world No 1 in women\u2019s tennis. Forty years on, no professional male footballer in Britain has ever come out during his career. A cricketer has \u2013 Steve Davies, the Somerset and former England wicketkeeper. It was brave of him but, with only eight caps, none of them in Tests, he may not be quite well-known enough to have had a wide impact. Root, unmistakably, is well-known enough. And the circumstances help too: he was not giving a press conference, he was not being paid to promote anything, he was just being natural. He is, by all accounts, a decent person and he showed it even in the heat of battle. Afterwards he was statesmanlike, insisting that what was said on the field should stay there. It was a bit late for that but Root was being magnanimous towards Gabriel. He could have been following Michelle Obama\u2019s advice: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d By speaking out, Root joins the select club of men in British sport who have stood up for social tolerance. The unofficial chair is Andy Murray, who identifies as a feminist and proved it in 2014 by employing Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo as his coach. The club\u2019s vice-chair is the England football manager Gareth Southgate, who recently congratulated Raheem Sterling on his bravery in pointing out how differently he and a young white player had been treated by the tabloids. \u201cFootball is a mirror of society,\u201d Southgate argued, in his measured way. \u201cUnfortunately racism exists in society and so there are times when people seem to use the opportunity at a football ground to fuel that. We have to stand strong as a game to make sure that does not happen.\u201d Southgate has also said there were \u201cracial undertones\u201d to the Brexit vote. Well, obviously \u2013 but good for him being prepared to say it, and thus dismay people who manage to express racist views while supporting a multiracial team. Root\u2019s remark was not just good for the cause of tolerance. It was good for the game of cricket, which tends to be culturally conservative, verging on reactionary. Anxious that cricket holds little appeal for women and children, the England and Wales Cricket Board is bringing in a new format called The Hundred, played nowhere else in the world.

It is the system at fault, not individuals. There are other ownership models, of course: the Guardian isn\u2019t owned by a mogul, and its now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/nov/12/katharine-viner-guardian-million-reader-funding\" title=\"\">million-strong supporter scheme</a> is a source of revenue independent of advertisers. But the wider media system is broken.</p> <p>How can we overcome this crisis to build a dynamic media ecosystem that informs and educates, holds the powerful to account, challenges myths, and creates an active, informed citizenry? This week, the government-appointed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/11/public-funds-should-be-used-to-rescue-local-journalism-says-report\" title=\"\">Cairncross review</a> offered its suggestions, warning that a collapsing media threatened the \u201clong-term sustainability of democracy\u201d. It suggested that the drain of advertising to the likes of Facebook should be subject to a public investigation, while public interest news outlets should receive direct funding, and public interest journalism should benefit from tax reliefs. </p> <p>But these suggestions are not ambitious enough. One possible solution is public subsidy for the whole media industry, whether or not it is for profit. There is state support for the media in both Norway and Sweden, and that doesn\u2019t compromise the freedom of the press: they both top the Reporters Without Borders\u2019 <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/ranking\" title=\"\">World Press Freedom Index</a>. Yet that would rightly be widely opposed here. Why should failing for-profit news organisations be propped up by the state? And who would decide how the money is allocated?</p> <p>Here\u2019s another idea. The veteran US media reformer Robert McChesney has proposed that such a subsidy could be democratised. Every citizen would be given an allowance of $200 a year to donate to a single publication, or spread across multiple publications. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been further developed by British media activist Leo Watkins. The allowance could be funded by an annual tax on the advertising industry. To be eligible for funding, an outlet would need to be a not-for-profit cooperative \u2013 ensuring good terms and conditions for journalists \u2013 and would be forbidden from taking money from other sources, guaranteeing editorial independence. Media outlets would have to compete for support from citizens, incentivising them to listen to currently unrepresented voices.

      "bodyText": "A flourishing, diverse media is essential to a functioning democracy. We have neither. An already broken model faces an existential crisis. Back in 1948, the media mogul Lord Beaverbrook told a royal commission on the press that he ran the Daily Express \u201cpurely for the purpose of making propaganda and with no other object ... I look at it as a purely propagandist project.\u201d Today, most of the British press remains the plaything of media moguls who profit from a broken status quo. Ideas such as public ownership are popular with the public: a poll by one rightwing thinktank found that 83% back nationalisation of the water industry, as do more than three-quarters with regard to electricity, gas and the railways. The vast majority of people back higher taxes on the rich. Yet these are fringe ideas within most of the mainstream media, which marginalises those who support them. Then there\u2019s the daily whipping up of hatred and bigotry against benefit claimants, Muslims, refugees, migrants and trans people \u2013 helping to legitimise and fuel the prejudice and discrimination experienced by minorities. Both the Times \u2013 supposedly a reputable paper of record \u2013 and the Sun have been forced to correct false or misleading stories about Muslims: but by then the damage is done. Political reporting is too often trivialised, treated as a soap opera based in Westminster, rather than placed in a broader social or economic context. Financial dependence on collapsing advertising revenues inevitably ties newspapers to corporate interests: in one egregious example, the conservative commentator Peter Oborne resigned from the Telegraph after he claimed it refused to cover a scandal involving HSBC for fear of compromising its advertising revenue. The media is also desperately unrepresentative of those it exists to serve, partly because of the decline of local newspapers, which offered a way in for aspiring non-privileged journalists; and partly because of the prevalence of unpaid internships and expensive postgraduate journalism degrees, two routes into the profession which are financially prohibitive options for most. One government study suggested that, after doctors, journalists had the most privileged backgrounds across a broad range of professions. Minorities are drastically under-represented, and in one study in a randomly selected time frame in 2017, just a quarter of front page stories were written by women. Advertising has migrated to internet giants such as Facebook, plunging the old media into economic crisis. In Britain, 228 local newspapers closed between 2005 and 2018, while the number of regional journalists is believed to have halved. That\u2019s been accompanied by an explosion in the PR industry: from \u00a39.62bn in 2013 to \u00a314bn three years later. Too often, PR propaganda is written up as news, or what investigative journalist Nick Davies once called \u201cchurnalism\u201d. There are, of course, brilliant journalists in the media, including those courageously exposing injustices: take our own Amelia Gentleman and the Windrush scandal. It is the system at fault, not individuals. There are other ownership models, of course: the Guardian isn\u2019t owned by a mogul, and its now million-strong supporter scheme is a source of revenue independent of advertisers. But the wider media system is broken. How can we overcome this crisis to build a dynamic media ecosystem that informs and educates, holds the powerful to account, challenges myths, and creates an active, informed citizenry? This week, the government-appointed Cairncross review offered its suggestions, warning that a collapsing media threatened the \u201clong-term sustainability of democracy\u201d. It suggested that the drain of advertising to the likes of Facebook should be subject to a public investigation, while public interest news outlets should receive direct funding, and public interest journalism should benefit from tax reliefs. But these suggestions are not ambitious enough. One possible solution is public subsidy for the whole media industry, whether or not it is for profit. There is state support for the media in both Norway and Sweden, and that doesn\u2019t compromise the freedom of the press: they both top the Reporters Without Borders\u2019 World Press Freedom Index. Yet that would rightly be widely opposed here. Why should failing for-profit news organisations be propped up by the state? And who would decide how the money is allocated? Here\u2019s another idea. The veteran US media reformer Robert McChesney has proposed that such a subsidy could be democratised. Every citizen would be given an allowance of $200 a year to donate to a single publication, or spread across multiple publications. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been further developed by British media activist Leo Watkins. The allowance could be funded by an annual tax on the advertising industry. To be eligible for funding, an outlet would need to be a not-for-profit cooperative \u2013 ensuring good terms and conditions for journalists \u2013 and would be forbidden from taking money from other sources, guaranteeing editorial independence. Media outlets would have to compete for support from citizens, incentivising them to listen to currently unrepresented voices. Such outlets could range from general news organisations at national or local level, to outlets catering for minorities, to sports or leisure pursuits. A thriving, diverse, genuinely independent media universe could be constructed from the bottom-up. Sure, it\u2019s a radical idea. But with the media in a death spiral \u2013 and with Britain\u2019s print press the least trusted in Europe \u2013 a wide-ranging debate about where to go next is long overdue. Our democracy faces an existential crisis: but with imagination, it can be rebuilt. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Before that, at 3.03pm as people had begun to emerge from the central \u201cpens\u201d of the Leppings Lane terraces at Hillsborough, a call had been made for dog handlers, also a response to a perceived public disorder problem.</p> <p>At 3.07pm a request was made from the Hillsborough police control room for a fleet of ambulances to be sent to the ground, and information was given that there were \u201ca lot of casualties\u201d.</p> <p>Edmundson was asked by Myers if it would have been expected in those circumstances that an officer of Jackson\u2019s rank would get involved. \u201cYes,\u201d Edmundson replied. \u201cI would have expected the assistant chief constable to take immediate charge.\u201d</p> <p>Edmundson agreed with Myers that although Jackson was there in the police control room, he never spoke on the radio or gave an order, or took control of what was happening. He said an ACC was never off duty and it did not matter whether he was wearing his police uniform or not.</p> <p>\u201cWould it be expected that an assistant chief constable would step in if capable of doing so?\u201d Myers asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Edmundson replied.</p> <p>Richard Matthews QC, the lead prosecution barrister, re-examined Edmundson following Myers\u2019 questions and asked him if he had any \u201cparticular experience, expertise or knowledge\u201d of when somebody would take over from a match commander. </p> <p>Edmundson said he would expect the senior officer to take over when he understood the seriousness of an incident and if it was \u201cthe most serious event in a policeman\u2019s career\u201d.</p> <p>Edmundson acknowledged questioning from Matthews that he had never been a football match commander, and said was not giving that opinion from his experience of being in command himself.</p> <p>Earlier in the proceedings, Stephen Ellis, a former police officer, broke down as he recalled that his initial reaction after a large exit gate was opened to ease the crush outside the ground was relief.</p> <p>The jury has heard that the 24,000 people with tickets to support Liverpool had to get through 23 turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end, and the 10,100 people with tickets to stand were allocated just seven of those turnstiles.</p> <p>After a large crowd of people built up at those turnstiles, Ellis said, he climbed on top of a police Land Rover and began to shout through a megaphone, urging people to move back from the crush. </p> <p>Ellis told the court he had not been aware that the wide exit gate C had been opened to allow a large number of people through at once. The jury has heard expert evidence that 2,603 people entered during two openings of gate C. A tunnel leading to the terrace\u2019s central pens was not closed, many incoming people went down the tunnel and the lethal crush took place in the central pens 3 and 4.</p> <p>Asked about the thinning of the crowd that followed the gate opening, Ellis broke down in distress. He said: \u201cThis part upsets me, because I was so concerned about the safety of people in front of Leppings Lane \u2026 And then, [in] what seemed like seconds, I looked again and there was just about five metres of spectators in front of the turnstiles. And I felt a huge sense of relief. But where had they gone? God they went in there quick.\u201d</p> <p>Ellis was excused by the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, from giving further evidence. Instead, after a lunch break, Myers read extracts from statements Ellis made in 1989 and in 2015. The 1989 statement included observations that Liverpool supporters had been drinking before the match, were pushing and \u201cgripped by a mania\u201d to get into the match, that some dived over the turnstiles and that the police were powerless to control the numbers of people.</p> <p>Duckenfield is on trial alongside Graham Mackrell, the former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer, who is charged with two criminal breaches of safety legislation. Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p> <p>The trial continues. </p>",

Edmundson was asked by Myers if it would have been expected in those circumstances that an officer of Jackson\u2019s rank would get involved. \u201cYes,\u201d Edmundson replied. \u201cI would have expected the assistant chief constable to take immediate charge.\u201d Edmundson agreed with Myers that although Jackson was there in the police control room, he never spoke on the radio or gave an order, or took control of what was happening. He said an ACC was never off duty and it did not matter whether he was wearing his police uniform or not. \u201cWould it be expected that an assistant chief constable would step in if capable of doing so?\u201d Myers asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Edmundson replied. Richard Matthews QC, the lead prosecution barrister, re-examined Edmundson following Myers\u2019 questions and asked him if he had any \u201cparticular experience, expertise or knowledge\u201d of when somebody would take over from a match commander. Edmundson said he would expect the senior officer to take over when he understood the seriousness of an incident and if it was \u201cthe most serious event in a policeman\u2019s career\u201d. Edmundson acknowledged questioning from Matthews that he had never been a football match commander, and said was not giving that opinion from his experience of being in command himself. Earlier in the proceedings, Stephen Ellis, a former police officer, broke down as he recalled that his initial reaction after a large exit gate was opened to ease the crush outside the ground was relief. The jury has heard that the 24,000 people with tickets to support Liverpool had to get through 23 turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end, and the 10,100 people with tickets to stand were allocated just seven of those turnstiles. After a large crowd of people built up at those turnstiles, Ellis said, he climbed on top of a police Land Rover and began to shout through a megaphone, urging people to move back from the crush. Ellis told the court he had not been aware that the wide exit gate C had been opened to allow a large number of people through at once. The jury has heard expert evidence that 2,603 people entered during two openings of gate C. A tunnel leading to the terrace\u2019s central pens was not closed, many incoming people went down the tunnel and the lethal crush took place in the central pens 3 and 4. Asked about the thinning of the crowd that followed the gate opening, Ellis broke down in distress. He said: \u201cThis part upsets me, because I was so concerned about the safety of people in front of Leppings Lane \u2026 And then, [in] what seemed like seconds, I looked again and there was just about five metres of spectators in front of the turnstiles. And I felt a huge sense of relief. But where had they gone? God they went in there quick.\u201d Ellis was excused by the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, from giving further evidence. Instead, after a lunch break, Myers read extracts from statements Ellis made in 1989 and in 2015. The 1989 statement included observations that Liverpool supporters had been drinking before the match, were pushing and \u201cgripped by a mania\u201d to get into the match, that some dived over the turnstiles and that the police were powerless to control the numbers of people. Duckenfield is on trial alongside Graham Mackrell, the former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer, who is charged with two criminal breaches of safety legislation. Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial continues.",

English Football League rules state that if a club suffer \u201can insolvency event\u201d, which includes the appointment of a receiver, they receive a 12-point deduction, but the league has not yet determined whether that penalty will be imposed in this case. The receivership of the club, an associated company and other assets owned by Owen Oyston and his son, the former club chairman Karl, was ordered by the high court after it heard the money is still owed to Belokon. The millions are owed by the Oystons to Belokon following a court judgment in 2017 that the Oystons \u201cillegitimately stripped\u201d the club of \u00a326.77m in a salary and other payments to their own companies, following Blackpool\u2019s single 2010-11 season in the Premier League.

More than one in 10 Northern and Thameslink trains were cancelled after the introduction of the new timetables on 20 May 2018. The rail regulator criticised Grayling's DfT for failing to question the industry\u2019s assurances about the risk of disruption.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Seaborne Freight</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Grayling was widely mocked after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/30/no-deal-brexit-ferry-company-owns-no-ships-and-has-never-run-ferry-service\">awarding Seaborne Freight a no-deal Brexit ferry contract despite the company not owning any ships and having never previously operated a ferry service.</a>&nbsp;It emerged that Seaborne's website had copied their legal terms and conditions from a pizza delivery service. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/09/government-cancels-brexit-ferry-contract-with-no-ship-firm\">The contract was cancelled in February 2019</a>.

Under Grayling, in 2013, the ministry created 21 community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) to manage low- and medium-risk offenders with the aim of cutting reoffending rates and costs. The NAO found that while there has been a 2.5% reduction in the proportion of offenders proven to have committed another crime between 2011 and March 2017, the number of offences per reoffender has increased by 22%.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/haroonsiddique\"><b>Haroon Siddique</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Corbyn said the government\u2019s wider handling of Brexit had been \u201ccostly, shambolic and deliberately evasive\u201d, and he asked why Grayling had told MPs the Seaborne contract had cost taxpayers nothing, when a National Audit Office report this week said \u00a3800,000 was spent on external consultants to scrutinise the plan. \u201cWill the prime minister use this opportunity to correct the record?\u201d he asked.</p> \n<p>May said \u201cproper due diligence\u201d was carried out on the Seaborne contract and on contracts with two other ferry providers, DFDS and Brittany, who were due to provide 90% of the service.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat included a third-party assessment of the companies that were bidding for the contracts.

      "bodyText": "The top civil servant from Chris Grayling\u2019s department has admitted the government did not have a written guarantee of secure financial backing before handing a \u00a313.8m contract to a ferry company with no ships. Bernadette Kelly, the Department for Transport\u2019s permanent secretary, told the public accounts committee that instead officials accepted verbal guarantees from Seaborne Freight and were reassured that the firm was a \u201cknown quantity in the industry\u201d. The DfT scrapped its contract with Seaborne, a startup company, last week after its apparent financial backer, the Irish firm Arklow Shipping, withdrew its support. Sources at Arklow told the Guardian this week that the firm had been in talks with Seaborne Freight twice last year but \u201cnever had any agreement\u201d with either Seaborne or the Department for Transport to run a ferry service between Ramsgate and Ostend. Grayling is facing demands to resign as transport secretary after his department ignored warnings from experts that the endeavour entailed \u201csignificant risks\u201d. A review by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, found that the DfT received three bids for the ferry contracts, and that two of the three operators that won contracts did not meet the department\u2019s own criteria. Kelly told MPs the DfT awarded Seaborne one of three contracts before Arklow initially confirmed its backing in a letter on 15 January. She said the department received \u201cintimations\u201d from Seaborne. \u201cSo you took the word of Seaborne?\u201d asked the committee\u2019s chair, Meg Hillier. \u201cI would need to check what precise pieces of paper were in play at that point,\u201d Kelly said. The department\u2019s director general for international security and environment, Lucy Chadwick, told the committee: \u201cWe certainly had a number of discussions with Seaborne in term of who their backers were.\u201d Kelly said the firm\u2019s proposed arrangements, which involved leasing two ferries that it would then operate, were \u201cnot in any way abnormal or remarkable\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday during prime minister\u2019s questions, Jeremy Corbyn pressed Theresa May over the failed plan. Pointing to Grayling\u2019s already troubled history in the job, the Labour leader said: \u201cAnd now the transport secretary is in charge of a major and vital aspect of Brexit planning, how on earth can the prime minister say that she has confidence in the transport secretary?\u201d May said it had been correct to allow Seaborne to take up a small part of the allocation for alternative ferry freight provision. Corbyn said the government\u2019s wider handling of Brexit had been \u201ccostly, shambolic and deliberately evasive\u201d, and he asked why Grayling had told MPs the Seaborne contract had cost taxpayers nothing, when a National Audit Office report this week said \u00a3800,000 was spent on external consultants to scrutinise the plan. \u201cWill the prime minister use this opportunity to correct the record?\u201d he asked. May said \u201cproper due diligence\u201d was carried out on the Seaborne contract and on contracts with two other ferry providers, DFDS and Brittany, who were due to provide 90% of the service. \u201cThat included a third-party assessment of the companies that were bidding for the contracts. There would have been a cost attached to this process regardless of who the contracts were entered into with,\u201d May argued. Corbyn also pressed May on whether Thanet, the Kent council responsible for Ramsgate, would be reimbursed for \u00a32m in costs linked to trying to prepare the port, which has not had a ferry service for six years, for potential use. Kelly told the committee that some dredging had been completed at Ramsgate. She left open the possibility that it could yet be used for ferries in a no-deal scenario. \u201cWe may yet conclude that we might yet consider investment in that port,\u201d she said. A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe have procured a number of routes to ensure resilience through our contracts with DFDS and Brittany Ferries. These routes will be used for priority goods, including medicines. \u201cWe are continuing to work with key sectors to understand their capacity needs and ensure that supplies of priority goods continue in any scenario. \u201cWe will continue to explore all possible options to secure additional freight capacity to ease pressure on the Dover straits in the event of a no deal Brexit, including through the port of Ramsgate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A man has been arrested on suspicion of triple murder after the bodies of three elderly men, including twins, were found within 24 hours of each other in Exeter. Detectives said the three men, two aged 84 and one aged 80, whose bodies were found at two addresses a mile apart, had suffered \u201csignificant levels of injury\u201d. Police said there were no active lines of inquiry that gave them cause for concern that there could be other victims, but asked for anyone who had concerns about vulnerable neighbours to check on them or contact the police. A 27-year-old man was arrested within hours of the twins\u2019 bodies being found after a member of the public raised the alarm. Detectives said they were still trying to understand the motive for the attacks. They have not established a clear link between the suspect and the victims or between the twins and the third victim. Police were called by paramedics at about 3pm on Monday to a house in Bonhay Road, Exeter, after the body of a man was discovered there. Anthony Payne, 80, was confirmed dead at the scene. Police are still tracing his next of kin. At 1pm on Tuesday police were called to a second property, in Cowick Lane, and the bodies of Dick and Roger Carter were confirmed dead at the scene. Their next of kin have been informed. The 27-year-old man remains in police custody at Heavitree police station in the city. Supt Matt Lawler, the local policing commander for Exeter, east and mid-Devon, said on Wednesday that police were appealing for anyone who was in the area of Bonhay Road or Cowick Lane between 8am on Sunday 10 February and 1pm on Tuesday 12 February and may have seen anything relevant to contact police. Asked at a press conference whether it was possible the men had been a victim of \u201ccuckooing\u201d, which involves a criminal taking over a vulnerable person\u2019s home, Lawler said: \u201cThis is very early stages in terms of investigation. We must be careful not to speculate.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have yet to establish a clear connection between the parties involved.\u201d Dozens of officers from as far away as St Ives in Cornwall are helping with the investigation. House-to-house inquiries are taking place and CCTV footage is being studied. Forensic teams were at both properties. DCI Roy Linden, the deputy head of the major crime investigation team, said: \u201cThere are several significant common factors between the addresses. In terms of the levels of violence that were used, we\u2019ve decided to link the investigations. There were significant levels of injury with some commonality between the two incidents. \u201cWe are trying to understand why the three individuals were attacked. There are no active lines of inquiry to suggest there are any other victims.\u201d He declined to say if anything had been taken from the properties. One woman who lives near the Carters said her mother had seen a \u201cscruffy looking man carrying a tool bag\u201d outside the elderly twins\u2019 home just hours before their bodies were discovered. Police have been asking the twins\u2019 neighbours if they had noticed vehicles parked outside their home and if they had had anything stolen since 10 February. The pair were directors of an agricultural company called Traycrop from the early 1990s until it was dissolved in 2004. Neighbours have said they were mushroom farmers. Graham May, who lives close to the twins\u2019 home, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been here most of my life and know they\u2019ve been in the area for the last 20 years.\u201d A note pinned to the door of the Bonhay Road address, signed AG Payne, read: \u201cElderly man 80 years of age wants accommodation for himself and his pet cat.\u201d Neighbours said the note had been there for some weeks.

The economy of the early industrial revolution was as close to frictionless as you could get. There was no collective bargaining, so wages were set by the interplay of demand and supply of labour. There was no welfare state, so those who fell on hard times went to the workhouse. There were no health and safety regulations to protect workers or the environment, so industrial injuries and pollution were rife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4645c50a0e00c3a3a74a8098b3f63ee2d280c78f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4645c50a0e00c3a3a74a8098b3f63ee2d280c78f/0_97_4110_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England governor Mark Carney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England governor Mark Carney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It eventually became apparent that this model of capitalism was sowing the seeds of its own destruction, and that there would have to be reform if the revolutionary outcome predicted by Karl Marx was to be avoided.

      "bodyText": "For the first time in a week there was the sound of hooves thudding against turf on a British racecourse on Wednesday. There were not as many hooves as normal, perhaps, since an unknown number of jumping horses have not had a booster jab against equine flu in the last six months, a strict requirement for every runner as the sport emerges from self-imposed quarantine after flu outbreaks in Newmarket and Cheshire. But it was still competition and a much-needed chance to earn a wage after a six-day suspension. Many of racing\u2019s employees are earning only when the action starts. Most jockeys are paid by the ride and their valets are self-employed as well while, if there are no horses to bet on, the on-course bookies have no punters to service. \u201cI\u2019ve been sat at home watching South African racing,\u201d said John Goss, laying bets on the Sherlock Racing pitch in the betting ring before the first of six races here. \u201cIt\u2019s a day\u2019s wages, every day you\u2019re off.

There would have been mortgage-payment worries if it had gone on much longer.\u201d At Musselburgh on Tuesday evening Andrew Hughes was forced to turn his horsebox round and set off on the long journey back to his base in County Kilkenny after his six-year-old The Tartan Spartan failed to meet the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s new biosecurity requirements. No horses were turned away from Plumpton on Wednesday but one was ruled out overnight because its last flu booster jab was more than six months ago and, in all, only 46 runners faced the starter on the six-race card. Like many National Hunt trainers Anthony Honeyball had been forced to rummage through the passports of his entire 50-horse string to determine which were still eligible to run, after the BHA announced its new rule on Monday night. \u201cI think it [the BHA\u2019s handling of the flu outbreak] was good, it was all right,\u201d Honeyball said, after saddling Acey Milan to win the first race on the card. \u201cThe only thing for me was that at 11 o\u2019clock at night I was qualified for anything I wanted to run in and then, at 11.30, half the horses can\u2019t run.

Elena Mondal was found in the grounds of Henrietta Barnett school in Hampstead Garden Suburb, north London, on 5 June 2017, less than four weeks after she had cut her arms in the school toilets. The inquest at Barnet coroner\u2019s court heard from expert witnesses that although Elena had experienced panic attacks and collapsed at school in the months before her death, had walked out of a classroom with scissors, and been admitted to hospital for her arm injury, they did not believe her life had been at risk. Elena was a pupil at a selective girls\u2019 school founded in 1911 by Henrietta Barnett, a pioneer of female education.

The inquest heard Elena was receiving counselling from Barnet\u2019s child and adolescent mental health service for an eating disorder and self-harming and had been assessed at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead. Her psychiatrist, Dr Cathy Wainhouse, told the inquest that on the day Elena died she may have hoped she would be discovered before it was too late, but her \u201cdramatic statement\u201d had gone terribly wrong. The inquest heard that Elena had warned that she may do something \u201cdrastic and silly\u201d.

Asked whether she had told Elena she could not keep coming to school if she continued to self-harm, Barry told the court: \u201cIf Elena self-harmed in school we would ask her parents to come and pick her up.\u201d Barry said as soon as she became aware of the self-harming it was \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d that she would speak to the girl\u2019s parents.

Labour\u2019s Peter Hain said: \u201cIn the current climate in Zimbabwe \u2013 which is a human rights-free zone, with President Mnangagwa and his military henchmen cracking down on individual freedom and particularly the opposition \u2013 nobody should be deported, especially when their families are protesting about the desperate situation they will probably face.\u201d The Home Office has been criticised for working with the new Zimbabwean government to push ahead with a removals process for refused asylum seekers, many of whom have been in the UK for over a decade. Two refused asylum seekers were detained at the Home Office\u2019s Vulcan House building in Sheffield on Monday and were told they could be returned to Zimbabwe within days. One of the men detained was Victor Mujakachi, who came to the UK as a postgraduate student in 2003. Zimbabwean authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 2008 after he made critical comments online about the re-election of Mugabe. On Wednesday, following appeals from his MP and 7,500 people who signed a petition for his release, Mujakachi was given a three-month window in which he will not be removed from the UK. Gill Furniss, MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, said that while she was pleased by the news, Mujakachi was still in detention and efforts to get him released were continuing. \u201cThe outpouring of support for such a valued member of our community has been amazing and has played no small part in ensuring for now, Victor is safe,\u201d she said. \u201cMy team and I will be working over the coming weeks to help Victor return to his family and secure his future in Sheffield.\u201d Responding to comments in the Lords, the Home Office minister Lady Williams of Trafford said: \u201cThe UK continues to call for the government of Zimbabwe to uphold the rule of law and human rights and to promote free and fair elections under the protection of the 2013 constitution and international human rights law. \u201cThe Home Office only seeks to return those whose asylum claim has been unsuccessful. They are by definition not at risk on return. All protection claims from Zimbabwean nationals are carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with our international obligations.\u201d",

Repeat with the flour. 6 Fill the moulds and cook Divide the batter between the two moulds, leaving a little room at the top for them to rise. If you\u2019d like to eat them immediately, put them on the hot baking tray in the oven for 12 minutes, until the tops are set and the cake mix is just starting to come away from the sides of the moulds. 7 Rest, then plate Leave to rest for 30 seconds, then loosen with a palette or butter knife and turn out on to plates if you\u2019re feeling confident, or serve in the moulds if you\u2019d prefer to play it safe. (If you\u2019re really out to impress, I\u2019d recommend trying out this recipe in advance, to check the exact timings in your oven, because they\u2019re likely to vary slightly from mine.) 8 Alternatively, save until later Although the cooked puddings should be eaten immediately, if you\u2019d like to get ahead, you can chill the raw mixture in its moulds, or even freeze it \u2013 in which case, cook for 14 minutes from cold or 16 from frozen: again, timings will depend on the exact temperature of your oven, so you might want to make double and cook a test pudding in advance. 9 The finishing flourish Serve hot with ice-cream, cold single cream or creme fraiche. For extra brownie points, make your own accompaniment by mixing 100ml creme fraiche with a teaspoon of icing sugar and the zest of half an orange; or a teaspoon each of vanilla extract and runny honey; or a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and chilli powder and a teaspoon of runny honey.",

These are also frequently served at meetings and events.\u201d We have to accept certain foods are rare treats. That, in fact, scarcity heightens enjoyment of them.</p> <p><strong>Rewind and streamline</strong> The most calorific scone surveyed contained fruit, while ludicrous hybrids (Mars scones, Cr\u00e8me Egg scones) unnecessarily load in extra fat and sugar. Scones should be plain: no currants, no glace cherries, no raspberry and white chocolate (22.7g of fat, that one). Instead, for optimum scone pleasure, add cream first, then jam, so that its flavour (raspberry or blackcurrant, preferably) asserts itself before your palate becomes coated in fat.

Cream should not come with a crust, and scalding it obviously gives it a bizarre, curdled flavour. Clean, whipped double cream is the progressive alternative. Don\u2019t put it on a diet This report will inevitably inspire a wave of \u201cskinny\u201d scones: high-protein/low-carb versions made with chickpeas and served with half-fat cr\u00e8me fraiche and unsweetened goji berry compote. That will suck any joy out of the scone, as would shrinking them. Instead, have them as a hefty indulgence and \u2026 \u2026 don\u2019t eat them every day It sounds unlikely, but the Nutritional Content of Scones report (lads, you\u2019re looking in the wrong place), focused on Northern Ireland \u201cdue to the NI custom of including scones as a mid-morning snack. These are also frequently served at meetings and events.\u201d We have to accept certain foods are rare treats. That, in fact, scarcity heightens enjoyment of them. Rewind and streamline The most calorific scone surveyed contained fruit, while ludicrous hybrids (Mars scones, Cr\u00e8me Egg scones) unnecessarily load in extra fat and sugar. Scones should be plain: no currants, no glace cherries, no raspberry and white chocolate (22.7g of fat, that one). Instead, for optimum scone pleasure, add cream first, then jam, so that its flavour (raspberry or blackcurrant, preferably) asserts itself before your palate becomes coated in fat. Who could argue with that?",

      "bodyText": "California police officers fatally shot a 20-year-old rapper who was sleeping in his car outside a Taco Bell, authorities said. Six Vallejo officers fired \u201cmultiple rounds\u201d at the man, identified by family as Willie McCoy, police said. McCoy had a handgun on him when the officers fired out of \u201cfear for their own safety\u201d on Saturday night, according to the department. The family of McCoy, whose rapper name was Willie Bo, said Tuesday that police had racially profiled the young black man and that there was no justification for using deadly force against someone who was sleeping and not a threat. \u201cThere was no attempt to try to work out a peaceful solution,\u201d Marc McCoy, Willie\u2019s older brother, told the Guardian. \u201cThe police\u2019s job is to arrest people who are breaking the law \u2013 not take the law into your own hands. You\u2019re not judge, jury and executioner \u2026 We\u2019re never going to get over this.\u201d Police said officers were checking up on McCoy after a Taco Bell employee called 911 and said a man was \u201cslumped over\u201d behind the wheel of his car at the fast-food restaurant drive through on Saturday at around 10.30pm. McCoy was unresponsive and had a handgun on his lap, police said, adding that the doors were locked and the car was on. After they called for backup, McCoy \u201csuddenly\u201d moved, officials said in a statement. Police further alleged that officers told him to \u201ckeep his hands visible\u201d but that he \u201cquickly moved his hands downward for the firearm\u201d. Police said six officers all fired shots within roughly four seconds, but they did not disclose the number of bullets that struck McCoy. The officers continued shouting commands before removing him from the vehicle and \u201crendering medical assistance\u201d. He died on the scene. Police have not yet confirmed his identity and said an autopsy was pending. The killing of McCoy follows numerous scandals involving alleged police brutality against black residents in Vallejo, a diverse city 30 miles north-east of San Francisco.

They have been blowing their horn saying it\u2019s a massive victory for clean sport but it\u2019s not really when you have alienated hundreds of athletes on the way.</p> <p>\u201cBut away from the whole Rusada case, the main issue is we find disdain for the athlete voice,\u201d he added. \u201cUltimately no one knows sport better than the athletes, so it seems crazy to me that you would exclude that voice from any decision-making table or fail to engage in basic dialogue.\u201d</p> <p>Skinner said he hoped that Global Athlete would attract as many athletes from as many countries as possible to give them as much power as possible. \u201cWe are saying we need a fairer system and that is something we hope people will get behind whether they are Russian, British or American,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The organisation will be led by Rob Koehler, who was previously the deputy director of Wada before resigning from the organisation last year, who is planning to conduct a \u201clistening exercise\u201d among athletes over the next few months. \u201cWe are taking a bottom up approach and speaking to the athletes to find where the biggest pressure points are and what their concerns are,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Global Athlete is being funded by FairSport \u2013 a not-for-profit independent organisation dedicated to eradicating cheating \u2013 as well as some private individuals. However Koehler promised that anyone putting money into the organisation would have no say over how it was run. \u201cFunding is not, and will never be linked to decision making,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an organisation that will be solely driven by the athletes \u2013 we are here to support them and give them a voice in the long term.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2019.

      "bodyText": "The British Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist Callum Skinner has urged his fellow athletes to sign up for a new global body that he says will stand up for their rights \u2013 and ensure they are no longer treated with \u201cdisdain\u201d by the International Olympic Committee and World Anti-Doping Agency. Skinner, one of the key figures behind Global Athlete, which plans to be an \u201cathlete-led movement for change\u201d in Olympic and Paralympic sports, told the Guardian that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d that competitors did not currently have more of a voice in deciding how their sports are run. The new organisation has been launched after growing concerns about athlete welfare following the US gymnastics sex abuse scandal and also historic reports of bullying in various British Olympic and Paralympic sports, as well as concerns that the IOC and Wada have brushed the Russian doping crisis under the carpet. Skinner, a member of Britain\u2019s team sprint Olympic gold-winning trio in 2016, said he had got involved with the new organisation after realising that sending \u201cdisgruntled tweets\u201d were not going to bring about change. \u201cThis was born out of a dissatisfaction with the way Wada lifted the suspension on the Russian Anti-Doping Agency but it is clear there are also a whole bunch of issues where things for athletes could be better, including their welfare,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe also want to say to the IOC, maybe you could let us tweet about our sponsors during Olympics or let us wear their logo on our shirt \u2013 basically something that doesn\u2019t detract from their sponsors but gives us a platform to make a living.\u201d Skinner was especially critical of the Wada president, Sir Craig Reedie, his director general, Olivier Niggli, and the IOC president, Thomas Bach, calling their leadership over the Russian doping scandal \u201cineffectual\u201d. \u201cIt has been gladiatorial towards athletes when it should have been conciliatory,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should have been about open dialogue, instead it has been about suppressing the athlete voice and somebody telling us to get back on the pitch because we don\u2019t understand the issues. They have been blowing their horn saying it\u2019s a massive victory for clean sport but it\u2019s not really when you have alienated hundreds of athletes on the way. \u201cBut away from the whole Rusada case, the main issue is we find disdain for the athlete voice,\u201d he added. \u201cUltimately no one knows sport better than the athletes, so it seems crazy to me that you would exclude that voice from any decision-making table or fail to engage in basic dialogue.\u201d Skinner said he hoped that Global Athlete would attract as many athletes from as many countries as possible to give them as much power as possible. \u201cWe are saying we need a fairer system and that is something we hope people will get behind whether they are Russian, British or American,\u201d he added. The organisation will be led by Rob Koehler, who was previously the deputy director of Wada before resigning from the organisation last year, who is planning to conduct a \u201clistening exercise\u201d among athletes over the next few months. \u201cWe are taking a bottom up approach and speaking to the athletes to find where the biggest pressure points are and what their concerns are,\u201d he said. Global Athlete is being funded by FairSport \u2013 a not-for-profit independent organisation dedicated to eradicating cheating \u2013 as well as some private individuals. However Koehler promised that anyone putting money into the organisation would have no say over how it was run. \u201cFunding is not, and will never be linked to decision making,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an organisation that will be solely driven by the athletes \u2013 we are here to support them and give them a voice in the long term.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2019. Callum Skinner was a member of Britain\u2019s team sprint, not pursuit as an earlier version said, Olympic gold-winning trio in 2016.",

      "body": "<p>A former US air force intelligence officer who defected to Iran in 2013 has been charged with espionage, giving away the identity of a US agent and other secrets.</p> <p>Monica Witt, aged 39, was a cryptologist and a counter-intelligence investigator for the US air force for more than 10 years before working as an intelligence analyst for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton for five months in 2008 and doing other private sector work.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5736443/Indictment-Monica-Witt.pdf\">charges unsealed</a> on Wednesday by the justice department, she defected to Iran in August 2013, taking with her details of US counter-intelligence agents she had worked with who were then targeted by Iranian hackers, four of whom are named in the indictment and charged alongside Witt.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a sad day for America when one of its citizens betrays our country,\u201d the assistant attorney general for national security, John Demers, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-national-security-john-c-demers-delivers-remarks-unsealing-0\">said</a>.</p> <p>Demers said: \u201cMs Witt was recruited by Iran as part of a program that targets former intelligence officers and others who have held security clearances. Following her defection to Iran in 2013, she is alleged to have revealed to the Iranian government the existence of a highly classified intelligence collection program and the true identity of a US intelligence officer, thereby risking the life of this individual.\u201d</p> <p>The indictment suggests Witt defected for ideological motives, and was recruited when she visited Iran in February 2012 to attend a conference on US cultural influence called \u201cHollywoodism\u201d.</p> <p>The conference was organised by an group called New Horizon, which was put under US sanctions on Wednesday for allegedly serving as a front from the Quds Force, the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC-QF).</p> <p>\u201cNew Horizon Organization hosts international conferences that serve as a platform for the IRGC-QF to recruit and collect intelligence from attendees,\u201d a <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm611\">US treasury statement</a> said. Witt is alleged to have made videos at that time identifying herself as a US veteran, criticising the US government and publicly converting to Islam.</p> <p>Witt was warned by the FBI that she was a target for recruitment as an Iranian spy, and she said she would not disclose information about her time in air force intelligence. But she went on to help make a propaganda video and return to Iran for a second Hollywoodism conference in February 2013, where she allegedly approached the IRGC and offered to defect.</p> <p>Over the next few months, before she defected, her point of contact is alleged to be an Iranian woman, referred to as individual A.<strong> </strong>At one point Individual A flatters her by saying: \u201cShould I thank the sec [secretary] of defence \u2026 u were well trained.\u201d</p> <p>Witt replied: \u201cLOL thank the sec of defence? For me? Well, I loved the work, and I am endeavouring to put the training I received to good use instead of evil. Thanks for giving me the opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>In July 2013, according to the indictment, individual A told Witt that Iranian officials were suspicious of her and wondered how she managed to travel around Asia while claiming to have no money.</p> <p>Witt replied: \u201cGrrr \u2026 No matter what, they are just going to be suspicious, right?

      "bodyText": "A former US air force intelligence officer who defected to Iran in 2013 has been charged with espionage, giving away the identity of a US agent and other secrets. Monica Witt, aged 39, was a cryptologist and a counter-intelligence investigator for the US air force for more than 10 years before working as an intelligence analyst for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton for five months in 2008 and doing other private sector work. According to charges unsealed on Wednesday by the justice department, she defected to Iran in August 2013, taking with her details of US counter-intelligence agents she had worked with who were then targeted by Iranian hackers, four of whom are named in the indictment and charged alongside Witt. \u201cIt is a sad day for America when one of its citizens betrays our country,\u201d the assistant attorney general for national security, John Demers, said. Demers said: \u201cMs Witt was recruited by Iran as part of a program that targets former intelligence officers and others who have held security clearances. Following her defection to Iran in 2013, she is alleged to have revealed to the Iranian government the existence of a highly classified intelligence collection program and the true identity of a US intelligence officer, thereby risking the life of this individual.\u201d The indictment suggests Witt defected for ideological motives, and was recruited when she visited Iran in February 2012 to attend a conference on US cultural influence called \u201cHollywoodism\u201d. The conference was organised by an group called New Horizon, which was put under US sanctions on Wednesday for allegedly serving as a front from the Quds Force, the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC-QF). \u201cNew Horizon Organization hosts international conferences that serve as a platform for the IRGC-QF to recruit and collect intelligence from attendees,\u201d a US treasury statement said. Witt is alleged to have made videos at that time identifying herself as a US veteran, criticising the US government and publicly converting to Islam. Witt was warned by the FBI that she was a target for recruitment as an Iranian spy, and she said she would not disclose information about her time in air force intelligence. But she went on to help make a propaganda video and return to Iran for a second Hollywoodism conference in February 2013, where she allegedly approached the IRGC and offered to defect. Over the next few months, before she defected, her point of contact is alleged to be an Iranian woman, referred to as individual A. At one point Individual A flatters her by saying: \u201cShould I thank the sec [secretary] of defence \u2026 u were well trained.\u201d Witt replied: \u201cLOL thank the sec of defence? For me? Well, I loved the work, and I am endeavouring to put the training I received to good use instead of evil. Thanks for giving me the opportunity.\u201d In July 2013, according to the indictment, individual A told Witt that Iranian officials were suspicious of her and wondered how she managed to travel around Asia while claiming to have no money. Witt replied: \u201cGrrr \u2026 No matter what, they are just going to be suspicious, right? I just hope I have better luck with Russia at this point. I am starting to get frustrated at the level of Iranian suspicion.\u201d The indictment quotes her as threatening to \u201cslip into Russia quietly\u201d and contact the WikiLeaks organisation from there. She had already threatened to \u201cdo like Snowden\u201d, a reference to the NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, and go public with what she knew about US intelligence operations. Prosecutors say she eventually defected to Iran on 28 August 2013, flying to Tehran from Dubai, writing to individual A \u201cI\u2019m signing off and heading out! Coming home.\u201d An FBI missing person poster from the time shows two pictures of Witt wearing a headscarf and saying she was last known to be traveling and working in south-west Asia. The FBI alert read: \u201cShe was last believed to be in either Afghanistan or Tajikistan in July 2013, where she was working as an English teacher. Witt may have also traveled to the United Arab Emirates or Iran, where she had previously traveled on at least two other occasions. \u201cThe last known contact with her is believed to have been in June 2013.

During the town hall, Schultz again insisted he will not run for president as a Democrat and that the time is ripe for an independent who can exploit discontent with the major parties and win the White House in 2020. The former Starbucks CEO has alarmed Democrats by exploring a potential independent campaign that they fear would virtually guarantee a second presidential term for Donald Trump. The billionaire\u2019s comments at a CNN town hall event will not have eased those worries, as the self-declared lifelong Democrat said that the party and their Republican rivals have become too extreme and he is convinced that most voters agree. \u201cI believe the majority of Americans feel like I do, the far left and the far right do not represent them and they\u2019re looking for a home,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cThe country has lost a sense of leadership in both parties, lost a sense of understanding about the values and conscience of the country.\u201d Schultz said he will spend the next three or four months taking \u201cmy message out to the American people\u201d and \u201cif the numbers don\u2019t add up I will not run for president because I will not do anything whatsoever to re-elect Donald Trump.

Schultz frequently depicted Democrats and Republicans as out of touch extremists who have failed to solve the country\u2019s problems, but he lacked detailed policy proposals on key issues such as immigration, healthcare, the environment and taxation. The town hall at a downtown Houston theatre received scant local publicity and was closed to the media. CNN did not escape reprimands on social media for its decision to hand a prime-time platform to a relatively unknown political neophyte who is a rank outsider according to their own polling. The network gave then candidate Trump generous levels of exposure during the 2016 Republican primary season, arguably boosting his credibility and helping him develop from a long shot into a serious contender. CNN hosted a town hall with a Democratic 2020 candidate, Kamala Harris, last month. It will broadcast one with another senator seeking the party\u2019s nomination, Amy Klobuchar, next Monday.

Perhaps the first place to start is a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-46814527\" title=\"\">Brexit emergency kit,</a> available for \u00a3300, which contains freeze-dried macaroni cheese and water purification tablets.</p> <p>As I have been kicking around the traps of disaster-planning since I was a child, when we had a basement full of condensed milk in case we urgently needed to make fudge after a nuclear war, I know a thing or two about survival packs. First, never buy one: like the baffling economics of the Christmas hamper, it is always twice as expensive as everything in it. There is often something chilling buried within, such as a piece of wire that will cut cheese but also go through bone, and that will freak you out before the disaster has even got going.</p> <p>Instead, build your own. Try not to be too practical: if you think seriously about what you will need in the event of total societal breakdown, the answer is always water, and when you consider quantities, the answer is \u201ctonnes\u201d. When the Iraq war broke out in 2003, my mum still had a load of bottles she had stockpiled for Y2K, which she said was fine, she would use it for washing. We had a big fight about the kind of world she wanted to live in: one where people bare-knuckle fight in the street over crusts of bread, while she walked around, clean and full of condensed milk.</p> <p>By the time of 2008\u2019s financial crash, I had a child of my own, and finally understood why, when world leaders start flying to meet each other in a rushed, unscheduled fashion and people talk about cash machines drying up, you might want to take personal precautions. If I had been thinking straight, I would have stockpiled money.

      "bodyText": "With the health minister admitting to stockpiling body bags in the event of a no-deal Brexit, rather than take to the streets to demand a better government (one that doesn\u2019t meet imminent catastrophe with catastrophe storage solutions), our thoughts naturally turn to what we should stockpile ourselves. Perhaps the first place to start is a Brexit emergency kit, available for \u00a3300, which contains freeze-dried macaroni cheese and water purification tablets. As I have been kicking around the traps of disaster-planning since I was a child, when we had a basement full of condensed milk in case we urgently needed to make fudge after a nuclear war, I know a thing or two about survival packs. First, never buy one: like the baffling economics of the Christmas hamper, it is always twice as expensive as everything in it. There is often something chilling buried within, such as a piece of wire that will cut cheese but also go through bone, and that will freak you out before the disaster has even got going. Instead, build your own. Try not to be too practical: if you think seriously about what you will need in the event of total societal breakdown, the answer is always water, and when you consider quantities, the answer is \u201ctonnes\u201d. When the Iraq war broke out in 2003, my mum still had a load of bottles she had stockpiled for Y2K, which she said was fine, she would use it for washing. We had a big fight about the kind of world she wanted to live in: one where people bare-knuckle fight in the street over crusts of bread, while she walked around, clean and full of condensed milk. By the time of 2008\u2019s financial crash, I had a child of my own, and finally understood why, when world leaders start flying to meet each other in a rushed, unscheduled fashion and people talk about cash machines drying up, you might want to take personal precautions. If I had been thinking straight, I would have stockpiled money. If I had been thinking half-straight, I would have thought: \u201cThis baby is not yet weaned, I need to stockpile chocolate for myself and forget about everyone else.\u201d Instead, I bought a gigantic bag of rice. Then a friend said: \u201cThat\u2019s not really what you want, is it, to raise yourself above everyone else?\u201d Unless you\u2019re intending to share it, rice-hoarding is not neighbourly; so I just ate it all, which took a really long time.

      "bodyText": "New South Wales taxpayers could be shortchanged up to $500m by a state government \u201caccounting trick\u201d that allows mining companies to dodge paying appropriate contingency costs for site rehabilitation. A 2017 report by the NSW auditor general found that security deposits paid by miners for future rehabilitation were inadequate and made several recommendations, including that the \u201ccontingency\u201d costs be increased. Though not part of the formal recommendation, the report said contingency costs should range from 25% to 50% (of the estimated total rehabilitation cost). The environmental group Lock the Gate has obtained a letter, through Freedom of Information, that shows the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment told a parliamentary committee last year it had accepted all of the auditor general\u2019s recommendations, and that it had already increased contingency costs. The department told Guardian Australia this week it had increased \u201ccontingencies\u201d to 30%. But it later clarified that figure included \u201ccontingency\u201d and two other metrics \u2013 project management costs and post-project environmental monitoring \u2013 which were dealt with separately by the audit. The amount for \u201ccontingency\u201d remains at the previous level of 10%. Rick Humphries, the mine rehabilitation coordinator at Lock the Gate, said the new arrangements were \u201can accounting sleight of hand\u201d that had the effect of not forcing mining companies to meet the standards outlined by the audit. \u201cContingency is a very specific tool designed to protect the taxpayer in this case from mine closure uncertainty. You need contingency to account for uncertainty (and the audit) recommended it should be substantially increased. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is bundle three elements together, call them \u2018contingencies\u2019 and claim the contingency has been raised ... and that\u2019s simply not true. \u201cIn effect this is another subsidy to the mining industry, particularly coal. Ultimately now if a project doesn\u2019t go according to plan, the taxpayer will have foot that bill.\u201d Lock the Gate estimates the shortfall will be about $500m \u2013 a calculation based on the $2.2bn held by the government in the form of cash and bank guarantees, and the findings of the audit that contingencies were insufficient. Humphries said the department\u2019s suggestion it had implemented recommendations of the audit was \u201ca serious misrepresentation of the facts\u201d. \u201cIt is placing the interests of the mining sector over those of the NSW taxpayer,\u201d he said. In a statement, the department said in response to the audit it \u201ccommitted to improving the security deposit scheme process by updating the security calculation tool (including providing for increased contingencies), which was implemented from July 2017. It said \u201ccontingencies\u201d increased from 15% to 30%. But when asked to clarify, the department confirmed that amount included project management and post-project monitoring costs, not purely \u201ccontingency\u201d for uncertainties. The audit recommendation was that the department increase \u201cthe contingency for uncertainties associated with mine rehabilitation and closure\u201d. \u201cAdditionally, the department has the power to adjust a security deposit at any time, should an inspection or review of mining operations plans reveal the need for additional funds,\u201d the department said.",

Bahrain wanted al-Araibi back to serve a 10-year sentence delivered in absentia for an act of vandalism he says he couldn\u2019t have committed because he was playing in a televised football match.

Over the coming months a dizzying array of parties would have some kind of input into or responsibility for what had happened or what might happen next.</p> \n<p>It crossed lines of international diplomacy, law enforcement, refugee law, human rights and the Arab Spring, the geopolitics of football, and the regular politics of domestic elections.</p> \n<p>But first, it was a small holding cell in a Thai immigration building. It was more than 48 hours before word got out that he and his wife were there. She wouldn\u2019t leave him.</p> \n<p>Gulf democracy groups, some run by just two or three people, and al-Araibi\u2019s Sydney-based lawyer began contacting media.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a refugee in Australia, I\u2019m scared of the Bahraini government,\u201d al-Araibi told the Guardian while he still had his phone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9dc72324-0a3a-49fb-b4f1-5f9deb42c683\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/elKuKQuZ9pA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThey will kill me.

He called me when he got out and said \u2018just to let you know there\u2019s an Australian footballer in there and he\u2019s a refugee, he\u2019s a lovely guy and his wife is so sweet, if you guys can do anything you should help out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jones became an integral part of the small army which formed, essentially working full time to free one man. He would soon be visiting weekly and became friends with al-Araibi.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Thai immigration officials assessing the situation were confused by al-Araibi\u2019s UN refugee travel documents, and juggled the red notice, a separate arrest request from Bahrain, and Australia\u2019s pleas to have him released.</p> \n<p>A senior official said if the documents were legitimate he would be sent back to Australia, because he was a refugee.</p> \n<p>Things moved quickly over the following week.</p> \n<p>Al-Araibi was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/02/setback-for-australian-refugee-football-player-arrested-in-thailand\">told to book a flight home</a> for the following day but just hours before takeoff it was cancelled and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/03/fears-grow-for-australian-based-refugee-detained-in-thailand\">he was bundled off to a Bangkok prison</a>. His wife was told he wouldn\u2019t be coming back.</p> \n<p>A court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/07/australian-bahraini-dissident-told-he-will-face-extradition-hearing-in-thailand\">extended his detention</a>, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/12/hakeem-al-araibi-interpol-red-notice-against-refugee-contravened-its-own-regulations\">the red notice</a> was lifted, but then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/bahrain-requested-arrest-of-refugee-before-he-arrived-in-thailand\">a separate request from Bahrain</a> appeared and Thailand gave it respect.</p> \n<h2>A powerful silence</h2> \n<p>Fears grew and human rights groups rallied. Al-Araibi\u2019s Melbourne football club, Pascoe Vale, learned quickly about red notices and refugee law and diplomacy, and started to campaign for his release. Players associations and unions joined in.</p> \n<p>Former Socceroo captain Craig Foster started rattling cages. Where was Football Federation Australia? Where was Fifa? The Asian Football Confederation?

Some weeks later a Saudi teenager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/09/rahaf-al-qurun-will-get-no-special-treatment-from-australia-peter-dutton-says\">Rahaf al-Qunun</a>, would also be detained in Thailand and threatened with deportation back to the country she\u2019d fled.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/10/why-has-one-refugee-captured-the-worlds-attention-while-another-is-left-in-jail\">Observations that her plight had galvanised more support than al-Araibi\u2019s</a> seemed to spur people on, and the campaign moved up a gear, driven by every group that had been there from the beginning, but spearheaded by Foster.</p> \n<p>The Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights\u2019 Fatima Yazbek and Yahya al-Hadid, their young daughter in tow, travelled between Melbourne and Sydney meeting human rights groups, activists, and journalists, introducing them to al-Araibi\u2019s wife and sharing their expertise and personal experiences with the long arm of the Bahrain state.</p> \n<p>Protests, op-eds, actions at Australia\u2019s A-League games lit up news sites. Olympians and some of the world\u2019s most famous footballers got on board. Foster showed up on the Swiss doorstep of Fifa, and demanded action from its secretary general Fatma Samoura, before flying back to Sydney to hold a rally outside the Opera House.</p> \n<p>They called for sanctions and boycotts. How could Thailand hope to host a World Cup after this? Fifa should threaten to take the chance away. The International Olympic Committee should kick it and Bahrain out of the Games. They didn\u2019t of course, because, of all the twists and turns along the way, the most consistent thing had been the limp words of the world\u2019s most powerful sporting organisations.</p> \n<p>Fifa and FFA had been dragged into something resembling forthrightness. The AFC, obstinately, said only it was working with Fifa and would not even call for his release.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/i-spent-the-first-day-of-my-honeymoon-in-a-jail-cell-with-my-husband-hakeem-al-araibi\">I spent the first day of my honeymoon in a jail cell with my husband</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Fans were disgusted.

Al-Araibi was one of theirs. But a powerful Bahraini was also one of theirs.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/hakeem-al-araibis-detention-not-sheikh-salmans-responsibility-afc-says\">Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al Khalifa</a>, a Bahraini royal, was the head of Bahrain\u2019s football association at the time of the athlete crackdown which saw 150 detained.

The FFA Twitter account posted a photo of the meeting, which stayed online.</p> \n<p>They did eventually meet again, on the sidelines of the Asian Cup six weeks later. The Guardian understands FFA chairman, Chris Nikou, suggested to Sheikh Salman that Australia would like al-Araibi back.</p> \n<p>If a later statement from the AFC is to be believed, that meeting would have been in vain anyway because Sheikh Salman no longer had sway, having recused himself a full 18 months ago from regional responsibilities to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest. It was the first anyone knew of it.</p> \n<p>The AFC would eventually call for al-Araibi\u2019s release \u2013 immediately after Bahrain formally lodged its extradition request to Thai authorities.</p> \n<h2>Diplomatic appeals</h2> \n<p>Behind the scenes international diplomacy rolled on. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the Bangkok embassy staff, had worked continuously behind the scenes pushing for his release. Nothing was getting through to Thailand, despite the countries\u2019 close relationship. Evidently Bahrain was closer.</p> \n<p>Statements from Payne demanding his release grew stronger, but it was a lone voice from the Australian government. Scott Morrison, prime minister since August, said little and only wrote to his Thai counterpart after lobbying from Olympians.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>As soon as he was safe his family and supporters urged people not to forget the others</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Still al-Araibi sat inside the prison. Graham Thom from Amnesty International, described the conditions to a Sydney rally.</p> \n<p>\u201cDuring that time he has been held in a cell with 40 to 50 other people,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe has to roll over at night with everyone else, just to be able to sleep.\u201d</p> \n<p>In late January he was brought to court. Wearing beige and pink prison clothes, al-Araibi shuffled from a bus to the court room door, barefoot and shackled, surrounded by guards. \u201cDon\u2019t send me to Bahrain!\u201d he shouted.</p> \n<p>\u201cAustralia is with you! Your wife sends her love!\u201d Foster cried back.</p> \n<p>With a coalition comprising representatives of 14 countries and the EU, Fifa, human rights groups, Foster, and his lawyers, al-Araibi stood as the judge read Bahrain\u2019s charges against him. He declared he would not go back willingly. The court gave him 60 days to prepare a defence, bail denied.</p> \n<p>That was last week, and his supporters, despondent, faced another two months or more of al-Araibi inside that crowded prison.</p> \n<p>More people joined the cause. Thais were horrified at the images of his shackles beamed around the world. The Australians who helped rescue a team of schoolboys from a Thai cave last year cashed in their capital, writing directly to the Thai prime minister.</p> \n<p>Morrison wrote again.</p> \n<p>Still nothing.</p> \n<p>Then rumours began, of what Foster called \u201cdevelopments\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were extremely hopeful,\u201d he told the Guardian.

Citing \u201cnew information\u201d, Thailand\u2019s foreign ministry had petitioned the court to drop the extradition case.</p> \n<p>Chatchom Akapin, the director general of the international affairs department of the attorney general\u2019s office, told the Guardian it was because Bahrain had decided not to pursue it any more.</p> \n<p>The claim didn\u2019t hold water \u2013 and Bahrain almost immediately said it still wanted al-Araibi and would keep trying to get him \u2013 but it didn\u2019t matter because he was going to come home.</p> \n<p>Bahrain hauled in Australia\u2019s ambassador and said publicly it was now requesting Australia extradite al-Araibi \u2013 an impossible request. It was dismissed as an act of face-saving but again, it didn\u2019t matter because he was going to come home.</p> \n<p>Less than an hour after the attorney general\u2019s office announced the extradition charges had been dropped, al-Araibi was bundled into a police van out of Bangkok remand prison. Unusually he was not taken to a processing centre but instead sent straight to the airport to board a midnight flight back to Melbourne, the ticket paid for by the Thai authorities.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/please-help-me-refugee-footballer-hakeem-al-araibi-tells-of-his-thai-jail-ordeal\">'Please help me': refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi tells of his Thai jail ordeal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Asked via WhatsApp how she felt, al-Araibi\u2019s wife responded \u201che\u2019s coming\u201d with a series of heart symbols and crying emojis. The young woman, who has been torn between staying out of the limelight and wanting to be with her husband, had endured the worst three months many could imagine.

Evan Jones, learning there was no one accompanying al-Araibi on the flight, bought a ticket.</p> \n<p>With the immigration authorities keen to avoid any further furore around the case, which has been seen to have brought shame upon Thailand, al-Araibi was only escorted to his flight gate at the last minute, surrounded by 10 officers. Press were ushered away. But in a hurried comment to the Guardian, a beaming al-Araibi said: \u201cI am so happy. I cannot wait to go home to my wife.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe talked for probably the first four or five hours of the flight, about anything and everything, his wife \u2026 how strong she was\u2026 about his family, his brother who\u2019s still in jail in Bahrain,\u201d said Jones.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48d71242a77ee2e1eb757e899b96d3167be0a5c3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48d71242a77ee2e1eb757e899b96d3167be0a5c3/0_12_4595_2758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Socceroo Craig Foster (centre) with refugee footballer Hakeem Al-Araibi (right) as he arrives at Melbourne International Airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Socceroo Craig Foster (centre) with refugee footballer Hakeem Al-Araibi (right) as he arrives to a media scrum at Melbourne International Airport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Crosling/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe support from Australia was probably one of the biggest ones, and how he felt about that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Al-Araibi was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the support, said Jones.

There are others in similar or worse situations. As soon as he was safe his family and supporters urged people not to forget the others.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose are imprisoned merely in retaliation for their pro-democracy demands. Their parents as well aspire to reunite with them soon,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe outstanding fight for Hakeem\u2019s case has averred that the continuous and effective efforts would find their way towards success.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then he was home, walking through the gates at Melbourne airport to a waiting horde of well-wishers. Freshly shaved and in new clothes, al-Araibi was swamped with hugs, cheers, microphones. He spoke excitedly and confidently.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see all of the people here and all of the Australian people and all of the media who supported me,\u201d he said, thanking the Australian government, its people, and Foster in particular.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is my country. I didn\u2019t have citizenship yet, but my country is Australia.\u201d</p> \n<p>Foster stood beside him and vowed to hold people accountable, but for the moment what mattered was al-Araibi was heading home, to his wife, perfume in hand and perhaps a (local) honeymoon on the cards.</p> \n<p>The cold and drizzly Melbourne day al-Araibi flew home to was nothing like the tropical beaches they had planned to visit, but with yet another jail cell behind him, it was paradise all the same.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Before Hakeem al-Araibi walked into Melbourne airport\u2019s arrivals area, into the hordes of waiting media and supporters, he stopped in the duty free shop to buy his wife some perfume. It had been 77 days since they\u2019d been alone together. Seventy-seven days since their planned honeymoon to Thailand\u2019s beaches was stopped before it began, as Thai authorities met the couple as they disembarked from the plane at Bangkok and arrested al-Araibi on an Interpol red notice he had no idea existed. The details now are well known. Bahrain wanted al-Araibi back to serve a 10-year sentence delivered in absentia for an act of vandalism he says he couldn\u2019t have committed because he was playing in a televised football match. He fled the charge while on bail, having already been imprisoned and tortured for three months. Al-Araibi, a 25-year-old Bahraini dissident, football player, refugee and Australian resident, had landed in the centre of a complicated and terrifying tug of war. A cry for help There were three countries involved but really it was so much more. Over the coming months a dizzying array of parties would have some kind of input into or responsibility for what had happened or what might happen next. It crossed lines of international diplomacy, law enforcement, refugee law, human rights and the Arab Spring, the geopolitics of football, and the regular politics of domestic elections. But first, it was a small holding cell in a Thai immigration building. It was more than 48 hours before word got out that he and his wife were there. She wouldn\u2019t leave him. Gulf democracy groups, some run by just two or three people, and al-Araibi\u2019s Sydney-based lawyer began contacting media. \u201cI\u2019m a refugee in Australia, I\u2019m scared of the Bahraini government,\u201d al-Araibi told the Guardian while he still had his phone. \u201cThey will kill me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen there. My life will end if I go to Bahrain.\u201d Evan Jones, program director at the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, was in Morocco when he got a call from a Palestinian refugee friend. \u201cHe was detained with Hakeem, in the same cell as Hakeem. He called me when he got out and said \u2018just to let you know there\u2019s an Australian footballer in there and he\u2019s a refugee, he\u2019s a lovely guy and his wife is so sweet, if you guys can do anything you should help out.\u201d Jones became an integral part of the small army which formed, essentially working full time to free one man. He would soon be visiting weekly and became friends with al-Araibi. Meanwhile Thai immigration officials assessing the situation were confused by al-Araibi\u2019s UN refugee travel documents, and juggled the red notice, a separate arrest request from Bahrain, and Australia\u2019s pleas to have him released. A senior official said if the documents were legitimate he would be sent back to Australia, because he was a refugee. Things moved quickly over the following week. Al-Araibi was told to book a flight home for the following day but just hours before takeoff it was cancelled and he was bundled off to a Bangkok prison. His wife was told he wouldn\u2019t be coming back. A court extended his detention, then the red notice was lifted, but then a separate request from Bahrain appeared and Thailand gave it respect. A powerful silence Fears grew and human rights groups rallied. Al-Araibi\u2019s Melbourne football club, Pascoe Vale, learned quickly about red notices and refugee law and diplomacy, and started to campaign for his release. Players associations and unions joined in. Former Socceroo captain Craig Foster started rattling cages. Where was Football Federation Australia? Where was Fifa? The Asian Football Confederation? They had obligations. But it was Christmas and public interest was low. Some weeks later a Saudi teenager, Rahaf al-Qunun, would also be detained in Thailand and threatened with deportation back to the country she\u2019d fled. Observations that her plight had galvanised more support than al-Araibi\u2019s seemed to spur people on, and the campaign moved up a gear, driven by every group that had been there from the beginning, but spearheaded by Foster. The Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights\u2019 Fatima Yazbek and Yahya al-Hadid, their young daughter in tow, travelled between Melbourne and Sydney meeting human rights groups, activists, and journalists, introducing them to al-Araibi\u2019s wife and sharing their expertise and personal experiences with the long arm of the Bahrain state. Protests, op-eds, actions at Australia\u2019s A-League games lit up news sites. Olympians and some of the world\u2019s most famous footballers got on board. Foster showed up on the Swiss doorstep of Fifa, and demanded action from its secretary general Fatma Samoura, before flying back to Sydney to hold a rally outside the Opera House. They called for sanctions and boycotts. How could Thailand hope to host a World Cup after this? Fifa should threaten to take the chance away. The International Olympic Committee should kick it and Bahrain out of the Games. They didn\u2019t of course, because, of all the twists and turns along the way, the most consistent thing had been the limp words of the world\u2019s most powerful sporting organisations. Fifa and FFA had been dragged into something resembling forthrightness. The AFC, obstinately, said only it was working with Fifa and would not even call for his release. Fans were disgusted. These organisations had developed and enshrined their own human rights codes: this was their first test and they were failing. Al-Araibi was one of theirs. But a powerful Bahraini was also one of theirs. Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al Khalifa, a Bahraini royal, was the head of Bahrain\u2019s football association at the time of the athlete crackdown which saw 150 detained. He is the current president of the AFC, and the vice president of Fifa but an aspiring president. Sheikh Salman\u2019s significance in this saga was inversely matched by his silence. Sitting inside the bleak, overcrowded confines of Bangkok remand prison in January, al-Araibi told the Guardian he believed his arrest was retaliation for his public criticism of Sheikh Salman at the time he was gunning for the Fifa presidency. Prison visitors were only allowed 20 minutes but al-Araibi spoke urgently and fast, determined that the world knew the \u201creal story\u201d. \u201cThis is nothing to do with my conviction; Bahrain wants me back to punish me because I talked to the media in 2016 about the terrible human rights and about how Sheikh Salman is a very bad man who discriminates against Shia Muslims,\u201d he said, emphasising over and over again his fears of being tortured or killed if he was sent back, such was the power of Sheikh Salman in Bahrain. FFA executives had met with Sheikh Salman the day after al-Araibi was arrested but have said they weren\u2019t aware of his situation. The FFA Twitter account posted a photo of the meeting, which stayed online. They did eventually meet again, on the sidelines of the Asian Cup six weeks later. The Guardian understands FFA chairman, Chris Nikou, suggested to Sheikh Salman that Australia would like al-Araibi back. If a later statement from the AFC is to be believed, that meeting would have been in vain anyway because Sheikh Salman no longer had sway, having recused himself a full 18 months ago from regional responsibilities to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest. It was the first anyone knew of it. The AFC would eventually call for al-Araibi\u2019s release \u2013 immediately after Bahrain formally lodged its extradition request to Thai authorities. Diplomatic appeals Behind the scenes international diplomacy rolled on. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the Bangkok embassy staff, had worked continuously behind the scenes pushing for his release. Nothing was getting through to Thailand, despite the countries\u2019 close relationship. Evidently Bahrain was closer. Statements from Payne demanding his release grew stronger, but it was a lone voice from the Australian government. Scott Morrison, prime minister since August, said little and only wrote to his Thai counterpart after lobbying from Olympians. Still al-Araibi sat inside the prison. Graham Thom from Amnesty International, described the conditions to a Sydney rally. \u201cDuring that time he has been held in a cell with 40 to 50 other people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has to roll over at night with everyone else, just to be able to sleep.\u201d In late January he was brought to court. Wearing beige and pink prison clothes, al-Araibi shuffled from a bus to the court room door, barefoot and shackled, surrounded by guards. \u201cDon\u2019t send me to Bahrain!\u201d he shouted. \u201cAustralia is with you! Your wife sends her love!\u201d Foster cried back. With a coalition comprising representatives of 14 countries and the EU, Fifa, human rights groups, Foster, and his lawyers, al-Araibi stood as the judge read Bahrain\u2019s charges against him. He declared he would not go back willingly. The court gave him 60 days to prepare a defence, bail denied. That was last week, and his supporters, despondent, faced another two months or more of al-Araibi inside that crowded prison. More people joined the cause. Thais were horrified at the images of his shackles beamed around the world. The Australians who helped rescue a team of schoolboys from a Thai cave last year cashed in their capital, writing directly to the Thai prime minister. Morrison wrote again. Still nothing. Then rumours began, of what Foster called \u201cdevelopments\u201d. \u201cWe were extremely hopeful,\u201d he told the Guardian. But they kept quiet. Finally \u2013 freedom Then the news broke on Monday. Citing \u201cnew information\u201d, Thailand\u2019s foreign ministry had petitioned the court to drop the extradition case. Chatchom Akapin, the director general of the international affairs department of the attorney general\u2019s office, told the Guardian it was because Bahrain had decided not to pursue it any more. The claim didn\u2019t hold water \u2013 and Bahrain almost immediately said it still wanted al-Araibi and would keep trying to get him \u2013 but it didn\u2019t matter because he was going to come home. Bahrain hauled in Australia\u2019s ambassador and said publicly it was now requesting Australia extradite al-Araibi \u2013 an impossible request. It was dismissed as an act of face-saving but again, it didn\u2019t matter because he was going to come home. Less than an hour after the attorney general\u2019s office announced the extradition charges had been dropped, al-Araibi was bundled into a police van out of Bangkok remand prison. Unusually he was not taken to a processing centre but instead sent straight to the airport to board a midnight flight back to Melbourne, the ticket paid for by the Thai authorities. Asked via WhatsApp how she felt, al-Araibi\u2019s wife responded \u201che\u2019s coming\u201d with a series of heart symbols and crying emojis. The young woman, who has been torn between staying out of the limelight and wanting to be with her husband, had endured the worst three months many could imagine. She reserved her belief that the ordeal was over until he got on the plane. While all this was going on, al-Araibi didn\u2019t know for sure that he wasn\u2019t going back to Bahrain until around 8pm. Evan Jones, learning there was no one accompanying al-Araibi on the flight, bought a ticket. With the immigration authorities keen to avoid any further furore around the case, which has been seen to have brought shame upon Thailand, al-Araibi was only escorted to his flight gate at the last minute, surrounded by 10 officers. Press were ushered away. But in a hurried comment to the Guardian, a beaming al-Araibi said: \u201cI am so happy. I cannot wait to go home to my wife.\u201d \u201cWe talked for probably the first four or five hours of the flight, about anything and everything, his wife \u2026 how strong she was\u2026 about his family, his brother who\u2019s still in jail in Bahrain,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThe support from Australia was probably one of the biggest ones, and how he felt about that.\u201d Al-Araibi was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the support, said Jones. He loved the country, where he didn\u2019t have to look over his shoulder, and its people who had rallied for him. \u2018My country is Australia\u2019 The focus has been on al-Araibi, who is now free likely because of the size of the campaign, its star power, and the relentless pressure put on Thailand. There are others in similar or worse situations. As soon as he was safe his family and supporters urged people not to forget the others. \u201cThose are imprisoned merely in retaliation for their pro-democracy demands. Their parents as well aspire to reunite with them soon,\u201d they said. \u201cThe outstanding fight for Hakeem\u2019s case has averred that the continuous and effective efforts would find their way towards success.\u201d Then he was home, walking through the gates at Melbourne airport to a waiting horde of well-wishers. Freshly shaved and in new clothes, al-Araibi was swamped with hugs, cheers, microphones. He spoke excitedly and confidently. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see all of the people here and all of the Australian people and all of the media who supported me,\u201d he said, thanking the Australian government, its people, and Foster in particular. \u201cThis is my country. I didn\u2019t have citizenship yet, but my country is Australia.\u201d Foster stood beside him and vowed to hold people accountable, but for the moment what mattered was al-Araibi was heading home, to his wife, perfume in hand and perhaps a (local) honeymoon on the cards. The cold and drizzly Melbourne day al-Araibi flew home to was nothing like the tropical beaches they had planned to visit, but with yet another jail cell behind him, it was paradise all the same.",

      "bodyText": "A coalition of peak Indigenous organisations is preparing to pressure state and federal governments for a greater share of Closing the Gap funding following the release of the 2019 report card, which found only two of the seven targets were on track. The group is hoping to sign an agreement with the Council of Australian Governments by the end of February outlining a tripartite agreement to update the targets, four of which have expired. The historic deal was struck in December and will ensure control over and responsibility for the targets is shared between Indigenous people, the federal government and state and territory governments. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is expected to promote the new arrangement in his first Closing the Gap update in parliament on Thursday, which will also highlight progress made against key areas like life expectancy, employment and child mortality, despite those targets not being on track. In comments taken from a draft of his speech, Morrison said the Closing the Gap targets, established in 2008, were \u201cwell intentioned but \u2018top down\u2019 so it was always doomed to fail in both its ambitions and also its process\u201d. \u201cIt didn\u2019t genuinely bring on board states and territories in making sure they have accountabilities and sharing the objective and process with Indigenous Australians,\u201d he said. Morrison said the existing targets took a \u201cdeficit mentality \u2026 which can sometimes mask progress being made\u201d. \u201cThe progress may not be fast enough or far enough but it still can discourage further efforts because of that approach so we do always need to mark what\u2019s been accomplished,\u201d he said. The report card found that the year 12 attainment rate was on track to halve by 2025 and rates of early childhood education had already reached their 2025 goal, with 95% of Indigenous four-year-olds attending early childhood education in 2017. Child mortality rates continued to decline but that target to halve the gap was no longer on track due to an even more rapid decrease of non-Indigenous child mortality rates. Progress have been made in improving literacy and numeracy rates, employment rates and life expectancy rates, but not enough to meet the target. School attendance rates will be confirmed mid-year but on current data are unchanged since 2014. Pat Turner, the chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, told Guardian Australia before the report\u2019s release that she expected Australia would \u201cfail again to meet the targets\u201d due to a lack of targeted resources. \u201cWe would like a lot of the money to go directly to Aboriginal community organisations to implement some of the policies because we know they will be more effective,\u201d she said. She said the tripartite partnership with Coag was \u201ca game-changer\u201d and set \u201ca real precedent here for how governments should be working with Aboriginal people\u201d. \u201cBusiness as usual is not going to work out,\u201d she said. Turner said the focus for the new targets would be on \u201cmeaningful jobs, meaningful education and being healthy to do those things in the first place\u201d. Rod Little, the co-chair of the National Congress of Australia\u2019s First Peoples, said that for progress to be made governments had to commit to working with Indigenous people. The draft targets, released in December, include reducing the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in out-of-home care, reducing rates of domestic violence against Aboriginal women and children, reducing Indigenous overrepresentation in youth and adult incarceration rates, and reducing rates of overcrowded housing. They also include a plan to develop a target on access to land, water and cultural rights; positive targets on education, employment and tertiary education; and reframing numeracy and literacy targets to focus on getting a greater number of Indigenous students in the top two bands. Coag has proposed that the existing targets on early childhood education, year 12 attainment and life expectancy be maintained.",

However, I am just as proud of my family\u2019s Irish heritage and my affinity and connection with the country. I have equal respect and love for both England and Ireland and therefore the national team I choose to represent is not a clear-cut, simple selection.

      "bodyText": "Declan Rice has submitted a written request to Fifa to transfer his registration from the Republic of Ireland to England, ending a long-running saga over his international allegiance. The West Ham midfielder, whose consistently impressive displays this season have caught the eye, was born in Kingston-upon-Thames but his paternal grandparents are from Cork and he excelled for Ireland at junior level. The 20-year-old progressed to gain three senior caps, but all in friendly fixtures, permitting him to declare for the country of his birth. Rice spent months deliberating before telephoning Mick McCarthy and Gareth Southgate on Wednesday to confirm he would seek to represent England in the Euro 2020 qualifiers. \u201cThis has been an extremely difficult decision and, in all honesty, not one I ever expected to be making at this stage of my career,\u201d he said. Rice said he had discussed the matter with family and friends as well as with McCarthy, Southgate and the former Ireland manager Martin O\u2019Neill. \u201cLike so many people around the world, I consider myself to be of mixed nationality,\u201d he added. \u201cI am a proud Englishman, having been born and raised in London. However, I am just as proud of my family\u2019s Irish heritage and my affinity and connection with the country. I have equal respect and love for both England and Ireland and therefore the national team I choose to represent is not a clear-cut, simple selection. Particularly not for a young lad who never dreamed of being in this position. \u201cUltimately, it is a personal decision that I have made with my heart and my head, based on what I believe is best for my future. I fully accept that some Irish supporters will be disappointed by my decision, and that everyone has different opinions in regard to the rules around international representation. However, I hope that people can understand that I have made this decision with honesty, integrity and the full support of my family.\u201d His switch is a huge blow for McCarthy, who succeeded O\u2019Neill in November, with the Ireland manager confirming he had fielded Rice\u2019s call and accepted his decision. \u201cDeclan rang me today and said he has decided to give it a go with England,\u201d he said. \u201cGood luck to him.\u201d Rice, who was at Chelsea\u2019s academy before moving to West Ham in 2014, has been one of his club\u2019s best players this season.

      "body": "<p>The alleged bias of the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, in permitting Uber to operate in London has been raised in a courtroom challenge.</p> <p>In June, the judge approved a 15 month probationary licence but then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/18/uber-judge-steps-aside\">agreed not to hear any future Uber-related cases </a>after the Observer revealed her husband works for a strategy firm that advised one of Uber\u2019s largest investors.</p> <p>At the high court on Wednesday, the counsel for United Cabbies Group, who oppose Uber running services in the capital, argued that Arbuthnot had not relied on the correct, statutory test in her decision and had failed to check whether her family had a financial interest in the issue.</p> <p>Robert Griffiths QC, representing United Cabbies, told the court in written submissions that the chief magistrate should have asked her husband, Lord Arbuthnot, about his company\u2019s involvement.</p> <p>Lord Arbuthnot, a former Tory MP for Wanstead and Woodford and chair of the defence select committee, had been a director of SC Strategy Ltd. One of the company\u2019s clients is the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) which, Griffiths told the court, is \u201cwidely reported to be a significant financial investor in Uber\u201d.</p> <p>Griffiths said: \u201cIn this case a simple question by the district judge of her husband \u2013 \u2018Can you please check on whether you or any of the companies in respect of which you are a chairman, director or consultant have any direct or indirect association with Uber or Transport for London?\u2019 \u2013 would have resulted in the identification of any potential conflicts of interest which the judge would either have been able to disclose to the parties or enable her in a timely manner to recuse herself from hearing the case.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIn our submission, there is a duty on a judge especially when dealing with high profile matters of this kind which have a significant element of public interest to check on whether there are any likely disqualifying interests which she should disclose to the parties on the basis that prima facie they may evidence a conflict of interest in respect of which the judge should recuse herself \u2026 Once the suspicion of bias has been created it colours the mind of even the fair minded and informed observer and the perception of continuing bias is perpetuated.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing the high court, Griffiths alleged that Arbuthnot did not have legal powers to grant Uber a probationary licence on the grounds that they \u201cmay become a fit and proper person\u201d to operate the service. The correct test, he said, was whether or not they had already reached that standard.</p> <p>Philip Kolvin QC, counsel for Uber, told the court: \u201cThe attack on the judge\u2019s impartiality and decision-making by non-parties to the appeal, who also happen to be trade competitors of Uber, is without substance and should be rejected.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that the judge understood and applied the correct test, finding that Uber was, at the time of the decision, fit and proper to hold the licence.\u201d</p> <p>Uber\u2019s application for a five-year licence was rejected by TfL in September 2017. </p> <p>TfL had a number of concerns with the firm, including failure to report criminal allegations to the police and the use of technology to thwart regulators outside the UK. </p> <p>The chief magistrate issued the shorter licence with stringent conditions after concluding the firm had made \u201crapid and very recent\u201d changes.</p> <p>The appeal continues. The judgment is expected to be reserved. </p> <p>Following a separate Uber case involving its operations in Reading, allegations have this week been made about another judge, Lord Justice Flaux, and his connections to the tech firm.</p> <p>Flaux recently heard a high court case in which Reading council appealed against a decision in Uber\u2019s favour. Flaux\u2019s son, it is claimed, works for an insurance company which has links to Uber.</p> <p>Responding to the allegation, a spokesman for the judiciary said: \u201cLord Justice Flaux was not aware of any connection between Aon (where his son is an associate director specialising in political risks insurance) and Uber. This is the first time that any suggestion of a connection has been brought to the judge\u2019s attention.</p> <p>\u201cThe judge would consider on its facts whether any future case constituted a perceived conflict of interest which required him either to declare it to the parties or to ask that another judge hear the case.

      "bodyText": "The alleged bias of the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, in permitting Uber to operate in London has been raised in a courtroom challenge. In June, the judge approved a 15 month probationary licence but then agreed not to hear any future Uber-related cases after the Observer revealed her husband works for a strategy firm that advised one of Uber\u2019s largest investors. At the high court on Wednesday, the counsel for United Cabbies Group, who oppose Uber running services in the capital, argued that Arbuthnot had not relied on the correct, statutory test in her decision and had failed to check whether her family had a financial interest in the issue. Robert Griffiths QC, representing United Cabbies, told the court in written submissions that the chief magistrate should have asked her husband, Lord Arbuthnot, about his company\u2019s involvement. Lord Arbuthnot, a former Tory MP for Wanstead and Woodford and chair of the defence select committee, had been a director of SC Strategy Ltd. One of the company\u2019s clients is the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) which, Griffiths told the court, is \u201cwidely reported to be a significant financial investor in Uber\u201d. Griffiths said: \u201cIn this case a simple question by the district judge of her husband \u2013 \u2018Can you please check on whether you or any of the companies in respect of which you are a chairman, director or consultant have any direct or indirect association with Uber or Transport for London?\u2019 \u2013 would have resulted in the identification of any potential conflicts of interest which the judge would either have been able to disclose to the parties or enable her in a timely manner to recuse herself from hearing the case.\u201d He added: \u201cIn our submission, there is a duty on a judge especially when dealing with high profile matters of this kind which have a significant element of public interest to check on whether there are any likely disqualifying interests which she should disclose to the parties on the basis that prima facie they may evidence a conflict of interest in respect of which the judge should recuse herself \u2026 Once the suspicion of bias has been created it colours the mind of even the fair minded and informed observer and the perception of continuing bias is perpetuated.\u201d Addressing the high court, Griffiths alleged that Arbuthnot did not have legal powers to grant Uber a probationary licence on the grounds that they \u201cmay become a fit and proper person\u201d to operate the service. The correct test, he said, was whether or not they had already reached that standard. Philip Kolvin QC, counsel for Uber, told the court: \u201cThe attack on the judge\u2019s impartiality and decision-making by non-parties to the appeal, who also happen to be trade competitors of Uber, is without substance and should be rejected. \u201cIt is clear that the judge understood and applied the correct test, finding that Uber was, at the time of the decision, fit and proper to hold the licence.\u201d Uber\u2019s application for a five-year licence was rejected by TfL in September 2017. TfL had a number of concerns with the firm, including failure to report criminal allegations to the police and the use of technology to thwart regulators outside the UK. The chief magistrate issued the shorter licence with stringent conditions after concluding the firm had made \u201crapid and very recent\u201d changes. The appeal continues. The judgment is expected to be reserved. Following a separate Uber case involving its operations in Reading, allegations have this week been made about another judge, Lord Justice Flaux, and his connections to the tech firm. Flaux recently heard a high court case in which Reading council appealed against a decision in Uber\u2019s favour. Flaux\u2019s son, it is claimed, works for an insurance company which has links to Uber. Responding to the allegation, a spokesman for the judiciary said: \u201cLord Justice Flaux was not aware of any connection between Aon (where his son is an associate director specialising in political risks insurance) and Uber. This is the first time that any suggestion of a connection has been brought to the judge\u2019s attention. \u201cThe judge would consider on its facts whether any future case constituted a perceived conflict of interest which required him either to declare it to the parties or to ask that another judge hear the case. He has no other cases pending which involve Uber.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Does Mike Pompeo realise what a foolish figure he cuts as he shambles around Europe, spouting risible tosh about Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to a \u201cnew liberal order\u201d and America as \u201cforce for good\u201d in the Middle East? It seems he does not. Pompeo is a former soldier, Tea Party Republican, hawkish CIA chief and enthusiastic torture advocate who complained in 2013 that Guantanamo Bay inmates on hunger strike had \u201cput on weight\u201d. Self-awareness is not really his thing. Whatever else he is, Pompeo is plainly no diplomat. Yet thanks to Trump, his job since April last year is US secretary of state, arguably the world\u2019s most influential diplomatic post. It\u2019s a role previously held by such towering figures as James Monroe, John Foster Dulles and George Shultz. By comparison, Pompeo is a political pufferfish floundering out of his depth. His latest self-inflicted embarrassment is Wednesday\u2019s conference in Warsaw, envisaged (by him) as an international rally to put pressure on Iran. In the week Iran noisily celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution and its leaders dared the US to do its worst, Pompeo mounted a demonstration of his own.

In a document summing up their case, prosecutors in Italy alleged that a network of BT Italy employees fabricated contracts and invoices and invented fake transactions to hide the unit\u2019s true financial position and hit bonus targets. Under Italian law, the claims mark the beginning of a three-week period during which the people under investigation have the opportunity to explain why they should not be charged. According to Reuters, which first reported the latest development in the BT Italy affair, prosecutors have named Luis Alvarez and Richard Cameron, respectively the former chief executive and former chief financial officer of BT Global Services \u2013 one of the biggest divisions of BT Group. They also reportedly named Corrado Sciolla, the former head of continental Europe who left in the immediate aftermath of the scandal emerging, among an expanded list of 23 suspects. Alvarez and Cameron were based in London, Sciolla in Milan. The executives have since left the company. A BT spokesman said: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d Shares in BT plunged 21% in January 2017, cutting its stock market value by \u00a38bn in one day, after the company revealed that it expected the cost of the affair to reach \u00a3530m. The three people named in the prosecutors\u2019 report are accused of setting unrealistically high business targets and of complicity in false accounting at BT Italy, which formed part of the global services division, according to the document. Reuters said it had been unable to reach their legal advisers for comment. The document also reveals that an Italian partner of BT\u2019s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, is under investigation over the scandal. In the document, prosecutors allege Andrea Alessandri, who led the PwC team in charge of auditing BT Italia\u2019s accounts, falsified the audit. When the scandal broke in early 2017, BT\u2019s then chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said the company could not have detected the problem sooner because top managers in London were unaware. BT filed its own criminal complaint against several of BT\u2019s Italian managers in 2017. It is contesting class-action lawsuits by shareholders who say the group misled investors and failed to promptly disclose the irregularities. The prosecution have named BT Italy as a suspect in the investigation, having previously been named as an injured party.",

      "body": "<p>Two suspected former secret service officers from the Syrian government have been arrested in Germany on allegations of carrying out or aiding torture and crimes against humanity.</p> <p>The men, identified only as Anwar R, 56, and Eyad A, 42, were arrested in Berlin and in Zweibr\u00fccken, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on Tuesday. Both men are believed to have left Syria in 2012 and to have sought asylum in Germany.</p> <p>The arrests follow years of investigation assisted by the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR).</p> <p>As part of an operation coordinated with police in France, another Syrian alleged to have worked for the secret service was arrested by Parisian prosecutors on Tuesday. His name was not revealed. </p> <p>It is the first time that western criminal prosecutors have arrested alleged torturers working for Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>The federal prosecution service in Karlsruhe said in a statement: \u201cFrom April 2011 at the latest, the Syrian regime began to suppress all anti-government activities of the opposition nationwide with brutal force. The Syrian secret services played a vital role in this. The goal was to use the intelligence services to stop the protest movement as early as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Anwar R is suspected of heading a secret service department that operated a prison near Damascus. He is accused of participation in the torture and abuse of prisoners between April 2011 and September 2012.</p> <p>The prosecutors said: \u201cAs head of the investigative division, Anwar R directed and commanded prison operations, including the use of systematic and brutal torture.\u201d</p> <p>Eyad A is thought to be a former officer who aided and abetted the murders and physical abuse of around 2,000 people between July 2011 and January 2012.</p> <p>He is alleged to have been responsible for guarding a checkpoint close to Damascus in 2011, where typically around 100 people a day were arrested before being imprisoned and tortured in Anwar R\u2019s jail.</p> <p>The arrest warrants for the pair were issued several months ago.

      "bodyText": "Two suspected former secret service officers from the Syrian government have been arrested in Germany on allegations of carrying out or aiding torture and crimes against humanity. The men, identified only as Anwar R, 56, and Eyad A, 42, were arrested in Berlin and in Zweibr\u00fccken, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on Tuesday. Both men are believed to have left Syria in 2012 and to have sought asylum in Germany. The arrests follow years of investigation assisted by the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR). As part of an operation coordinated with police in France, another Syrian alleged to have worked for the secret service was arrested by Parisian prosecutors on Tuesday. His name was not revealed. It is the first time that western criminal prosecutors have arrested alleged torturers working for Bashar al-Assad. The federal prosecution service in Karlsruhe said in a statement: \u201cFrom April 2011 at the latest, the Syrian regime began to suppress all anti-government activities of the opposition nationwide with brutal force. The Syrian secret services played a vital role in this. The goal was to use the intelligence services to stop the protest movement as early as possible.\u201d Anwar R is suspected of heading a secret service department that operated a prison near Damascus. He is accused of participation in the torture and abuse of prisoners between April 2011 and September 2012. The prosecutors said: \u201cAs head of the investigative division, Anwar R directed and commanded prison operations, including the use of systematic and brutal torture.\u201d Eyad A is thought to be a former officer who aided and abetted the murders and physical abuse of around 2,000 people between July 2011 and January 2012. He is alleged to have been responsible for guarding a checkpoint close to Damascus in 2011, where typically around 100 people a day were arrested before being imprisoned and tortured in Anwar R\u2019s jail. The arrest warrants for the pair were issued several months ago. Warrants have also been issued against at least 24 other alleged members of Assad\u2019s government, including Jamil Hassan, the head of Syria\u2019s notorious Air Force Intelligence Directorate. Hassan is wanted in Germany for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, and is believed to have tortured and murdered tens of thousands of civilians. The ECCHR is assisting torture survivors to file cases against their alleged torturers. Evidence against Hassan was gathered in interviews with other Syrians, some of whom live in Germany. Anwar R has apparently not made a secret of his role in torture, expressing the view that his flight from Syria and his application for asylum in Germany is evidence enough that he has distanced himself from his past. Substantial evidence against the men was gathered as a result of the exhibition of so-called Caesar photographs in the UN headquarters in New York in March 2015, which depicted the corpses of thousands of torture victims alongside personal testimonies. The photographs were taken by a former member of the Syrian military police calling himself Caesar, who fled Syria with the images in 2013. German authorities have approached the cases under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of crimes in one country even if they happened elsewhere. It was on the same basis that the US judiciary ruled last week that the Sunday Times journalist Marie Colvin was deliberately targeted and murdered by Assad\u2019s rgovernment.",

Food is no use waiting around in storage.\u201d Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition figurehead now recognized as Venezuela\u2019s leader by dozens of governments, announced on Tuesday that caravans of volunteers will take the shipment of food and medicine across the border on 23 February. The move is only likely to provoke the Venezuelan government, which as Guaid\u00f3 made his announcement, was parading troops on the same international bridge which the opposition has chosen as a staging area. It is as though both sides are reading from the same script. US officials and opposition leaders have explicitly stated that one of the goals of the aid is to weaken Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, by forcing the Venezuelan military to choose between blocking the aid caravan or disobeying their boss. The tactic also allows them to paint Maduro as a callous dictator who puts pride before his own starving people. When Venezuelan authorities positioned shipping containers and a fuel tanker across the Tienditas international bridge, opponents of Maduro \u2013 including the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and US senator Marco Rubio \u2013 highlighted images of the improvised blockade to reinforce their message that the Venezuela president was refusing to let food in. \u201cBy blocking aid to the Venezuelan people, Maduro is committing a crime against humanity. And military leaders in Venezuela who carry out this order are disqualifying themselves from any sanctions relief or post-Maduro US-backed guarantees,\u201d tweeted Rubio. Meanwhile, Maduro and his circle deny there are food shortages in Venezuela \u2013 despite widespread reports of chronic hunger in the country \u2013 and have portrayed the aid as a Trojan horse sent by the US and its allies. His vice-president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, even went so far as to claim the food packages had been poisoned with carcinogens. \u201cThere is no famine in Venezuela,\u201d Maduro said in a testy exchange with the BBC broadcast on Tuesday, adding that media coverage of food shortages were following a \u201cscript\u2026 established in the west to disfigure the Venezuela situation, and justify any intervention, any aggression, as is happening right now\u201d.

It wasn\u2019t too bad for Paris Saint-Germain either, though let\u2019s remember they\u2019ve got three weeks to think about what a great position they\u2019re in, and those extremely vivid, cold-sweat-tinged memories of Sergi Roberto aren\u2019t going to go away any time soon. But despite there remaining, if history is any guide, a real chance that the French champions could still balls this up with the kind of inevitable meltdown that would put Brazil\u2019s 2014 World Cup squad to shame, it wasn\u2019t great for Manchester United, who lost a home tie in Europe by more than one goal for the first time since records began in 1956.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/13/manchester-united-psg-angel-di-maria-uefa\">Manchester United charged by Uefa after bottles thrown at \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They were thoroughly outplayed pretty much from the get-go by a team who showed signs of having finally started listening to their coach. We know! PSG! Thomas Tuchel stood on the touchline directing tactical operations for the majority of the match, barking orders and gesticulating theatrically. The free movement of arms was particularly impressive to witness, given his jerkin appeared to be made out of that inflatable packaging Amazon fill their boxes with these days whenever you buy so much as a paperback book. Presumably a pre-emptive defence measure just in case a beer bottle meant for the back of \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s head was accidentally hoicked in the wrong direction. Anyway, Tuchel\u2019s charges did a good game, and now United\u2019s European hopes look at worst jiggered, at best utterly dependent on how PSG\u2019s central nervous system holds up. All is not yet lost, then.</p> <p>United do have one particularly big straw to clutch at, in that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has proved already that the odd spectacular European comeback can be possible. His never-say-die spirit will ensure the team go to the Parc des Princes in three weeks in the right frame of mind. \u201cThere is a determination and desire there to put this right, and when we go to Paris we\u2019ll give it a go,\u201d promised the grim-faced-baby-faced assassin. \u201cIt\u2019s a mountain to climb but it\u2019s not impossible. If we get to half-time with a 1-0 lead, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to look for.\u201d The only problem being, they\u2019ll have to do it without suspended late lunger Paul Pogba, and maybe without Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard, if those muscle injuries are as bad as feared. Meanwhile, it\u2019s over to Tottenham Hotspur, who have in the last few weeks demonstrated it\u2019s not obligatory to fall to pieces completely whenever a couple of your better players pick up knocks.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Scott Murray from 8pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Tottenham 2-2 Borussia Dortmund, while Barry Glendenning will be on hand for Ajax 2-1 Real Madrid.</a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so important for us to have good people.

When I first met my wife, she was very much a rugby, F1 or nothing girl when it came to watching sport. Being a Portsmouth season-ticket holder I decided to take her along to a Cup match about 15 years ago, to experience Fratton Park at its most raucous, and change her mind about football. After seven goals, two red cards, more bookings than I can remember and a full-on 22-man brawl to fire up the atmosphere, my wife said on the way home: \u2018Not really that impressed, I expected more from the game, to be honest.\u2019 Obviously I questioned the impending marriage at that point, but made a steadfast promise to myself to <em>never</em> take her to a game again, regardless of how much she begged me*. Can the readership collect better that for an example of an underappreciated game? *She has never begged to return (much to my annoyance)\u201d\u2013 Simon Toms.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a level of income after which it is impossible to trouser wages (Tuesday\u2019s Bits and Bobs)? Aaron Ramsey\u2019s pantaloons must look like MC Hammer\u2019s. Maybe that\u2019s why the latter went bankrupt \u2013 too much wage-trousering and not enough wage in-the-bank-putting.

      "bodyText": "IT\u2019S STILL IN THE BALANCE! SORT OF! It was a great evening for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. It wasn\u2019t too bad for Paris Saint-Germain either, though let\u2019s remember they\u2019ve got three weeks to think about what a great position they\u2019re in, and those extremely vivid, cold-sweat-tinged memories of Sergi Roberto aren\u2019t going to go away any time soon. But despite there remaining, if history is any guide, a real chance that the French champions could still balls this up with the kind of inevitable meltdown that would put Brazil\u2019s 2014 World Cup squad to shame, it wasn\u2019t great for Manchester United, who lost a home tie in Europe by more than one goal for the first time since records began in 1956. They were thoroughly outplayed pretty much from the get-go by a team who showed signs of having finally started listening to their coach. We know! PSG! Thomas Tuchel stood on the touchline directing tactical operations for the majority of the match, barking orders and gesticulating theatrically. The free movement of arms was particularly impressive to witness, given his jerkin appeared to be made out of that inflatable packaging Amazon fill their boxes with these days whenever you buy so much as a paperback book. Presumably a pre-emptive defence measure just in case a beer bottle meant for the back of \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s head was accidentally hoicked in the wrong direction. Anyway, Tuchel\u2019s charges did a good game, and now United\u2019s European hopes look at worst jiggered, at best utterly dependent on how PSG\u2019s central nervous system holds up. All is not yet lost, then. United do have one particularly big straw to clutch at, in that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has proved already that the odd spectacular European comeback can be possible. His never-say-die spirit will ensure the team go to the Parc des Princes in three weeks in the right frame of mind. \u201cThere is a determination and desire there to put this right, and when we go to Paris we\u2019ll give it a go,\u201d promised the grim-faced-baby-faced assassin. \u201cIt\u2019s a mountain to climb but it\u2019s not impossible. If we get to half-time with a 1-0 lead, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to look for.\u201d The only problem being, they\u2019ll have to do it without suspended late lunger Paul Pogba, and maybe without Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard, if those muscle injuries are as bad as feared. Meanwhile, it\u2019s over to Tottenham Hotspur, who have in the last few weeks demonstrated it\u2019s not obligatory to fall to pieces completely whenever a couple of your better players pick up knocks. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Scott Murray from 8pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Tottenham 2-2 Borussia Dortmund, while Barry Glendenning will be on hand for Ajax 2-1 Real Madrid. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt\u2019s so important for us to have good people. No d!ckheads, only good people. It\u2019s not because we don\u2019t want personality, or an edge, but we want people who actually care\u201d \u2013 Brentford boss Thomas Frank gets his chat on with Nick Miller and reveals the club has a policy the wider world could probably benefit from at the moment. SUPPORT THE GUARDIAN Producing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism [the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed] is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t. If you value our journalism, please support us. In return we can hopefully arm you with the kind of knowledge that makes you sound slightly less uninformed during those hot reactive gegenpress chats you so enjoy. And if you think what we do is enjoyable [again, etc and so on \u2013 Fiver Ed], please help us keep coming back here to give you more of the same. FIVER LETTERS \u201cHow about a more positive spin on the Noble Francis challenge around games where nothing happened (Fiver letters passim). When I first met my wife, she was very much a rugby, F1 or nothing girl when it came to watching sport. Being a Portsmouth season-ticket holder I decided to take her along to a Cup match about 15 years ago, to experience Fratton Park at its most raucous, and change her mind about football. After seven goals, two red cards, more bookings than I can remember and a full-on 22-man brawl to fire up the atmosphere, my wife said on the way home: \u2018Not really that impressed, I expected more from the game, to be honest.\u2019 Obviously I questioned the impending marriage at that point, but made a steadfast promise to myself to never take her to a game again, regardless of how much she begged me*. Can the readership collect better that for an example of an underappreciated game? *She has never begged to return (much to my annoyance)\u201d\u2013 Simon Toms. \u201cIs there a level of income after which it is impossible to trouser wages (Tuesday\u2019s Bits and Bobs)? Aaron Ramsey\u2019s pantaloons must look like MC Hammer\u2019s. Maybe that\u2019s why the latter went bankrupt \u2013 too much wage-trousering and not enough wage in-the-bank-putting. Also, who is his Mr.15% and can we get him to negotiate Brexit? The guy is clearly very talented\u201d \u2013 Craig Fawcett. \u201cDear Fiver, are you able to provide an xL (expected laughs) stat prior to each update? Would be a tremendous help and would save minutes of my day\u201d \u2013 Adam Smith. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Simon Toms, who wins a random tube map with footballers in place of stations. Plenty more prizes to come. BITS AND BOBS Paul Scholes is taking the Taylor Swift approach to criticism after getting the Oldham gig and winning his first match 4-1. \u201cIf anyone wants to have a dig at me, I won\u2019t be taking any notice,\u201d sniffed Scholes, shaking it off. \u201cThe only person I answer to is the owner.\u201d \u2026 at Hibernian\u2019s training ground to finalise deal to become head coach \u2026 SKY SPORTS YELLOW BREAKING NEWS TICKER OF DOOM \u2026 Paul Heckingbottom is \u2026 Charlotte Kerr, the Charlton player whose injury caused their game against Manchester United to be abandoned last month, has returned to training. Inter have stripped Mauro Icardi of the club captaincy without explanation, though his reluctance to write \u201cMauro Icardi\u201d on a new contract may have something to do with it. And AFC Fylde are on the look out for three fans who \u201ccunningly duped our stadium announcer into asking for a white Nissan Micra NE14 ABJ to be moved last night.\u201d We don\u2019t get it. Someone will have to explain it to us. STILL WANT MORE? Were PSG better off without their expensive Brazilian bauble, asks floating football brain in a jar Jonathan Wilson. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is fast and good. Good and fast. Good. Fast. Barney Ronay on the speedy sensation. Sometimes you can be just too busy to advocate for the release of an unfairly imprisoned footballer. That\u2019s what Marina Hyde reckons might have stopped Gianni Infantino from helping Hakeem-al-Araibi. From China to modern jazz: Ed Aarons profiles Dortmund\u2019s Axel Witsel. Is Tottenham\u2019s run of 30 league games without a draw a record? That, and other pieces of indispensable knowledge is in, erm, The Knowledge. Here\u2019s Richard Williams\u2019s tribute to Gordon Banks, the ideal goalkeeper who became the best in the world playing for Leicester and Stoke.

It spends its time among unfeasibly beautiful young people in microscopically tiny swimming costumes, and moves with them in a trance of heightened physicality, drifting across beaches, bars and dancefloors. The mood is dreamy unseriousness qualified occasionally by stabs of jealousy or misery. The sexiness isn\u2019t promiscuous exactly; more directionless. There is a sustained hedonism here: it floats along and you will wait a long time \u2013 three hours in fact \u2013 for something to happen in the boringly conventional narrative sense, some sudden event that will dramatically or ironically cut across all this sensuality.</p> <p>It is adapted from the 2011 novel La Blessure, La Vraie, or The Real Wound, by Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9gaudeau \u2013 whose Entre Les Murs was the basis of Laurent Cantet\u2019s Cannes Palme-winning movie The Class from 2008, starring B\u00e9gaudeau himself. The year is 1994 and Amin (Sha\u00efn Boumedine) is a young guy who has abandoned his medical studies in Paris and come back to his hometown: the Mediterranean port of S\u00e8te, which was the setting of Kechiche\u2019s earlier work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/20/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic10\" title=\"\">Couscous</a>. (There\u2019s a sly early nod to that film.)

Partly it\u2019s because he needs time to think about the new career direction he\u2019s fixed on \u2013 being a screenwriter, or maybe photographer. But Kechiche makes it clear Amin is still emotionally embedded in the ongoing soap opera of those love lives he left behind and the rich, garrulous warmth of his extended family who run a Tunisian restaurant locally.</p> <p>Is Amin himself in love? Well, he appears to have strong, unexpressed feelings of some sort for Oph\u00e9lie, a smart debut performance by black-belt <em>mignonne</em> Oph\u00e9lie Bau. Oph\u00e9lie is supposedly engaged to a guy called Cl\u00e9ment who is in the military, doing service overseas, but Amin has come back to discover she is having an affair with his cousin Tony (Salim Kechiouche), a commitmentphobe, heartbreaker and all-round party animal.</p> <p>Amin\u2019s summer of love will consist of hanging out with Tony while he ostentatiously seduces other women, as part of a diversionary tactic to draw gossips away from his liaison with Oph\u00e9lie \u2013 a scheme to which Oph\u00e9lie has semi-assented, being still notionally committed to Cl\u00e9ment. It creates a crosscurrent of anxiety and resentment that ripples under the party atmosphere. Tony puts the moves on tourist Charlotte (Alexia Chardard) while Amin is supposedly paired off with her friend C\u00e9line (Lou Luttiau). The excellent Hafsia Herzi, from Kechiche\u2019s Couscous, returns as Amin\u2019s aunt Cam\u00e9lia, and the director\u2019s sister Delinda Kechiche and Hatika Karaoui give lovely, warm performances as Amin and Tony\u2019s mums.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29f21f4f51df42f43cf4b08d1be02cf58f325d0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29f21f4f51df42f43cf4b08d1be02cf58f325d0b/0_0_1920_804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mektoub, My Love\" width=\"1000\" height=\"419\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simmering attraction \u2026 Mektoub, My Love</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sex in the movie is constructed counter-climactically.

I did my best to write about why jetpacks are not likely to be a household item any time soon.</p> <p>Four years later, I find myself writing about a situation which is essentially the exact opposite. This time, the subject is self-driving cars, a mode of transport that we\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/21/victoria-to-allow-trial-of-driverless-cars-on-country-roads\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/18/controversial-engineer-i-travelled-over-3000-miles-in-a-self-driving-car\">told</a> is just around the carefully manoeuvred corner. Indeed, the government is among the biggest advocates of driverless cars and has made some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/23/philip-hammond-pledges-driverless-cars-by-2021-and-warns-people-to-retrain\">bold promises about their use</a>. Yet Britain\u2019s population is possibly the least enthused of all about fully automated vehicles and it seems the country is seriously unprepared for their widespread use.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/nov/26/how-one-insurer-is-prepping-for-a-world-of-driverless-cars\">How one insurer is prepping for a world of driverless cars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are the findings of a recent study, covered by <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rise-of-the-driverless-car-is-halted-by-slow-broadband-fmlhqmftn\">The Times</a>, into the state of play about autonomous vehicles in several countries. It seems that the British government talks a good game about self-driving cars, but our infrastructure is nowhere near ready for it and the public is the most sceptical.</p> <p>Far be it from me to suggest that the government has a tendency to insist that something will be brilliant, and rapidly pushing ahead with it without doing any basic preparation, and despite the fact that most people don\u2019t want it and may well be harmed by it, but this is one instance where the general public is almost surely in the right because most experts agree that this hype is exceedingly premature.</p> <p>Many reasons to be sceptical about the imminent arrival of driverless cars are covered by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FryRsquared\">Dr Hannah Fry</a> in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0857525247/ref=asc_df_085752524758476890/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;creative=22110&amp;creativeASIN=0857525247&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=310816411121&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=2970739513284195269&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9045371&amp;hvtargid=pla-716563517512&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">her book</a> (and <a href=\"http://discovermagazine.com/2018/nov/baby-can-you-drive-my-car\">this article</a>), and in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/14/statistically-self-driving-cars-are-about-to-kill-someone-what-happens-next\">2016 </a>piece by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjrobbins\">Martin Robbins</a>. But one constant theme with all concerns about self-driving cars is that most of the issues exist \u201cbeyond\u201d the vehicle. Making a car that can move and control itself seems to be relatively straightforward, it\u2019s the world around it that causes all the headaches.</p> <p>For instance, in the study I referred to earlier, one of the main issues with Britain\u2019s infrastructure for self-driving cars was poor mobile network coverage<em> </em>in many areas. How many people even realise that a self-driving car needs constant access to fast, reliable mobile data in order to communicate with other cars and traffic control? </p> <p>It also conjures up other problems. Imagine a British self-driving car being used for a trip to mainland Europe? Stopping every 2 minutes so the passenger can repeatedly sign up to the free wifi at Spanish coffee shops, because the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/tech-industry/brexit-european-roaming-3691966/\">return of roaming charges post-Brexit</a> mean you can\u2019t afford to use the mobile networks.</p> <p>Another big problem? Potholes! A <a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/pothole-measure-50mm-darren-twitter-reactions-cheshire-west-and-chester/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic\">classic feature of UK roads</a>. The fact that the most cutting-edge tech can be brought literally crashing to a halt by an absence of asphalt is surely very telling. And what about insurance, that other vital aspect of modern car ownership? Who\u2019s liable if your self-driving car hits another self-driving car? You, the car, the manufacturer? Car insurance is tricky and complex enough without opening this petrol can of worms.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, I wrote a Guardian article about jetpacks. A mode of transport that seemingly everyone wants and has been expecting (and angrily demanding of us scientists) for a good while, but which is still essentially nowhere in sight. I did my best to write about why jetpacks are not likely to be a household item any time soon. Four years later, I find myself writing about a situation which is essentially the exact opposite. This time, the subject is self-driving cars, a mode of transport that we\u2019re repeatedly told is just around the carefully manoeuvred corner. Indeed, the government is among the biggest advocates of driverless cars and has made some bold promises about their use. Yet Britain\u2019s population is possibly the least enthused of all about fully automated vehicles and it seems the country is seriously unprepared for their widespread use. These are the findings of a recent study, covered by The Times, into the state of play about autonomous vehicles in several countries. It seems that the British government talks a good game about self-driving cars, but our infrastructure is nowhere near ready for it and the public is the most sceptical. Far be it from me to suggest that the government has a tendency to insist that something will be brilliant, and rapidly pushing ahead with it without doing any basic preparation, and despite the fact that most people don\u2019t want it and may well be harmed by it, but this is one instance where the general public is almost surely in the right because most experts agree that this hype is exceedingly premature. Many reasons to be sceptical about the imminent arrival of driverless cars are covered by Dr Hannah Fry in her book (and this article), and in this 2016 piece by Martin Robbins. But one constant theme with all concerns about self-driving cars is that most of the issues exist \u201cbeyond\u201d the vehicle. Making a car that can move and control itself seems to be relatively straightforward, it\u2019s the world around it that causes all the headaches. For instance, in the study I referred to earlier, one of the main issues with Britain\u2019s infrastructure for self-driving cars was poor mobile network coverage in many areas. How many people even realise that a self-driving car needs constant access to fast, reliable mobile data in order to communicate with other cars and traffic control? It also conjures up other problems. Imagine a British self-driving car being used for a trip to mainland Europe? Stopping every 2 minutes so the passenger can repeatedly sign up to the free wifi at Spanish coffee shops, because the return of roaming charges post-Brexit mean you can\u2019t afford to use the mobile networks. Another big problem? Potholes! A classic feature of UK roads. The fact that the most cutting-edge tech can be brought literally crashing to a halt by an absence of asphalt is surely very telling. And what about insurance, that other vital aspect of modern car ownership? Who\u2019s liable if your self-driving car hits another self-driving car? You, the car, the manufacturer? Car insurance is tricky and complex enough without opening this petrol can of worms. But it would be an unavoidable issue, with the current laws and rules of the road. And of course, people are often the biggest issue. Even the most complex algorithm can\u2019t hope to match the chaotic, unpredictable, baffling behaviour of the average human. Or \u201cpedestrian\u201d, as they\u2019d be considered by autonomous vehicles. This is another key aspect that is often overlooked in the upbeat coverage of self-driving cars. Even if the technology was perfect (which it isn\u2019t, not even close), does that mean they\u2019d automatically be trusted by the people who\u2019d have to buy and use them to make them a viable prospect? Definitely not. Humans trusting machines is a big ask at the best of times. Numerous studies have shown that even for something relatively mundane, such as helping with a basic recognition test, we are very reluctant to implicitly trust something entirely synthetic. That\u2019s just not how we\u2019ve evolved, we\u2019ve evolved to trust other people with our own wellbeing and safety, not \u201ctools\u201d (the fact that other people are often less reliable than tools is another matter). For instance, how many times have you been on hold on the phone, dealing with the automated system, before yelling \u201cat last, a human!\u201d when put through to someone in a call centre? True, the rise of the virtual assistants may be changing that, but it\u2019s rare to surrender total control to such creations, particularly when your safety is a concern, as it would be in a car.

      "body": "<p>Shannon Gabriel has been suspended for the first four one-day internationals against England following the on-field altercation in St Lucia that prompted Joe Root to tell him \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay\u201d.</p> <p>The West Indies fast bowler accepted a charge of breaching the International Cricket Council\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 \u201cpersonal abuse of a player\u201d \u2013 and was fined 75% of his match fee, as well as earning three demerit points. The latter triggered his suspension due to previous marks on his disciplinary record from the past two years.</p> <p>The ICC, on announcing the verdict of the match referee, Jeff Crowe, on Wednesday, did not detail what Gabriel said to Root. This was also absent from the footage that circulated during the third Test and Gabriel is understood to have told Cricket West Indies that his words were not of a homophobic nature; he was, in fact, misheard.</p> <p>Gabriel was unable to say, however, that verbal abuse had not taken place during what was a hard-fought passage of play and so did not contest the charge that was brought by the on-field umpires, Kumar Dharmasena and Rod Tucker. It meant no hearing was required and Root, who has received widespread praise for his response at the time, was not therefore asked to give evidence or a statement.</p> <p>Root and Gabriel shook hands after England had wrapped up the consolation 232-run win that saw the series end 2-1 to West Indies. And in keeping with the generally amicable tenor of the three Tests, the two teams then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/windiescricket/status/1095734070066249728?s=20\" title=\"\">joined each other for drinks</a> in the dressing room after play and relations are said to remain good.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s suspension from one-day cricket did raise eyebrows, however, given he has not played the format for 14 months. On announcing their squad last week West Indies stated that the fast bowler was still part of their World Cup plans and would be called up for the final three matches after missing next week\u2019s opening two in Barbados for a period of scheduled rest.</p> <p>This situation changed on the day of his spat with Root, when the seamer Keemo Paul went down injured with a torn quad muscle in the morning session. West Indies told the ICC that, with Rovman Powell, an all-rounder, also a slight injury doubt, Gabriel was to be called up early but the switch had not yet been made public.</p> <p>Had Gabriel been banned for two Tests \u2013 the equivalent punishment for a one-format player \u2013 he would have been out until October, with West Indies due to play only a two-Test series against India in July before then.</p> <p>With the incident, or at least Root\u2019s words, picked up by the stump microphones and originally circulated online by a member of the TV audience in England, it has once again raised the subject of whether they should be turned up or down between deliveries.</p> <p>The ICC has been looking to crack down on behaviour following the acrimonious series between South Africa and Australia last year. The Pakistan captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, was banned for four ODIs last month under the anti-racism code after he called South Africa\u2019s Andile Phehlukwayo the Urdu word \u201c<em>kaale</em>\u201d, meaning \u201cblack\u201d, during a game. The evidence for this sanction came from audio picked up by the stump microphones.</p> <p>Speaking on Wednesday the England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, was adamant that the stump microphones should be switched off in international matches. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve said it once before, no, I\u2019m not in favour of it and I\u2019m not going to change my mind. If stump mics were around a few years ago, there would be some blokes seen as \u2018holier than thou\u2019 who would have been in trouble as well. [But] I think it should be down.</p> <p>\u201cI know there are people who think the opposite and it is good for the game but sometimes, in the heat of battle, things are said when guys, given a bit of time to sit down and think about it, would give themselves a bit of a kick up the backside.\u201d</p> <p>England\u2019s preparations for the forthcoming one-day series \u2013 the start of a white-ball only schedule that leads into the summer\u2019s World Cup in Britain \u2013 begin on Sunday with a 50-over warm-up against a University of West Indies Vice Chancellor\u2019s XI at the Three Ws Oval near Bridgetown.</p> <p>Jos Buttler, England\u2019s vice-captain, has been permitted to miss it for a period of rest but is expected to feature in the first ODI at the Kensington Oval on 20 February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyCricket/status/1095246700602712064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Don&#39;t use it as an insult.

      "bodyText": "Shannon Gabriel has been suspended for the first four one-day internationals against England following the on-field altercation in St Lucia that prompted Joe Root to tell him \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay\u201d. The West Indies fast bowler accepted a charge of breaching the International Cricket Council\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 \u201cpersonal abuse of a player\u201d \u2013 and was fined 75% of his match fee, as well as earning three demerit points. The latter triggered his suspension due to previous marks on his disciplinary record from the past two years. The ICC, on announcing the verdict of the match referee, Jeff Crowe, on Wednesday, did not detail what Gabriel said to Root. This was also absent from the footage that circulated during the third Test and Gabriel is understood to have told Cricket West Indies that his words were not of a homophobic nature; he was, in fact, misheard. Gabriel was unable to say, however, that verbal abuse had not taken place during what was a hard-fought passage of play and so did not contest the charge that was brought by the on-field umpires, Kumar Dharmasena and Rod Tucker. It meant no hearing was required and Root, who has received widespread praise for his response at the time, was not therefore asked to give evidence or a statement. Root and Gabriel shook hands after England had wrapped up the consolation 232-run win that saw the series end 2-1 to West Indies. And in keeping with the generally amicable tenor of the three Tests, the two teams then joined each other for drinks in the dressing room after play and relations are said to remain good. Gabriel\u2019s suspension from one-day cricket did raise eyebrows, however, given he has not played the format for 14 months. On announcing their squad last week West Indies stated that the fast bowler was still part of their World Cup plans and would be called up for the final three matches after missing next week\u2019s opening two in Barbados for a period of scheduled rest. This situation changed on the day of his spat with Root, when the seamer Keemo Paul went down injured with a torn quad muscle in the morning session. West Indies told the ICC that, with Rovman Powell, an all-rounder, also a slight injury doubt, Gabriel was to be called up early but the switch had not yet been made public. Had Gabriel been banned for two Tests \u2013 the equivalent punishment for a one-format player \u2013 he would have been out until October, with West Indies due to play only a two-Test series against India in July before then. With the incident, or at least Root\u2019s words, picked up by the stump microphones and originally circulated online by a member of the TV audience in England, it has once again raised the subject of whether they should be turned up or down between deliveries. The ICC has been looking to crack down on behaviour following the acrimonious series between South Africa and Australia last year. The Pakistan captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, was banned for four ODIs last month under the anti-racism code after he called South Africa\u2019s Andile Phehlukwayo the Urdu word \u201ckaale\u201d, meaning \u201cblack\u201d, during a game. The evidence for this sanction came from audio picked up by the stump microphones. Speaking on Wednesday the England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, was adamant that the stump microphones should be switched off in international matches. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve said it once before, no, I\u2019m not in favour of it and I\u2019m not going to change my mind. If stump mics were around a few years ago, there would be some blokes seen as \u2018holier than thou\u2019 who would have been in trouble as well. [But] I think it should be down. \u201cI know there are people who think the opposite and it is good for the game but sometimes, in the heat of battle, things are said when guys, given a bit of time to sit down and think about it, would give themselves a bit of a kick up the backside.\u201d England\u2019s preparations for the forthcoming one-day series \u2013 the start of a white-ball only schedule that leads into the summer\u2019s World Cup in Britain \u2013 begin on Sunday with a 50-over warm-up against a University of West Indies Vice Chancellor\u2019s XI at the Three Ws Oval near Bridgetown. Jos Buttler, England\u2019s vice-captain, has been permitted to miss it for a period of rest but is expected to feature in the first ODI at the Kensington Oval on 20 February.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. The cost of living has eased on both sides of the Atlantic, thanks to recent falls in energy costs. In the UK, inflation hit a two-year low of 1.8% in January, below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. A recent cap on energy bills, and falling clothing costs, were the prime factors. The fall means real incomes in Britain are continuing to rise (after a long trough when wages didn\u2019t keep pace with prices). Economists predicted that inflation could remain subdued, unless a hard Brexit causes sterling to plunge. In America, inflation is rising at a 19-month low of just 1.6%. Drivers benefited from cheaper gasoline, with consumer prices unchanged in January. Stock markets are rallying, after president Trump hinted that the deadline for a US-China trade deal could be extended. Wall Street has just opened higher, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has reached a four-month high. But there\u2019s fresh tensions in the eurozone, as Spain\u2019s parliament votes down its 2019 budget - making an early general election likely. Eurozone factories are struggling too, with output plunging over 4% year-on-year in December. You probably don\u2019t need another reason to worry about Brexit. But just in case.... The government\u2019s push to roll over EU trade deals from which the UK currently benefits has yielded agreements covering only \u00a316bn of the near-\u00a3117bn of British trade with the countries involved. Despite frenetic efforts by ministers to ensure the continuity of international trade after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has so far only managed to secure deals with seven of the 69 countries that the UK currently trades with under preferential EU free trade agreements, which will end after Brexit. Here\u2019s an interesting chart, showing how inflation is sizzling in San Francisco, but rather weaker in Washington: Nick Kilbey, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, says America\u2019s central bank can afford leave interest rates unchanged for longer - as inflation is looking subdued. He writes: Whilst another round of trade talks between the US and China are keeping investors on edge this week, US Inflation provided a distraction as it dropped to 1.6%, the smallest print since June 2017, with lower energy costs the main culprit once again. So far Economic growth in the US has moderated only marginally and the economy remains robust, despite the ongoing dispute with China. However, with broader inflation at 1.6%, it certainly underscores the Fed\u2019s \u201cwait and see\u201d stance and their ability to remain patient. Capital Economics has dug into the CPI figures, and explains how cheaper energy is helping Americans handle the cost of living. Gasoline prices fell by 5.5% month-on-month in January, the third consecutive monthly decline of around that magnitude. However, piped natural gas prices fell by only 0.3% m/m, which barely began to reverse the 5.1% m/m spike in December. With natural gas prices falling sharply, CPI piped gas will drop more markedly in February At just 1.6%, US inflation is now at a 19-month low. More reaction to the US inflation figures: Newsflash: inflation has also fallen in America...and again, cheaper energy can take some credit. US consumer prices were unchanged month-on-month in January. That pulls the annual rate of CPI inflation down to 1.6%, from 1.9% in December. That brings some relief to US households, especially those who missed out on pay cheques during the government shutdown. It could also take some pressure off the Federal Reserve, as it wonders whether to keep raising interest rates. However, core inflation (stripping out energy and food costs), rose by 0.2% in the month and 2.2% year-on-year. Here\u2019s our news story about the impact that Brexit is having on the construction industry: Wall Street is expected to open higher in two hours time, as trade deal optimism continues to push shares up. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to gain 80 points, or 0.3%, after President Donald Trump said he may let a China trade-deal deadline \u201cslide\u201d if the two sides were making enough progress. Newsflash: There\u2019s drama in Spain, where the parliament has just voted down the government\u2019s 2019 budget. That\u2019s a blow to Spain\u2019s socialist government, who have been blocked by an alliance of rightwing parties and Catalan secessionists. It could trigger early elections, bringing more uncertainty to the euro area. This has knocked shares in Madrid, a little, and pushed up Spanish borrowing costs slightly. My colleague Sam Jones explains: Government and PSOE party sources said the snap election date had not been set, although 14 April was most likely, followed by 28 April because [PM Pedro] S\u00e1nchez wants a ballot as soon as possible to mobilise left-leaning voters against the threat of the right coming to power. The Socialists are ahead in opinion polls \u2013 which show them on around 30% of voting intentions \u2013 but the two main right-of-centre parties together poll at more than 30%. In Spain\u2019s most populous region of Andaluc\u00eda they unseated the socialists last year with the help of the far-right party Vox. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is closing in on a new four-month high. The blue-chip index is now up 50 points at 7184, only a few points away from last week\u2019s peak. Top risers include packaging firm DS Smith (+4.6%), mining group Antofagasta (+3%) and jet engine maker Rolls-Royce (+2.8%) . This chart, from the inflation report, shows how the energy price cap kicked in, pulling the cost of living down; Thomas Wells, manager of the Smith &amp; Williamson Global Inflation-Linked Bond Fund, fears a disorderly Brexit would send inflation soaring again: He says: \u201cWith the UK mired in a major political crisis, we are still conscious that a \u2018crash out\u2019 Brexit would deliver a short-term inflation shock.\u201d That shock could include a tumbling currency, making imports pricier, and problems at the ports - creating supply shortages. That\u2019s a recipe for higher prices. Nice emoji work here The slump in eurozone factory output shows European manufacturers are being hit by a swath of problems - at home and abroad. Bert Colijn of ING (who may have been enjoying a recent BBC hit drama) explains: The eurozone industrial sector is plagued with more drama than an average episode of The Bodyguard. Trade wars, emission standard related production delays, yellow vest movements and slowdowns in emerging markets have all played a part in the weakening of production over recent months, causing two quarters of declining production. While the headline figure was much worse than anticipated, durable goods production increased in December and intermediate goods production was flat after a sharp decline in November. Out of the large economies, both Germany and France saw production increase, while Spain, Italy and the Netherlands contributed to the decline. The rollercoaster ride for industry is far from over as deadlines on the China-US trade dispute and Brexit are coming closer. Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on the drop in UK inflation: One month\u2019s decent inflation figures doesn\u2019t make up for 10 years of austerity.... Good news for cash-conscious families: Stephen Clarke of Resolution Foundation thinks inflation will keep falling: Yikes! Eurozone factories have just suffered their worst month since the financial crisis. Industrial production across the eurozone shrank by 0.9% in December, new figures show. That means output was a shocking 4.2% lower than a year before. This will reinforce fears that the eurozone economy is weakening, and could face a tough 2019. UK house price inflation has also slowed, to a five year low. Average prices rose by 2.5% year-on-year in December, the ONS reports, down from 2.7% in November. Prices continued to fall in London, down 0.6% compared with a year ago. These UK inflation figure are a real boost to household incomes. They could help people save a bit more, says Kate Smith, Head of Pensions at Aegon: \u201cInflation fell for the third month in a row to 1.8% in January, the lowest level since January 2017, bringing the 12-month rate finally below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. With the latest wage growth figures showing a positive trend, the gap between earnings and inflation continues to widen and households will feel an ease in the cost of living. In the period of real wage growth, individuals should find themselves in a strong financial position to set out financial goals and those who can afford to save any additional income should be encouraged to do so. Taking a glass-half-empty approach, weak inflation can also be a sign that economic activity is cooling. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: \u201cDespite the UK labour market remaining tight, political and economic uncertainty have held prices down. With oil prices low on the back of weaker global demand and air fares tumbling, inflation has kept close to the Bank of England\u2019s target. \u201cThe sluggish UK economy is symptomatic of the wider picture. Central banks across the globe have taken their foot off the stimulus pedal and we are now seeing the results. With idiosyncratic issues in both the US and Europe slowing growth, Brexit affecting the UK, trade disputes, and a Chinese slowdown, we\u2019re indisputably in a mid-cycle slowdown. A global recession seems a far flung prospect, however in the UK Carney must be flexible and data-driven, putting decisive monetary policy on the back burner until greater political and economic clarity emerges.\u201d Irony of the day: January\u2019s inflation report shows that the energy price cap helped UK households... just a week after regulators agreed to LIFT the cap because wholesale prices have risen. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the unexpectedly large drop in UK inflation: Falling inflation means that real wages are rising. Average basic pay in the UK rose by 3.3% per year in the quarter to November (the most recent data available). So if inflation is just 1.8%, that means real earnings are growing by roughly 1.5% per year. Here\u2019s the Office for National Statistics\u2019 explanation for how cheaper energy has pulled inflation down over the last year The largest downward contribution to the change in the CPIH 12-month rate came from housing and household services, where gas and electricity prices fell, between December 2018 and January 2019, by 8.5% and 4.9%, respectively. The downward movement partially reflected the response from energy providers to Ofgem\u2019s January energy price cap which came into effect from 1 January 2019. Clothing and footwear price have fallen over the last 12 months, today\u2019s inflation report shows. That\u2019s a sign that struggling retailers have been slashing prices in an effort to lure shoppers. As you can see, food, alcohol, housing and transport all became more expensive other the last year - but by less than in the previous 12 months. Cheaper energy costs helped to pull Britain\u2019s inflation rate down to just 1.8% last month, below the Bank of England\u2019s target. Prices of electricity, gas and other fuels fell between December 2018 and January 2019 compared with price rises the same time a year ago. These downward effects were partially offset by air fares, with prices falling between December 2018 and January 2019 by less than a year ago. Newsflash: UK inflation has hit a two-year low of 1.8% in January, bringing some relief to households. That\u2019s lower than expected, and down from 2.1% in December. More to follow.... UK furniture and homeware group Dunelm is also getting ready for Brexit. It told the City this morning that it has been stockpiling some popular items, in case of a no-deal crisis. The business imports less than 1% of its goods from EU countries. However, we have identified some risks arising from potential disruption at \u2018deep-sea\u2019 ports in the period following exit. Actions have been taken within the business and throughout our supply chain to mitigate these risks, such as purchasing incremental stock of some best-selling lines and securing additional supply chain capacity. Dunelm (like Galliford Try earlier) is also hedged against a sudden plunge in the value of the pound. Sensible precautions, but Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, fears they will eat into profitability. European stock markets are all showing gains, following president\u2019s Trump\u2019s hint that he might give China more time to reach a trade deal. UK FTSE 100: up 33 points or nearly 0.5% at 7,166 Germany\u2019s DAX: up 55 points or 0.5% at 11,181 French CAC: up 17 points or 0.35% at 5,074 UK housebuilder Galliford Try has added its voice to the chorus urging MPs to avoid a no-deal Brexit. In its latest financial results, the company says crashing out of the EU would badly hurt the economy: We consider that a controlled departure under the terms of a withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU will have no significant direct impact, with supply chains and EU and other overseas labour able to adjust over time as detailed future arrangements become clear. If the UK leaves without a deal, the biggest impact we foresee is the effect on our markets, and on Linden Homes market in particular, of a potential severe decline in consumer confidence and economic activity in general Galliford Try adds that it has taken steps to protect its business against shortages of critical materials and products, but it\u2019s \u201cimpractical to try to insulate our business entirely\u201d. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has opened 25 points higher at 7,157. That takes it closer to last week\u2019s four-month high. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management says hopes of a US-China trade deal are bubbling, especially following Donald Trump\u2019s comments. Equity market investors can practically taste the beautiful piece of chocolate cake served on a Mar a Lago plate. Enthusiasm about the prospect of a US-China trade deal led equities to rally. The hope is that not only will there be no new taxes, but some of the existing taxes may be reversed. Sterling is bobbing around the $1.29 mark against the US dollar this morning, roughly where it ended yesterday. Today\u2019s inflation data could move the currency pair, though. Asian markets reacted positively to Donald Trump\u2019s hint, hitting their highest levels in four months. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index has surged by 2%, as optimism builds that new tariffs can be avoided. Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained +1.34%, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 1.1%. Senior US officials, including treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, are due to hold high-level trade talks in Beijing tomorrow. So we could be close to a breakthrough. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says Trump\u2019s suggestion of letting the March 1st tariff deadline \u201cslide\u201d is moving markets. US negotiators are having high-level meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing this week, and flexibility on the deadline would reduce the pressure for an immediate breakthrough. Any delay to higher tariffs would be positive for markets, so the news was greeted by an equity rally, with cyclical and trade-dependent stocks outperforming. Overnight, Donald Trump has hinted that he could extend the deadline to reach a trade deal with China. The US president revealed that the existing plan - for a trade deal by March 1st - could be rejigged, if Washington and Beijing are making progress. Trump told a cabinet meeting that: \u201cIf we\u2019re close to a deal where we think we can make a real deal and it\u2019s going to get done, I could see myself letting that slide for a little while. \u201cBut generally speaking, I\u2019m not inclined to do that.\u201d If a deal isn\u2019t reached, America will hike the tariff on around $200bn of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, which could have a serious chilling effect on trade. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A double-dose of cost-of-living data should keep investors on their toes this morning, as optimism over a trade war deal continues to build. Inflation in the UK (due at 9.30am) is expected to fall from 2.1% per year to 2%. That would give the Bank of England the rare treat of actually hitting its consumer price index target - if only for one month. In normal times, CPI would be a good benchmark for future interest rate rises, and thus the value of the pound. But right now Brexit development - and the latest careless talk in Brussels bars - probably has a bigger impact. US inflation is also expected to ease. Cheaper energy could pull the US annual CPI rate down to just 1.5% or 1.6% today, from 1.9% in December. But, any sign of inflationary pressures bubbling under the surface will alarm America\u2019s central bankers at the Federal Reserve, as they wonder whether to raise interest rates again. As Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s Elsa Lignos explains, The US headline inflation dynamic is going to be weak in the first half of 2019 \u2013 but that is all down to energy prices. Underlying that, core inflation should actually be pretty firm (our economists note demand is strong, evidenced by strong chain-store sales and very healthy income growth). The Fed has explicitly said it can wait as long as inflation is under control \u2013 so stronger inflation supports a less dovish outlook and stronger US dollar. We also get new UK house price figures, and a healthcheck on the eurozone\u2019s factories. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK consumer price index for January 9.30am GMT: UK house price data for December 10am GMT: Eurozone industrial production for December 1.30pm GMT: US consumer price index for January",

      "body": "<p>For the last decade, Marina \u2013 formerly Marina and the Diamonds \u2013 has sat on the precarious fence between mainstream and underground pop: someone with that curious, 21st-century kind of fame where you can rack up tens of millions of streams without ever having a Top 10 single. The Welsh native\u2019s first solo work in four years, Handmade Heaven, was released last Friday \u2013 can it finally be the song to give her universal appeal?</p> <p>Peter Robinson, editor of the influential pop music site Popjustice, says Marina excels in a particular manner: while \u201ccertain music comes in and out of fashion, it\u2019s a rare artist who does exactly what they want to a high standard\u201d. He describes her as \u201cone of the top three British artists \u2013 it\u2019s a shame we don\u2019t cherish her more.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiOGlYjKgX8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GiOGlYjKgX8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>With every album Marina, now 33, has offered a different persona, focus and tone, attracting and dismaying fans and critics with each change. Her first album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/18/marina-and-the-diamonds-cd-review\">The Family Jewels</a>, in 2010, was written mainly by her \u2013 rough around the edges but unapologetically honest and autobiographical. It had a range of styles, from two ethereal piano-driven tracks, Obsessions and I\u2019m Not a Robot, which address OCD tendencies and social isolation, to songs with poppier aspirations discussing wider societal issues. Take a look at the song Girls: \u201cGirls are not meant to fight dirty / Never look a day past 30 / I\u2019ll never bend over and curtsey for you\u201d: assertive, sarcastic lyrics backed by spine-chilling synthesisers and haunting laughter.</p> <p>This strikingly stylised voice contrasted starkly against the tedious ballad singers who had begun dominating the charts, such as Adele and Sam Smith. The album earned her second place in BBC\u2019s Sound of 2010 after Ellie Goulding, and granted Marina her most successful single to date, Hollywood, peaking at No 12.</p> <p>Marina\u2019s lyrics made it very clear that from the beginning, she had even greater aspirations. In the opener, Are You Satisfied?, she sings: \u201cThey say I am a control freak / Driven by a greed to succeed\u201d, a message she repeats \u2013 perhaps ironically \u2013 on Oh No: \u201cDon\u2019t do love, don\u2019t do friends / I\u2019m only after success\u201d.</p> <p>She later said she held out for six months before finally accepting all the commercial help her record company offered her on next album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/26/marina-diamonds-electra-heart-review\">Electra Heart</a> \u2013 from big pop producers such as Dr Luke (Katy Perry), Stargate (Rihanna) and Shellback. She developed a new, theatrical persona called Electra, complete with a blond wig, long eyelashes and pink bows to comment on female archetypes. In Primadonna, Electra sings in a childlike voice: \u201cWould you do anything for me / Buy a big diamond ring for me\u201d. In Bubblegum Bitch, she\u2019s more assertive: \u201cQueentex, latex, I\u2019m your wondermaid / Life gave me some lemons so I made some lemonade / Soda pop, soda pop, baby, here I come / Straight to No 1\u201d. Which is exactly where the album went. The trouble was that Marina, as she later said, was so uncomfortable with the album that \u201cwhen I look at [Electra Heart], I feel like it\u2019s somebody else.\u201d</p> <p>It just didn\u2019t suit her: Lana Del Rey could pull off the tragic, toxic heroine much more effectively, combining nostalgic glamour with 20th-century Americana in a singular focused image. Marina\u2019s persona \u2013 self-aggrandising yet coquettish \u2013 complicated the mix; trying to portray a female character who is defined by the male gaze made any self-identification confusing. She said: \u201cI felt like I was being pushed into it\u201d, and told the Oxford Union: \u201cI hated how there was an expectation for your individuality to be ironed out in order to succeed \u2026 I was working in the wrong place.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/30/marina-and-the-diamonds-interview-new-album-froot\">Marina and the Diamonds: \u2018I killed Electra Heart with sleeping pills\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How refreshing it was, then, when she returned in 2015 to write all the tracks for her third album Froot, herself, and with a more mature and self-aware approach. Some of the song names alone \u2013 Happy, Forget and Can\u2019t Pin Me Down \u2013 show her new attitude. In Gold, she even addressed how misperceived she was in the pop industry: \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to understand who you are / It doesn\u2019t matter as long as you are a star.\u201d</p> <p>Rolling Stone magazine criticised her \u201csuperfluous songs and cringey lyrics\u201d and interpreted her lyrical commentary on Savages as \u201cmisanthropic\u201d and Better Than That as \u201cslut-shaming\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t all bad. As Caroline Sullivan wrote in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/19/marina-and-the-diamonds-froot-review\">her review for the Guardian</a>: \u201cIf you allow yourself to be swept into her world, it\u2019s an intriguing place\u201d, even though \u201cthis has yielded a record of intense highs and lows, and a range of styles that don\u2019t always join up well.\u201d Commercially, it was her lowest performing album in the UK, although it went to No 8 in the US.</p> <p>While still lacking cohesion \u2013 and a killer hit \u2013 Froot was the work of a woman brimming with confidence. This has continued, as she changed her name in late 2018 from Marina and the Diamonds to just Marina. This self-assertion was clear even in the song Hollywood from her first album, whose lyrics relayed a joking exchange: \u201cOh my god, you look just like Shakira / No no, you\u2019re Catherine Zeta / Actually, my name\u2019s Marina.\u201d After years of being pulled between different versions of herself, the name change suggests she\u2019s now more focused than ever.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlznpxNGFGQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hlznpxNGFGQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That\u2019s not to say she is against collaboration. Despite saying in a 2015 BBC article that \u201cco-writing is killing pop music \u2026 if you listen to lyrics on any radio station, you don\u2019t find anyone talking about anything deep or provocative\u201d, she has since featured on two of Clean Bandit\u2019s songs. Baby was released last November and peaked at No 15. Disappointingly, it was a generic tale of the one who got away.</p> <p>So does Handmade Heaven suggest an album where she can finally blend popularity with meaning? The song evokes the very frustration she has felt throughout her career: \u201cI carry along a feel of unease / I want to belong like the birds in the trees\u201d, she sings, before finding solace in the handmade heaven of the title: a place she can write her own version of paradise.</p> <p>Whether other people will ever want to enter it is still open to debate, but her sharply insightful worldview is rare in pop and deserves to be heard. Having disposed of all the personae to leave simply Marina, now is the perfect time for her to show her true potential with her next album in April. As Peter Robinson says, \u201cif she doesn\u2019t succeed with this, that\u2019s a problem with pop culture \u2013 not a problem with Marina.\u201d</p>",

In Gold, she even addressed how misperceived she was in the pop industry: \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to understand who you are / It doesn\u2019t matter as long as you are a star.\u201d Rolling Stone magazine criticised her \u201csuperfluous songs and cringey lyrics\u201d and interpreted her lyrical commentary on Savages as \u201cmisanthropic\u201d and Better Than That as \u201cslut-shaming\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t all bad. As Caroline Sullivan wrote in her review for the Guardian: \u201cIf you allow yourself to be swept into her world, it\u2019s an intriguing place\u201d, even though \u201cthis has yielded a record of intense highs and lows, and a range of styles that don\u2019t always join up well.\u201d Commercially, it was her lowest performing album in the UK, although it went to No 8 in the US. While still lacking cohesion \u2013 and a killer hit \u2013 Froot was the work of a woman brimming with confidence. This has continued, as she changed her name in late 2018 from Marina and the Diamonds to just Marina. This self-assertion was clear even in the song Hollywood from her first album, whose lyrics relayed a joking exchange: \u201cOh my god, you look just like Shakira / No no, you\u2019re Catherine Zeta / Actually, my name\u2019s Marina.\u201d After years of being pulled between different versions of herself, the name change suggests she\u2019s now more focused than ever. That\u2019s not to say she is against collaboration. Despite saying in a 2015 BBC article that \u201cco-writing is killing pop music \u2026 if you listen to lyrics on any radio station, you don\u2019t find anyone talking about anything deep or provocative\u201d, she has since featured on two of Clean Bandit\u2019s songs. Baby was released last November and peaked at No 15. Disappointingly, it was a generic tale of the one who got away. So does Handmade Heaven suggest an album where she can finally blend popularity with meaning? The song evokes the very frustration she has felt throughout her career: \u201cI carry along a feel of unease / I want to belong like the birds in the trees\u201d, she sings, before finding solace in the handmade heaven of the title: a place she can write her own version of paradise. Whether other people will ever want to enter it is still open to debate, but her sharply insightful worldview is rare in pop and deserves to be heard. Having disposed of all the personae to leave simply Marina, now is the perfect time for her to show her true potential with her next album in April. As Peter Robinson says, \u201cif she doesn\u2019t succeed with this, that\u2019s a problem with pop culture \u2013 not a problem with Marina.\u201d",

It depicts a dysfunctional society and guilt-ridden family in miniature, and demonstrates the shifting power dynamics of a cult, the craziness embedded in the minds of child soldiers, the resentments nursed in a military unit without a supervising commanding officer, and the very real danger of eating shrooms grown in cowshit.</p> <p>The Monos are a unit of teenage guerrilla bandits, operating in a country very similar to Colombia or Bolivia \u2014 and apparently named after the Mono Grande, the mythical giant monkey for centuries rumoured to exist somewhere in South America. They are initially shown in their up-country mountainous retreat where they have little to do but hang out, await orders on the radio, look after a cow that has been given to them for milk (good for their young bones and teeth) and see to their American hostage, an engineer who is being held captive separately from her small child. They are permitted and even encouraged to develop sexual relationships among themselves, and have developed weird rituals and traditions. When one of them has a birthday, there is a version of the bumps, except it\u2019s sexualised thrashing with a belt. Everyone joins in and their hostage is also sportingly allowed a go.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3nJfr8GI_Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B3nJfr8GI_Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But what they most like doing is firing their semi-automatics, an excitement simply impossible to resist, and this, inevitably, leads to disaster. (I was reminded of something PJ O\u2019Rourke wrote about hearing semi-automatic fire for the first time at close quarters: the \u201cchemical craziness\u201d it triggers in the pit of your stomach \u2013 something that is horrible for most, but for some could be addictive.) The Monos are required to move from the eerie aloneness of the mountain down into the jungle, and when the hostage shows signs of wanting to escape, the leader has a spasm of rage, trashes the radio that theoretically connects them to a larger command structure and the entire group effectively goes rogue \u2013 even more rogue than it was in the first place.</p> <p>It is not clear if they are now just breaking the rules in pursuit of some definite objective, or submitting to some collective orgiastic breakdown. There is no Kurtz, no progressive loosening of the unstable bonds of civilised restraints; it\u2019s just an intensification of the chaos which was there all along.</p> <p>Monos is not concerned just to show a static situation deteriorating. There is a driving narrative impulse: tense things happen. And they are made even tenser by the vivid, disturbing musical score from Mica Levi, which periodically rolls in timpani like exclamations of thunder.</p> <p>Jasper Wolf\u2019s cinematography captures the transcendent beauty of the landscape, the density and hostile lushness of the undergrowth and the banks of cloud with us floating overhead, as if monitoring the characters\u2019 habitat in some dreamily removed state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ca847a605a111da0f47187740a6a06999b4a0b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ca847a605a111da0f47187740a6a06999b4a0b2/0_0_2550_1435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Transcendent beauty \u2026 Monos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transcendent beauty \u2026 Monos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is so intriguing about Monos is that it is simply about the group, collectively, with no member more important than any other. Individuals do emerge, yet it is never clear who is evolving as the most significant. Landes\u2019s film refuses the final girl trope or indeed the final boy trope. And of course it is not simply about child soldiers, but rather soldiers generally, although it is conceivable that their parodic littleness offers a faint pun on Conrad\u2019s Mr Kurtz: sounds like <em>kurz</em>, or short.</p> <p>In some ways, Monos is a ritual heading to disaster, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/an-apocalyptic-cult-900-dead-remembering-the-jonestown-massacre-40-years-on\">a Jim Jones ceremonial</a> in the jungle clearing, or alternatively a dream, a hallucination, one that we are having about them, or they are having about themselves: a delirium brought on by altitude sickness or hunger or post-traumatic stress disorder. And Landes withholds from us any sense of when precisely this is supposed to be happening: now, or in some postapocalyptic future or in the past, as if his children are a version of the mythic Japanese soldier in the jungle unaware the war is over.</p> <p>Perhaps it is an allegory about his homeland, Colombia, a country awakening as if from an endless dream of violence but with an uneasy suspicion that the seedlings of new violence are always there. An unforgettable immersion in terror.</p> <p>\u2022Monos is released in the UK on 25 October</p>",

When one of them has a birthday, there is a version of the bumps, except it\u2019s sexualised thrashing with a belt. Everyone joins in and their hostage is also sportingly allowed a go. But what they most like doing is firing their semi-automatics, an excitement simply impossible to resist, and this, inevitably, leads to disaster. (I was reminded of something PJ O\u2019Rourke wrote about hearing semi-automatic fire for the first time at close quarters: the \u201cchemical craziness\u201d it triggers in the pit of your stomach \u2013 something that is horrible for most, but for some could be addictive.) The Monos are required to move from the eerie aloneness of the mountain down into the jungle, and when the hostage shows signs of wanting to escape, the leader has a spasm of rage, trashes the radio that theoretically connects them to a larger command structure and the entire group effectively goes rogue \u2013 even more rogue than it was in the first place. It is not clear if they are now just breaking the rules in pursuit of some definite objective, or submitting to some collective orgiastic breakdown. There is no Kurtz, no progressive loosening of the unstable bonds of civilised restraints; it\u2019s just an intensification of the chaos which was there all along. Monos is not concerned just to show a static situation deteriorating. There is a driving narrative impulse: tense things happen. And they are made even tenser by the vivid, disturbing musical score from Mica Levi, which periodically rolls in timpani like exclamations of thunder. Jasper Wolf\u2019s cinematography captures the transcendent beauty of the landscape, the density and hostile lushness of the undergrowth and the banks of cloud with us floating overhead, as if monitoring the characters\u2019 habitat in some dreamily removed state. What is so intriguing about Monos is that it is simply about the group, collectively, with no member more important than any other. Individuals do emerge, yet it is never clear who is evolving as the most significant. Landes\u2019s film refuses the final girl trope or indeed the final boy trope. And of course it is not simply about child soldiers, but rather soldiers generally, although it is conceivable that their parodic littleness offers a faint pun on Conrad\u2019s Mr Kurtz: sounds like kurz, or short. In some ways, Monos is a ritual heading to disaster, like a Jim Jones ceremonial in the jungle clearing, or alternatively a dream, a hallucination, one that we are having about them, or they are having about themselves: a delirium brought on by altitude sickness or hunger or post-traumatic stress disorder. And Landes withholds from us any sense of when precisely this is supposed to be happening: now, or in some postapocalyptic future or in the past, as if his children are a version of the mythic Japanese soldier in the jungle unaware the war is over. Perhaps it is an allegory about his homeland, Colombia, a country awakening as if from an endless dream of violence but with an uneasy suspicion that the seedlings of new violence are always there. An unforgettable immersion in terror. \u2022Monos is released in the UK on 25 October",

Toni McLachlan has been named by the accused, who cannot be identified, for legal reasons, and who denies abducting, raping and murdering the child last July on the Isle of Bute, in a special defence as the person responsible for the killing. McLachlan told the high court in Glasgow that she did not have anything to do with the murder and that she had loved the child to bits. Alesha, from Airdrie in Lanarkshire, was found dead in the grounds of a disused hotel near her grandparents\u2019 seafront home, close to the ferry port of Rothesay, where she had arrived a few days previously to spend a three-week summer break. McLachlan told the prosecutor, Iain McSporran QC, that she had become aware that the 16-year-old accused was saying that she murdered Alesha on Monday, when the trial began. Asked by McSporran how she felt about the accusations, which were put to her on the third morning of the trial, including the allegation that she smeared the contents of a used condom on to Alesha\u2019s body to incriminate the accused, she replied: \u201cHorrible\u201d. \u201cBut she knew that I loved her and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to keep in my head.

Pressed on the \u201cappalling\u201d nature of the injuries inflicted on Alesha, McLachlan broke down and again insisted that she had nothing to do with the killing. The court heard on Tuesday that Alesha\u2019s grandmother, Angela King, had noticed she was missing early in the morning of 2 July last year, and posted an appeal for help on Facebook, prompting a frantic search by locals on the island. A member of the public found Alesha\u2019s body approximately half a mile away at about 9am. Under lengthy cross-examination, McLachlan, 18, repeatedly answered \u201cno\u201d as Brian McConnachie QC for the defence laid out a scenario that involved her previously having a sexual relationship with the accused, and having sexual intercourse with him again on the night of Alesha\u2019s disappearance. She further denied that she had kept the condom from that liaison and used it to plant evidence on Alesha, having taken the child from the flat herself to nearby woodland, where she murdered her. Alesha\u2019s father, Robert MacPhail, admitted on Tuesday that he had regularly sold cannabis to the accused, explaining that the defendant would message him via Facebook and the drugs would usually be handed over at the bus shelter opposite his parents\u2019 flat. McLachlan told the court on Wednesday that she was not seriously worried by the girl\u2019s disappearance at first: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it, but I didn\u2019t think anything bad because I know Rothesay is a safe place.

The court later heard that the police had initially interviewed the accused as a witness, after his mother informed them that he had left the family home in the early hours of the day that Alesha disappeared. Describing the teenager\u2019s behaviour as \u201cvery cooperative\u201d, detective constable Gavin McKellar told McSporran that the accused had provided a detailed account of his movements during the night and early morning as he walked around the local area trying to buy cannabis, but did not mention any interaction with Toni McLachlan.

      "body": "<p>Italy\u2019s Sanremo Music Festival, the model for everything from Eurovision to The X-Factor, is one of the oldest and most prestigious of its kind. On Saturday evening 26-year-old Alessandro Mahmoud, who goes by the stage name Mahmood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/italian-egyptian-mahmood-singers-victory-angers-matteo-salvini\" title=\"\">won the 69th edition of the festival</a> with his song Soldi (Money). But this was no ordinary win. This win was about much more than music \u2013 it was political and important.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/italian-egyptian-mahmood-singers-victory-angers-matteo-salvini\">Italian-Egyptian singer's victory angers Matteo Salvini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mahmood was born in Milan to an Italian mother and an Egyptian father. His winning song contains Arabic, and references Ramadan. He has criticised discrimination against gay men in Italy and Egypt. The singer embodies much of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/24/matteo-salvini-italy-far-right-interior-minister\" title=\"\">Matteo Salvini</a> and other far-right figures in Italy would love to erase from their notion of traditional \u201cItalian\u201d identity: the white, Christian, heterosexual, \u201cnorthern\u201d model from which Salvini\u2019s party, the League, first took its name.</p> <p>During Sanremo\u2019s final Salvini, leader of the League and the country\u2019s interior minister, targeted Mahmood on Twitter, not only questioning the quality of his song but appearing to question <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matteosalvinimi/status/1094394837468696578\" title=\"\">if it was really Italian at all</a>.</p> <p>Salvini\u2019s preferred performer, Ultimo, a singer from Rome, had claimed 46.5% of votes in the final round compared with a mere 14.1% for Mahmood. However, the voting system for Sanremo \u2013 like that for its offspring, Eurovision \u2013 is not based solely on public opinion. In the three final rounds the public vote counts for 50% of the final verdict, while a combination of music journalists and a selected jury stands for the other 50%. Mahmood went on to win the competition.</p> <p>Drama naturally ensued. Mahmood had defeated two popular favourites: Il Volo, the operatic pop group who represented Italy in 2015\u2019s Eurovision with their hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAZ-gT0Ip-0\" title=\"\">Grande Amore</a>; and Ultimo, a young, white, heterosexual selfie-star who chimed with Salvini\u2019s own social media obsession.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"466e230df198567eb61d19192f005d9681d30b55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/466e230df198567eb61d19192f005d9681d30b55/0_98_2300_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Italian singer Ultimo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The singer Ultimo openly insulted Mahmood and journalists in the post-show press conference.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In effect, the press and the jury voted against Salvini, and by doing so they opened themselves up to criticism. Some Italians felt outrage at learning that their votes had been essentially overturned \u2013 though this is not the first time the system has worked in this way. Ultimo, meanwhile, took to Instagram to condemn the voting process of the festival.</p> <p>His stance, echoing Donald Trump, was to cast the journalists and experts as the bad guys. Openly insulting Mahmood and journalists in the post-show press conference, Ultimo goaded: \u201cYou have this week to feel important.\u201d The situation rapidly escalated: \u201cHere is a mirror of the country,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lastampa.it/2019/02/11/spettacoli/salvini-non-c-lho-con-mahmood-contesto-linutile-giuria-donore-E5fWbVnv4NJQpRzdHPxWHM/premium.html\" title=\"\">Salvini declared</a>, \u201cthe opposition between people and elites.\u201d</p> <p>For Salvini, Mahmood is simply a pawn in a leftist agenda \u2013 the idea that his music might actually be good is apparently incomprehensible.</p> <p>The Sanremo system aims to create the perfect mix, balancing the wisdom of experts with popular taste.

      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s Sanremo Music Festival, the model for everything from Eurovision to The X-Factor, is one of the oldest and most prestigious of its kind. On Saturday evening 26-year-old Alessandro Mahmoud, who goes by the stage name Mahmood, won the 69th edition of the festival with his song Soldi (Money). But this was no ordinary win. This win was about much more than music \u2013 it was political and important. Mahmood was born in Milan to an Italian mother and an Egyptian father. His winning song contains Arabic, and references Ramadan. He has criticised discrimination against gay men in Italy and Egypt. The singer embodies much of what Matteo Salvini and other far-right figures in Italy would love to erase from their notion of traditional \u201cItalian\u201d identity: the white, Christian, heterosexual, \u201cnorthern\u201d model from which Salvini\u2019s party, the League, first took its name. During Sanremo\u2019s final Salvini, leader of the League and the country\u2019s interior minister, targeted Mahmood on Twitter, not only questioning the quality of his song but appearing to question if it was really Italian at all. Salvini\u2019s preferred performer, Ultimo, a singer from Rome, had claimed 46.5% of votes in the final round compared with a mere 14.1% for Mahmood. However, the voting system for Sanremo \u2013 like that for its offspring, Eurovision \u2013 is not based solely on public opinion. In the three final rounds the public vote counts for 50% of the final verdict, while a combination of music journalists and a selected jury stands for the other 50%. Mahmood went on to win the competition. Drama naturally ensued. Mahmood had defeated two popular favourites: Il Volo, the operatic pop group who represented Italy in 2015\u2019s Eurovision with their hit Grande Amore; and Ultimo, a young, white, heterosexual selfie-star who chimed with Salvini\u2019s own social media obsession. In effect, the press and the jury voted against Salvini, and by doing so they opened themselves up to criticism. Some Italians felt outrage at learning that their votes had been essentially overturned \u2013 though this is not the first time the system has worked in this way. Ultimo, meanwhile, took to Instagram to condemn the voting process of the festival. His stance, echoing Donald Trump, was to cast the journalists and experts as the bad guys. Openly insulting Mahmood and journalists in the post-show press conference, Ultimo goaded: \u201cYou have this week to feel important.\u201d The situation rapidly escalated: \u201cHere is a mirror of the country,\u201d Salvini declared, \u201cthe opposition between people and elites.\u201d For Salvini, Mahmood is simply a pawn in a leftist agenda \u2013 the idea that his music might actually be good is apparently incomprehensible. The Sanremo system aims to create the perfect mix, balancing the wisdom of experts with popular taste. Salvini heralds the idea of populism over expertise. He wants a competition without judges \u2013 and he\u2019d like a country without them, too. You only have to look at how the League and Five Star coalition government are already dispensing with experts in other areas to see a pattern emerging. In December alone they sacked the entirety of Italy\u2019s medical health advisory board. Mahmood may not have been most of the voting public\u2019s first choice, but after the result they embraced him: Soldi has shot to the top of the country\u2019s charts and streaming platforms. The most esteemed music festival in the country chose a winner who represents aspects of life that Salvini and the far right want to erase \u2013 crucially, they\u2019ve also chosen a song that critics, jurors and fans enjoyed too. His combined score came out on top in the festival, and now it\u2019s playing out in the real world too. This certainly won\u2019t be the last we\u2019ll hear of the talented young performer, and I hope it won\u2019t be the last we hear of all that he represents. Mahmood will now go on to represent Italy at this year\u2019s Eurovision in May in Tel Aviv \u2013 an event that is set to be steeped in its own controversy. Regardless, Soldi is going to be around for a while \u2013 Salvini may have to start listening to things he doesn\u2019t want to hear. \u2022 Thea Hawlin is a freelance journalist based in Milan \u2022 This article was amended on 15 February 2019.

And in some of the regional countries currently blockading Qatar, the headlines on news coverage of the final show just how close the whole peace-dream is to becoming a reality. Which is to say, not very close, if they still can\u2019t mention the match winner in a match report. As the UAE\u2019s Gulf News had it: \u201cJapan come up short in Asian Cup final.\u201d That said, it did have two articles about the final. The headline on the other was: \u201cThe Samurai\u2019s extra confidence caused their loss.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2019/feb/12/sport-officials-willing-to-sacrifice-hakeem-al-araibis-life-while-in-a-position-of-prestige-should-be-expunged\">Privileged sport officials willing to sacrifice Hakeem al-Araibi's life should be expunged | Craig Foster</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If you enjoy Qatar\u2019s Voldemort-like status in a tournament they actually won, then you\u2019d have loved the Khaleej Times\u2019s headline: \u201cUnlucky Japan lose AFC Asian Cup final.\u201d \u201cJapan fought until the last second,\u201d this version of events lamented, \u201cand like a champion side, dug deep to grab a positive result but couldn\u2019t succeed.\u201d Mmm. Sort of like a champion side, then. And sort of a positive result.</p> \n<p>If the Fifa boss Gianni Infantino was expecting pan-regional celebrations of Fifa\u2019s latest tournament, he might have noted that Qatar\u2019s fans didn\u2019t even dare to travel to UAE to support their side. These fears seem to have been well-founded. Last week, it appeared that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/british-man-detained-in-uae-after-wearing-qatar-football-t-shirt-to-match\" title=\"\">British man had been arrested</a> in the UAE for wearing a Qatar football shirt, unaware that even seeming to promote Qatar in the UAE is punishable by a prison sentence and hefty fine. Issa Ahmad claimed to have been beaten after his arrest, but the UAE authorities have since claimed he beat himself up. They duly charged Ahmad with wasting police time and making false statements and he is now awaiting trial, where he faces up to 15 years in prison.</p> \n<p>As for the Asian Cup\u2019s wider halo effect on this most bitterly factionalised region, that is also very much TBC. Or as one expert put it last week: \u201cThe response to Qatar\u2019s run in the Asian Cup has, if anything, deepened the split within the Gulf.\u201d The UAE and Saudi are more opposed to Qatar than they were before the start of the healing tournament.</p> \n<p>In a strange instance of synchronicity, furthermore, it was reported this week that the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby had offered to coordinate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/10/lynton-crosby-2022-qatar-world-cup-ctf-partners\" title=\"\">a campaign to get Qatar stripped of the 2022 tournament</a>, for a fee of \u00a35.5m. The frontman client was apparently a self-styled Qatari opposition leader named Khalid al-Hail. Who funds Hail remains a mystery tantalisingly unsolved \u2013 but if you had to lay a fiver on his backers, I imagine you wouldn\u2019t lose your bet.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Infantino declined to make any public statement despite the matter being a test case for Fifa\u2019s new human rights policy</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Even in this crowded field, though, the Middle East story with the most troubling implications for Infantino should be the case of Hakeem al-Araibi, the Bahraini refugee who plays semi-professional football in Australia, and who was detained for almost three months in a Thai jail after an Interpol red notice was suspiciously issued. Bahrain sought to extradite Araibi to serve 10 years for vandalism during the brutally-suppressed Bahrain Spring \u2013 a crime he is unlikely to have committed, as he was playing in a live televised football match at the time it happened. Some have suggested that his real crime was to publicly accuse the Asian and Bahrain Federation president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, of abandoning his players during the crackdown. Indeed, though he denies it, Sheikh Salman himself was personally alleged by several human rights groups to have ordered the torture of athletes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548ddbd987d1320b3f42bd9163bc5fd1a9f4fb94\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548ddbd987d1320b3f42bd9163bc5fd1a9f4fb94/592_372_2143_1286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Infantino\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even on the day the Bahrain government were submitting their extradition order to a Thai court, Gianni Infantino was standing alongside Sheikh Salman to hand out medals in the Asian Cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Araibi was freed on Monday, following the frankly heroic efforts of the former Australian football captain Craig Foster, various human rights organisations, players unions and others. But not, would you believe, Infantino himself. While the Fifa general secretary, Fatma Samoura, wrote a letter to the Thai government, this was only after Araibi had been imprisoned for two months. World football\u2019s president himself declined to make any public statement, at any stage, despite the matter being an absolute test case for Fifa\u2019s new human rights policy. The Asian Federation chairman, needless to say, did even less.</p> \n<p>Now that he is free, Foster is clear that Araibi\u2019s story is about those who helped him in his desperate need \u2013 but also about those who didn\u2019t. He said on Monday: \u201cWe will work to ensure all those in positions of governance that were willing to sacrifice the life of one player while occupying positions of influence and prestige, whether in football, the Olympic movement or any other sport, are expunged.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/12/hes-free-but-whos-to-blame-for-hakeem-al-araibis-ordeal\">He\u2019s free, but who\u2019s to blame for Hakeem al-Araibi\u2019s ordeal?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the very day the Bahrain government submitted its extradition order to a Thai court, Infantino stood alongside Sheikh Salman to hand out the winners\u2019 medals in the Asian Cup. Salman, you may recall, was the runner-up to Infantino in the 2016 Fifa presidential election. I always loved him as a candidate \u2013 there\u2019s something so insanely auto-satirical about a royal family member from one of Earth\u2019s most repressive regimes standing up and twatting on about the cleansing power of an election.</p> \n<p>As for Infantino\u2019s decision to stand side-by-side with a member of the Bahrain regime while a footballer was in mortal peril from the Bahrain regime, I guess you could say he keeps his friends close, and his former leadership rivals closer. But with less than four months until the Fifa presidential election in which he is the only candidate, his priorities deserve greater scrutiny than ever.</p>",

If the Fifa boss Gianni Infantino was expecting pan-regional celebrations of Fifa\u2019s latest tournament, he might have noted that Qatar\u2019s fans didn\u2019t even dare to travel to UAE to support their side. These fears seem to have been well-founded. Last week, it appeared that a British man had been arrested in the UAE for wearing a Qatar football shirt, unaware that even seeming to promote Qatar in the UAE is punishable by a prison sentence and hefty fine. Issa Ahmad claimed to have been beaten after his arrest, but the UAE authorities have since claimed he beat himself up. They duly charged Ahmad with wasting police time and making false statements and he is now awaiting trial, where he faces up to 15 years in prison. As for the Asian Cup\u2019s wider halo effect on this most bitterly factionalised region, that is also very much TBC. Or as one expert put it last week: \u201cThe response to Qatar\u2019s run in the Asian Cup has, if anything, deepened the split within the Gulf.\u201d The UAE and Saudi are more opposed to Qatar than they were before the start of the healing tournament. In a strange instance of synchronicity, furthermore, it was reported this week that the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby had offered to coordinate a campaign to get Qatar stripped of the 2022 tournament, for a fee of \u00a35.5m. The frontman client was apparently a self-styled Qatari opposition leader named Khalid al-Hail. Who funds Hail remains a mystery tantalisingly unsolved \u2013 but if you had to lay a fiver on his backers, I imagine you wouldn\u2019t lose your bet. Even in this crowded field, though, the Middle East story with the most troubling implications for Infantino should be the case of Hakeem al-Araibi, the Bahraini refugee who plays semi-professional football in Australia, and who was detained for almost three months in a Thai jail after an Interpol red notice was suspiciously issued. Bahrain sought to extradite Araibi to serve 10 years for vandalism during the brutally-suppressed Bahrain Spring \u2013 a crime he is unlikely to have committed, as he was playing in a live televised football match at the time it happened. Some have suggested that his real crime was to publicly accuse the Asian and Bahrain Federation president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, of abandoning his players during the crackdown. Indeed, though he denies it, Sheikh Salman himself was personally alleged by several human rights groups to have ordered the torture of athletes. Araibi was freed on Monday, following the frankly heroic efforts of the former Australian football captain Craig Foster, various human rights organisations, players unions and others. But not, would you believe, Infantino himself. While the Fifa general secretary, Fatma Samoura, wrote a letter to the Thai government, this was only after Araibi had been imprisoned for two months. World football\u2019s president himself declined to make any public statement, at any stage, despite the matter being an absolute test case for Fifa\u2019s new human rights policy. The Asian Federation chairman, needless to say, did even less. Now that he is free, Foster is clear that Araibi\u2019s story is about those who helped him in his desperate need \u2013 but also about those who didn\u2019t. He said on Monday: \u201cWe will work to ensure all those in positions of governance that were willing to sacrifice the life of one player while occupying positions of influence and prestige, whether in football, the Olympic movement or any other sport, are expunged.\u201d On the very day the Bahrain government submitted its extradition order to a Thai court, Infantino stood alongside Sheikh Salman to hand out the winners\u2019 medals in the Asian Cup. Salman, you may recall, was the runner-up to Infantino in the 2016 Fifa presidential election. I always loved him as a candidate \u2013 there\u2019s something so insanely auto-satirical about a royal family member from one of Earth\u2019s most repressive regimes standing up and twatting on about the cleansing power of an election. As for Infantino\u2019s decision to stand side-by-side with a member of the Bahrain regime while a footballer was in mortal peril from the Bahrain regime, I guess you could say he keeps his friends close, and his former leadership rivals closer. But with less than four months until the Fifa presidential election in which he is the only candidate, his priorities deserve greater scrutiny than ever.",

As all eyes turn to the midnight deadline on Friday \u2013 when, if there is no final accommodation, parts of the federal government will close \u2013 reports suggested Trump was grudgingly minded to sign off the deal reached by congressional negotiators. It would give him less than $1.4bn for his border wall with Mexico \u2013 substantially less than he has demanded \u2013 though his senior aides have hinted heavily that he would try to take additional funds from other federal budgets. CNN on Wednesday morning reported that they had talked to two anonymous sources who said Trump intended to sign the deal to prevent a repeat of last month\u2019s shutdown, the longest such disruption in US history. That echoed CBS News, which said an unnamed official had told them Trump would be \u201cvery likely\u201d to sign should the agreement land on his desk. But further jitters erupted after it was reported that the deal may yet be facing difficulties even before it reaches the Oval Office. The compromise formula agreed by a panel of 17 negotiators from both parties might now be \u201cunraveling a bit\u201d, according to Politico. \u201cIt seems as if the deal was announced a bit too early,\u201d Politico said, adding quizzically that there were \u201cboth critical issues and ancillary issues that were not yet solved\u201d. Politico\u2019s list of sticking points as lawmakers seek to draft the agreement into actual legislation does not look overly serious, and includes points of language over the border settlement. In El Paso at his first rally of 2019 on Monday night, Trump\u2019s new theme, if the banners around the venue were anything to go by, appeared to be \u201cfinish the wall\u201d not \u201cbuild the wall\u201d, as was the chant he led previously. Regardless, not a mile of new wall has been built on the US-Mexico border since Trump took office promising to create such a \u201cbeautiful\u201d thing along the 1,900-plus miles of border. Some existing barrier sections have been replaced or refurbished, mainly with slatted fencing, amid a lack of agreement to fund the president\u2019s long-promised project. Talks are also reportedly stuck over whether or not to insert back-pay for federal contractors hit by the last government shutdown. But as Politico points out: \u201cMany of these issues can be worked out, but there is very little time.\u201d If the Friday deadline is to be met, the House of Representatives needs to vote on the final bill on Wednesday so that it can be sent to the Senate on Thursday and to Trump in good time. As America entered the final 76 hours before the deadline, Trump continued to keep everyone guessing. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m thrilled,\u201d he said of the draft agreement that emerged from Congress on Tuesday. But he told a cabinet meeting that when it came to another shutdown: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d While grumbling about the terms of the deal, which would give him only 55 miles (88km) of new border fencing in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas as opposed to the 215 miles (345km) he had demanded in December, Trump has also made increasingly threatening noises about raiding federal budgets to supplement the sum granted by Congress. ABC News reported that the White House, which has been studying this matter for months, is looking closely at the possibility of swiping funds from the Department of Defense under an obscure rule allowing resources to be diverted to counter illegal drugs. ABC News also said the Pentagon was reviewing whether the military construction budget could be reallocated to the border wall. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said last week: \u201cWe\u2019ll take as much money as you can give us, and then we will go off and find the money someplace else legally in order to secure that southern barrier.\u201d The nuclear option would be for Trump to declare a national emergency, which would give him access to a much greater pot of federal money while effectively bypassing the will of Congress. That would send a constitutional jolt through Washington that even senior Republicans are reluctant to see implemented by a Republican president.",

It wasn't my kind of music but I liked some of it - it was catchy. And they were nice lads, polite online and stuff. But I thought they were kind of a street band, there were lines like \"Tarquin\" that would insinuate that they were knocking the middle classes, but it turns out they're not working class. That offended me, because I then held the belief that they were appropriating, to a certain degree, a working class voice. Obviously that excelled when the second album came out, and I felt a bit cheated. I also became jaded by this idea that we were a band that was campaigning for social justice, when we're not, we're just talking about what's around us. Music can't solve political problems. And I think their take on it is cliched, patronising, insulting and mediocre. And that's why I have a problem with them. I take music seriously, and I've come from a place where this music has been created. Without that, we wouldn't be here. I went through a lot of pain - I understand Idles' singer has gone through a lot of pain. But I don't believe their slant on this. I don't like them at all.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c640944e4b042feedcbcfc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T12:11:57.187Z\">12.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100476827\">BarryCrucial</a> asks:</p> <p>What do you think of the <a href=\"https://www.greeneking-pubs.co.uk/pubs/nottinghamshire/ye-olde-trip-to-jerusalem/\">Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem</a> [Pub in Nottingham]?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/125822156\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101356701\" title=\"View JasonWilliamson\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/101356701\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JasonWilliamson\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101356701\" title=\"View JasonWilliamson\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JasonWilliamson</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/125822156\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 February 2019 12:05pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>It's alright!

They broke through in 2013, with the release of their critically acclaimed album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/20/sleaford-mods-review\">Austerity Dogs</a> and a European tour. The duo have since kept up a steady release schedule, with Divide and Exit (2014), Key Markets (2015) and English Tapas (2017).</p> <p>The two fortysomethings have also appeared in two documentaries: Invisible Britain, which followed the band on tour and analysed the impact of David Cameron\u2019s government, and the more intimate portrait Bunch of Kunst. Their next record, <a href=\"https://etonalive.lnk.to/albumWE\">Eton Alive</a>, will be released this month on their own new label, Extreme Eating.</p> <p>Jason will answer your questions during a webchat on Wednesday 13 February from 12 noon \u2013 post them in the comments below.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

Scroll down to read all of his responses. UncleZippy asks: Why are you either so self-deprecating or comically cocky about your work? Did you grow up feeling ashamed about being creative? ID8463918 asks: You went to stage school. Can you tell us about that? LeilaKhaledSaid asks: Did you ever visit the old Robin Hood visitor centre in Nottingham? I went in there tripping on shrooms and the papier mache headed Middle Ages blokes sat round in the tavern will last with me forever. rustysheriff147 asks: Would you take on a sponsor for live shows if it meant you could put on the whole lighting rig stuff and video walls/visuals, or are the crates and laptop a part of your signature? sp3ccylad asks: You\u2019ve not put a foot wrong these last few years \u2013 how do you keep pushing forward in such a consistent manner? Admittedly, the utter shitshow we have to endure gives you loads of material, but isn\u2019t that true for every band? Melvazord asks: Who cut your hair, the council? MYCohen asks: 1. How important is money? 2. What\u2019s your favourite Fall track? SqueezyCat asks: Your music is so full of hate, have you ever thought of being constructive for a change? Perhaps sing about solutions, not your spite? bobblomax asks: How difficult has it been to keep reacting to events given how fast everything moves now? BoggisOBoggis asks: Hi, I\u2019m a 21 year old that\u2019s grown up poor in the depressing, expensive Tory heartland of Surrey. A lot of my mates are turning very right wing, regurgitating whatever they\u2019ve read from social media, and the heavy lefties seem to be equally shallow and militant. Any help? BostonPilgrim asks: Do you envisage a time when Sleaford Mods will have run its course, or are you happy to be like the Rolling Stones? chrisbardell asks: Jason, you gave up alcohol a couple of years back. You\u2019ve mentioned that this has helped you get in physical shape. But did it affect your creativity \u2013 is writing lyrics harder now? Nicom4130 asks: How hard is to keep the lyrics real in this time of political correctness when everybody\u2019s so easily offended? ThirdPrize asks: Why were you supporting the Who at Hyde Park a few years back? Someone thought you were a mod band perhaps? Kebabspider asks: D\u2019you reckon the Brits are rigged? Or just shit? Malicious_Steve asks: What\u2019s happening with your trousers? FrenchPaul asks: Each time I\u2019ve seen you live, you seem to be more and more ambivalent to the adulation from the crowd. Does it just become another boring job to do \u2026 same songs every night? Dworthington asks: Are the kids alright or was Daltrey talking out of his arse? billyhandcart asks: What do you think about Brexit? RED_KEN asks: Is it true you sleep with a replica Brit Award and are you going next week? JamesonArt asks: Although your approach is unconventional, to many you are the most important and significant act around. Has the response from your fans surprised you? churst1 asks: What do you hate most about Nottingham? joeycabron asks: What did you do in America for a year and where were you? Vwcampery4 asks: Do you know Shane Meadows? And are you still in touch with Steve Ignorant? Bananaramadan asks: Which women artists do you think are making the most exciting music right now? jameszzzzzz asks: What are your favourite Oasis songs? Superdooper1 asks: How did you feel when you found out that Corbyn didn\u2019t come from Telford New Town, but grew up in a manor house and was educated privately? micbinbag asks: Is anger a necessary component of your work and, if it is, do you fear success will erode it? milkandsunsets 1d ago 12 Your new LP is being released on your own label, Extreme Eating. Could you tell us a little bit about the label and how it came about? Jacopo Ghioldi asks How much do you bring to your songs, musically speaking, apart from the lyrics? jonbeat asks: Have Sleafords ever thought of collaborating on a techno record? Antony Cancellara asks: Do you pay full whack for your Smithy clobber or am I likely to bump into you at one of the warehouse sales? scottbridges asks: Whenever I see the Mods live, I\u2019m always highly impressed how you remember all the words. How do you do it without a prompt? RSFlint asks: Following your role in Lost Dog and your written output does \u2018acting\u2019 appeal? Have you had any offers of roles? LiamBannon96 asks: Are you ever going to release Jobseeker, Routine Dean and Jolly F**ker on Spotify or iTunes? joshyooare66 asks: Who is Alistair Candyfloss Head? joshyooare66 asks: What was going on in Some of These Plants are Burnt? sherwoodforester asks: Growing up in Nottingham, I recognise the many local references in your songs to landmarks, clubs, streets or football for example. As you\u2019ve got bigger I feel those intimate nods to the city are less frequent. Is this conscious? Are you trying to commercially appeal to people beyond Lenton Boulevard NG7? SevenIlls asks: Are there any plans of a US tour supporting the release of Eton Alive? Peadar76 asks: What\u2019s it like to record a jingle for something so prestigious as BBC 6Music\u2019s the Chain? Edgy1970 asks: Why the beef with Idles? BarryCrucial asks: What do you think of the Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem [Pub in Nottingham]? Don Van Vliet asks: If every tune you\u2019d ever created, bar one, was wiped from history forever, which one would you save as your legacy? Jason is with us now Sleaford Mods are often perceived as the political voice of the British working class, although somewhat reluctantly on their behalf. Their fast, furious yet humorous lyrics about blue-collar life in a period of austerity, combined with their fresh and minimal take on punk, have ensured that they are afforded, as the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw says, \u201cnational treasure status\u201d. Lyricist Jason Williamson first began devising his sound in 2006 and a few years later, he was joined by Andrew Fearn, who provides the backing tracks. They broke through in 2013, with the release of their critically acclaimed album Austerity Dogs and a European tour. The duo have since kept up a steady release schedule, with Divide and Exit (2014), Key Markets (2015) and English Tapas (2017). The two fortysomethings have also appeared in two documentaries: Invisible Britain, which followed the band on tour and analysed the impact of David Cameron\u2019s government, and the more intimate portrait Bunch of Kunst. Their next record, Eton Alive, will be released this month on their own new label, Extreme Eating. Jason will answer your questions during a webchat on Wednesday 13 February from 12 noon \u2013 post them in the comments below.",

      "bodyText": "The Dutch love affair with the bicycle has emerged as an obstacle to government plans to introduce driverless cars to the roads of the Netherlands. A report on the levels of preparedness around the world has crowned the country as the leader in efforts to get ready for the new technology. The Dutch government is working with Germany and Belgium on establishing \u201ctruck platooning\u201d \u2013 where one human-driven vehicle leads a convoy of autonomous ones \u2014 on major roads. Under the plans, about 100 driverless trucks would drive the \u201cTulip corridors\u201d at night \u2013 from Amsterdam to Antwerp, and from Rotterdam to the Ruhr valley \u2013 fully maximising the routes through which the Netherlands distributes its goods using 5G technology and 1,200 smart traffic lights. The Dutch infrastructure minister, Cora van Nieuwenhuizen, has announced a \u201cdriving licence\u201d for self-driving cars, through which it would certify new autonomous models, and a framework of legislation \u2013 known as the Experimenteerwet zelfrijdende auto\u2019s \u2013 is being prepared. But a report by the professional service company KPMG highlights a major problem for Dutch ministers in introducing the technology to urban centres, where the bicycle is increasingly king. Driverless cars detect other road users using a variety of cameras or laser-sensing systems to ensure that they stop if an object is detected in their path. But the varying sizes and agility of cyclists, with their sudden changes in speed and loose adherence to the rules of the road, present a major challenge to the existing technology. That challenge is particularly stark in the Netherlands, where 17 million people own 22.5m bicycles. More than a quarter of all trips made by Dutch residents are by bike. Of all trips of a distance of up to five miles, a third are made by bicycle, with the rate only dropping to 15% for trips up to 10 miles in length. Stijn de Groen, an automotive expert at KPMG, said in the report that for this reason the government would be best to focus on motorways. \u201cWe have a lot of bicycles,\u201d he said. \u201cIn urban, crowded areas it will be very difficult to start autonomous driving.\u201d The report concludes that as a result it might \u201cmake more sense to keep transport modes separate rather than integrating [autonomous vehicles] to work there\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Brexit is already delaying private and public sector projects, according to the construction firm Galliford Try, which said companies are holding off on investment while the government is preoccupied with preparations for leaving the European Union. In comments accompanying strong half-year results, the firm warned that a no-deal Brexit would cause \u201ca potential severe decline in consumer confidence and economic activity in general\u201d. It predicted that a more controlled departure under the terms of a negotiated withdrawal agreement would be much more manageable and would have no \u201csignificant direct impact\u201d on the business. However, the chief executive, Peter Truscott, said that regardless of the outcome, uncertainty over the terms of Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU was already placing a drag on the sector. \u201cThe government is distracted with other things and in the private sector some clients are just holding off the decision to commence until such time as they know what [Brexit] is all going to look like,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking people longer to make those decisions to buy homes for instance. In construction it\u2019s anecdotal and it\u2019s hard to be specific about individual clients but some of those public sector projects we\u2019d expect to have started seem to have been delayed. \u201cGovernment departments are busy with other things and that has delayed getting started on some sites.\u201d The Financial Reporting Council, the UK\u2019s accounting watchdog, has asked firms to flag up any impact they believe Brexit is likely to have on their businesses. Truscott\u2019s warning was among the few downsides to a strong half-year statement that sent the company\u2019s shares up more than 7% to 771.53p. Galliford Try, which registered a \u00a345m charge last year when it had to take on part of the Aberdeen bypass road project from the collapsed outsourcer Carillion, reported a 4% decline in first-half pre-tax profit to \u00a353.8m. It took another \u00a326m charge on the Aberdeen project in the first half because of delays in works on a bridge over the River Don. This was not linked to Carillion, although its former joint venture partner\u2019s demise means that any extra costs are now shared with only one other partner, the construction firm Balfour Beatty. Excluding exceptional charges, almost all of which relate to the road project, the company reported a record pre-tax profit of \u00a384.2m, while reducing its net debt by more than half, from \u00a384.9m to \u00a340.1m. However the half-year dividend on offer to shareholders has been cut from 28p a share to 23p. The group\u2019s financial position has been helped by a \u00a3150m rights issue launched last year to help it fund growth while absorbing the financial burden it shouldered from Carillion\u2019s failure. Its Linden Homes division recorded a 10% fall in revenues to \u00a3392m, with profits down 5% to \u00a376.8m as it moved away from higher-priced property in London to homes outside the capital with better margins. Revenues in its partnerships and regeneration business surged by 27%, helping push profits up 34% to \u00a314.5m. Truscott said this was partly thanks to cross-party political support for building more housing, resulting in increased activity, which he expects to continue. The high-revenue but low-margin construction business saw revenue fall by 13% to \u00a3718.4m, with operating profit 12% lower at \u00a36.3m.",

      "bodyText": "A Hungarian government minister has accused a senior representative of British Jews of politically-motivated lying, telling her to \u201cmind your own business\u201d following a meeting in which she raised concerns about antisemitism. The secretary of state, Vince Szalay-Bobrovniczky, wrote to Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, this week to take issue with the board\u2019s account of a meeting between the pair. The board said the meeting, which took place on 8 February, was \u201can important opportunity to raise a number of the [BOD\u2019s] long-standing concerns directly with the Hungarian government, including the use of antisemitic tropes and \u2026 moves to downplay the role of historical Hungarian leaders in supporting the Holocaust.\u201d Other issues raised by the board included the Hungarian government\u2019s attitude to Muslims and migrants, and relations between it and Jewish communities in the country. The board also raised language used by the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, in relation to the Hungarian-born Jewish philanthropist George Soros which, it said, \u201cwhether intentionally or not, represent[s] the oldest antisemitic tropes and this has to stop\u201d. Orb\u00e1n attacked Soros at an election rally last year, saying: \u201cWe are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open, but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.\u201d In an email to Van der Zyl, released by the board on Wednesday, Szalay-Bobrovniczky said: \u201cI harshly reject again your allegations of antisemitism against us, and especially against PM Orb\u00e1n \u2026 It is a shame for you and a shame for the whole cause: a simple lie. The Jewish communities in the UK and in Hungary would deserve more than your obviously politically-motivated words. \u201cI again explicitly reject every charge of yours concerning our declarations regarding Soros. Soros organises illegal migration to Europe and is thus undermining European security and the security of Jewish life on our continent. That is our problem. I am extremely sorry for the Jews that you pretend to represent \u2026 With due respect, please mind your own business and we will equally not interfere with yours.\u201d He also accused Van der Zyl of a \u201cdishonest and an unacceptable whitewashing\u201d of \u201cthe obviously antisemitic tendencies in the [UK] Labour party\u201d. In her reply, Van der Zyl said she was \u201castonished and disappointed\u201d by his response, adding: \u201cWe came to raise serious issues with you in a constructive spirit.\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s comments about Soros contravened the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism, Van der Zyl said. She urged the Hungarian government to \u201cstep back from, and apologise for, this kind of language\u201d. \u201cI find it particularly bizarre your allegation that we are \u2018whitewashing\u2019 Labour\u2019s record on antisemitism,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>As much as he loves a martini, Felix Cohen finds it a drink with some obvious drawbacks. \u201cYou have to drink it quite fast because it only really works when it\u2019s very cold. And when you look at a serving with three shots of gin in, or navy-strength gins at 55% or 60% [abv], sometimes it\u2019s just a bit much,\u201d says the co-owner, head bartender and creative brain at the cocktail bar <a href=\"https://everycloudbar.com/menu/\" title=\"\">Every Cloud</a> in Hackney, east London.</p> <p>Cohen\u2019s solution? The dinky \u00a35 martiny, a 40ml mini-martini that offers that \u201crefreshing strength and flavour profile\u201d without flooring you after one drink.</p> <p>Cohen regularly changes his gins, and premixes martini in batches for his 40-people capacity, \u201cscience-driven\u201d bar. He carefully calibrates its dilution (the 15% to 20% abv that would normally occur as you stir your martini with ice), then serves the drinks \u201ccolder than ice-cold\u201d from an old J\u00e4germeister machine. He has also served flights of miniaturised negronis at his pop-up <a href=\"http://manhattansproject.com/\" title=\"\">Manhattans Project</a> and sees such diddy drinks as the perfect way to explore flavours, relatively affordably.</p> <p>Cohen isn\u2019t the only bar owner experimenting with the so-called \u201cshot-tail\u201d: internationally, a small but growing <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/drinks/2018/12/28/18157981/fancy-shots-craft-cocktail-shooters\" title=\"\">number of bars </a>are adding compact cocktails or \u201ccraft shooters\u201d to their menus. Many of these are smaller versions of well-known cocktails: London\u2019s <a href=\"http://lyancub.com/\" title=\"\">Cub</a> serves a \u00a36 miniature martini, while, in Brooklyn, the <a href=\"http://moodringnyc.com/\" title=\"\">Mood Ring bar</a> carries several speciality $5 \u201cshots\u201d that are closer to micrococktails. Its aux cord riffs on the bloody mary with vodka, tomato juice, sriracha hot sauce and tabasco.</p> <p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://meatliquor.com/\" title=\"\">Meatliquor</a> burger restaurants have blurred the lines between the shot and cocktail, with a range of short 75ml mixed drinks more complex than neat spirits. Meatliquor\u2019s pipe dreams, for instance, combines Pernod absinthe, watermelon syrup and lemon juice. Elsewhere this winter, the <a href=\"https://www.shoryuramen.com/\" title=\"\">Shoryu Ramen</a> restaurant group is serving hot 25ml cups of Gekkeikan Junmai sake with gingerbread syrup for \u00a36.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9a5cdbec1bf2724cb32469605f5ed70378f9e8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9a5cdbec1bf2724cb32469605f5ed70378f9e8f/0_56_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The martiny at Every Cloud, Hackney, east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The martiny is a speciality of Every Cloud, a cocktail bar in Hackney, east London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amanda Schuster, the senior editor-in-chief of the <a href=\"https://www.alcoholprofessor.com/about-us\" title=\"\">Alcohol Professor website,</a> has encountered such diminutive drinks at New York bars such as Dead Rabbit and BlackTail, usually served as a complimentary welcome: \u201cIt\u2019s perfect while perusing the menu. I love the idea of a mini-cocktail as an <em>amuse</em>, but I also think it\u2019s the perfect nightcap \u2013 just the right size to end the evening.\u201d</p> <p>Miniaturising cocktails also makes it easier to serve them with food. At Cub, small versions of its outre cocktails are paired with dishes on the tasting menu. At Bristol\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/19/ethicurean-wrington-bristol-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Ethicurean</a>, its seasonal \u201csips and sharpeners\u201d have recently included a cocktail of mushroom vodka, maple syrup and chipotle \u2013 \u201cOur interpretation of port,\u201d says the manager, Meghan Morrell \u2013 a small measure of which was served with its cheese course.</p> <p>The emphasis on quality and self-control is very different to Britain\u2019s historic relationship with shots. From the first 1960s package-holiday encounters with Italian grappa or Greek ouzo, we never learned to savour our sambuca. For the hardcore who want to get drunk quickly, shots have always been a fast-track to oblivion; more a Bushtucker Trial-type challenge than something to be enjoyed. \u201cA few years ago, there was this weird thing of shots being almost undrinkable. The challenge was that it tasted appalling, like trying to shot super-high-proof Wray &amp; Nephew white rum,\u201d says James O\u2019Hara, who owns several Sheffield bars. These range from <a href=\"http://www.thegatsbybar.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Great Gatsby</a>, a party venue that mixes its own shooters (\u201cWe want palatable, interesting flavours\u201d), to the Observer Food Monthly bar of the year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/23/ofm-awards-2018-best-place-to-drink-public-sheffield\" title=\"\">Public</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone has ever bought a shot there,\u201d says O\u2019Hara, drily.</p> <p>The shot \u2013 a small measure of a single spirit \u2013 has always existed, but the shooter, a short combo of different alcohols, the forerunner to the modern mini-cocktail, is a modern invention. The American drinks historian David Wondrich traces it to the mid-70s kamikaze, equal parts vodka, lime juice and triple sec. Its exact origins are mysterious, but Wondrich thinks the shooter was seen as a way to keep bars relevant in the age of disco, drugs and neon, when classic, full-sized cocktails seemed terribly old fashioned (pardon the pun). In his 1984 novel, Cocktail (inspiration for the Tom Cruise film), Heywood Gould described the kamikaze as: \u201cOne of the classic disco cocktails invented by barbiturated teenagers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8dbccefd5170f270647df2ec4e4bfafe2b170323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dbccefd5170f270647df2ec4e4bfafe2b170323/0_224_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A selection of craft shots by Mr Lyan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Set \u2019em up: a selection of craft shots by Mr Lyan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDrugs made cocktails seem kind of tame, so they had to adapt by getting fancy and weird. Liquor companies started churning out sweet gimmick cocktails featuring fruit juices, dairy, crazy names,\u201d Wondrich <a href=\"https://firstwefeast.com/drink/2014/04/david-wondrich-history-of-shots\" title=\"\">told the First We Feast website in 2014</a>. By the 80s, US bars (and many British yuppie bars, too) were busily \u201cbuilding\u201d colourful layered shots such as the B-52, from viscous, sweet liqueurs such as coffee-flavoured Kahlua and the ubiquitous Baileys. Sweet liqueurs had a conveniently long shelf-life and were seen as female-friendly at a time when women had only recently started visiting bars socially, without men. With juvenile names like slippery nipple, blow job or screaming orgasm, these drinks always felt like a fad and would fall out of fashion in the 90s. Only to be replaced by equally childish drinks: the 90s and early 00s saw a huge growth in luminous vodka shots flavoured to taste of not just fruit, but pear drops, bubblegum and other nostalgic flavours from the sweet shop. It has only been in the past decade that the \u201ccraft cocktail\u201d movement \u2013 with its emphasis on real ingredients, flavour complexity, reviving historic recipes \u2013 has taken hold, and the sweetness has been dialled-down.</p> <p>In short, bartenders got serious \u2013 even in the way they tried to impress one another. Bar staff often treat colleagues from rival venues to a shot-sized free drink, a so-called \u201cbartender\u2019s handshake\u201d, and, to an extent, this new wave of mini-cocktails has grown out of that private ritual. Certain drinks gain a cult status among these nerds of the alcohol world. For instance, there is a whole subset of 50:50s or mixed-shots, many using bitter Fernet Branca (\u201cFernet has nailed it with bartenders,\u201d says O\u2019Hara), which are primarily enjoyed by staff. Cohen has a bottle of <a href=\"https://punchdrink.com/articles/how-the-ferrari-became-more-than-just-a-shot-amaro-cocktails/\" title=\"\">Ferrari</a> (half Fernet Branca, half Campari) at Every Cloud, from which he dispenses shots to industry friends and regulars.</p> <p>Other bartenders go a step further. \u201cIf I go into another bar I might be offered a \u2018<a href=\"https://punchdrink.com/articles/where-did-the-snaquiri-daiquiri-come-from/\" title=\"\">snaquiri</a>\u2019,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cYou make a full-sized daiquiri, pour it out into four shot glasses, and it\u2019s a nice social thing.\u201d At one time, the now closed Chicago bar Gideon Sweet had a whole menu of \u201csmall pours\u201d; batch-made cocktails easily split into shots. Particularly where these drinks are touted as in-the-know, off-menu orders, civilians love to feel they are part of that inner-circle.

      "bodyText": "As much as he loves a martini, Felix Cohen finds it a drink with some obvious drawbacks. \u201cYou have to drink it quite fast because it only really works when it\u2019s very cold. And when you look at a serving with three shots of gin in, or navy-strength gins at 55% or 60% [abv], sometimes it\u2019s just a bit much,\u201d says the co-owner, head bartender and creative brain at the cocktail bar Every Cloud in Hackney, east London. Cohen\u2019s solution? The dinky \u00a35 martiny, a 40ml mini-martini that offers that \u201crefreshing strength and flavour profile\u201d without flooring you after one drink. Cohen regularly changes his gins, and premixes martini in batches for his 40-people capacity, \u201cscience-driven\u201d bar. He carefully calibrates its dilution (the 15% to 20% abv that would normally occur as you stir your martini with ice), then serves the drinks \u201ccolder than ice-cold\u201d from an old J\u00e4germeister machine. He has also served flights of miniaturised negronis at his pop-up Manhattans Project and sees such diddy drinks as the perfect way to explore flavours, relatively affordably. Cohen isn\u2019t the only bar owner experimenting with the so-called \u201cshot-tail\u201d: internationally, a small but growing number of bars are adding compact cocktails or \u201ccraft shooters\u201d to their menus. Many of these are smaller versions of well-known cocktails: London\u2019s Cub serves a \u00a36 miniature martini, while, in Brooklyn, the Mood Ring bar carries several speciality $5 \u201cshots\u201d that are closer to micrococktails. Its aux cord riffs on the bloody mary with vodka, tomato juice, sriracha hot sauce and tabasco. Similarly, the Meatliquor burger restaurants have blurred the lines between the shot and cocktail, with a range of short 75ml mixed drinks more complex than neat spirits. Meatliquor\u2019s pipe dreams, for instance, combines Pernod absinthe, watermelon syrup and lemon juice. Elsewhere this winter, the Shoryu Ramen restaurant group is serving hot 25ml cups of Gekkeikan Junmai sake with gingerbread syrup for \u00a36. Amanda Schuster, the senior editor-in-chief of the Alcohol Professor website, has encountered such diminutive drinks at New York bars such as Dead Rabbit and BlackTail, usually served as a complimentary welcome: \u201cIt\u2019s perfect while perusing the menu. I love the idea of a mini-cocktail as an amuse, but I also think it\u2019s the perfect nightcap \u2013 just the right size to end the evening.\u201d Miniaturising cocktails also makes it easier to serve them with food. At Cub, small versions of its outre cocktails are paired with dishes on the tasting menu. At Bristol\u2019s Ethicurean, its seasonal \u201csips and sharpeners\u201d have recently included a cocktail of mushroom vodka, maple syrup and chipotle \u2013 \u201cOur interpretation of port,\u201d says the manager, Meghan Morrell \u2013 a small measure of which was served with its cheese course. The emphasis on quality and self-control is very different to Britain\u2019s historic relationship with shots. From the first 1960s package-holiday encounters with Italian grappa or Greek ouzo, we never learned to savour our sambuca. For the hardcore who want to get drunk quickly, shots have always been a fast-track to oblivion; more a Bushtucker Trial-type challenge than something to be enjoyed. \u201cA few years ago, there was this weird thing of shots being almost undrinkable. The challenge was that it tasted appalling, like trying to shot super-high-proof Wray &amp; Nephew white rum,\u201d says James O\u2019Hara, who owns several Sheffield bars. These range from the Great Gatsby, a party venue that mixes its own shooters (\u201cWe want palatable, interesting flavours\u201d), to the Observer Food Monthly bar of the year, Public. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone has ever bought a shot there,\u201d says O\u2019Hara, drily. The shot \u2013 a small measure of a single spirit \u2013 has always existed, but the shooter, a short combo of different alcohols, the forerunner to the modern mini-cocktail, is a modern invention. The American drinks historian David Wondrich traces it to the mid-70s kamikaze, equal parts vodka, lime juice and triple sec. Its exact origins are mysterious, but Wondrich thinks the shooter was seen as a way to keep bars relevant in the age of disco, drugs and neon, when classic, full-sized cocktails seemed terribly old fashioned (pardon the pun). In his 1984 novel, Cocktail (inspiration for the Tom Cruise film), Heywood Gould described the kamikaze as: \u201cOne of the classic disco cocktails invented by barbiturated teenagers.\u201d \u201cDrugs made cocktails seem kind of tame, so they had to adapt by getting fancy and weird. Liquor companies started churning out sweet gimmick cocktails featuring fruit juices, dairy, crazy names,\u201d Wondrich told the First We Feast website in 2014. By the 80s, US bars (and many British yuppie bars, too) were busily \u201cbuilding\u201d colourful layered shots such as the B-52, from viscous, sweet liqueurs such as coffee-flavoured Kahlua and the ubiquitous Baileys. Sweet liqueurs had a conveniently long shelf-life and were seen as female-friendly at a time when women had only recently started visiting bars socially, without men. With juvenile names like slippery nipple, blow job or screaming orgasm, these drinks always felt like a fad and would fall out of fashion in the 90s. Only to be replaced by equally childish drinks: the 90s and early 00s saw a huge growth in luminous vodka shots flavoured to taste of not just fruit, but pear drops, bubblegum and other nostalgic flavours from the sweet shop. It has only been in the past decade that the \u201ccraft cocktail\u201d movement \u2013 with its emphasis on real ingredients, flavour complexity, reviving historic recipes \u2013 has taken hold, and the sweetness has been dialled-down. In short, bartenders got serious \u2013 even in the way they tried to impress one another. Bar staff often treat colleagues from rival venues to a shot-sized free drink, a so-called \u201cbartender\u2019s handshake\u201d, and, to an extent, this new wave of mini-cocktails has grown out of that private ritual. Certain drinks gain a cult status among these nerds of the alcohol world. For instance, there is a whole subset of 50:50s or mixed-shots, many using bitter Fernet Branca (\u201cFernet has nailed it with bartenders,\u201d says O\u2019Hara), which are primarily enjoyed by staff. Cohen has a bottle of Ferrari (half Fernet Branca, half Campari) at Every Cloud, from which he dispenses shots to industry friends and regulars. Other bartenders go a step further. \u201cIf I go into another bar I might be offered a \u2018snaquiri\u2019,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cYou make a full-sized daiquiri, pour it out into four shot glasses, and it\u2019s a nice social thing.\u201d At one time, the now closed Chicago bar Gideon Sweet had a whole menu of \u201csmall pours\u201d; batch-made cocktails easily split into shots. Particularly where these drinks are touted as in-the-know, off-menu orders, civilians love to feel they are part of that inner-circle. Whether that means drinking a slam busy at New York\u2019s Up &amp; Up (originally a staff drink of gin and amaro), or ordering \u2013 on-request, they are not listed on the menu \u2013 mini cocktails at High Water in Dalston, east London. How far scaled-down cocktails can go is a moot point. They tick every box in terms of what drinks analysts claim are the prevailing trends.

In San Francisco, for instance, the gin bar Whitechapel has imported the Dutch version of the US Boilermaker (beer with a whiskey chaser), with its kopstootje menu of beer and genever shots. Practically, however, you cannot have too many small made-to-order drinks on a menu. It could really \u201cbog down service\u201d, says Mark Low, lead creative consultant at Mr Lyan Studio. There are those, meanwhile, who believe drinking is heading in the opposite direction. Britain\u2019s 60 Revolution bars may sell 18 flavoured vodka shots but, says its commercial director, Myles Doran: \u201cThe most popular serve for flavoured vodka is long. That\u2019s the trend within our business \u2013 tall, lower-strength drinks.\u201d Other big players are circling, however.

Since then the pentecostal churches \u2013 which place a special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God \u2013 have continued their exponential growth across the country and continent. Pentecostals make up 35% of all Christians in Africa, according to the World Christian Database, up from 13% in 1970. In Nigeria, their leaders have come to wield major political power.</p> \n<p>This year, the two presidential frontrunners are both Muslim \u2013 the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, and the former vice-president Atiku Abubakar.</p> \n<p>But the \u201cpentecostalisation\u201d of politics, which began 20 years ago, is continuing unabated, experts say, and the democratic process is shaped by powerful pastors, who regularly weigh in on elections. Some pastors even tell their flocks which way to vote. With no pope or archbishops to tell them what to do or say, and therefore no limit to their political activities, pastors have grown in their ambitions.</p> \n<p>Though the highest Okotie has ever finished is eighth, he still considers himself and his Fresh party to be the solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems. He has offered himself to the two leading candidates as a president everyone can agree on \u2013 what he calls a \u201cconsensus remedial facilitator\u201d \u2013 in an interim government, though the chance they will go for it is slimmer than a communion wafer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"812fb3acb416c75453501328efec5175404e5a57\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/812fb3acb416c75453501328efec5175404e5a57/0_292_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Okotie departs from the service he held at his church in Ikeja, Lagos, on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Okotie departs from the service he held at his church in Ikeja, Lagos, on Sunday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Esiebo/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Traditionally, the highest office of the vast west African country has alternated between Muslims and Christians. Though northern Muslims have had only a slight advantage, being in office for about 33 of the 58 years since independence, most Nigerians think they have dominated, and Nigeria\u2019s pentecostals are increasingly competing with them for state power.</p> \n<p>Many Nigerian Christians fear the \u201cIslamisation\u201d of their country, pointing to the rise of Boko Haram in the north-east over the past decade, the spread of Sharia law across many northern states in the early 2000s, and attacks by mostly Muslim herders, who are often unfairly perceived as waging a jihadist campaign against Christian farmers. At least three priests have been killed in as many years in the pastoralist crisis in the Middle Belt, and the perceived nonchalance of the presidency about the issue has turned many Christians against the government.</p> \n<p>Going into this Saturday\u2019s election, many Christian Nigerians see Atiku, as Abubakar is popularly known, as more liberal than Buhari \u2013 and therefore more friendly to them, and more likely to deal with these threats.</p> \n<p>Buhari, however, has on his side Yemi Osinbajo, the vice-president and a pastor from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/11/eat-pray-live-lagos-nigeria-megachurches-redemption-camp\">Redeemed Christian Church of God</a>, which has over 20,000 branches in 198 countries as well as its millions of Nigerian adherents.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97a2a5fc94a42bd12f0e7b305166aab465118190\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97a2a5fc94a42bd12f0e7b305166aab465118190/0_344_5566_3339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A campaign poster in Abuja for Muhammadu Buhari and his vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A campaign poster in Abuja for Muhammadu Buhari and his vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In picking Osinbajo, Buhari was continuing to recognise the major political clout of pentecostal Christianity in his country, which is home to some of the world\u2019s biggest megachurches.

He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.&nbsp; </p>\n    <p>He has promised business-friendly policies to double the economy to $900bn by 2025. He wants to privatise parts of the state oil company, and create a $25bn fund to support private sector investment.</p>\n    <p>Atiku's opponents have claimed he would exploit those pro-business policies to enrich himself and those around him.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>A divided country</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nigeria is deeply divided between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south. There are more than 200 distinct ethnic groups. This has led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement, with the presidency alternating between north and south every eight years.</p>\n    <p>It isn't just religion or ethnicity causing fractures. Half of Nigeria\u2019s registered voters are aged 18-35. Many say their ageing leaders are out of touch, and supported a \"Not Too Young to Run\" campaign to encourage younger people seeking office.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Election concerns</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>2015 was the only time Nigeria had a peaceful power handover since civilian government took over in 1999. Even then there was evidence of vote buying, voter intimidation, and other forms of corruption. International observers fear election interference and rigging this time around.</p>\n    <p>Last month, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Path to victory</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The candidate with the most votes is declared winner, as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states and the capital.

Now, Christians do not just want to stand on an equal footing \u2013 they want power themselves,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Pentecostal churches are forcing Muslim leaders to up their game to keep their hold on power, Obadare said. God is invoked on everyone\u2019s side.</p> \n<p>The pentecostal church has been growing as part of a wave of religious fervour rising in Nigeria since the early 1990s. As the standard of living fell through both military and civilian administrations, citizens clung to their faith for salvation and respite. Pentecostals multiplied in the south, giving purpose and the promise of miracles to their converts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53c75a8cc5967bc80f38148df5a66d9bd7fd9495\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53c75a8cc5967bc80f38148df5a66d9bd7fd9495/0_252_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Okotie leads the \u2018praise and worship\u2019 session of his Sunday service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Okotie leads the \u2018praise and worship\u2019 session of his Sunday service.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Esiebo/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Whoever is in power, working together \u2013 what Obadare calls an \u201cinter-religious political bromance\u201d \u2013 is crucial.

Marabouts have enjoyed special access to the presidency since the 1980s.</p> \n<p>In an interview in his marble antechamber after the service, Okotie delivers his analysis in the same style as his sermons.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/10/the-guardian-view-on-nigerias-elections-84m-voters-deserve-better\">The Guardian view on Nigeria\u2019s elections: 84m voters deserve better | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe things that divide us are ethnicity and religion, so we must rise above the pastiches of religion, the mosaic of ethnicity and whatever it is that separates us to an altitude where these cleavages diminish into mere superficial lacerations in the terrain of national integration and that\u2019s the message that I\u2019ve been given and that we can translate the paraphernalia of our diversity into the apparatus of national unity because we have an aboriginal connectivity that cannot be vitiated by politics, religion or ethnicity and we need to realise that and if we can embrace this philosophy then there\u2019s hope,\u201d he says, hardly pausing for breath. That was to say, an increasingly divided Nigeria should forget their differences and come together under him.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Chris Okotie option is the only viable option,\u201d the author of Nigerian classics Show Me Your Backside and Yes I Know He Lives adds, his aides standing reverentially around.</p> \n<p>Jesus, he says, will be a political leader in his second coming. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is going to be a microcosm of what is going to come.\u201d</p>",

Young women in sweeping sparkly dresses sing along adoringly as ageing Nollywood stars boogie at the back. In 2003 Okotie became the first pentecostal pastor to run for president of Nigeria, which heads to the polls on Saturday. Since then the pentecostal churches \u2013 which place a special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God \u2013 have continued their exponential growth across the country and continent. Pentecostals make up 35% of all Christians in Africa, according to the World Christian Database, up from 13% in 1970. In Nigeria, their leaders have come to wield major political power. This year, the two presidential frontrunners are both Muslim \u2013 the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, and the former vice-president Atiku Abubakar. But the \u201cpentecostalisation\u201d of politics, which began 20 years ago, is continuing unabated, experts say, and the democratic process is shaped by powerful pastors, who regularly weigh in on elections. Some pastors even tell their flocks which way to vote. With no pope or archbishops to tell them what to do or say, and therefore no limit to their political activities, pastors have grown in their ambitions. Though the highest Okotie has ever finished is eighth, he still considers himself and his Fresh party to be the solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems. He has offered himself to the two leading candidates as a president everyone can agree on \u2013 what he calls a \u201cconsensus remedial facilitator\u201d \u2013 in an interim government, though the chance they will go for it is slimmer than a communion wafer. Traditionally, the highest office of the vast west African country has alternated between Muslims and Christians. Though northern Muslims have had only a slight advantage, being in office for about 33 of the 58 years since independence, most Nigerians think they have dominated, and Nigeria\u2019s pentecostals are increasingly competing with them for state power. Many Nigerian Christians fear the \u201cIslamisation\u201d of their country, pointing to the rise of Boko Haram in the north-east over the past decade, the spread of Sharia law across many northern states in the early 2000s, and attacks by mostly Muslim herders, who are often unfairly perceived as waging a jihadist campaign against Christian farmers. At least three priests have been killed in as many years in the pastoralist crisis in the Middle Belt, and the perceived nonchalance of the presidency about the issue has turned many Christians against the government. Going into this Saturday\u2019s election, many Christian Nigerians see Atiku, as Abubakar is popularly known, as more liberal than Buhari \u2013 and therefore more friendly to them, and more likely to deal with these threats. Buhari, however, has on his side Yemi Osinbajo, the vice-president and a pastor from the Redeemed Christian Church of God, which has over 20,000 branches in 198 countries as well as its millions of Nigerian adherents. In picking Osinbajo, Buhari was continuing to recognise the major political clout of pentecostal Christianity in his country, which is home to some of the world\u2019s biggest megachurches. In 2011 he chose the influential Tunde Bakare of the Latter Rain Assembly, who gives his sermons titles like The Technology of Wealth Transfer and The Termites of Destiny. Osinbajo and his faithful flock may have been a deciding factor in their 2015 victory, despite the fact that David Oyedepo, the founder of Winners\u2019 Chapel, who preaches a prosperity gospel and has described himself as \u201cdangerously wealthy\u201d, told his congregation to pray for his opponent, the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan, to win. Ebenezer Obadare, professor and author of the new book Pentecostal Republic, said that the \u201cold story\u201d of the interaction between religion and democracy had changed with the rise of the pentecostal churches. \u201cWhat the church wanted [in the past] was to be on an equal footing with Islam. Now, Christians do not just want to stand on an equal footing \u2013 they want power themselves,\u201d he said. Pentecostal churches are forcing Muslim leaders to up their game to keep their hold on power, Obadare said. God is invoked on everyone\u2019s side. The pentecostal church has been growing as part of a wave of religious fervour rising in Nigeria since the early 1990s. As the standard of living fell through both military and civilian administrations, citizens clung to their faith for salvation and respite. Pentecostals multiplied in the south, giving purpose and the promise of miracles to their converts. Whoever is in power, working together \u2013 what Obadare calls an \u201cinter-religious political bromance\u201d \u2013 is crucial. In the 2015 presidential election, Jonathan\u2019s national security adviser spent billions of naira employing marabouts \u2013 Muslim holy men \u2013 from Saudi Arabia and north Africa to pray for his re-election, according to Nigerian media. Marabouts have enjoyed special access to the presidency since the 1980s. In an interview in his marble antechamber after the service, Okotie delivers his analysis in the same style as his sermons. \u201cThe things that divide us are ethnicity and religion, so we must rise above the pastiches of religion, the mosaic of ethnicity and whatever it is that separates us to an altitude where these cleavages diminish into mere superficial lacerations in the terrain of national integration and that\u2019s the message that I\u2019ve been given and that we can translate the paraphernalia of our diversity into the apparatus of national unity because we have an aboriginal connectivity that cannot be vitiated by politics, religion or ethnicity and we need to realise that and if we can embrace this philosophy then there\u2019s hope,\u201d he says, hardly pausing for breath. That was to say, an increasingly divided Nigeria should forget their differences and come together under him. \u201cThe Chris Okotie option is the only viable option,\u201d the author of Nigerian classics Show Me Your Backside and Yes I Know He Lives adds, his aides standing reverentially around. Jesus, he says, will be a political leader in his second coming. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is going to be a microcosm of what is going to come.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In December, I read a news article that had me cursing at the computer with rage. It was a New York Times investigation detailing allegations of<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/business/planned-parenthood-pregnant-employee-discrimination-women.html\"> poor treatment of mothers by Planned Parenthood</a>, including not offering maternity leave, mistreating pregnant workers and discriminating against moms in hiring and promotion. So why did this get me so much more worked up than average? After all, we live in a general cascade of bad news, with no shortage of things to be outraged about. The story made me particularly angry because, in addition to being a mother myself, for the last two years I\u2019ve been researching and reporting on working mothers. And the more I learn about motherhood in America, the angrier I get. Many thoughtful articles and<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Good-Mad-Revolutionary-Power-Womens/dp/1501181793\"> interesting books</a> are exploring new levels of<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/charles-duhigg-american-anger/576424/\"> anger in the public sphere</a> \u2013 and there\u2019s been a lot of attention on exploring our current renaissance of women\u2019s rage. While mothers today are rightfully involved in all sorts political organizing and public protests, I think we should also make space to be truly pissed about what it\u2019s <em>actually</em> like to be mother in 2019.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start at the beginning. When a woman learns she\u2019s pregnant, she immediately becomes vulnerable to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/15/business/pregnancy-discrimination.html\">\u201cepidemic\u201d of pregnancy discrimination</a>; it appears no industry is immune. <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2018/12/maternal-mortality-usa-health-motherhood/\">Mothers are more likely to die in childbirth in America</a> than in most industrialized countries, and that rate is climbing. Even more disturbingly,<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm\"> black mothers are nearly 3.5 times more likely to die than white mothers</a>. As hospitals try to address this, some of them appear more interested in<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/opinion/sunday/maternal-mortality-rates.html\"> blaming mothers for their own deaths</a> than proactively changing outcomes. Since we live in the only industrialized country that doesn\u2019t mandate paid family leave, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nearly-1-in-4-new-mothers-return-to-work-less-than-2-weeks-after-giving-birth_us_55d308aae4b0ab468d9e3e37\">nearly 25% of mothers go back to work within two weeks of giving birth</a>. To give you a sense of where human mothers fall on the legal protection hierarchy, it\u2019s illegal to separate a dog from her newborn pups <a href=\"https://www.animallaw.info/article/overview-laws-restricting-age-puppies-sale\">before eight weeks in several states</a>. Once we return to work, we unfortunately can<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/opinion/workplace-discrimination-mothers.html\"> expect anti-mom bias in hiring, pay and promotions</a>. And, if a woman has a baby between the ages of 25 and 35, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/upshot/the-10-year-baby-window-that-is-the-key-to-the-womens-pay-gap.html\">she can expect a lifetime of economic marginalization and diminished earnings</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/14/your-stories-about-motherhood-in-america-there-are-no-social-safety-nets\">Your stories about motherhood in America: 'There are no social safety nets'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While all of this is happening, the social expectations of mothers are becoming more intense. At home, <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/10/searching-for-an-equal-co-parent.html\">mothers do more housework and childcare than fathers</a>, even when both parents work full-time, and mothers today are<a href=\"https://www.russellsage.org/publications/changing-rhythms-american-family-life-1\"> doing just as much hands-on parenting</a> as stay-at-home mothers did in the 1970s. We now live in a time where every basic parenting decision, like whether it\u2019s OK to leave a child in a parked car for five minutes, is judged, analyzed, and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/opinion/sunday/motherhood-in-the-age-of-fear.html\">even criminalized</a>. And studies have a found that<a href=\"https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.58/\"> mothers are judged more harshly than fathers</a> for making the exact same parenting decisions. I believe what it means to be a \u201cgood mother\u201d in this era has become a total farce, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/01/intensive-helicopter-parenting-inequality/580528/\">increasingly out of reach for non-wealthy parents</a>.

The New York Times<em> </em>journalist Claire Cain Miller\u2019s reporting shows that there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/upshot/the-relentlessness-of-modern-parenting.html\">no clear evidence that this form of parenting</a> actually benefits kids, and it certainly succeeds at making many mothers stressed and miserable.</p> <p>As a society, we have a deeply uncomfortable relationship with mothers getting mad. But that hasn\u2019t stopped us in the past. Women, fueled by anger, have invoked their identity as mothers in all kinds of fights for social justice throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Mary Harris, known as \u201c<a href=\"https://aflcio.org/about/history/labor-history-people/mother-jones\">Mother Jones</a>\u201d, was a powerful and fearless labor leader, seen as a mother figure to thousands of workers after losing her own children to yellow fever. Mamie Till, the mother of the lynched teenager Emmett Till, pushed to allow photos of her murdered son to be publicized,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/07/12/emmett-tills-mother-opened-his-casket-and-sparked-the-civil-rights-movement/?utm_term=.8cf05e764403\"> which helped galvanize the civil rights movement nationally</a>. Mothers, of course, are instrumental to a number of powerful social movements we see today, including Black Lives Matter, the Women\u2019s March, and teacher strikes. But when women invoke their status as mothers in activism, as we see with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Mothers of the Movement, and Moms Demand Action, it\u2019s nearly universally to advocate for <em>others</em> \u2013 most notably our children. We have not yet seen much anger-fueled activism and organizing on behalf of ourselves.</p> <p>Mothers are right to be feeling some pretty intense emotions about the hand we\u2019re dealt. But instead of bonding together in righteous fury, I hear a lot more talk about \u201cmom guilt\u201d. \u201cI talk about guilt with mothers every single day,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.alexandrasacksmd.com/\">Alexandra Sacks</a>,<a href=\"http://www.alexandrasacksmd.com/\"> </a> a reproductive psychiatrist and coauthor of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-One-Tells-You-Motherhood/dp/1501112562/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=alexandrasack-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=2df1e297b8d543ebd90314439e2f1a31&amp;creativeASIN=1501112562\">What No One Tells You: A Guide to Your Emotions from Pregnancy to Motherhood</a>. She notes that moms she\u2019s hearing about guilt from aren\u2019t just those who are seeking psychiatric care, but women she\u2019s interacting with at lectures, workshops and on social media. She agrees that as a society, we are much more comfortable with mothers expressing guilt than we are with mothers expressing anger.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s very clear is that no one is coming to stand up for mothers if we don\u2019t get angry and stand up for ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Guilt and anger actually operate in different parts of the brain. Guilt is an emotion that operates in the right frontal cortex, and encourages a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070724113727.htm\">withdrawal motivation</a>\u201d, causing us to retreat from experiences we find difficult. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/147470491000800108\">no large-scale academic research</a> on moms and guilt even exists to help put mothers\u2019 current experience in historic or cross-cultural perspective. Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt exists to help enforce social norms, and in the case of mothers, I don\u2019t think many of those norms are doing us any favors. If we\u2019re constantly inundated with the message that we\u2019re personally doing something wrong, this leads to a brain response that shuttles us toward avoidance and isolation rather than outspoken defiance. In short, guilt keeps mothers quiet.</p> <p>Anger is different from guilt from a neurological perspective. It operates in the left frontal cortex, which encourages \u201c<a href=\"https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/S0749-742320160000019003\">approach motivation</a>\u201d. Despite its bad rap, anger, which is different from aggression, is actually an outwardly much more productive emotion. Neural maps of the brain show that anger can<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201403/go-forth-in-anger\"> energize us to move towards challenges</a> \u2013 rather than retreating. For mothers, I think tapping into anger could motivate us to speak up more about the injustices of our experience and take action. Angry people go to protests, sue their employers for discrimination, challenge unfair work and legislative policies and demand more from their partners at home \u2013 and loudly reject intensive parenting. I think society would be much better off if we saw a lot more angry mothers doing all of those things. \u201cYou can\u2019t organize a group of victims,\u201d Marshall Ganz, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School who\u2019s an expert in social change, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/charles-duhigg-american-anger/576424/\">recently told the Atlantic</a>. \u201cIf people only see themselves that way, there\u2019s no sense of agency, no sense of power. But when you tell them that we\u2019re fighting an injustice or an offense to their dignity, they become angry and involved.\u201d</p> <p>Despite all of this, I\u2019m actually optimistic that things are starting to change for moms. (Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m angry \u2013<a href=\"https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/pn.37.9.0025\"> anger actually leads to increased optimism</a>.) I\u2019ve spent nearly a year <a href=\"https://www.thedoubleshift.com/\">reporting for a new podcast</a> about working mothers, for which I\u2019ve been talking to women across the country, from executives to sex workers to politicians to musicians. What all of these women have in common is that they are refusing to accept the way things are for mothers in America, and they are doing something about it.

      "bodyText": "In December, I read a news article that had me cursing at the computer with rage. It was a New York Times investigation detailing allegations of poor treatment of mothers by Planned Parenthood, including not offering maternity leave, mistreating pregnant workers and discriminating against moms in hiring and promotion. So why did this get me so much more worked up than average? After all, we live in a general cascade of bad news, with no shortage of things to be outraged about. The story made me particularly angry because, in addition to being a mother myself, for the last two years I\u2019ve been researching and reporting on working mothers. And the more I learn about motherhood in America, the angrier I get. Many thoughtful articles and interesting books are exploring new levels of anger in the public sphere \u2013 and there\u2019s been a lot of attention on exploring our current renaissance of women\u2019s rage. While mothers today are rightfully involved in all sorts political organizing and public protests, I think we should also make space to be truly pissed about what it\u2019s actually like to be mother in 2019. Let\u2019s start at the beginning. When a woman learns she\u2019s pregnant, she immediately becomes vulnerable to the \u201cepidemic\u201d of pregnancy discrimination; it appears no industry is immune. Mothers are more likely to die in childbirth in America than in most industrialized countries, and that rate is climbing. Even more disturbingly, black mothers are nearly 3.5 times more likely to die than white mothers. As hospitals try to address this, some of them appear more interested in blaming mothers for their own deaths than proactively changing outcomes. Since we live in the only industrialized country that doesn\u2019t mandate paid family leave, nearly 25% of mothers go back to work within two weeks of giving birth. To give you a sense of where human mothers fall on the legal protection hierarchy, it\u2019s illegal to separate a dog from her newborn pups before eight weeks in several states. Once we return to work, we unfortunately can expect anti-mom bias in hiring, pay and promotions. And, if a woman has a baby between the ages of 25 and 35, she can expect a lifetime of economic marginalization and diminished earnings. While all of this is happening, the social expectations of mothers are becoming more intense. At home, mothers do more housework and childcare than fathers, even when both parents work full-time, and mothers today are doing just as much hands-on parenting as stay-at-home mothers did in the 1970s. We now live in a time where every basic parenting decision, like whether it\u2019s OK to leave a child in a parked car for five minutes, is judged, analyzed, and sometimes even criminalized. And studies have a found that mothers are judged more harshly than fathers for making the exact same parenting decisions. I believe what it means to be a \u201cgood mother\u201d in this era has become a total farce, increasingly out of reach for non-wealthy parents. Directives now include giving gifts to adult airline passengers who might have to suffer the indignity of hearing your child cry, interactively \u201cco-viewing\u201d TV with with your kids rather than taking a few moments of time for yourself while they\u2019re occupied, and spending weekend \u201cfree\u201d time shuttling children to expensive and time-consuming enrichment activities. The New York Times journalist Claire Cain Miller\u2019s reporting shows that there\u2019s no clear evidence that this form of parenting actually benefits kids, and it certainly succeeds at making many mothers stressed and miserable. As a society, we have a deeply uncomfortable relationship with mothers getting mad. But that hasn\u2019t stopped us in the past. Women, fueled by anger, have invoked their identity as mothers in all kinds of fights for social justice throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Mary Harris, known as \u201cMother Jones\u201d, was a powerful and fearless labor leader, seen as a mother figure to thousands of workers after losing her own children to yellow fever. Mamie Till, the mother of the lynched teenager Emmett Till, pushed to allow photos of her murdered son to be publicized, which helped galvanize the civil rights movement nationally. Mothers, of course, are instrumental to a number of powerful social movements we see today, including Black Lives Matter, the Women\u2019s March, and teacher strikes. But when women invoke their status as mothers in activism, as we see with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Mothers of the Movement, and Moms Demand Action, it\u2019s nearly universally to advocate for others \u2013 most notably our children. We have not yet seen much anger-fueled activism and organizing on behalf of ourselves. Mothers are right to be feeling some pretty intense emotions about the hand we\u2019re dealt. But instead of bonding together in righteous fury, I hear a lot more talk about \u201cmom guilt\u201d. \u201cI talk about guilt with mothers every single day,\u201d says Alexandra Sacks, a reproductive psychiatrist and coauthor of What No One Tells You: A Guide to Your Emotions from Pregnancy to Motherhood. She notes that moms she\u2019s hearing about guilt from aren\u2019t just those who are seeking psychiatric care, but women she\u2019s interacting with at lectures, workshops and on social media. She agrees that as a society, we are much more comfortable with mothers expressing guilt than we are with mothers expressing anger. Guilt and anger actually operate in different parts of the brain. Guilt is an emotion that operates in the right frontal cortex, and encourages a \u201cwithdrawal motivation\u201d, causing us to retreat from experiences we find difficult. Unfortunately, no large-scale academic research on moms and guilt even exists to help put mothers\u2019 current experience in historic or cross-cultural perspective. Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt exists to help enforce social norms, and in the case of mothers, I don\u2019t think many of those norms are doing us any favors. If we\u2019re constantly inundated with the message that we\u2019re personally doing something wrong, this leads to a brain response that shuttles us toward avoidance and isolation rather than outspoken defiance. In short, guilt keeps mothers quiet. Anger is different from guilt from a neurological perspective. It operates in the left frontal cortex, which encourages \u201capproach motivation\u201d. Despite its bad rap, anger, which is different from aggression, is actually an outwardly much more productive emotion. Neural maps of the brain show that anger can energize us to move towards challenges \u2013 rather than retreating. For mothers, I think tapping into anger could motivate us to speak up more about the injustices of our experience and take action. Angry people go to protests, sue their employers for discrimination, challenge unfair work and legislative policies and demand more from their partners at home \u2013 and loudly reject intensive parenting. I think society would be much better off if we saw a lot more angry mothers doing all of those things. \u201cYou can\u2019t organize a group of victims,\u201d Marshall Ganz, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School who\u2019s an expert in social change, recently told the Atlantic. \u201cIf people only see themselves that way, there\u2019s no sense of agency, no sense of power. But when you tell them that we\u2019re fighting an injustice or an offense to their dignity, they become angry and involved.\u201d Despite all of this, I\u2019m actually optimistic that things are starting to change for moms. (Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m angry \u2013 anger actually leads to increased optimism.) I\u2019ve spent nearly a year reporting for a new podcast about working mothers, for which I\u2019ve been talking to women across the country, from executives to sex workers to politicians to musicians. What all of these women have in common is that they are refusing to accept the way things are for mothers in America, and they are doing something about it. One of the women I spoke to is Nydia Sanchez, who owns a 24-hour childcare center in Las Vegas that caters to an extremely overlooked group \u2013 single mothers who work overnight. \u201cIt is amazing what these women do,\u201d she told me, \u201chow they stand on their own two feet.\u201d It is amazing what we as mothers can do, and how we stand on our own two feet. But I don\u2019t think we should just accept our lot in this country, because it doesn\u2019t have to be this hard. And that\u2019s why I was so furious about the report on Planned Parenthood.

And that\u2019s not to mention his football crimes: a stint on Dancing with the Stars; the Instagram Live feed with James Harrison during a press conference in which Mike Tomlin answered questions about his communication with Brown, which, amazingly, was not his first Facebook Live infraction; an ill-timed appearance on Fox\u2019s The Masked Singer. All are perfectly normal activities for famous people from the non-football world. The NFL, however, likes to strip away all personality; doing anything non-football related is tantamount to treason in the NFL\u2019s repressed ecosystem. At 30, some teams will decide the juice is no longer worth the squeeze, financially or emotionally. They would be wrong. Brown is in the midst of a six-year stretch that not even Jerry Rice could compete with. Brown has totaled over 100 catches in each of the last six seasons and averaged over 1,500 yards and 11 touchdowns in the same span. Want to know how many players have ever scored at least eight touchdowns with at least 100 catches and at least 1,200 yards for six consecutive seasons? One. Brown is the only guy. Not Terrell Owens. Not Rice. Not Randy Moss. Brown is an elite receiver in every capacity. He has torched the league with a blend of smarts, body control, and immense short area quickness, the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen rolled into such a slender package. His small stature and low draft status \u2013 he was selected in the sixth-round in 2010 by the Steelers \u2013 has fueled Brown\u2019s Me-v-Everybody complex, the kind that continues to burn in Tom Brady to this day, as well as his work ethic. \u201cHe\u2019s the hardest working man, I think, in football,\u201d Raiders head coach Jon Gruden said of Brown earlier this season. \u201cHardest working player I\u2019ve ever seen practice. I\u2019ve seen Jerry Rice, I\u2019ve seen a lot of good ones, but I put Antonio Brown at the top.\u201d Brown has had to work for everything. From his point of view, he wants his credit. He feels he was never quite as respected or beloved within the Steelers organization as he should have been. \u201cIt\u2019s like wifi,\u201d Brown once said of his relationship with Roethlisberger. \u201cSometimes the connection is poor. Sometimes the connection is great.\u201d It appears the connection has finally gone out and it\u2019s time to pull the plug.",

The academics, including almost 100 professors, say the \u201ctragic and desperate facts\u201d of the unfolding climate breakdown \u2013 and the lack of meaningful action by politicians \u2013 leave young people with little option but to take matters into their own hands. In a letter to the Guardian, they write: \u201c[Those taking part in the strike] have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken.\u201d The number of those taking part in Friday\u2019s strike is growing rapidly, amid mounting evidence of the scale and impact of the climate emergency. There are more than 50 confirmed events from Fort William to Hastings, with more added each day. The UK day of action is part of a movement that started in August when Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, held a solo protest outside Sweden\u2019s parliament. Globally, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week are taking part in 270 towns and cities. Individual demonstrations have already been held in the UK, but Friday\u2019s coordinated day of action is expected to see the biggest protests by students and young people in the UK since the student strikes of 2010 over tuition fees. There has been some criticism of the strikes by climate change deniers and politicians who claim the strike amounts to little more than truanting. Earlier this month a Belgian environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country\u2019s intelligence services held evidence that the tens of thousands of children skipping school were being directed by unnamed powers. But the strike has been backed by one of the UK\u2019s leading teaching unions and the academics say the young people who are prepared to organise and take part in the strike are setting an example that others should follow. \u201cWe are inspired that our children, spurred on by the noble actions of Greta Thunberg and many other striking students all around the world, are making their voices heard.\u201d The letter highlights the growing signs of climate breakdown, from the latest UN report that warns there are 12 years to avoid the worst impacts of global warming, to record-breaking droughts and heatwaves, warming oceans and melting ice sheets. The academics added: \u201cIt is with these tragic and desperate events in mind that we offer our full support to the students, some of whom may well aspire to be the academics of the future, who bravely plan to strike on 15 February to demand that the UK government takes climate action.\u201d",

For example, the summer of 2018 has been confirmed by the Met Office as the <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/2018/end-of-summer-stats\">hottest on record for England</a>. The heatwave adversely affected crops across Europe, with wheat and potato harvests reduced by one quarter, which in turn impacted upon food prices. Australia is similarly experiencing \u201chottest on record\u201d weather events. As citizens across the globe will know and testify, many comparably disturbing examples could be given. We cannot nurture our children without Nature.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/12/school-climate-strikes-share-your-videos-and-stories\">School climate strikes: share your videos and stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are rapidly losing sea ice in the Arctic. The warming of the ocean, the melting of land ice and the ensuing rising sea levels will threaten coasts. In 2018, the European Drought Observatory noted a high deficit in soil moisture across Scotland, Ireland and much of northern Europe. This increases the risk of wildfires, such as those we saw across England in 2018. As well as posing a direct threat to life, fires produce toxic smoke, which is a significant health risk to young and old alike.

      "bodyText": "We, the undersigned academics, stand in solidarity with the children going on school climate strike on 15 February, and with all those taking a stand for the future of the planet. Nelson Mandela once said: \u201cOur children are our greatest treasure. They are our future. Those who abuse them tear at the fabric of our society and weaken our nation.\u201d Human planetary abuse is, in a very real sense, child neglect. As many of us and other fellow academics have indicated previously in this newspaper (Letters, 27 October 2018), the scientific evidence of climate change is clear. For example, the summer of 2018 has been confirmed by the Met Office as the hottest on record for England. The heatwave adversely affected crops across Europe, with wheat and potato harvests reduced by one quarter, which in turn impacted upon food prices. Australia is similarly experiencing \u201chottest on record\u201d weather events. As citizens across the globe will know and testify, many comparably disturbing examples could be given. We cannot nurture our children without Nature. We are rapidly losing sea ice in the Arctic. The warming of the ocean, the melting of land ice and the ensuing rising sea levels will threaten coasts. In 2018, the European Drought Observatory noted a high deficit in soil moisture across Scotland, Ireland and much of northern Europe. This increases the risk of wildfires, such as those we saw across England in 2018. As well as posing a direct threat to life, fires produce toxic smoke, which is a significant health risk to young and old alike. Sir David Attenborough has warned: \u201cIf we don\u2019t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.\u201d Many other organisations, like Extinction Rebellion, are now working to bring the truth about the ecological crisis to the public\u2019s attention. It is with these tragic and desperate events in mind that we offer our full support to the students \u2013 some of whom may well aspire to be the academics of the future \u2013 who bravely plan to strike on 15 February to demand that the UK government takes climate action. They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken. We are inspired that our children, spurred on by the noble actions of Greta Thunberg and many other striking students all around the world, are making their voices heard.

I had nothing but the voice of a narrator, and maybe a page about a man without a name being thrown from a car. But almost immediately it opened a dark mouth with an insatiable appetite. To get the book to work it had to be about hardboiled tales of crime and detectives, so for the decade that I spent learning to write <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/muscle-9780571352210.html\">Muscle</a>, that was what I fed it, reading Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Mickey Spillane, James M Cain, Ross Macdonald and on and on. Somewhere in the process a second mouth opened \u2013 my narrator started reading pulp fiction of his own, science fiction stories, so I read those too, so that I could make my own counterfeits for my own purposes.</p> <p>The 10 books in this list all make their own play with genre in some way. They\u2019re not intended to be ranked, and it would be ridiculous to claim that anything grander than my own fondness earned them their place. </p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/don-quixote-25.html\">Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes</a></strong><br>It is because of books that Don Quixote of La Mancha sets forth: his head is consumed with tales of chivalric romance that he believes he is sallying into that genre\u2019s world of courageous knights, beautiful princesses and fearsome giants. Cervantes\u2019 own book was a huge success, and by the second volume, one of the brave knights whose adventures are known across the land is Quixote himself, and he is greeted on his travels by nobles who have read them \u2013 and toy with his delusions for their own amusement.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/frankenstein-42.html\">Frankenstein by Mary Shelley</a><br></strong>Lord Byron suggested to his companions a game to help pass a dreich summer in Switzerland. Each of them would invent a ghost story. In response, Mary Shelley created not just a masterpiece of horror, but a new kind of monster: science fiction. For the next 200 years, as it has lumbered around the world, it has never travelled too far from tropes invented in this novel. Mad scientists, god-high from hideous experiments conducted in their labs, continue to be destroyed by their own hubris.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/bloody-chamber-and-other-stories.html\">3. The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories by Angela Carter<br></a></strong>In which Carter takes fairytales and folk tales and remakes them \u2013 carrying across into her tellings their uncanny intensity, but otherwise subverting them as she sees fit. In the first line of The Tiger Queen, Beauty is lost to the Beast in a game of cards; the story ends with the transformation not of the Beast but of Beauty, as the Beast\u2019s harsh tongue licks her skin from her, layer after layer, until \u2013 beautifully furred \u2013 she is finally revealed. The whole collection is inspiring and exciting in the way it claims, with uncompromising strength, the freedom to occupy in return the stories that have occupied us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6a40173b72108649377a52b2b8af3d5768c2542\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6a40173b72108649377a52b2b8af3d5768c2542/0_111_1316_2025/650.jpg\" alt=\"An android of Philip K Dick on show at NextFest in Chicago in 2005.\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The distinction between SF and autobiography collapsed \u2026 an android of Philip K Dick on show at NextFest in Chicago in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gress/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU9vmJiSn3Q&amp;t=600s\">VALIS by Philip K Dick</a><br></strong>Imitators of Dick often share this problem: that behind their carefully fracturing, multiplying realities is the sense of a rational, maybe even clever author in command of it all. In the best of Dick\u2019s novels, you feel the author\u2019s own grip on reality might just be as tentative as that of his suffering characters. In VALIS (probably his masterpiece) the distinction between science-fiction fabulism and autobiography collapses completely, as a character that is explicitly Dick experiences a great revelation on the nature of existence by way of a pink laser beam.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/01/fiction.reviews7\">Gun, With Occasional Music by Jonathan Lethem</a><br></strong>Among Raymond Chandler\u2019s many quotable lines is this from his last novel, Playback: \u201cThe subject was as easy to spot as a kangaroo in a dinner jacket.\u201d Lethem takes this line and runs strange, somersaulting laps with it, merging a Chandleresque detective novel with a freakish sci-fi future in which humans live alongside genetically modified, sentient animals (including a kangaroo in a dinner jacket). It succeeds simultaneously as a detective yarn and as the kind of bustling science fiction that\u2019s so rich with ideas that they scatter freely as it moves.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/18/100-best-novels-nightmare-abbey-thomas-love-peacock\">Nightmare Abbey by Thomas Love Peacock</a><br></strong>Like the bad hardboiled detective story, bad gothic writing strikes poses so extreme and solemn that they invite pastiche. First published in 1818 \u2013the same year as Frankenstein \u2013 Nightmare Abbey is a short and very funny gothic satire. It is set in a dilapidated mansion of crumbling towers and secret passages, where the owner (the melancholic Mr Glowry) chooses his servants for their miserable appearance or morbid names.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/at-swim-two-birds.html\">At Swim-Two-Birds by Flann O\u2019Brien</a><br></strong>Like a woman giving birth to a man older than herself (something that happens in this novel), At Swim Two-Birds gleefully dismantles the primacy of an author over their creations \u2013 and also the distinctions between genres, as characters from different stories, including Irish legend and fairytale, leap their narrative bounds to interact. A great well of delight and a comic masterpiece.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/22/fiction.italocalvino\">If on a winter\u2019s night a traveller \u2026 by Italo Calvino</a><br></strong>Like At Swim-Two-Birds, this is a book of multiple beginnings. It will start a story with new characters in a new setting completely unrelated to what has come before, and then, just as you have become gripped, frustrate it, cutting it dead mid-scene. And then do the same again. The linking thread is a story (told in between these partial tales) of the reader (addressed as \u201cyou\u201d) going on an ever more ornate and genre-imbued adventure in search of the book they initially intended to read.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/bluets-565837.html\">Bluets by Maggie Nelson</a><br></strong>It\u2019s particularly hard to say what sort of book Bluets is: it\u2019s written in a series of numbered propositions as if it means to be a philosophical treatise, but these little bursts of thought are all profoundly poetic. It presses essayistically around the artistic, historical and personal connotations of the colour blue, and novelistically at the details of a relationship and a heartbreak. Whatever it is, it\u2019s wonderful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/11/top-10-books-about-wild-women\">Top 10 books about wild women</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/21/biography\">Blind Man with a Pistol and Plan B by Chester Himes</a><br></strong>The earlier Harlem Detective books featuring Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson are raucous, macabre fun \u2013 try All Shot Up or Cotton Comes to Harlem. But in these final two books (one unfinished) something breaks. Finally, even a chaotic version of the detective novel can\u2019t deal with injustices as large as those Himes heaps on his two policemen \u2013 confronted with the bone-deep racism of a whole society, struggling with their own position as black men defending the white status quo. Nothing is resolved, no cases are cracked, the violence is not just brutal but shocking. It\u2019s a fascinating, sad, disorienting conclusion.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/muscle-9780571352210.html\">Muscle by Alan Trotter</a> is published by Faber &amp; Faber, priced \u00a310.

To get the book to work it had to be about hardboiled tales of crime and detectives, so for the decade that I spent learning to write Muscle, that was what I fed it, reading Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Mickey Spillane, James M Cain, Ross Macdonald and on and on. Somewhere in the process a second mouth opened \u2013 my narrator started reading pulp fiction of his own, science fiction stories, so I read those too, so that I could make my own counterfeits for my own purposes. The 10 books in this list all make their own play with genre in some way. They\u2019re not intended to be ranked, and it would be ridiculous to claim that anything grander than my own fondness earned them their place. 1. Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes It is because of books that Don Quixote of La Mancha sets forth: his head is consumed with tales of chivalric romance that he believes he is sallying into that genre\u2019s world of courageous knights, beautiful princesses and fearsome giants. Cervantes\u2019 own book was a huge success, and by the second volume, one of the brave knights whose adventures are known across the land is Quixote himself, and he is greeted on his travels by nobles who have read them \u2013 and toy with his delusions for their own amusement. 2. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley Lord Byron suggested to his companions a game to help pass a dreich summer in Switzerland. Each of them would invent a ghost story. In response, Mary Shelley created not just a masterpiece of horror, but a new kind of monster: science fiction. For the next 200 years, as it has lumbered around the world, it has never travelled too far from tropes invented in this novel. Mad scientists, god-high from hideous experiments conducted in their labs, continue to be destroyed by their own hubris. 3. The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories by Angela Carter In which Carter takes fairytales and folk tales and remakes them \u2013 carrying across into her tellings their uncanny intensity, but otherwise subverting them as she sees fit. In the first line of The Tiger Queen, Beauty is lost to the Beast in a game of cards; the story ends with the transformation not of the Beast but of Beauty, as the Beast\u2019s harsh tongue licks her skin from her, layer after layer, until \u2013 beautifully furred \u2013 she is finally revealed. The whole collection is inspiring and exciting in the way it claims, with uncompromising strength, the freedom to occupy in return the stories that have occupied us. 4. VALIS by Philip K Dick Imitators of Dick often share this problem: that behind their carefully fracturing, multiplying realities is the sense of a rational, maybe even clever author in command of it all. In the best of Dick\u2019s novels, you feel the author\u2019s own grip on reality might just be as tentative as that of his suffering characters. In VALIS (probably his masterpiece) the distinction between science-fiction fabulism and autobiography collapses completely, as a character that is explicitly Dick experiences a great revelation on the nature of existence by way of a pink laser beam. 5. Gun, With Occasional Music by Jonathan Lethem Among Raymond Chandler\u2019s many quotable lines is this from his last novel, Playback: \u201cThe subject was as easy to spot as a kangaroo in a dinner jacket.\u201d Lethem takes this line and runs strange, somersaulting laps with it, merging a Chandleresque detective novel with a freakish sci-fi future in which humans live alongside genetically modified, sentient animals (including a kangaroo in a dinner jacket). It succeeds simultaneously as a detective yarn and as the kind of bustling science fiction that\u2019s so rich with ideas that they scatter freely as it moves. 6. Nightmare Abbey by Thomas Love Peacock Like the bad hardboiled detective story, bad gothic writing strikes poses so extreme and solemn that they invite pastiche. First published in 1818 \u2013the same year as Frankenstein \u2013 Nightmare Abbey is a short and very funny gothic satire. It is set in a dilapidated mansion of crumbling towers and secret passages, where the owner (the melancholic Mr Glowry) chooses his servants for their miserable appearance or morbid names. 7. At Swim-Two-Birds by Flann O\u2019Brien Like a woman giving birth to a man older than herself (something that happens in this novel), At Swim Two-Birds gleefully dismantles the primacy of an author over their creations \u2013 and also the distinctions between genres, as characters from different stories, including Irish legend and fairytale, leap their narrative bounds to interact. A great well of delight and a comic masterpiece. 8. If on a winter\u2019s night a traveller \u2026 by Italo Calvino Like At Swim-Two-Birds, this is a book of multiple beginnings. It will start a story with new characters in a new setting completely unrelated to what has come before, and then, just as you have become gripped, frustrate it, cutting it dead mid-scene. And then do the same again. The linking thread is a story (told in between these partial tales) of the reader (addressed as \u201cyou\u201d) going on an ever more ornate and genre-imbued adventure in search of the book they initially intended to read. 9. Bluets by Maggie Nelson It\u2019s particularly hard to say what sort of book Bluets is: it\u2019s written in a series of numbered propositions as if it means to be a philosophical treatise, but these little bursts of thought are all profoundly poetic. It presses essayistically around the artistic, historical and personal connotations of the colour blue, and novelistically at the details of a relationship and a heartbreak. Whatever it is, it\u2019s wonderful. 10. Blind Man with a Pistol and Plan B by Chester Himes The earlier Harlem Detective books featuring Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson are raucous, macabre fun \u2013 try All Shot Up or Cotton Comes to Harlem. But in these final two books (one unfinished) something breaks. Finally, even a chaotic version of the detective novel can\u2019t deal with injustices as large as those Himes heaps on his two policemen \u2013 confronted with the bone-deep racism of a whole society, struggling with their own position as black men defending the white status quo. Nothing is resolved, no cases are cracked, the violence is not just brutal but shocking. It\u2019s a fascinating, sad, disorienting conclusion. \u2022 Muscle by Alan Trotter is published by Faber &amp; Faber, priced \u00a310. To order a copy, go to guardianbookshop.com.

      "bodyText": "The freight industry has warned of the potential for a fresh Brexit ferry fiasco after it emerged all British truckers will be required to have counter-terrorism safety security certificates to enter the European Union in the event of no deal. The EU rule was introduced after the 9/11 attack on New York\u2019s twin towers but only applies to third country freight entering the EU. But if the UK crashes out of the bloc it will be classified as a third country like Ukraine or China and all freight operators will be required to fill out a 38-point safety and security form. Irish drivers using the UK as a land bridge to the continent would also have to comply, sources said. Not only would this be necessary for every consignment, but it would be required hours before transit, fuelling fears that trucks could face delays not just because of customs and public health checks but also safety. James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the Freight Transport Association, said it was a serious issue particularly because the certificates were required for each consignment in a truck, affecting small- to medium-sized businesses which have multiple pickups before they head to the continent. \u201cIt is not fiscal like customs and tariffs, but it is more serious for ferries and Eurotunnel because it involves security issues because the vessel or train could be endangered if there is a truck without the security certificate on it,\u201d he said. The concerns have been raised amid reports that truckers could face fines of up to \u00a31,000 if they do not have a similar clearance certificate on their way back into the UK. And to add to the freight industry\u2019s problems, the Department for Transport (DfT) only has 9% of the 11,000 driver permits requested by British hauliers to operate legally in the EU in the event of no deal. The government confirmed the need for safety and security clearance certificates in a 37-page \u201cpartnership pack\u201d it has prepared for importers and exporters. \u201cFor imports into the UK a separate safety and security declaration needs to be made by the carrier of the goods (this is usually the haulier, airline, freight train operator or shipping line, depending on the mode of transport used to import goods),\u201d the pack says. Hookham said the safety certificates were not as big an issue for ports such as Felixstowe that deal with sea containers, because goods from countries such as China have weeks of transit in which to deal with paperwork. But the just-in-time systems used in British manufacturing rely heavily on the \u201cturn-up-and-go\u201d arrangement that operates at ports and Eurotunnel. Under the EU rules ferry companies would need paperwork two hours in advance while Eurotunnel would need it one hour before transit. An HM Revenue and Customs spokesperson said: \u201cHMRC have written several times to traders to advise them how to prepare for a no deal and will continue to set out further detail over the coming weeks.\u201d The concern over safety certificates comes amid mounting worries among the freight industry of a no-deal Brexit. In the event of no deal all heavy goods vehicle operators would be required to have a European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) permit, of which only 984 have been allocated to the UK for 2019 and just 60 for Northern Ireland. Last week the DfT confirmed it had received 11,000 applications for permits from 2,000 truck operators. Seamus Leheny, the policy manager for the FTA in Northern Ireland, tweeted that he received a call on Tuesday from a haulier who operates to and from the continent who had applied for 35 ECMT permits but had been \u201ctold they get 2\u201d. Leheny said: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain the consequences of this.\u201d Pauline Bastidon from the FTA tweeted that she had been told of another company that \u201capplied for 60 permits and got just 14\u201d.",

Academy president John Bailey had announced the move as part of its attempt to shorten the TV show\u2019s notoriously sprawling running time, under pressure from host network ABC. In the first of what is planned as a rotating series of relegations, the Oscars for cinematography, editing, live action short, and makeup and hair will be handed out during ad breaks (though shown on the live stream on the Oscars website) with acceptance speeches edited in to the broadcast. However, entertainment industry figures have been reacting with dismay. Actor Russell Crowe called it \u201ca fundamentally stupid decision \u2026 just too fucking dumb for words\u201d, while Exorcist director William Friedkin described it as \u201can insult to award two of the most essential qualities of film-making\u201d.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s important to remember how the controversy around Ilhan Omar, who Trump said should resign over tweets critical of a pro-Israel lobbying group, began. The first two Muslim congresswomen in the history of the United States \u2013 Ilhan Omar, a freshman representative from Minnesota and Somali refugee, and her fellow freshman representative Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American \u2013 have bravely criticized the Israeli government for its grotesque treatment of the Palestinian people.</p> <p>Acknowledging this apartheid system is a dangerous thing for American elected officials to do. Just in 2016, when presidential candidate Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/15/11437602/clinton-sanders-israel-palestine-debate\">dared</a> to say that \u201cWe are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity\u201d it became a major media event.</p> <p>Omar and Tlaib endorse <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions</a> (BDS) movement, a Palestinian-led movement to pressure Israel to change course on Palestine. Opponents have dishonestly cast it as inherently antisemitic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4162\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The furor over BDS has led more than half of US states to pass laws attacking BDS. These laws clearly trample on the constitutional right to free speech and expression, but that didn\u2019t stop the US Senate from passing the very first piece of legislation this session, which forbids Congress from pre-empting such state laws.</p> <p>So by supporting a justice movement for Palestinians, Omar and Tlaib have opened themselves up to a torrent of attacks from liberals, centrists and the right. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, took these attacks one step further, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/kevin-mccarthy-promises-action-against-ilhan-omar-and-rashida-tlaib-1.6917751\">threatening</a> to punish the two representatives if Democratic party leaders failed to do so.</p> <p>Omar responded to McCarthy\u2019s threat by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1094747501578633216\">quoting</a> the title of a popular song, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins,\u201d on Sunday night. When the opinion editor of the Forward, Batya Ungar Sargon, questioned who Omar might think is paying members of Congress to unflinchingly support Israel, Omar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1094761790595088384\">tweeted</a>, \u201cAipac!\u201d</p> <p>Then the real tsunami began. Omar was immediately labeled an antisemite. By early afternoon on Monday, Democratic leaders \u2013 who sank a proposal to censure the nine-term, <a href=\"https://readsludge.com/2018/10/25/after-visiting-auschwitz-rep-steve-king-gave-interview-to-anti-semitic-publication/\">openly white supremacist</a> representative Steve King just weeks earlier \u2013 had called on Omar to apologize, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1095046561254567937\">she did</a> promptly.</p> <p>Evil people have used the hateful conspiracy theory that Jews use their money to secretly control politicians and the media for many centuries. That has led to atrocities being committed against Jewish people. Everyone, especially politicians, should know and acknowledge this.</p> <p>But in doing so, it\u2019s incredibly important to be able to distinguish between real antisemitism and basic political facts. We need to be able to examine the money and influence in politics that every special-interest group, including pro-Israel lobbying groups such as Aipac, wields. Often, because of their ability to pay for costly lobbyists and fund political campaigns, these special interests drown out the voices of everyday Americans. As a result, members of Congress are <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/study-congress-overestimates-the-publics-conservatism.html\">way out of touch</a> with the views of their own constituents.</p> <p>Omar\u2019s controversial tweets noted two important realities. First, money is a huge problem, and motivator, in Washington. Second, Aipac is a powerful group that uses its money to influence the policy decisions of members of Congress. As Mehdi Hasan and Ryan Grim detail in the Intercept, Aipac officials have <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/11/ilhan-omar-israel-lobby-documentary/\">bragged</a> about their <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/12/there-is-a-taboo-against-criticizing-aipac-and-ilhan-omar-just-destroyed-it/\">power</a> over Washington lawmakers.</p> <p>I <a href=\"https://readsludge.com/2019/02/11/heres-how-aipac-spends-money-to-influence-congress/\">explain at Sludge</a> that Aipac played a role in forming separate pro-Israel Pacs and has encouraged its members to donate to its favorite candidates for decades; it spends more money than any other pro-Israel group every year to lobby the federal government; it holds annual conventions featuring <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexkotch/status/1095083513932599297\">sympathetic members of Congress</a>; and it\u2019s spent nearly $16m since 2000 to send groups of congresspeople to Israel to learn about the two countries\u2019 relationship through the Aipac lens.</p> <p>In part because of Aipac\u2019s political efforts, the US has remained Israel\u2019s strongest ally, funding its military and <a href=\"https://readsludge.com/2019/01/04/new-house-foreign-affairs-chair-receives-money-from-weapons-contractors-he-oversees/\">selling it weapons</a>, siding with Israel on UN <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/16/us-israel-golan-heights-syria-un-resolution-oppose\">resolutions</a>, and hardly slapping Israel on the wrist when it expands its illegal West Bank settlements or its soldiers kill hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/31/israeli-military-defends-tactics-video-appears-show-unarmed/\">unarmed</a> Palestinians, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amnesty/status/996013600509657088\">children</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-protests/israeli-army-kills-palestinian-nurse-in-gaza-border-protest-medics-idUSKCN1IX5OA\">medics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/palestinian-journalist-wearing-press-jacket-killed-by-israeli-fire-in-1.5977830\">journalists</a>.</p> <p>Antisemitic incidents have <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/anti-semitic-incidents-surged-nearly-60-in-2017-according-to-new-adl-report\">risen drastically</a> in the US since Donald Trump took office. Neo-Nazis rallied in Charlottesville in 2017. Eleven Jews were murdered in the Tree of Life synagogue last October. Two weeks ago, neo-Nazis <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/upstate-new-york-yeshiva-set-on-fire-and-painted-with-swastikas-1.6919613\">burned and painted swastikas</a> on yeshiva buildings in my state of New York. Discussing the political influence of Jews and pro-Israel groups, including some that have considerable evangelical Christian support, should surely be done delicately, but we can\u2019t pretend an insensitive tweet about politics is in the same universe as support for white supremacy, as <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/gop-leader-promises-action-against-democrats-accused-of-anti-semitism/\">McCarthy preposterously asserted</a>.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s important to remember how the controversy around Ilhan Omar, who Trump said should resign over tweets critical of a pro-Israel lobbying group, began. The first two Muslim congresswomen in the history of the United States \u2013 Ilhan Omar, a freshman representative from Minnesota and Somali refugee, and her fellow freshman representative Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American \u2013 have bravely criticized the Israeli government for its grotesque treatment of the Palestinian people. Acknowledging this apartheid system is a dangerous thing for American elected officials to do. Just in 2016, when presidential candidate Bernie Sanders dared to say that \u201cWe are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity\u201d it became a major media event. Omar and Tlaib endorse Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian-led movement to pressure Israel to change course on Palestine. Opponents have dishonestly cast it as inherently antisemitic. The furor over BDS has led more than half of US states to pass laws attacking BDS. These laws clearly trample on the constitutional right to free speech and expression, but that didn\u2019t stop the US Senate from passing the very first piece of legislation this session, which forbids Congress from pre-empting such state laws. So by supporting a justice movement for Palestinians, Omar and Tlaib have opened themselves up to a torrent of attacks from liberals, centrists and the right. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, took these attacks one step further, threatening to punish the two representatives if Democratic party leaders failed to do so. Omar responded to McCarthy\u2019s threat by quoting the title of a popular song, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins,\u201d on Sunday night. When the opinion editor of the Forward, Batya Ungar Sargon, questioned who Omar might think is paying members of Congress to unflinchingly support Israel, Omar tweeted, \u201cAipac!\u201d Then the real tsunami began. Omar was immediately labeled an antisemite. By early afternoon on Monday, Democratic leaders \u2013 who sank a proposal to censure the nine-term, openly white supremacist representative Steve King just weeks earlier \u2013 had called on Omar to apologize, which she did promptly. Evil people have used the hateful conspiracy theory that Jews use their money to secretly control politicians and the media for many centuries. That has led to atrocities being committed against Jewish people. Everyone, especially politicians, should know and acknowledge this. But in doing so, it\u2019s incredibly important to be able to distinguish between real antisemitism and basic political facts. We need to be able to examine the money and influence in politics that every special-interest group, including pro-Israel lobbying groups such as Aipac, wields. Often, because of their ability to pay for costly lobbyists and fund political campaigns, these special interests drown out the voices of everyday Americans. As a result, members of Congress are way out of touch with the views of their own constituents. Omar\u2019s controversial tweets noted two important realities. First, money is a huge problem, and motivator, in Washington. Second, Aipac is a powerful group that uses its money to influence the policy decisions of members of Congress. As Mehdi Hasan and Ryan Grim detail in the Intercept, Aipac officials have bragged about their power over Washington lawmakers. I explain at Sludge that Aipac played a role in forming separate pro-Israel Pacs and has encouraged its members to donate to its favorite candidates for decades; it spends more money than any other pro-Israel group every year to lobby the federal government; it holds annual conventions featuring sympathetic members of Congress; and it\u2019s spent nearly $16m since 2000 to send groups of congresspeople to Israel to learn about the two countries\u2019 relationship through the Aipac lens. In part because of Aipac\u2019s political efforts, the US has remained Israel\u2019s strongest ally, funding its military and selling it weapons, siding with Israel on UN resolutions, and hardly slapping Israel on the wrist when it expands its illegal West Bank settlements or its soldiers kill hundreds of unarmed Palestinians, including children, medics and journalists. Antisemitic incidents have risen drastically in the US since Donald Trump took office. Neo-Nazis rallied in Charlottesville in 2017. Eleven Jews were murdered in the Tree of Life synagogue last October. Two weeks ago, neo-Nazis burned and painted swastikas on yeshiva buildings in my state of New York. Discussing the political influence of Jews and pro-Israel groups, including some that have considerable evangelical Christian support, should surely be done delicately, but we can\u2019t pretend an insensitive tweet about politics is in the same universe as support for white supremacy, as McCarthy preposterously asserted. We need to be honest about what is truly antisemitic and what are inconvenient facts of Washington. I was raised Jewish, so while everyone should be deeply concerned about antisemitism, I know the issue affects me personally. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned about Judaism, it\u2019s that standing up against hate and oppression is about the best thing I can do to honor Jewish history. That\u2019s why I, along with many American Jews, support BDS and unapologetically condemn the current government of Israel for its heinous treatment of Palestinians. J Street, a moderate pro-Israel group that has a Pac that spends a lot of money on politics, is right: we must recognize antisemitic tropes, but \u201celected officials should also refrain from labeling all criticism of Israeli actions or policies as \u2018antisemitic,\u2019 in a transparent effort to silence legitimate discussion and debate\u201d. Labeling anyone who speaks of Jews and money in the same sentence an antisemite weakens our fight against the real antisemitic, neo-Nazi, and other white nationalist forces that have seen a resurgence in recent years. It also stifles legitimate discussions about the enormous power of special interests, something that threatens our democratic political system. We must speak honestly about the issues Ilhan Omar has raised. In an era of unprecedented corruption in Washington, we can\u2019t afford not to.

Seiji Iimura, a fifth-generation bonsai cultivator, and his wife, Fuyumi, alerted police last month after the miniature trees went missing from their garden in Saitama, near Tokyo. They included a 400-year-old shimpaku juniper \u2013 a variety prized by collectors that is worth at least 6m yen (\u00a342,000), according to the Asahi Shimbun. It appears the thieves had the expertise to target the most expensive tree among the 3,000 the couple keep on display in their 5,000 sq metre garden, which is open to visitors. Iimura described the stolen trees as \u201chousehold treasures\u201d, while Fuyumi said they had raised them \u201clike our children\u201d. \u201cI am filled with sadness and heartache,\u201d she wrote on Facebook.

      "bodyText": "Inflation dropped to 1.8% last month following the biggest monthly fall in gas prices since the 1980s, to offer hard-pressed British consumers some respite from rising prices ahead of Brexit. The consumer prices index (CPI) fell from 2.1% in December to its lowest level in two years as wholesale energy prices tumbled, cutting heating bills for millions of households. Business groups described the fall as \u201ca boon for the economy\u201d just as it attempts to weather the effects of Brexit uncertainty, while the TUC said it should improve workers living standards during a period when Brexit was \u201charming confidence in the economy and putting living standards at risk\u201d. Steep falls in petrol prices, down 2.1p month on month, and lower hotel costs also helped reduce pressure on prices, the Office for National Statistics said. However, the biggest ever monthly fall in gas prices since comparable records began in 1988, which coincided with the start of energy regulator Ofgem\u2019s cap on household bills, was the largest factor in January\u2019s inflation fall. Energy prices had been rising a year earlier, before steadily falling over the course of 2018. Between December 2018 and January 2019, consumer prices for gas fell by 8.5%, the biggest fall in three decades. The latest fall in inflation marks the end of a long run of price rises above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target for CPI. The fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote had pushed inflation higher, squeezing household disposable income as it pushed up the cost of imported goods. Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, above the level of pay growth for British workers, although it has gradually fallen. If wage growth holds steady at the pace recorded most recently in November, the fall in inflation during January would push real pay growth up to 1.4%, the fastest since 2016, said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics. Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThe pronounced drop in inflation this month \u2013 driven by sharp falls in energy prices \u2013 marks the first time that it has been below the Bank of England target in two years. \u201cThis will provide a welcome boost to people\u2019s spending power and means that next month we\u2019re likely to see real wage growth of around 1.5%, the fastest since mid-2016,\u201d he added. \u201cThis cannot come too soon for households, with average earnings yet to be restored to their pre-crisis levels.\u201d While the current capped rate for energy prices is effective until the end of March, it was announced earlier this month that it would rise by 10%, drawing criticism of the price cap for the government. About 15m households will see their energy bills increase by more than \u00a3100 a year from April after Ofgem said it was lifting two price caps because of rising wholesale costs. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said he expects inflation to stay modestly below 2% for much, if not all, of 2019: \u201cWe see inflation averaging 1.8% over 2019 and it could very well get as low as 1.6% during the year.\u201d However, he added: \u201cIf there is a no-deal UK exit from the EU at the end of March, the inflation outlook will be clouded by a number of factors \u2013 most notably what happens to sterling, how well the economy holds up and what tariffs come into effect. \u201cOur suspicion is that inflation will spike significantly higher if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cLower inflation should be good news for workers.

After being elevated to the top job in October after two years as Dean Smith\u2019s assistant, he has overseen a run of eight defeats in 10 games, immediately followed by 10 unbeaten, in the middle of which came personal and professional bereavement.</p> <p>Frank had been in the job only a month when, as he was waiting at a leadership conference to meet his friend Rob Rowan, Brentford\u2019s technical director, he got a call from the club\u2019s co-director of football Phil Giles. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/13/robert-rowan-brentford-technical-director-dies-aged-28\" title=\"\">Rowan had died in his sleep</a> of what turned out to be heart failure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/12/paul-scholes-oldham-yeovil-league-two-one-championship-roundup\">Paul Scholes gets off to a flyer at Oldham with 4-1 win over Yeovil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d Frank says, quietly, recalling how he had to quickly find somewhere private to process his shock. \u201cHe was a very close friend. He was a guy who was very easy to like, because he was so open, so often smiling, but always with extremely high knowledge about football.\u201d</p> <p>The two men talked about the future, knowing that wherever they would be in 10 years, they would probably still be friends. \u201cI think we\u2019re a very human club.

When we take the gear from the training field in it has to be put right into the container not just dropped on the floor. It\u2019s basics in life, like I teach my children to take their plate into the kitchen.\u201d A few other things were tweaked, some key men returned from injury, a formation switch to 3-4-3 was implemented, and the 10-match run that has righted a floundering season followed before Saturday\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41dc893334298be4df9e1f21c045598ce94f63ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41dc893334298be4df9e1f21c045598ce94f63ae/0_29_2448_1468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neal Maupay, left, and Ollie Watkins are expected to be among the next Brentford players to be sold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neal Maupay, left, and Ollie Watkins are expected to be among the next Brentford players to be sold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TGSPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frank looks a bit like Filippo Inzaghi, if he had spent his 20s in academia rather than riotously celebrating three-yard tap-ins.

But on closer inspection, voter ID discriminates against people who are unable to provide identification with the ease that ministers, civil servants and most people take for granted \u2013 and naively think we all possess.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a> clearly demonstrated, many British citizens do not have official documentation, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/tories-id-voting-booths-labour-disadvantaged-ballot-box\" title=\"\">3.5 million electors</a> (7.5% of the electorate) do not have any photo ID.</p> <p>It was therefore hardly surprising that hundreds of voters across five pilot areas were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/03/uk-voters-turned-away-polling-stations-id-trial\" title=\"\">denied their right to vote</a> in last year\u2019s local elections. Their crime? Not possessing the right ID. We must also consider that voter impersonation is an incredibly rare event. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/30/compulsory-voter-id-uk-government-urged-halt-plans-vulnerable-disadvantaged-charities-warn\" title=\"\">28 allegations</a> of voter impersonation were made, for which one person was convicted, out of more than 44 million votes cast.</p> <p>Universal suffrage (the right to vote for all adult citizens, regardless of property ownership, income, race or ethnicity) is a concept that lies at the very heart of our democracy.</p> <p>These voting rights were not freely given: indeed, they were hard fought for over hundreds of years by brave, courageous people, who were subject to intimidation, imprisonment and brutal abuse, many of whom died for the democracy that we take for granted today.</p> <p>Therefore, as citizens, we are duty bound to question the motives of a government that would prescribe a solution that would erode fundamental rights that lie at the heart of our democracy, to combat a problem that barely exists.</p> <p>The government often refers to Northern Ireland as an example to defend the rollout of voter ID in the rest of the United Kingdom \u2013 but this example just reinforces the points I have been making.</p> <p>Northern Ireland has previously experienced high levels of documented impersonation at the polls. For example, in the 1983 general election, <a href=\"https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/a-sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut-the-2018-voter-id-trials/\" title=\"\">almost 1,000 people</a> turned up to vote only to find that someone else had voted in their place. It was therefore a proportionate response to introduce voter ID. They also took all possible steps to mitigate the discriminatory effects, by introducing a free, easy to obtain photo-identity card, something that will not be on offer in England.</p> <p>In addition, there is the contemptuous way this government is trying to bypass parliamentary scrutiny to introduce voter ID, by using, perhaps unlawfully, the provisions contained within the Representation of the People Act 2000, that were clearly intended to allow the running of pilots to test for ways of increasing voter turnout.</p> <p>We all want to see secure elections, free from fraud, in our country. Would it not simply be a better, more efficient and a more democratic solution to increase the penalties for the crime of voter \u201cpersonation\u201d, and publicise them on polling cards and at polling stations?</p> <p>While the government wastes time trying to introduce voter ID, it is ignoring very real threats to our electoral system, such as foreign influence in elections and unregulated digital advertising on Facebook.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/foreign-influence-not-voter-fraud-is-the-biggest-threat-to-our-democracy/\" title=\"\">Darren Hughes</a> observed in an article for the Times: \u201cThe reality is that, for anyone set on rigging an election, it is far easier to pump cash into political campaigns and digital adverts than to tour constituencies in an overcoat pretending to be someone else.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not wealthy, so I\u2019ve launched a campaign with <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/defending-our-democracy-say-no-to-voter-id/\" title=\"\">crowdjustice.com</a> to raise the \u00a340,000 in funds needed to cover my legal costs to bring this case. Our hard-won fundamental rights are being unnecessarily denied and I\u2019m proud to defend our democracy. </p> <p>\u2022 Neil Coughlan is an Essex resident who is taking the government to the high court over its plans to introduce voter ID</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/04/voter-id-trials-in-england-face-legal-challenge\">Voter ID trials in England face legal challenge</a> </p> </aside>",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, I received a date to attend the high court to fight against the government\u2019s dangerous voter ID plans. This case is particularly significant for everyone who lives in my community because next May, for the first time ever, we will be asked to show identification in order to cast our vote at the local government election. Braintree district council, my local authority in Essex, is one of 10 boroughs across England taking part in the government\u2019s pilot scheme, before it plans to roll out voter ID at the next general election. At first glance, these measures could appear reasonable, fair and innocuous. But on closer inspection, voter ID discriminates against people who are unable to provide identification with the ease that ministers, civil servants and most people take for granted \u2013 and naively think we all possess. As the Windrush scandal clearly demonstrated, many British citizens do not have official documentation, in fact, 3.5 million electors (7.5% of the electorate) do not have any photo ID. It was therefore hardly surprising that hundreds of voters across five pilot areas were denied their right to vote in last year\u2019s local elections. Their crime? Not possessing the right ID. We must also consider that voter impersonation is an incredibly rare event. In 2017, 28 allegations of voter impersonation were made, for which one person was convicted, out of more than 44 million votes cast. Universal suffrage (the right to vote for all adult citizens, regardless of property ownership, income, race or ethnicity) is a concept that lies at the very heart of our democracy. These voting rights were not freely given: indeed, they were hard fought for over hundreds of years by brave, courageous people, who were subject to intimidation, imprisonment and brutal abuse, many of whom died for the democracy that we take for granted today. Therefore, as citizens, we are duty bound to question the motives of a government that would prescribe a solution that would erode fundamental rights that lie at the heart of our democracy, to combat a problem that barely exists. The government often refers to Northern Ireland as an example to defend the rollout of voter ID in the rest of the United Kingdom \u2013 but this example just reinforces the points I have been making. Northern Ireland has previously experienced high levels of documented impersonation at the polls. For example, in the 1983 general election, almost 1,000 people turned up to vote only to find that someone else had voted in their place. It was therefore a proportionate response to introduce voter ID. They also took all possible steps to mitigate the discriminatory effects, by introducing a free, easy to obtain photo-identity card, something that will not be on offer in England. In addition, there is the contemptuous way this government is trying to bypass parliamentary scrutiny to introduce voter ID, by using, perhaps unlawfully, the provisions contained within the Representation of the People Act 2000, that were clearly intended to allow the running of pilots to test for ways of increasing voter turnout. We all want to see secure elections, free from fraud, in our country. Would it not simply be a better, more efficient and a more democratic solution to increase the penalties for the crime of voter \u201cpersonation\u201d, and publicise them on polling cards and at polling stations? While the government wastes time trying to introduce voter ID, it is ignoring very real threats to our electoral system, such as foreign influence in elections and unregulated digital advertising on Facebook. As Darren Hughes observed in an article for the Times: \u201cThe reality is that, for anyone set on rigging an election, it is far easier to pump cash into political campaigns and digital adverts than to tour constituencies in an overcoat pretending to be someone else.\u201d I\u2019m not wealthy, so I\u2019ve launched a campaign with crowdjustice.com to raise the \u00a340,000 in funds needed to cover my legal costs to bring this case. Our hard-won fundamental rights are being unnecessarily denied and I\u2019m proud to defend our democracy. \u2022 Neil Coughlan is an Essex resident who is taking the government to the high court over its plans to introduce voter ID",

Certainly, a Fox broadcaster claimed \u201cthe hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin\u2019s death as George Zimmerman was\u201d. While the case is extreme, in the UK, too, the hoodie has become a highly politicised and racialised item of apparel.</p> <p>Over the years, shopping malls including the Trafford Centre in Manchester and the Elephant and Castle shopping centre in south London introduced hoodie bans to combat what they see as intimidating groups of youths. The Children\u2019s Society has described such bans as \u201cblatant discrimination based on stereotypes and prejudices\u201d. Likewise, scores of black men and boys have told me stories of being harassed by the police or followed by shop detectives simply because they have been wearing a hoodie. How do they know this?

But today, in the context of rising knife crime \u2013 which is widely framed as black men killing one another \u2013 both the hoodie and the black male wearing it have come to be seen as emblems of violence: the image of a black guy in a hoodie as a violent thug has permeated our public consciousness. It is true that black men are disproportionately affected by knife crime. However, no black boy was born with a knife in his hand.

      "body": "<p>Over the weekend, I awoke to raging sinusitis. After calling my GP\u2019s surgery, I was told to log an appointment request on their new online system. Navigating the platform was easy enough until I was confronted with a barrage of multiple-choice questions. My mucus wasn\u2019t quite yellow, nor could it be described as green. Yes, my neck was stiff, but surely that didn\u2019t mean meningitis? And if I bend over, I think my headache gets worse \u2026 In the end I became more anxious than ill, which I guess is one way of treating a sore throat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Medical practitioners are so overworked that some have confessed that the NHS is draining them of their humanity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While plugging in my ill-fitting symptoms, I wondered about those with mobility impairment in their hands, or a visual impairment, or a small child demanding their immediate attention. Sometimes all patients need is to talk to a real, live human being \u2013 something that is becoming increasingly harder to do in everyday life.</p> <p>This week also marked the release of the <a href=\"https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/HEE-Topol-Review-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">watershed Topol review for the NHS</a>. The report outlines recommendations for the NHS on how to make use of digital tools for better healthcare outcomes. However, I worry that solutions to issues such as drug resistance and poor medication-taking by patients focus too heavily on digitally inspired sticking plasters, rather than person-centric approaches such as increasing the time spent with your GP.</p> <p>For instance, digital solutions abound for the <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/matt-hancock-2019-speech-at-world-economic-forum-in-davos/\" title=\"\">burgeoning drug resistance crisis</a>. The NHS is opting to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/antibiotic-resistance-nhs-drug-matt-hancock-davos-infection-amr-a8743331.html\" title=\"\">monitor prescriptions digitally</a>, while in the US, the Food &amp; Drug Administration has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/health/digital-pill-fda.html\" title=\"\">approved the world\u2019s first \u201cdigital pill\u201d</a> to monitor whether or when patients take their medication. (The NHS is also <a href=\"https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news/lloydspharmacy-tackle-adherence-smart-pill-launch\" title=\"\">interested in digital pills</a> with Lloyds pharmacy piloting a limited rollout in 2013.)</p> <p>After the social revolution of contraceptive pill, the digital pill promises to transform medical care. Drugs are digitised by embedding a Silicon Valley sensor into a pharmaceutical tablet. When swallowed, the sensor transmits a signal that records the fact that the medication has been taken on to a patch worn by the patient. With the patient\u2019s consent, this patch transmits the data to the patient\u2019s mobile device, their doctor\u2019s, and up to four other people.</p> <p>If doctors can see exactly how patients are taking their medication, the thinking goes, patients will not be as likely to fail to complete a course, or share drugs with friends and family \u2013 both of which are causes of drug resistance and poor health outcomes. Currently in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_report/en/inde x.html\" title=\"\">50% of patients don\u2019t take their medication properly</a>, costing the NHS more <a href=\"https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/opinion/insight/health-literacy-medication-adherence-and-thriving-healthcare-systems-connecting-the-dots/20203831.article\" title=\"\">than \u00a3500m annually</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/12/nhs-privatisers-competition-authority\">The NHS lives by co-operation.

Digitally monitoring medical staff and patients misses a crucial point: prescribing and taking drugs takes place in the context of the doctor-patient relationship. If beliefs about medication and patient concerns are not addressed in a sensitive and engaging way, no amount of digital monitoring will help. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11679023\" title=\"\">Studies suggest</a> that the quality, duration and frequency of interaction between doctor and patient as well as the doctor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1661624/\" title=\"\">openness to patients\u2019 questions</a> all affect how the patient will follow whatever they\u2019ve been advised.

      "bodyText": "Over the weekend, I awoke to raging sinusitis. After calling my GP\u2019s surgery, I was told to log an appointment request on their new online system. Navigating the platform was easy enough until I was confronted with a barrage of multiple-choice questions. My mucus wasn\u2019t quite yellow, nor could it be described as green. Yes, my neck was stiff, but surely that didn\u2019t mean meningitis? And if I bend over, I think my headache gets worse \u2026 In the end I became more anxious than ill, which I guess is one way of treating a sore throat. While plugging in my ill-fitting symptoms, I wondered about those with mobility impairment in their hands, or a visual impairment, or a small child demanding their immediate attention. Sometimes all patients need is to talk to a real, live human being \u2013 something that is becoming increasingly harder to do in everyday life. This week also marked the release of the watershed Topol review for the NHS. The report outlines recommendations for the NHS on how to make use of digital tools for better healthcare outcomes. However, I worry that solutions to issues such as drug resistance and poor medication-taking by patients focus too heavily on digitally inspired sticking plasters, rather than person-centric approaches such as increasing the time spent with your GP. For instance, digital solutions abound for the burgeoning drug resistance crisis. The NHS is opting to monitor prescriptions digitally, while in the US, the Food &amp; Drug Administration has approved the world\u2019s first \u201cdigital pill\u201d to monitor whether or when patients take their medication. (The NHS is also interested in digital pills with Lloyds pharmacy piloting a limited rollout in 2013.) After the social revolution of contraceptive pill, the digital pill promises to transform medical care. Drugs are digitised by embedding a Silicon Valley sensor into a pharmaceutical tablet. When swallowed, the sensor transmits a signal that records the fact that the medication has been taken on to a patch worn by the patient. With the patient\u2019s consent, this patch transmits the data to the patient\u2019s mobile device, their doctor\u2019s, and up to four other people. If doctors can see exactly how patients are taking their medication, the thinking goes, patients will not be as likely to fail to complete a course, or share drugs with friends and family \u2013 both of which are causes of drug resistance and poor health outcomes. Currently in the UK, 50% of patients don\u2019t take their medication properly, costing the NHS more than \u00a3500m annually. But a purely digital approach is not enough. Digitally monitoring medical staff and patients misses a crucial point: prescribing and taking drugs takes place in the context of the doctor-patient relationship. If beliefs about medication and patient concerns are not addressed in a sensitive and engaging way, no amount of digital monitoring will help. Studies suggest that the quality, duration and frequency of interaction between doctor and patient as well as the doctor\u2019s openness to patients\u2019 questions all affect how the patient will follow whatever they\u2019ve been advised. When medics have more time with their patients, they are better able to discuss the benefits and disadvantages of prescriptions, and end up prescribing less. Of course, this type of relationship between doctors and patients needs time and continuity, two elements that are sorely lacking in the NHS. Medical practitioners are so overworked that some have confessed that the NHS is draining them of their humanity. Not only are they barred from engaging in valuable, empathetic patient care, but they are also pressured into prescribing more antibiotics when working against the clock. While comprehensive reports such as the Topol review are an encouraging step forward, concerted efforts are needed to show how digital technologies result in concrete contact hours between medical staff and patients. Eventually, my doctor\u2019s website scheduled a telephone consultation. After a 150-second call with an audibly exhausted GP, I was prescribed antibiotics. Those few minutes were the first and possibly last time we\u2019d ever speak. He was unable to examine me and to check whether I had a bacterial infection. My consultation was a worrisome reminder that medicine is more than an analytic exercise in diagnosis and prescription, it\u2019s an art. \u2022 Lienkie Diedericks is a researcher and PhD candidate at King\u2019s College London",

      "bodyText": "Water flows at key environmental sites in the Murray-Darling Basin are unimproved or worse than before the basin plan was implemented, a scientific report has found, raising serious questions about where the $8.5bn of environmental water purchased by taxpayers is going. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, a group of eminent environmental scientists formed a decade ago to advocate for the river system, have looked at two key sites which they identified when the plan was put in place in 2010. They have found that environmental flows are not meeting the government\u2019s own objectives for improving the health of the river at these sites. At one site flows have actually declined, compared to pre-plan days. The work, the first time anyone \u2013 including the Murray-Darling Basin Authority \u2013 has tried to look in detail at progress against the plan\u2019s own environmental objectives, paints a worrying picture of whether the plan is working. In coming up with the environmental water recovery targets in the plan, the federal government identified 122 indicator sites \u2013 sites that needed more flows to ensure biodiversity was preserved or restored. These included wetlands and other sensitive or degraded parts of the river. They then identified the sorts of flows that were needed to mimic nature to restore the ecology. These included overall volumes as well as small pulse flows and occasional floods. The fish kills at Menindee in January on an unprecedented scale have sounded alarm bells about whether the plan is actually working to restore the health of Australia\u2019s most important river system. In recent weeks, the Wentworth group has analysed in detail two sites \u2013 one at Wilcannia in the Lower Darling, 200km above Menindee and another at Chowilla on the Murray in South Australia \u2013 to see what is happening. It found that in the case of the Wilcannia site, two out of three of the desired flow outcomes had failed to be achieved. \u201cOnly small flows have passed the target, with base flows and large flows failing to achieve hydrological conditions assumed necessary for ecological restoration,\u201d the report said. In the case of the floodplains at Chowilla, none of the indicators met the five targets and the flows were failing to achieve requirements for ecological restoration. A spokesman for the Wentworth group, Prof Jamie Pittock from Australian National University, said that despite 2,016GL of water being recovered for the environment (63% of that envisaged under the basin plan) at a cost of $8.5bn, the environmental flow targets had failed to be achieved. And this was during the relatively wet period from 2010-2018. The report says that \u201cin general annual average flows can be up to 40% and 60% smaller than expected under the Basin Plan. Observed flows are similar to or less than the baseline (pre-Basin Plan) model results, revealing that instead of an increase, there has actually been no improvement or even a decline in water flows since the implementation of the Basin Plan.\u201d Pittock said that the results were disastrous for the environmental health of the river. He said the result at Wilcannia, where two of three indicators were not met \u2013 including the overall flows \u2013 suggested the plan was going the wrong way. \u201cThe failure to meet the targets is likely due to low flows being pumped by irrigators upstream under the NSW government\u2019s dodgy water sharing plan,\u201d he said. The Chowilla site was picked because it is a sensitive floodplain which needs to be regularly inundated to ensure that wetlands and river red gums survive. Pittock said the watering was just not occurring because both the NSW and Victorian governments had failed to deal with constraints as promised along the river that meant insufficient water could be assembled to ensure the Murray overflowed its banks and watered the floodplain. These constraints include bridges and roads that might get flooded, or town levies that need to be raised to allow the big flows to be released for the environment. Asked what would happen to the Chowilla floodplains if the environmental watering targets were not achieved, Pittock said wetlands could die in a couple of years, and river red gum forests over the next few decades. \u201cIt\u2019s an awful trajectory and the government must change course,\u201d he said. The Murray\u2013Darling Basin Authority said it acknowledged the report contained useful pieces of analysis. \u201cWe would not expect flows across the Basin to fully reflect Basin Plan modelling at this stage of implementation. Eight seasons in the context of a highly variable climate is not long enough to draw statistically significant conclusions in comparison to a 114-year modelled period,\u201d it said. The Wentworth group was also highly critical of the authority\u2019s lack of monitoring, saying it looked at overall flows but not the all-important pulse flows that the plan itself identifies as needed. The group has called for the authority to urgently evaluate the success of its water recovery efforts using an approach which takes into account variable climate.",

It\u2019s a great stadium sport. It\u2019s fun to watch. It\u2019s a great exciting game that\u2019s in constant motion.

The game was thousands of miles away <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTyAh2fwtJI\">in San Diego</a> so the <a href=\"https://www.pignwhistleon36th.com/\">Pig and Whistle on West 36th</a> was busy. There was a watch party upstairs and an array of screens downstairs. A slice of the committed New York City rugby community was there, happily drunk and drunker.</p> <p>But there were also locals, surprised but intrigued by the game on the screens and the convivial noise in the bar. A couple of Knicks fans stopped in, on the way to watch their team <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=401071415\">lose to Miami</a> at Madison Square Garden nearby. One tapped the Guardian on the shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cThis rugby?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/28/hr-mcmaster-rugby-warrior-ethos\">HR McMaster on rugby: 'The warrior ethos is what a good team has'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Variations of the question, prompted by on-field calls, were asked by a friend in from Mamaroneck and generously keen to learn. Yes, he\u2019s allowed to hit him like that. No, he\u2019s not allowed to do that with the ball on the floor. Who knows why that was a penalty at the scrum: your guess is as good as mine.</p> <p>So much for rugby\u2019s fiendish minutiae. The main impression was that the product looked good \u2013 <a href=\"https://usdtoreros.com/sports/2018/5/23/facilities-torero-stadium-html.aspx\">Torero Stadium</a> is a neat college facility with good camera angles \u2013 and was fast and action-packed.</p> <p>It was also raw as hell, with tackles missed, passes dropped and kicks scuffed or sliced. But at this stage in MLR\u2019s life, that was a wonderful thing.</p> <p>At a key point in the second half, San Diego fly-half Joe Pietersen made a slashing break from his own half and went 60 thrilling metres, New Yorkers skittering after him. Eventually they staunched the flow, because Pietersen didn\u2019t put his wing away for the score. Along with a potentially contentious penalty try, it was enough to give RUNY a debut win.</p> <p>Looking on, it seemed inescapable that in the English Premiership, or in the Pro 14, or in France, or even in Super Rugby, 99 times in 100 Pietersen would not have made that break. He would have stepped, perhaps, but he would have stepped right into a proper clattering, squashed by some hulking blindside monster.</p> <p>MLR defences are not so organised and the bodies that staff them are not so big and fit. And so, with a shimmy and a flash, Pietersen was off to be chased and brought to ground. It was great stadium sport.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX0fjF26CoA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vX0fjF26CoA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Nola Gold 40-31 Glendale Raptors.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In every sense, MLR is rugby in the raw.

This year the league is up to nine teams from seven; the salary cap, still tiny in international terms, has increased; and each team can have 10 foreign players, up from five in year one. Progress necessitates diversity: Canadians don\u2019t count as foreigners but Irishmen, Frenchmen, Uruguayans and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/sport/rugby-united-new-york-major-league-rugby-spt-intl/index.html\">Ben Foden</a> do.

      "bodyText": "Recently, Major League Rugby commissioner Dean Howes called rugby union \u201ca great stadium sport\u201d. After three rounds of America\u2019s MLR season two, Nola Gold lead the ladder unbeaten. They play at Archbishop Shaw in New Orleans, home to high-school football, not yet by any standards a great sports stadium. Bleachers and park fencing sit either side of a simple turf field, rugby lines marked in yellow. Elsewhere, teams play at minor-league ballparks (Austin Elite, Rugby United New York, Houston SaberCats for now) or small multisport arenas (Seattle Seawolves, Toronto Arrows, San Diego Legion, Utah Warriors). Only the Glendale Raptors have a purpose-built home, although Houston are building another. One way to tell Infinity Park near Denver was made for rugby is that the markings on the pitch are clear: there are no soccer penalty boxes or lacrosse creases to confuse the casual viewer. Howes\u2019 quote to the AFP, however, should be run in full. \u201cI think rugby has the potential to be a top-tier sport. It\u2019s a great stadium sport. It\u2019s fun to watch. It\u2019s a great exciting game that\u2019s in constant motion. Rugby has the attributes of a sport that translates very well in person and on TV. We just need to convert more people to the sport. And as we expose more people to the sport, we will convert them.\u201d Conversions \u2013 and tries, penalties and drop goals, obviously \u2013 are what MLR is all about. And on this Six Nations rest weekend, European fans and fans elsewhere should be prepared to give it a go. Thanks to Facebook, which streams games internationally while CBS Sports Network, ESPN+ and local providers take care of business Stateside, they can. To catch up, there\u2019s also a well-stocked YouTube channel. One cold dark night in late January, fans in New York watched their team make their MLR debut. The game was thousands of miles away in San Diego so the Pig and Whistle on West 36th was busy. There was a watch party upstairs and an array of screens downstairs. A slice of the committed New York City rugby community was there, happily drunk and drunker. But there were also locals, surprised but intrigued by the game on the screens and the convivial noise in the bar. A couple of Knicks fans stopped in, on the way to watch their team lose to Miami at Madison Square Garden nearby. One tapped the Guardian on the shoulder. \u201cThis rugby?\u201d Variations of the question, prompted by on-field calls, were asked by a friend in from Mamaroneck and generously keen to learn. Yes, he\u2019s allowed to hit him like that. No, he\u2019s not allowed to do that with the ball on the floor. Who knows why that was a penalty at the scrum: your guess is as good as mine. So much for rugby\u2019s fiendish minutiae. The main impression was that the product looked good \u2013 Torero Stadium is a neat college facility with good camera angles \u2013 and was fast and action-packed. It was also raw as hell, with tackles missed, passes dropped and kicks scuffed or sliced. But at this stage in MLR\u2019s life, that was a wonderful thing. At a key point in the second half, San Diego fly-half Joe Pietersen made a slashing break from his own half and went 60 thrilling metres, New Yorkers skittering after him. Eventually they staunched the flow, because Pietersen didn\u2019t put his wing away for the score. Along with a potentially contentious penalty try, it was enough to give RUNY a debut win. Looking on, it seemed inescapable that in the English Premiership, or in the Pro 14, or in France, or even in Super Rugby, 99 times in 100 Pietersen would not have made that break. He would have stepped, perhaps, but he would have stepped right into a proper clattering, squashed by some hulking blindside monster. MLR defences are not so organised and the bodies that staff them are not so big and fit. And so, with a shimmy and a flash, Pietersen was off to be chased and brought to ground. It was great stadium sport. In every sense, MLR is rugby in the raw. In New Orleans, fans can sit on a bleacher and shuck an oyster and watch internationals like USA No8 Cam Dolan smash about a few short yards away. Years ago, I got to watch England v Italy from the touchline at Twickenham, surviving to report that Danny Grewcock running into Mark Giacheri makes a noise like some undersea tectonic belch. MLR offers that kind of immediacy week in, week out. Perhaps it won\u2019t always do so. This year the league is up to nine teams from seven; the salary cap, still tiny in international terms, has increased; and each team can have 10 foreign players, up from five in year one. Progress necessitates diversity: Canadians don\u2019t count as foreigners but Irishmen, Frenchmen, Uruguayans and Ben Foden do. Next year, Old Glory DC, New England Free Jacks and an as yet unnamed Atlanta team will enter, stretching the talent pool further. Howes has said the model is Major League Soccer: steady growth from grass roots to the big(ish) time. If MLR achieves that, its players will move further away from their fans. But for now they are very close indeed, in a pro competition tied close to the old club game. It\u2019s not a new idea: PRO Rugby, which ceased after one season in 2016, also tried to capture the corinthian spirit. But it is evidently a strong idea, creating a unique product we may one day mourn for lost. In America, rugby union is a great club sport that dreams of filling the greatest stadiums. Worldwide, fans can watch it try for free.",

      "body": "<p>Spend enough time in Churchill, and you will hear the stories.</p> <p>Of hearing a noise outside, pulling open the drapes and seeing a polar bear looking in through the window.</p> <p>Of walking around a corner at night, coming face-to-face with a bear and, implausibly, scaring it off with the strobe light on a cellphone.</p> <p>Of encountering an old man with a walker, determinedly clacking past a puzzled bear that peered at him from behind a rock and muttering defiantly: \u201cIf it gets me, it gets me.\u201d</p> <p>Of being about to, against all better judgment, walk the couple of hundred yards from restaurant to hotel room at night, only to be pulled back by a warning that a pair of polar bears had been spotted across the street.</p> <p>(OK, the last story is mine. The line between being a teller of tales and the subject of an obituary can be thinner than one might like.)</p> <p>Such is everyday life, particularly during October and November, in this small town on the shores of Canada\u2019s Hudson Bay. A little more than 1,000 miles north of the provincial capital of Winnipeg, Churchill is not just remote, it is defiantly so, accessible overland only by rail, its residents bonded by the conjoined challenges of living on the fringes of the Arctic and sharing their streets with the largest land carnivore in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d794b1251086b2d34e6ce1fa3d7f825b3cff66b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d794b1251086b2d34e6ce1fa3d7f825b3cff66b8/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: All Canada Photos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you were to build a town today, you would never put it here,\u201d explains Geoff York of Polar Bears International, a research and advocacy organization whose members, understandably, spend much time in Churchill each year. \u201cPolar bears are creatures of the sea ice, and they come ashore in the summer here when the sea ice on Hudson Bay melts and then they wait for the ice to return.\u201d That return tends to begin sometime in November; by October, the bears are already stirring, wandering in anticipation toward the bay along a route that takes them past, and sometimes directly through, Churchill.</p> <p>From a cold war peak of about 5,000 people, when it hosted a military base, Churchill is now home to roughly 900 year-round inhabitants, slightly more than half of whom are Native. Theirs can be a harsh and at times tenuous existence, one that is leavened by the income from tourists who come to gaze at the northern lights in the winter, paddle among the hundreds of belugas that throng the river in summer and, in October and November, visit the polar bear capital of the world.</p> <p>Polar bears have made Churchill famous, and led to it being dubbed the <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/3982336/tourism-industry-in-churchill-taking-hit-since-rail-line-wash-out-last-spring/\">\u201cjewel of Manitoba\u201d</a> and one of the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/canada/places-of-a-lifetime/\">top destinations in Canada</a>. But as it emerges from the most testing two years in its modern history, Churchill may be about to embark on an entirely different path, as this frequently frigid community considers embracing a warmer future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dee5781d6675daadac154409f95faabbfc671baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dee5781d6675daadac154409f95faabbfc671baa/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tour groups view polar bears along the Hudson Bay on a cloudy autumn morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tour groups view polar bears along the Hudson Bay on a cloudy autumn morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Souders/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is estimated that about 10,000 people descend upon Churchill annually during the five- or six-week \u201cbear season\u201d. The bulk of bear viewing takes place on the tundra outside of town, from the safety of bespoke vehicles approximately the size of school buses atop airport fire truck wheels, the immense size of which enables the trucks to traverse treacherous terrain and keep their occupants beyond the reach of even the largest and most curious bear.</p> <p>The challenge for Churchill residents is to encourage the bears to head to the tundra without tarrying in town. In the past, the policy was less one of deterrence than immediate destruction. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was common for conservation officers to shoot 25 bears a season,\u201d explains the mayor, Mike Spence, who is of Cree and Scottish descent. These days, the community, in conjunction with the Manitoba department of conservation, employs a different approach: the Polar Bear Alert Program.</p> <p>Signs around the town remind residents and visitors alike to exercise caution and report bear sightings on the hotline \u2013 675-BEAR. Culvert traps, baited with seal scent, line the perimeter of the community; bears that are caught in them are taken to a holding facility, popularly known as the polar bear jail, where they are held for up to 30 days (without food, to enhance the deterrence factor of the experience), before being drugged and helicoptered to a spot safely away from town \u2013 or, if late enough in the season, on to the sea ice.</p> <p>If a bear does make it past the perimeter defense and into town conservation officers\u2019 first plan is to help it on its way, motivating it to leave by firing cracker shells (loud, blank shotgun shells) and following it with vehicles. Only the recalcitrant and the repeat offenders are incarcerated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"43395dd881e564e5dd6c18b59d3327d9e35767ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43395dd881e564e5dd6c18b59d3327d9e35767ca/0_0_5415_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A polar bear at a car window in Churchill, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A polar bear at a car window in Churchill, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Konrad Wothe/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For residents, living with polar bears is an unavoidable fact of life, and one that instils an understandable caution. As one former resident once said to me with a chuckle: \u201cIn Winnipeg, they say you can tell when someone is from Churchill because they always look carefully before walking around a corner.\u201d</p> <p>House and vehicle doors are always unlocked, should anyone need to fling one open and leap to shelter. As much as they can, residents simply avoid peak bear sites \u2013 anywhere along the coast or the riverbanks, in the willows on the edge of town, alleyways \u2013 especially at night, and particularly during peak bear season. For some, however, that isn\u2019t always an option. Parker Fitzpatrick works for Manitoba Hydro, the provincial utility company, and if a line is down, he and his team have to repair it, no matter when and where. As a result, they exercise due caution.</p> <p>\u201cYou try your hardest to not put yourself in that predicament,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut if you have to go out in an area that\u2019s a bad area or where bears have been spotted, and there\u2019s a line down, I always get resources: set up security fences, for example, and carry shotguns with cracker shells.

The challenge isn\u2019t posed by a renovated railway, but by the prospect of a refurbished and revitalized port, the decrepit husk of which looms over the town. In the past, the port regularly exported grain and provided diesel fuel to remote Nunavut communities, but the new owners have <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/churchill-port-rail-owners-hudson-bay-line-1.4810683\">a much grander vision</a>: of links to Europe and India and the possible export of oil and gas.</p> <p>\u201cA few years ago, OmniTrax raised the prospect of shipping oil through the community, and unequivocally the community was resolutely against doing so for a number of reasons, the biggest one being that the shipping industry at the time was ill-equipped to deal with the prospect of accidents or disasters,\u201d said John Gunter of Frontiers North Adventures, one of the premier ecotourism companies in town. \u201cSo, it looks like we\u2019ll have to deal with that prospect again in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, for a port in an Arctic environment to become truly viable, it will require shipping lanes that aren\u2019t clogged with ice much of the year; and so Churchill may ultimately find itself as both the most famous home of the ultimate icon of climate change and a community that, in the words of Spence, \u201cwill have to take advantage\u201d of that warming climate.</p> <p>\u201cThe Northwest Passage offers a 7,000km shortcut from New Jersey to Shanghai,\u201d Murad al-Katib, CEO of Arctic Gateway, <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/4623913/climate-change-could-have-positive-impacts-for-churchills-port/\">said at the railway reopening ceremony</a>. \u201cChurchill is the only commercial deep-water port in northern Canada, and climate change has extended the shipping season.\u201d It is a view cautiously echoed by many in town, even as they express anxiety about not losing what makes Churchill unique.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not against oil, because I think it can be done safely,\u201d said Daley. \u201cWith global warming and the strait open more often, I think there\u2019s a market for it. But this is the jewel of Manitoba \u2013 it\u2019s the jewel of Canada \u2013 and we have to protect it. The port will in time become viable, but our economic future is tourism.\u201d</p> <p>For a community that in the last two years has been buried by snow and cut off from the world, and that even in the best of times must beware of polar bears around the corner, it is just the latest challenge among many. But at least, for now, with the sound of the train whistle regularly reminding the community of its re-connection with the outside world, there is hope.</p> <p>\u201cWe find a way; it\u2019s what we do,\u201d saids Cook. \u201cWe hang in there, and we\u2019re going to find a way.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spend enough time in Churchill, and you will hear the stories. Of hearing a noise outside, pulling open the drapes and seeing a polar bear looking in through the window. Of walking around a corner at night, coming face-to-face with a bear and, implausibly, scaring it off with the strobe light on a cellphone. Of encountering an old man with a walker, determinedly clacking past a puzzled bear that peered at him from behind a rock and muttering defiantly: \u201cIf it gets me, it gets me.\u201d Of being about to, against all better judgment, walk the couple of hundred yards from restaurant to hotel room at night, only to be pulled back by a warning that a pair of polar bears had been spotted across the street. (OK, the last story is mine. The line between being a teller of tales and the subject of an obituary can be thinner than one might like.) Such is everyday life, particularly during October and November, in this small town on the shores of Canada\u2019s Hudson Bay. A little more than 1,000 miles north of the provincial capital of Winnipeg, Churchill is not just remote, it is defiantly so, accessible overland only by rail, its residents bonded by the conjoined challenges of living on the fringes of the Arctic and sharing their streets with the largest land carnivore in the world. \u201cIf you were to build a town today, you would never put it here,\u201d explains Geoff York of Polar Bears International, a research and advocacy organization whose members, understandably, spend much time in Churchill each year. \u201cPolar bears are creatures of the sea ice, and they come ashore in the summer here when the sea ice on Hudson Bay melts and then they wait for the ice to return.\u201d That return tends to begin sometime in November; by October, the bears are already stirring, wandering in anticipation toward the bay along a route that takes them past, and sometimes directly through, Churchill. From a cold war peak of about 5,000 people, when it hosted a military base, Churchill is now home to roughly 900 year-round inhabitants, slightly more than half of whom are Native. Theirs can be a harsh and at times tenuous existence, one that is leavened by the income from tourists who come to gaze at the northern lights in the winter, paddle among the hundreds of belugas that throng the river in summer and, in October and November, visit the polar bear capital of the world. Polar bears have made Churchill famous, and led to it being dubbed the \u201cjewel of Manitoba\u201d and one of the top destinations in Canada. But as it emerges from the most testing two years in its modern history, Churchill may be about to embark on an entirely different path, as this frequently frigid community considers embracing a warmer future. * * * It is estimated that about 10,000 people descend upon Churchill annually during the five- or six-week \u201cbear season\u201d. The bulk of bear viewing takes place on the tundra outside of town, from the safety of bespoke vehicles approximately the size of school buses atop airport fire truck wheels, the immense size of which enables the trucks to traverse treacherous terrain and keep their occupants beyond the reach of even the largest and most curious bear. The challenge for Churchill residents is to encourage the bears to head to the tundra without tarrying in town. In the past, the policy was less one of deterrence than immediate destruction. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was common for conservation officers to shoot 25 bears a season,\u201d explains the mayor, Mike Spence, who is of Cree and Scottish descent. These days, the community, in conjunction with the Manitoba department of conservation, employs a different approach: the Polar Bear Alert Program. Signs around the town remind residents and visitors alike to exercise caution and report bear sightings on the hotline \u2013 675-BEAR. Culvert traps, baited with seal scent, line the perimeter of the community; bears that are caught in them are taken to a holding facility, popularly known as the polar bear jail, where they are held for up to 30 days (without food, to enhance the deterrence factor of the experience), before being drugged and helicoptered to a spot safely away from town \u2013 or, if late enough in the season, on to the sea ice. If a bear does make it past the perimeter defense and into town conservation officers\u2019 first plan is to help it on its way, motivating it to leave by firing cracker shells (loud, blank shotgun shells) and following it with vehicles. Only the recalcitrant and the repeat offenders are incarcerated. For residents, living with polar bears is an unavoidable fact of life, and one that instils an understandable caution. As one former resident once said to me with a chuckle: \u201cIn Winnipeg, they say you can tell when someone is from Churchill because they always look carefully before walking around a corner.\u201d House and vehicle doors are always unlocked, should anyone need to fling one open and leap to shelter. As much as they can, residents simply avoid peak bear sites \u2013 anywhere along the coast or the riverbanks, in the willows on the edge of town, alleyways \u2013 especially at night, and particularly during peak bear season. For some, however, that isn\u2019t always an option. Parker Fitzpatrick works for Manitoba Hydro, the provincial utility company, and if a line is down, he and his team have to repair it, no matter when and where. As a result, they exercise due caution. \u201cYou try your hardest to not put yourself in that predicament,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut if you have to go out in an area that\u2019s a bad area or where bears have been spotted, and there\u2019s a line down, I always get resources: set up security fences, for example, and carry shotguns with cracker shells. Ninety per cent of bears won\u2019t bother you at all, but there are some who are hungry or are curious and want to bat you around like a baseball.\u201d * * * Since the establishment of the Polar Bear Alert Program in 1983, serious attacks have been rare. There has been just one fatality, during the program\u2019s first season: a homeless man, Tommy Mutanen, was rummaging through the freezer of a fire-damaged motel, stuffing meat into his pockets, when he rounded a corner and bumped into a bear. Nearby residents heard his screams, but although they rushed to his aid, they could not make the bear stop his attack, and by the time they shot it, Mutanen was dead. There has, however, been one exceptionally close shave. Erin Greene first arrived in Churchill from her native Montreal in 2012; she planned to spend a few months working at a local restaurant and then go back home, but she liked it so much she returned to stay the following summer. \u201cAnd then,\u201d she said, \u201cI got mauled by a polar bear.\u201d On Halloween night 2013, Greene and two friends were walking home in the early hours from a party when, she later recalled: \u201cWe all looked and there was a polar bear that was barreling down the street, just running towards us. Our first instinct was to run.\u201d Her friends escaped, but the bear caught Greene and grabbed her by the head and shoulders, tearing off part of her scalp as it tossed her around like a rag doll. As blood poured down her body, Erin was convinced she was going to die, and she might well have done, had it not been for a 69-year-old man with a shovel named Bill Ayotte. Ayotte heard Greene\u2019s screams and, clad only in a sweater and his pyjamas, ran toward the scene and brought his shovel down as hard as he could between the bear\u2019s eyes. The bear dropped Greene, who scrambled toward the safety of Ayotte\u2019s house, and turned its attention to Ayotte instead, tearing off an ear and clamping down on a leg. Other residents arrived, firing cracker shells and, ultimately, driving at the bear with headlights flashing and horn blazing, sending it off. Greene and Ayotte were airlifted to Winnipeg. Greene\u2019s scalp was repaired; Ayotte\u2019s ear was reattached. Both spent weeks recuperating in the hospital; both returned to Churchill. Today, Greene teaches yoga in the community; during bear season, she works at a gift shop and, in the summer months, leads standup-paddleboard tours on to the river when the belugas are at their peak. She could not, I suggest, have been blamed had she elected not to return to the scene of such an ordeal. \u201cI was trying to heal myself from the trauma I had experienced, and I believe that facing it head on is the way to do it,\u201d she said. Besides, the community had helped pay her medical bills; she could hardly abandon them. \u201cKnowing that this community produced someone who would risk their life to save another person\u2019s, I definitely wanted to be somewhere where humans turned out like that.\u201d The sense of community, of a populace that bonds together and looks out for each other, is a common theme among residents. It was both tested and strengthened over the last two years, when the very viability of Churchill was threatened as never before. It all began with the largest blizzard anyone could recall. * * * The blizzard began on 7 March 2017 and lasted for 57 hours. As the snow fell, it was driven by 120 km/h winds into massive drifts. By the time it was over, drifts in some places were 25 to 30 feet high; \u201chuge stretches\u201d of roads were buried under eight to nine feet of snow. \u201cWe had to tunnel out of our house, tunnel up and out,\u201d recalls Sandra Cook, a local artist. \u201cMy son Max was 13 at the time, so we figured he was the strongest and the thinnest. So, we dug this tunnel up and sent Max up there. He had to lay down on the top of the snow pile, because he couldn\u2019t stand up [because of the wind], and shovel until [Sandra\u2019s husband] Kevin could get out. Then Kevin and Max went out and started shoveling out others. People were looking out across the street, looking out for neighbors. The whole community came together. Our streets were like tunnels. It was an extraordinary amount of snow.\u201d The response to the blizzard, said Cook, \u201cbrought out the best in people\u201d. But the community would face a bigger challenge two months later, one that stretched it to the limit. The snow melted. The melt caused massive flooding which, among other things, damaged the final 249km stretch of the railway track connecting Churchill to Winnipeg and thus the world. An engineering study found 20 washouts and damage in 130 places. The estimated repair bill was $43.5m. OmniTrax, the Colorado-based company that owned the track and which was already looking for a way to offload it, said it couldn\u2019t afford to foot the repairs and wouldn\u2019t.

In the past, the port regularly exported grain and provided diesel fuel to remote Nunavut communities, but the new owners have a much grander vision: of links to Europe and India and the possible export of oil and gas. \u201cA few years ago, OmniTrax raised the prospect of shipping oil through the community, and unequivocally the community was resolutely against doing so for a number of reasons, the biggest one being that the shipping industry at the time was ill-equipped to deal with the prospect of accidents or disasters,\u201d said John Gunter of Frontiers North Adventures, one of the premier ecotourism companies in town. \u201cSo, it looks like we\u2019ll have to deal with that prospect again in the future.\u201d Of course, for a port in an Arctic environment to become truly viable, it will require shipping lanes that aren\u2019t clogged with ice much of the year; and so Churchill may ultimately find itself as both the most famous home of the ultimate icon of climate change and a community that, in the words of Spence, \u201cwill have to take advantage\u201d of that warming climate. \u201cThe Northwest Passage offers a 7,000km shortcut from New Jersey to Shanghai,\u201d Murad al-Katib, CEO of Arctic Gateway, said at the railway reopening ceremony. \u201cChurchill is the only commercial deep-water port in northern Canada, and climate change has extended the shipping season.\u201d It is a view cautiously echoed by many in town, even as they express anxiety about not losing what makes Churchill unique. \u201cI\u2019m not against oil, because I think it can be done safely,\u201d said Daley. \u201cWith global warming and the strait open more often, I think there\u2019s a market for it. But this is the jewel of Manitoba \u2013 it\u2019s the jewel of Canada \u2013 and we have to protect it. The port will in time become viable, but our economic future is tourism.\u201d For a community that in the last two years has been buried by snow and cut off from the world, and that even in the best of times must beware of polar bears around the corner, it is just the latest challenge among many. But at least, for now, with the sound of the train whistle regularly reminding the community of its re-connection with the outside world, there is hope. \u201cWe find a way; it\u2019s what we do,\u201d saids Cook. \u201cWe hang in there, and we\u2019re going to find a way.\u201d",

He\u2019s chosen to try to wedge Bill Shorten on border protection, which was part of an effort to do everything he could to try to avoid losing the vote he lost in the House on Tuesday. After losing the vote, he\u2019s chosen to push off the loss by launching a sonic boom on border protection. The sonic boom is playing out on multiple fronts. Morrison chose to hold a press conference in his courtyard on Wednesday to announce the government will reopen the Christmas Island detention centre in order to deal with \u201cwhat the parliament has done to weaken our borders\u201d. His words, \u201cweaken our borders\u201d. Morrison chose them. No one forced him to say them. Morrison did not, at any point during this uplifting presentation, point out that 879 people (sick asylum seekers and their families) have been transferred to Australia for medical treatment as of 9 February, and that influx has not necessitated the reopening of any mothballed detention centres, nor any public rumination about weakening Australia\u2019s borders, nor, for that matter, triggered any known surge in the number of boats attempting to reach Australia. Again, a choice. What you say, and what you choose not to say. Prime ministers, more than any other person in the country, workshop everything that comes out of their mouths. Tracking back just a couple of weeks, Morrison gave a speech about the economy. The prime minister made a choice with that outing: he would hint, but not say outright, that electing a Labor government would trigger a recession. He didn\u2019t use the word recession because the office gives those words the power to move financial markets. There was a recession-like implication in the speech that gained wide interpretation in subsequent reporting \u2013 but the fact is the prime minister chose his words judiciously, because the responsibility of the office demands you do that. We are a long way from that caution now. That was so three weeks ago. So Morrison on Wednesday stood in his courtyard, reported with the full authority of his office that border protection had been weakened, concrete measures were being taken to deal with the weaknesses, and he Morrison, would attempt to stop the boats that Shorten had summoned with his manifest recklessness. As well as hanging a lantern over these alleged weaknesses, Morrison made another choice. The prime minister was invited to send a clear message to the people smugglers by confirming a central fact about the medical evacuations bill \u2013 that the new procedures would only apply to the current cohort of asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island, not to any new arrivals. He was invited to rebuke clearly misleading statements from members of his team, like Tony Abbott, who said on social media the bill invited people to \u201cget on a boat, get to Nauru, get sick, get to Australia\u201d (and later in a radio interview, added: \u201cStay in Australia\u201d). Morrison chose not to clarify the basic factual point, despite being invited to do so more than once. He also chose not to rebut the feelpinions of colleagues. Bizarrely, reporters were then rebuked for attempting to keep statements factual, which is the practical test of whether or not a reporter has showed up for work. \u201cYou fail to understand that people smugglers don\u2019t deal with the nuance of the Canberra bubble,\u201d the prime minister said. We needed to understand that people smugglers don\u2019t care about facts. The fact that new arrivals don\u2019t get access to the medevac procedures was a \u201cnuance which the people smugglers will ignore\u201d \u2013 which could well be true, but didn\u2019t in any way explain why Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, was declining to confirm basic facts pertinent to whether people smugglers have a product to market. Newsflash. What the law says is not a \u201cnuance\u201d. It\u2019s a fact. By this point, it was clear we were so far down the truthy tunnel that we would all require a map, a floodlight and some grappling hooks to find our way back. There is another element of recklessness about the current escalation that also needs to be highlighted. Part of the sonic boom involves senior figures creating an impression that Nauru and Manus Island are full of dangerous people, furtive criminals, and we can\u2019t have them coming here. Small problem with this narrative. Senior figures in the government seem to have forgotten that Australia is trying to convince Donald Trump to take a bunch of people for resettlement in the US that he doesn\u2019t want to take, and that we really need America to take some of these people to fix a mighty monstrosity we have created for ourselves because of our toxic politics on boat arrivals. What will Donald do, pray tell, when he finds out that offshore detention is full of criminals? Does anyone care? Is anyone thinking more than five minutes ahead?",

      "bodyText": "The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has played down the possibility of an extension to article 50 as the UK prepares to leave the European Union. His comments follow reports on Tuesday night that Theresa May\u2019s chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, was overheard in a Brussels bar saying MPs would be given a last-minute choice between her deal and a lengthy delay to Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. The prime minister has repeatedly insisted the government intends to leave the EU as planned on 29 March, and on Tuesday urged MPs to hold their nerve while she tried to renegotiate changes to the Irish backstop. An ITV reporter overheard Robbins, the most senior civil servant involved in the Brexit process, appearing to suggest in a late-night conversation that May would wait until March \u2013 and then give MPs the choice between backing her, or accepting a long extension to article 50. In an appearance on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Barclay declined to comment on Robbins\u2019s comments, which he said were overheard in a \u201cnoisy bar\u201d, but added that an extension was not the government\u2019s plan and would not only be a decision for the UK government. The Brexit secretary, who met senior MEPs in Strasbourg on Tuesday, added: \u201cWhat came over was actually that it is not in anyone\u2019s interests to have an extension without any clarity. It is actually very disruptive to the European parliament. \u201cThey have, obviously, elections for the parliament and a commission that will be formed at the end of May, so there is no desire on the European side to see what one described to me as an \u2018extension in darkness\u2019, where there is no clarity as to why we are extending. \u201cIt is not in anyone\u2019s interest to have an extension \u2026 with no clarity.\u201d Questioned about business leaders\u2019 fears about import and export duties, border controls and customs procedures in the event of no deal, Barclay said the government would release more information soon. \u201cA deal is the way that we will actually address those concerns in parliament and ensure we give businesses the confidence they need,\u201d he said. Asked whether the government would tell businesses what tariffs they would have to pay if the UK left without a deal, Barclay said: \u201cWe expect to give further information on that in the coming days.\u201d The government has promised to roll over 40 current EU free trade deals with 70 different countries, so they will still apply to the UK under a no-deal Brexit. But documents disclosed by the Sun showed that just six deals were expected to be ready in time for when the UK leaves on 29 March. They are the four already agreed, with Switzerland \u2013 signed on Monday, Chile, an eastern and southern African block, and the Faroe Islands, while deals with Israel and the Palestinian Authority were \u201con track\u201d. Amber warnings have been applied over deals with nine countries, including South Korea and Canada, which means they are seen as \u201coff-track\u201d in terms of being achievable by 29 March. Red and black warnings have been applied to 23 other EU deals, including those with big trading partners Japan, Turkey and Mexico, meaning they were given no chance of being completed by 29 March. They have been classed as either \u201csignificantly off-track\u201d or \u201cnot possible to be completed\u201d.",

Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Cooper says she will press for a vote on an amendment creating time for her bill on Wednesday 27 February, if Theresa May has not passed a deal by then.</strong> That means 27 February is the next crunch deadline for the PM. Tory pro-Europeans who have not rebelled on this issue yet are hinting that they will rebel then to vote for the Cooper plan.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Cooper and her allies are not proposing a vote this week on an amendment creating time for a bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit.</strong> </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The new Cooper bill would give May until Wednesday 13 March to get a deal through parliament. </strong>Assuming the bill passes through parliament (a big if, given the difficulty it might have in the Lords, where bills cannot be rushed through), if the PM has not got a deal through parliament by 13 March, MPs would either have to vote to agree a no-deal Brexit - or else they would have to vote to require the PM to seek an extension of article 50.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>It would be up to the government to decide how long the article 50 extension it would request would be.</strong> (Cooper\u2019s previous bill on this specified a nine-month extension.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Cooper is proposing the amendment and the bill with the Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Caroline Spelman, the Conservative MP who tabled the non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit that was passed by MPs two weeks ago, has said she will back the bill</strong>. She did not vote for the Cooper amendment two weeks ago and her endorsement is significant because it suggests Cooper\u2019s new amendment will get wider Tory support than her previous one, which was backed by 17 Tories.</li> </ul> <p>The original Cooper bill said that May should be given until Tuesday 26 February to pass a Brexit deal, and that if she did not get one through the Commons by then, at that point she should be obliged to seek an extension of article 50. The amendment that would have created time for that bill to be passed was defeated two weeks ago by 23 votes. This bill would create a new deadline, 15 days later than the one in the original bill.</p> <p>In a statement Cooper said;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This bill would require the prime minister and parliament to take crucial decisions by the middle of March at the very latest on whether the UK is leaving with a deal, without a deal or seeking an extension to article 50.</p> <p>It forces the prime minister to tell us whether she wants to leave with no deal or to extend article 50 if she still hasn\u2019t got a deal in place by the middle of March. This bill creates a parliamentary safeguard to prevent us drifting into no deal by accident, and to prevent those crucial decisions being left until the final fortnight. The risks to jobs, the NHS and security from no deal are too great for us to stand back and let the government drift. </p> <p>The prime minister needs to get a workable deal in place quickly and she has asked for more time. But there is a real danger of endless drift so if she can\u2019t get a deal in place by 26th February, our cross party group will put forward this bill at that point to ensure that crucial decisions are made by the middle of March. That is the latest timetable to get the bill through the parliamentary process in time for decisions to be made in March.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T18:44:48.997Z\">at 6.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c63058ce4b00ef6acc6ca85\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T17:45:34.385Z\">5.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And, while we\u2019re on the subject of <strong>Stephen Barclay,</strong> the relatively new Brexit secretary, in an interview today he also got the name of the European commission president wrong, calling him Jean-Paul Juncker, not Jean-Claude.

But May said the EU withdrawal agreement bill would amend CRAG to accommodate this. She explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement. But of course, in this instance MPs will already have debated and approved the agreement as part of the meaningful vote.

We desperately need more people to settle in the country, especially around the Highlands and islands, but the uncertainty around Brexit is having quite the opposite effect.</p> <p>One passionate advocate for immigration who spoke to the committee this morning is <strong>Donald Macaskill</strong>, chief executive of Scottish Care, who represents the health and social care sector. He told BBC Scotland earlier that Sajid Javid\u2019s immigration proposals \u2013 including a \u00a330,000 salary threshold \u2013 were \u201cunrealistic, damaging and dangerous\u201d.</p> <p>He explained that, with the average salary in the care sector at \u00a318,000, it was \u201cdemeaning\u201d to describe people providing palliative care as \u201clow-skilled\u201d. He added that 12% of nurses in the sector are currently from Europe, while under the new rules it is estimated that 85% of workers from the EEA will not be allowed to come to Scotland, adding to an already significant recruitment and retention crisis.</p> <p>Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is on a recruitment drive to attract nurses from Australia, after successfully lobbying the Nursing and Midwifery Council to relax restrictions on foreign staff.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T15:25:15.705Z\">at 3.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c62dd1ce4b042feedcbc620\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T14:55:06.187Z\">2.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The May statement has finally finished.</p> <p><strong>Ian Blackford,</strong> the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says he is making a point of order \u201cmore in sorrow than in anger\u201d.

Within the last 24 hours three of Westminster\u2019s most senior political journalists have all published reports suggesting that May could well end up taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. No one is saying that she definitely will \u2013 predicting Brexit is even harder than predicting normal politics, and May\u2019s inner thinking is in many respects inscrutable \u2013 but it is worth knowing how the Westminster conventional wisdom is shifting,</p> <p>The longest and most detailed of the three articles is by HuffPost\u2019s<strong> Paul Waugh</strong>. Under the heading <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/theresa-may-no-deal-brexit-fallback-plan_uk_5c617348e4b0910c63f30fc8?fbm&amp;utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage\">\u201cWhy A No-Deal Brexit Is Now Theresa May\u2019s Fallback Plan To Save Her Party \u2013 And Herself\u201d,</a> he says that those who know May and who have been trying to gauge how she would respond to a no-deal choice think the calculus has changed in recent weeks. Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Several Tory remainers, including trusted gobetween Sir Oliver Letwin, have confided to colleagues that since the 230-vote defeat last month, May has entered into an irreversible pact with her Brexiteers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat worries me now is that it feels like something has changed,\u201d says one MP. \u201cIt feels like she\u2019s crossed a line now. She\u2019s boxed herself so far in she\u2019s lost any capacity to pivot, even though she might want to in her head, she\u2019s stuck now\u201d ...</p> <p>With any binding vote on stopping no-deal now unlikely to emerge until later this month, one Tory insider says the key factor has been that the PM is more afraid of her Brexiteers than remainers.</p> <p>Chief whip Julian Smith is understood to have counselled her that the danger will not come from pro-EU ministers thinking of quitting in protest.</p> <p>One source says: \u201cShe\u2019s been told \u2013 \u2018You need to understand prime minister, it\u2019s very simple maths \u2013 the ERG [European Research Group] will fuck you, fuck the Conservative party and they will throw themselves over a cliff. Your remainer colleagues will not\u2019. It\u2019s who\u2019s got the biggest balls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe remainers need a gameplan to show Julian [Smith] is wrong on this. At the moment, they are rolling over having tummies tickled. And she\u2019s thrown all her weight behind the chief whip.</p> <p>\u201cShe gets to save her party and potentially gets to live for another day. She will be the PM who delivered Brexit. She can blame parliament and Tusk, Juncker and the EU [for no-deal] and say I managed it as best as anyone could. </p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s home and dry as long as she sits tight with the Brexiteers who only a few weeks ago wanted her head. It\u2019s utterly tragic.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/inside-uk-prime-minister-theresa-may-mind-brexit-deal-cliff-edge/\">an article for Politico Europe</a>, <strong>Tom McTague</strong> has picked up similar talk about May being willing to do anything to avoid splitting the Conservative party. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To understand May, one must understand her relationship with the Conservative party \u2014 a relationship unlike that of any other Tory MP.</p> <p>\u201cFor most of us, the Conservative party is a means to an end,\u201d explained the cabinet minister. \u201cTheresa is different. She has an attitude to the Conservative party which is more in common with a lot of Labour MPs. For them, it is something closer to love, to family. For us, you have family and nation, the Conservative party is just a vehicle. If it\u2019s not working, you change it\u201d ...</p> <p>One of her closest parliamentary allies predicted that May would \u201cpush as hard and long as possible\u201d to achieve a deal that her party and her parliamentary allies the Democratic Unionist party can support.</p> <p>\u201cShe will use every last minute of time before she has to make that choice,\u201d the ally said, adding that in the end, she may refuse to make it until it\u2019s too late to stop no-deal from happening.</p> <p>\u201cShe will delay and delay \u2014 she may not make that choice and go for no deal. I don\u2019t think even she knows.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And ITV\u2019s <strong>Robert Peston</strong> explains <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-02-11/why-a-no-deal-brexit-is-likely/\">in a blog </a>why he now thinks a no-deal Brexit is likely, partly based on his experience of how the US authorities allowed the investment bank Lehman to go bust in 2008 - even though they knew this would trigger a disaster.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So just to personalise this for a moment, on Friday 12 September 2008 it was obvious to me that without a bailout, the investment bank Lehman would be dead on Monday morning, but that the consequences to all our prosperity of Lehman going down would be so momentous that the US authorities and government would find a route to save it. Come Sunday 14 September, I was reporting that Lehman would collapse and be taken into bankruptcy protection the following morning.</p> <p>The rest is the painful history of the worst recession and blow to our living standards since the 1930s \u2013 which would not have been as acute if Lehman had not gone down.</p> <p>Brexit feels eerily like Lehman 2.0, if in slightly slower motion and on the scale of a nation and continent.</p> <p>Disclaimer: I make the Lehman analogy because both the government and EU leaders are explicit that a no-deal Brexit would have serious economic and security costs, just as the US (and UK) government, central bank and regulators knew that the collapse of Lehman would be an event that would impoverish us all. And yet they let it happen.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T12:46:59.851Z\">at 12.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c62ac4be4b00ef6acc6c580\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T11:22:14.881Z\">11.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from the Telegraph\u2019s <strong>Steven Swinford</strong> on today\u2019s cabinet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1095281504715005952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New:<br><br>Cabinet has broken up and there was no discussion about Brexit AT ALL<br><br>One minister said it was &#39;utterly surreal&#39;, one of shortest meetings they can remember<br><br>There were discussions on fly-tipping &amp; child poverty targets (figures don&#39;t look good in March)<br><br>But that was it.</p>&mdash; Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1095281504715005952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 12, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c62a9a9e4b00ef6acc6c552\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T11:11:47.107Z\">11.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>No 10 are denying claims that the Brexit debate could be brought forward from Thursday to tomorrow (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/12/brexit-latest-news-developmens-mays-statment-mps-need-to-hold-our-nerve-may-to-tell-mps-as-leadsom-hints-uk-softening-call-for-deal-to-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c62a1b7e4b04a6f567ddcd8#block-5c62a1b7e4b04a6f567ddcd8\">10.36am), </a>the Mirror\u2019s <strong>Pippa Crerar </strong>reports.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c62a967e4b04a6f567ddd38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-12T11:09:59.578Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are no urgent questions today.

And she confirmed that May will bring amendable motion on Brexit for debate in the Commons on Wednesday February 27 if the deal has not been reached by then. When it was put to her that this meant the final vote might take place after the EU summit scheduled to start on Thursday 21 March, Leadsom did not deny this. She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a negotiation. It is not possible to predict the future. But the meaningful vote will come back to parliament as soon as the issue around the backstop has been sorted out.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she was confident that all the legislation that needed to be passed by 29 March would be passed by then.</strong> When it was put to her that parliament was not passing the necessary legislation, she denied this. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much of the preparations for Brexit, whether there is a deal or no deal, takes place in secondary legislation, something that is not often covered by media ...</p> <p>We have up to 600 statutory instruments [to pass].

As the Guardian reports in its overnight story, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/11/may-to-ask-mps-for-further-fortnights-grace-in-brexit-talks\">she is going to ask the Commons to her another fortnight\u2019s grace to keep pushing for changes to the Irish backstop.</a> Or, as May herself will put it, according to an extract from her statement released by Number 10 in advance, she will urge MPs to told their nerve. She will say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House has required and deliver Brexit on time.</p> <p>By getting the changes we need to the backstop; by protecting and enhancing workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections; and by enhancing the role of parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andrea Leadsom</strong>, the leader of the Commons, repeated this line when she was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. But much more interesting was what she said about the sort of concession on the backstop that might be acceptable to the UK government. Two weeks ago, in the \u201cnext steps\u201d debate in the Commons after her Brexit deal was rejected by MPs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/29/brexit-vote-commons-latest-news-developments-liam-fox-says-may-now-saying-withdrawal-deal-text-must-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c506e87e4b0fbf19bc3baea#block-5c506e87e4b0fbf19bc3baea\">May said that she wanted \u201clegally binding change to the withdrawal agreement\u201d, involving the \u201cre-opening\u201d of that agreement. </a>To many Brexiters in the party, the \u201cre-opening the withdrawal agreement\u201d part of that demand was crucial; they were not happy with the idea that it might just be reinterpreted by an addendum (something the EU has hinted it would consider).</p> <p>But this morning Leadsom, who is one of the most prominent Brexiters in the cabinet, suggested that re-drafting the text of the withdrawal agreement was no longer a red line. Here is the crucial exchange in her interview with Today\u2019s <strong>Mishal Husain.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>MH: </strong>Are you still holding out, you personally holding out, for changes to the withdrawal agreement? </p> <p><strong>AL: </strong>You know, the point is to ensure that the UK cannot be held in a backstop permanently. How it\u2019s achieved is not something to be purist about. </p> <p><strong>MH:</strong> So, as far as you are concerned then, words that are added to the political declaration would be good enough for you?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I would not speculate on what exactly the outcome needs to be. </p> <p><strong>MH:</strong> But you have not said that you are wedded to changes to the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I\u2019m wedded to delivering what parliament has said they would support, and that is some either unilateral means, or alternative arrangements, for the UK to not be held in the backstop permanently. </p> </blockquote> <p>I will post more from the interview shortly.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>Theresa May chairs cabinet.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> The Commons home affairs committee takes evidence on the settled status scheme from the3million, which represents EU nationals in the UK, NHS Employers and the Rights of Women campaign.</p> <p><em>11.30am: </em>Greg Clark, the business secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 12.30pm:</em> May makes a statement to MPs about Brexit. </p> <p>Also today David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, and Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, are meeting MEPs in Strasbourg.

      "bodyText": "Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who has been leading cross-party moves to ensure that MPs get the chance to vote to block a no-deal Brexit, has revealed details of her latest plan to get this legislation through the Commons. She won\u2019t put it to a vote this week, but plans a vote on Wednesday 27 February if Theresa May has not passed a Brexit deal by then. Significantly, this amendment/bill has wider Tory support than Cooper\u2019s last one, which was rejected by MPs. (See 6.18pm.) Theresa May has appealed to MPs for more time to push Brussels into agreeing to changes to her Brexit deal, in an update to the Commons that contained no new announcements and reiterated her opposition to a Labour compromise plan. The Labour party has tabled an amendment to the government Brexit motion being debated on Thursday that would oblige the government to hold a new vote by Wednesday 27 February if May has not passed a Brexit deal by by then. It says by 27 February there should either be a vote on a revised deal, or else a minister should \u201cmake a written statement declaring that there is no longer an agreement in principle in the negotiations with the European Union\u201d and table an amendable motion on \u201chow the government proposes to proceed.\u201d Announcing the move, Jeremy Corbyn said: This amendment would stop the government from running down the clock on the Brexit negotiations, hoping members of parliament can be blackmailed into supporting a botched deal. May has already promised that she will give MPs a vote on an amendable motion by 27 February if she has not got a deal by then. But her amendable motion is unlikely to say \u201cthere is no longer an agreement in principle.\u201d Labour MPs have told Theresa May that a fresh bill on workers\u2019 rights, not just an amendment, would be the minimum they could accept in order to secure their backing for her Brexit deal. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. UPDATE: I have corrected the paragraph about the Labour amendment to included more detail about its precise wording, and to remove a line saying the government is likely to accept it. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper has published details of her latest plan to ensure that MPs get the chance to vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Here are the key points. Cooper says she will press for a vote on an amendment creating time for her bill on Wednesday 27 February, if Theresa May has not passed a deal by then. That means 27 February is the next crunch deadline for the PM. Tory pro-Europeans who have not rebelled on this issue yet are hinting that they will rebel then to vote for the Cooper plan. Cooper and her allies are not proposing a vote this week on an amendment creating time for a bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The new Cooper bill would give May until Wednesday 13 March to get a deal through parliament. Assuming the bill passes through parliament (a big if, given the difficulty it might have in the Lords, where bills cannot be rushed through), if the PM has not got a deal through parliament by 13 March, MPs would either have to vote to agree a no-deal Brexit - or else they would have to vote to require the PM to seek an extension of article 50. It would be up to the government to decide how long the article 50 extension it would request would be. (Cooper\u2019s previous bill on this specified a nine-month extension.) Cooper is proposing the amendment and the bill with the Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin. Caroline Spelman, the Conservative MP who tabled the non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit that was passed by MPs two weeks ago, has said she will back the bill. She did not vote for the Cooper amendment two weeks ago and her endorsement is significant because it suggests Cooper\u2019s new amendment will get wider Tory support than her previous one, which was backed by 17 Tories. The original Cooper bill said that May should be given until Tuesday 26 February to pass a Brexit deal, and that if she did not get one through the Commons by then, at that point she should be obliged to seek an extension of article 50. The amendment that would have created time for that bill to be passed was defeated two weeks ago by 23 votes. This bill would create a new deadline, 15 days later than the one in the original bill. In a statement Cooper said; This bill would require the prime minister and parliament to take crucial decisions by the middle of March at the very latest on whether the UK is leaving with a deal, without a deal or seeking an extension to article 50. It forces the prime minister to tell us whether she wants to leave with no deal or to extend article 50 if she still hasn\u2019t got a deal in place by the middle of March. This bill creates a parliamentary safeguard to prevent us drifting into no deal by accident, and to prevent those crucial decisions being left until the final fortnight. The risks to jobs, the NHS and security from no deal are too great for us to stand back and let the government drift. The prime minister needs to get a workable deal in place quickly and she has asked for more time. But there is a real danger of endless drift so if she can\u2019t get a deal in place by 26th February, our cross party group will put forward this bill at that point to ensure that crucial decisions are made by the middle of March. That is the latest timetable to get the bill through the parliamentary process in time for decisions to be made in March. And, while we\u2019re on the subject of Stephen Barclay, the relatively new Brexit secretary, in an interview today he also got the name of the European commission president wrong, calling him Jean-Paul Juncker, not Jean-Claude. Perhaps not a great start to the renegotiation .... And while he was in Strasbourg, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, refused to say that the changes to the backstop that the UK requires would definitely require the text of the withdrawal agreement to be rewritten, the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming reports. Two weeks ago Theresa May said the withdrawal agreement would have to be re-opened. But today two of her cabinet ministers, first Andrea Leadsom (see 8.38am) and now Barclay), have implied that that might not be the case, and even May was a bit more wobbly on this in the Commons than she has been previously. (See 4.27pm.) Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, met Theresa May last week and David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, and Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, today. He says the UK does not seem to have a plan to break the Brexit deadlock. These are from Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis on the Brexit timetable. This morning, on the Today programme, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said that all 600-odd statutory instruments that have to be passed before Brexit on 29 March could get through parliament on time. (See 9.47am.) Ruth Fox, director of the Hansard Society, has written a helpful blog looking at this. Hr conclusion is that Leadsom is probably right - but \u201cpotentially at some cost to parliamentary scrutiny\u201d. Here is an excerpt. Ultimately, if the government is running out of time, it can initiate the urgent case procedure set out in the EU (Withdrawal) Act. Under this procedure, ministers can make SIs that come into immediate effect having been \u2018made\u2019 (signed-off) by the minister. \u2018Made affirmatives\u2019 require both Houses to approve them within 28 days to remain in force. To use this procedure, ministers will simply have to provide a written statement explaining the urgency. In the circumstances, this will not be difficult. Ministers have said that they do not anticipate using the urgent procedure \u2013 and if our hunch is correct, and the overall number of Brexit SIs that still need to be laid is lower than expected, they may not need to do so. Nevertheless, it is a useful insurance in the event of problems arising on or near 29 March. This procedure would ensure that all SIs that are required can come into effect on exit day. Here is Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, responding to the Robert Peston blog claiming a no-deal Brexit is now likely. (See 11.54am.) Unionism could be an energetic and energising voice in the debate around Irish unity, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald has said. As the Press Association reports, her comments came after a DUP MLA sent a letter warning unionists they may not be able to vote to keep Northern Ireland in the UK. North Down MLA Alex Easton contacted his constituents asking them to register in case there is a vote on Irish unity. The letter emerged hours after DUP leader Arlene Foster claimed there was no possibility of a border poll. McDonald said people should not \u201cfeel anxious\u201d about a border poll. Speaking outside Leinster House in Dublin, she said: People shouldn\u2019t feel a sense of threat around the prospect of a border poll or the debate that will lead into it or the Ireland that will emerge from it. This will be a collaborative and collective process. We won\u2019t write the blueprint for a new united Ireland. Unionism needs to be accommodated and welcomed and become a very energetic and energising voice, and perhaps a challenging voice, in the debate around Irish unity and in the debate around the securing a referendum on that matter. The Labour party has said it will oppose any move by the government to exempt the EU withdrawal agreement from the Constitutional Reform and Governance (CRAG) Act. (See 4.27pm.) In a statement the shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said: This plan shows contempt for our democracy. The government is trying to avoid proper scrutiny and run down the clock in order to force through its bad Brexit deal.Labour will oppose this change, which would deny parliament full scrutiny. The EU will keep the channel tunnel open for three months after a no deal Brexit to allow a renegotiation of the Treaty of Canterbury that permits the cross-border rail service to run. The European commission said the move would be conditional on the U.K. \u201cmaintaining safety standards identical to EU requirements\u201d. In a statement it said: This will ensure the protection of rail-passengers, the safety of citizens and will avoid major disruptions of cross-border rail operations and shuttle services after the UK\u2019s withdrawal. The Theresa May statement to the Commons, and the response she received from MPs, did not hugely advance our knowledge of where we are on Brexit but, as ever, there were some nuggets of interest. Here are the key points. May was accused of wanting to run down the clock so that MPs can be \u201cblackmailed into supporting a deeply flawed deal\u201d as she made her second Brexit holding statement after the failure of the Commons to pass a deal. She was on her feet for more than two hours taking questions because the government has been forced into agreeing that, until a revised deal comes to the Commons, there must now be regular ministerial statements and debates. In her first holding statement, more than three weeks ago, May explained the three changes she wanted. Today in her statement she did not elaborate much on what she said then, and she did nothing to suggest a revised deal with the EU was imminent. MPs will hold a debate on Thursday, but it is likely that May will be given at least another fortnight (until a third holding statement/debate) before pro-Europeans in her government rebel and call for MPs to be given the chance to legislate to rule out no deal. (See 12.37pm.) Responding to May, Jeremy Corbyn accused her of irresponsible time wasting. He said: In truth it appears the prime minister has just one real tactic: to run down the clock hoping members of this house are blackmailed into supporting a deeply flawed deal. This is an irresponsible act. She is playing for time and playing with people\u2019s jobs, our economic security and the future of our industry. In response to this claim, May said: [Corbyn] talked about running down the clock. No, I wanted to have this sorted before Christmas. This prompted jeers from MPs who pointed out that May cancelled the planned vote on her Brexit deal before Christmas. This \u201cplaying for time\u201d could well end up going on for another month or so. This, from my colleague Jessica Elgot, is entirely plausible. May failed to rule out cutting tariffs on imports to zero in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Heidi Allen, a Conservative pro-European, asked her to rule out this option, saying zero-rate tariffs would \u201cdecimate our agricultural and food industries and start a race to the bottom\u201d. May refused to do so. Instead she replied: There will be a number of statutory instruments that this house will be addressing \u2013 the house will be working hard on those Brexit arrangements next week. On the issue of tariffs in the event of a no deal, there are still discussions being undertaken with businesses and other sectors. May told MPs that, in the case of the Brexit agreement, the government would sidestep the normal rule saying the Commons should be given 21 sitting days to ratify a treaty. This schedule is set out in the Constitutional Reform and Governance (CRAG) Act. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European and former attorney general, said the government was running out of time to ensure MPs got the required 21 days if Brexit was still going to take place on 29 March. But May said the EU withdrawal agreement bill would amend CRAG to accommodate this. She explained: In most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement. But of course, in this instance MPs will already have debated and approved the agreement as part of the meaningful vote. So while we will follow normal procedure if we can, where there is insufficient time remaining following a successful meaningful vote, we will make provision in the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 with parliament\u2019s consent \u2013 to ensure that we are able to ratify on time to guarantee our exit in an orderly way. This is being seen as further confirmation that a revised deal with the EU may not be agreed until the very last minute. (See 9.47am.) Brigid Fowler from the Hansard Society says there is a good argument for saying that, in this case, the 21 days are not needed. May said that her talks with Labour about Brexit would continue \u2013 although both she and Corbyn expressed doubts about the value of those conversations. In her opening statement May said: I welcome [Corbyn\u2019s] willingness to sit down and talk to me and I look forward to continuing our discussions. Indeed, government ministers will be meeting with members of his team tomorrow. But Corbyn, in his response, said that May seemed to be \u201cmerely engaged in the pretence of working across parliament to find solutions\u201d and that she \u201chad not indicated she will move one iota away from her rejected deal or any of her red lines\u201d. And May herself, in response to a question from the Conservative MP Nicky Morgan, who said there was unlikely to be cross-party agreement, agreed that Corbyn\u2019s \u201ctone of response did not give much encouragement\u201d. May said that the \u201cobvious\u201d way to provide a legally binding assurance that the UK would not be kept in the backstop permanently would be through changes to the actual text of the withdrawal agreement. In a question, Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, said this assurance should take the form of an amendment to the text of the withdrawal agreement. In response May said: One of the concerns of this house was that any assurances that were given in relation to the temporary nature of the backstop in early January were not of the same legal form as the international treaty that forms the withdrawal agreement, and that is why what we are asking for is legally binding status, and the obvious way to do that is within the withdrawal agreement. This morning Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, hinted that the UK was no longer pushing for actual changes to the withdrawal agreement. (See 8.38am.) May confirmed that the government still does want changes to the actual text, but her comment was marginally weaker than No 10\u2019s previous insistence that the withdrawal agreement will definitely have to be rewritten. May repeatedly refused to tell MPs what she would do if forced to choose between a no-deal Brexit or extending article 50. Many opposition MPs said that May should rule out no deal. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot on one of the shadow cabinet discussions today. Earlier the Scottish affairs select committee was hearing about the practical impact of leaving the EU, in particular the impact on immigration. Unlike much of the rest of the UK, Scotland is currently facing a demographic timebomb, with an increasing elderly population, and not enough working-age people to pay the taxes and provide the labour needed to look after them. We desperately need more people to settle in the country, especially around the Highlands and islands, but the uncertainty around Brexit is having quite the opposite effect. One passionate advocate for immigration who spoke to the committee this morning is Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, who represents the health and social care sector. He told BBC Scotland earlier that Sajid Javid\u2019s immigration proposals \u2013 including a \u00a330,000 salary threshold \u2013 were \u201cunrealistic, damaging and dangerous\u201d. He explained that, with the average salary in the care sector at \u00a318,000, it was \u201cdemeaning\u201d to describe people providing palliative care as \u201clow-skilled\u201d. He added that 12% of nurses in the sector are currently from Europe, while under the new rules it is estimated that 85% of workers from the EEA will not be allowed to come to Scotland, adding to an already significant recruitment and retention crisis. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is on a recruitment drive to attract nurses from Australia, after successfully lobbying the Nursing and Midwifery Council to relax restrictions on foreign staff. The May statement has finally finished. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says he is making a point of order \u201cmore in sorrow than in anger\u201d. He says Theresa May said earlier that the government\u2019s economic analysis covered the Brexit option proposed by the government. He says May accused him of inadvertently misleading the House. But she was inadvertently misleading the house. Theresa May says the government put forward a deal, and the economic analysis was done on that deal. Blackford claims that did not cover what was in the political declaration. But the economic analysis covered a spectrum of choice. John Bercow, the Speaker, indicates he is not willing to hear another point of order on this. He says he thinks both sides have had their chance to make their point. \u201cLet\u2019s, perhaps, leave it there,\u201d he says. I will post a summary of the main points from the May statement shortly. As Bloomberg\u2019s Thomas Penny points out, the Conservative benches have been quite empty for much of this statement (which is still going on). But perhaps it is not surprising that Tory MPs have got better things to do than spend more than two hours listening to Theresa May say ... well, frankly, nothing hugely unexpected. The SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald says that, in Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, the eighth circle of hell was reserved for fraudsters. He suggests that that is where the leaders of the leave campaign will end up. The SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins says in Scotland a Mrs Vonn has had to apply for settled status, as an EU national, despite having lived in the UK for more than 70 years. This is from the Green MP Caroline Lucas. Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s opening statement to MPs. Labour\u2019s Toby Perkins asks if May can justify the Commons rising at 3.27pm last Wednesday because MPs had nothing to discuss. May says MPs do work outside the chamber, as well as in it. And the government has cancelled the February recess, she says. Jeremy Lefroy, a Conservative, asks what would happen to the service sector in the event of a no-deal Brexit. May says that a no-deal Brexit would have an impact on the economy, but that in the long run the UK would recover. May says businesses have said to her that they do not want article 50 extended, because they think that would just extend uncertainty. Alex Chalk, a Conservative, asks for an assurance from May that the talks with the EU are credible and constructive. May says previously the EU was unwilling to extend talks. But, after the Commons showed that it would not vote for the deal, the EU agreed to reopen talks. From Labour\u2019s David Lammy Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy says MPs voted against no deal. The government should stop buying fridges and focusing on \u201cfantasy ferries\u201d and let MPs vote to extend article 50. May says her priority is to address the backstop issue. Jo Swinson, the deputy Lib Dem leader, says May in her opening statement talked about the coalition introducing shared parental leave. But within the coalition the Tories opposed the idea, she says. And she says the Tories also commissioned the Beecroft report, which recommended weakening workers\u2019 rights. May says she wants to consider the case for extending free ports after Brexit. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has put out this statement from the Tory pro-European Philip Lee accusing both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn of running down the clock. Lee said: People watching the unfolding chaos of Brexit would be justified in thinking that Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are engaged in a conspiracy to run down the clock on Brexit. The prime minister openly wants her blindfold Brexit proposal to pass and is willing to gamble with the national interest in the hope of getting it through. The leader of the opposition acknowledges that the prime minister is \u2018engaged in the pretence\u2019 of cross-party talks but willingly embarks on another round of them. It is now time for ministers who say they are opposed to a \u2018no-deal\u2019 crash out to put the national interest ahead of any question of party or personal interest by leaving the government if the prime minister will not act decisively to end the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. It is now time for Jeremy Corbyn to be \u2018involved\u2019 as well as \u2018present\u2019 in this debate by putting his proposals to a vote in the House of Commons and, if they are rejected, move on to the next stage of his party\u2019s policy which is to begin campaigning for a new public vote on Brexit. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says May is right to reject Labour\u2019s call for the UK to stay in the custom union. He says that will be popular with her party, because it is consistent with the Conservative election manifesto. Labour\u2019s Angela Smith says people feel they are not getting effective leadership on Brexit \u201cfrom anywhere on the political landscape\u201d. Does May accept that her best chance of getting her deal over the line would be to accept the case for a second referendum? May says she disagrees with Smith on a second referendum. She wants to see a strong show of support for the deal across the Commons. Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman says he thinks there has been a change of mood since the referendum. There is an urgent desire for another vote, he says. May says, when she speaks to people, she finds an urgent desire to get Brexit sorted. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, says Leave Means Leave says the UK can walk away from the Brexit deal it has agreed with the EU, but also become a global champion of free trade by getting other countries to trust it to strike trade deals. That is illogical, she says. Ben Bradshaw, the Labour pro-European, says history will judge Tory pro-European ministers very harshly if they do not act to rule out no deal. And history will judge Labour very harshly if it does not honour the conference commitment to a people\u2019s vote. May says she would not be spending so much time negotiating with EU leaders if she did not want a deal. Here is HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh on the significance of May\u2019s response to Dominic Grieve. (See 1.33pm.) Sir Desmond Swayne, the Tory Brexiter, asks if there is a \u201cspecial place\u201d in somewhere (he does not use the word \u201chell\u201d) for people who think \u201creplace\u201d means \u201creplace\u201d. This is a veiled criticism of May, who has said that she does not necessarily want the backstop removed, even though the Commons passed the Brady amendment saying it should be \u201creplaced\u201d. May says Swayne has a special place in her estimation. Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall asks May if she can assure MPs that she will still be in her job by the time the future relationship is agreed. If not, why should the EU do any deal with her. May says she is trying to negotiate what is best for the UK. In response to a question from the Conservative pro-European Dominic Grieve, who says article 50 will have to be extended because parliament does not have the time to pass all the legislation, May says normally the Commons would need to study a treaty for 21 days before it can be ratified. But in this case that will not be necessary because MPs will have already debated these issues. This will be reflected in the EU withdrawal agreement bill, she says. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, congratulates May on what she is doing to extricate the UK from the backstop. But does she agree that there is no point in doing that unless it is written into the withdrawal agreement, and that the UK is out before the next election. May says she wants Britain to be out of the backstop. And she says that anything that allows the UK to exit from the backstop must have the same legal status as the withdrawal agreement. The obvious way to do that would be by changing the withdrawal agreement, she says. May says changing the text of the withdrawal agreement would be the obvious way to give the UK a means of leaving the backstop. This is marginally weaker than No 10\u2019s previous insistence that the withdrawal agreement will definitely have to be rewritten. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, says May must say what she would do if faced with a choice between no deal and extending article 50. May says Labour MPs should back her deal. Heidi Allen, a Conservative, says more and more MPs want article 50 extended. Can May assure MPs that the statutory instruments being passed next week will not include one to remove all tariffs in the event of no deal? May says discussions are still under way as to what would happen to tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. May refuses to rule out removing all tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, says a no-deal Brexit would undermine national security. If, by the middle of March, May has failed to get MPs to back a deal, has she still ruled out extending article 50? May says extending article 50 does not solve the problem. The only way to avoid no deal is to pass a deal, she says. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, accuses May of \u201cinflexibility and denial in the face of the facts\u201d. He says businesses are \u201cpulling their hair out\u201d at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. He says he does not think May would allow no deal. (\u201cShe will,\u201d someone shouts.) So will May rule it out? May says the way to avoid no deal is to pass a deal. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative pro-European, says the tone of Corbyn\u2019s response today suggests May will not get her deal through the Commons with Labour support. May says she would like to see \u201ca strong vote\u201d for the deal across the whole house, but Corbyn\u2019s response \u201cdid not give much encouragement\u201d on that front. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader at Westminster, says the best way to protect workers\u2019 rights would be to give them a say on the final deal. As May is responding, Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, apparently calls her a liar. Tory MPs protest. John Bercow, the Speaker, did not seem to hear the word originally (Blackford was sitting down, and the microphones did not pick up the word liar, although someone clearly shouted \u201cnot true\u201d). Then, after being advised by the clerks as to what was said, Bercow says Blackford should withdraw what he said. Blackford stands up and withdraws. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says May said a moment ago that she wanted Brexit sorted before Christmas. But it was May who cancelled the vote on Brexit planned before last Christmas, he says. Sometimes it is important for politicians to be honest with themselves, he says. Donald Tusk, the European council president, said the EU would not re-open the withdrawal agreement. Blackford asks what part of that did May not understand? He asks if May has done an economic assessment of the impact of her deal on the economy. He urges May to extend article 50, and \u201cto put an end to this economic madness\u201d. He says the SNP will not accept Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will. Ken Clarke, the pro-European Tory, says the EU-Japan trade deal is the biggest yet. Does May envisage a customs union that will allow the UK to continue to enjoy the benefits of this? If not, why does she think the UK will get a better trade deal from Japan than the one that the much bigger EU was able to negotiate? May says she wants to preserve the benefits of current EU trade deals after Brexit, and then enhance them with UK-only trade deals. May is responding to Corbyn. On Nissan, she says the firm has stressed that no jobs will be lost. She says being in the single market would involve accepting free movement. On delaying, she says she wanted this sorted before Christmas. She says every time someone votes against a deal, the risk of no deal increases. Here is the full text of Corbyn\u2019s response to May. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s plan has been widely welcomed as a way of breaking the impasse, by business leaders, and even by some Tory MPs. He says a no-deal Brexit would threaten jobs. May should rule it out, and back Labour\u2019s alternative plan. Corbyn says May is trying to get support for her bill by promising to protect workers\u2019 rights. But just look at the Tory record, he says. They opposed the minimum wage, and introduced employment tribunal frees. For many of them, ripping up rights is what Brexit is all about. He quotes Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, saying in the past that employment rights should be weakened. And environmental protections should be stronger too, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is responding. He says he normally thanks May for an advance copy of his statement. But he only got it today as he was leaving his office, so he can only assume she got Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, to deliver it, he jokes. He says May is running down the clock. She keeps putting off the vote on a deal. She has come back to the Commons today with more excuses and more delays. He asks if May has presented ideas to the EU. If such ideas exist, will she put them to the Commons? He says May is trying to run down the clock, so that MPs can be blackmailed into voting for the deal. In truth it appears the prime minister has just one real tactic: to run down the clock hoping members of this House are blackmailed into supporting a deeply flawed deal. This is an irresponsible act. She is playing for time and playing with people\u2019s jobs, our economic security and the future of our industry. The Nissan announcement about not producing a now model at Sunderland may be the thin end of a very long wedge. He says he has heard that other firms are planning similar announcements. Andrea Leadsom said today the meaningful vote may not take place until after 21 March. (See 9.47am.) If that is not the case, when will it take place? He says May urged MPs to hold their nerve. But try telling that to Nissan workers, and other workers worried about their jobs. He says, after receiving May\u2019s reply to his letter, he is more convinced that May is only pretending to be interested in a cross-party solution to Brexit. He says staying in the customs union is key. That is what business and unions want. He says May\u2019s deal does not offer the same benefits to CU membership. There would be barriers to trade under May\u2019s plan, he says. May says MPs have said they don\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit. But the way to deliver that is to pass a deal, she says. She says the talks are at a crucial stage. They all need to hold their nerve, she says. (See 8.38am.) May says MPs will debate an amendable Brexit motion on Thursday. She says it may take time to get a revised deal. But if there is no deal by Tuesday 26 February, the government will make a statement to MPs on that day, and hold a debate on an amendable motion on Wednesday 27 February. May says she is also looking at what can be done to ensure parliament is more involved in the next phase of the Brexit process, negotiating the future trade deal. But, she says, she and Corbyn do not agree on his proposal for the UK to stay in the customs union. She says parliament has already voted against this. In any case, membership of the customs union would be a less desirable outcome than what is already in the political declaration. Being in the CU would mean the UK would not be able to strike its own trade deals. May says this parliament has a proud record of going further than the EU on workers\u2019 rights. For example, it is going to abolish the so-called Swedish derogation, which allows firms to pay agency workers less. May says she has already made a no-regression commitment on workers\u2019 rights. But she says she is willing to consider legislating to ensure that, if the EU strengthens workers\u2019 rights, parliament should have the option of matching the new rules. But the UK does not need to follow Brussels to strengthen workers\u2019 rights, she says. She says British governments have in the past gone further than the EU on employment rights. May says Jeremy Corbyn shares her concerns about the backstop. Ministers will be meeting members of the Labour team tomorrow to discuss Corbyn\u2019s proposals, she says. Theresa May is now making her statement to MPs about Brexit. She says she went to Brussels last week, and said the UK wanted assurances that the UK would not be kept in the backstop. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, said, as expected, that the EU would not reopen the withdrawal agreement. But she and Juncker agreed to let their officials continue talks, she says. Two weeks ago, when MPs last debated the Brexit next steps, 17 Conservative MPs rebelled and voted for the Yvette Cooper amendment designed to allow the Commons to legislate to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The amendment was voted down. Before the vote there were reports claiming that many pro-European ministers (up to 40, according to one account) might resign to back the initiative, but in the event they all stayed put. Some of them briefed journalists to the effect that, if May had not got a deal by the middle of February, they would at that point rebel and vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Richard Harrington, the business minister, more or less said this explicitly in an article for the Observer. But now the pro-Europeans in government are minded to give May another two-week essay extension. But there will be conditions, according to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Number 10 has sent out a summary of what was said about Brexit at today\u2019s cabinet. For what it\u2019s worth, here it is in full. The PM updated cabinet on the talks with the EU and the statement she will deliver to MPs this afternoon. The PM said that in Brussels last week she had set out the need for legally binding changes to the backstop and had outlined the ways we thought this could be achieved \u2013 alternative arrangements, a time-limit or a unilateral exit mechanism. She said it is clear that these discussions with the EU will need a little more time to conclude and so we will not be bringing forward a meaningful vote this week, but will table an amendable motion for debate on Thursday. We will also commit to laying another amendable motion for debate by 27th February if a meaningful vote has not been passed by then. In the meantime, we will continue to progress the work on workers\u2019 rights, the role of parliament in the next phase of the negotiations and support for communities that feel they have been left behind. \u201cKnowing you from 20 years, I just don\u2019t believe that if your deal goes down, you are the kind of person who would contemplate taking this country into a no-deal situation.\u201d That was Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and chair of the Commons home affairs committee, to Theresa May at the liaison committee in November last year. Cooper is astute, and shadowed May for many years when May was home secretary, and until recently her assessment of what May would do if faced with a choice about whether or not to let the UK leave the EU with no deal was one that was widely shared at Westminster. But now people are not so sure. Within the last 24 hours three of Westminster\u2019s most senior political journalists have all published reports suggesting that May could well end up taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. No one is saying that she definitely will \u2013 predicting Brexit is even harder than predicting normal politics, and May\u2019s inner thinking is in many respects inscrutable \u2013 but it is worth knowing how the Westminster conventional wisdom is shifting, The longest and most detailed of the three articles is by HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. Under the heading \u201cWhy A No-Deal Brexit Is Now Theresa May\u2019s Fallback Plan To Save Her Party \u2013 And Herself\u201d, he says that those who know May and who have been trying to gauge how she would respond to a no-deal choice think the calculus has changed in recent weeks. Here is an extract. Several Tory remainers, including trusted gobetween Sir Oliver Letwin, have confided to colleagues that since the 230-vote defeat last month, May has entered into an irreversible pact with her Brexiteers. \u201cWhat worries me now is that it feels like something has changed,\u201d says one MP. \u201cIt feels like she\u2019s crossed a line now. She\u2019s boxed herself so far in she\u2019s lost any capacity to pivot, even though she might want to in her head, she\u2019s stuck now\u201d ... With any binding vote on stopping no-deal now unlikely to emerge until later this month, one Tory insider says the key factor has been that the PM is more afraid of her Brexiteers than remainers. Chief whip Julian Smith is understood to have counselled her that the danger will not come from pro-EU ministers thinking of quitting in protest. One source says: \u201cShe\u2019s been told \u2013 \u2018You need to understand prime minister, it\u2019s very simple maths \u2013 the ERG [European Research Group] will fuck you, fuck the Conservative party and they will throw themselves over a cliff. Your remainer colleagues will not\u2019. It\u2019s who\u2019s got the biggest balls.\u201d \u201cThe remainers need a gameplan to show Julian [Smith] is wrong on this. At the moment, they are rolling over having tummies tickled. And she\u2019s thrown all her weight behind the chief whip. \u201cShe gets to save her party and potentially gets to live for another day. She will be the PM who delivered Brexit. She can blame parliament and Tusk, Juncker and the EU [for no-deal] and say I managed it as best as anyone could. \u201cShe\u2019s home and dry as long as she sits tight with the Brexiteers who only a few weeks ago wanted her head. It\u2019s utterly tragic.\u201d In an article for Politico Europe, Tom McTague has picked up similar talk about May being willing to do anything to avoid splitting the Conservative party. He says: To understand May, one must understand her relationship with the Conservative party \u2014 a relationship unlike that of any other Tory MP. \u201cFor most of us, the Conservative party is a means to an end,\u201d explained the cabinet minister. \u201cTheresa is different. She has an attitude to the Conservative party which is more in common with a lot of Labour MPs. For them, it is something closer to love, to family. For us, you have family and nation, the Conservative party is just a vehicle. If it\u2019s not working, you change it\u201d ... One of her closest parliamentary allies predicted that May would \u201cpush as hard and long as possible\u201d to achieve a deal that her party and her parliamentary allies the Democratic Unionist party can support. \u201cShe will use every last minute of time before she has to make that choice,\u201d the ally said, adding that in the end, she may refuse to make it until it\u2019s too late to stop no-deal from happening. \u201cShe will delay and delay \u2014 she may not make that choice and go for no deal. I don\u2019t think even she knows.\u201d And ITV\u2019s Robert Peston explains in a blog why he now thinks a no-deal Brexit is likely, partly based on his experience of how the US authorities allowed the investment bank Lehman to go bust in 2008 - even though they knew this would trigger a disaster. So just to personalise this for a moment, on Friday 12 September 2008 it was obvious to me that without a bailout, the investment bank Lehman would be dead on Monday morning, but that the consequences to all our prosperity of Lehman going down would be so momentous that the US authorities and government would find a route to save it. Come Sunday 14 September, I was reporting that Lehman would collapse and be taken into bankruptcy protection the following morning. The rest is the painful history of the worst recession and blow to our living standards since the 1930s \u2013 which would not have been as acute if Lehman had not gone down. Brexit feels eerily like Lehman 2.0, if in slightly slower motion and on the scale of a nation and continent. Disclaimer: I make the Lehman analogy because both the government and EU leaders are explicit that a no-deal Brexit would have serious economic and security costs, just as the US (and UK) government, central bank and regulators knew that the collapse of Lehman would be an event that would impoverish us all. And yet they let it happen. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford on today\u2019s cabinet. No 10 are denying claims that the Brexit debate could be brought forward from Thursday to tomorrow (see 10.36am), the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar reports. There are no urgent questions today. That means the Theresa May statement will start at around 12.40pm. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. Theresa May would gain seats and win a tiny majority if there were a general election now, according to a YouGov poll and analysis for the Times. The findings probably deserve more attention than conventional surveys because this is not a standard poll. Instead, YouGov polled more than 40,000 adults and then used a system called multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) to predict results for all seats in Britain, based on constituency demographics. A YouGov MRP analysis before the 2017 correctly predicted a hung parliament when almost all conventional polling suggested the Tories were going to win. Here is an extract from the Times\u2019 splash (paywall). Labour is pushing for a general election but the new research suggests that this would backfire, with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party losing 12 seats and the Tories gaining four. The shift would take the Tories to 321 seats, just enough for a working majority. There are 650 seats in the Commons but Sinn Fein\u2019s seven MPs do not take their seats and the speaker is not counted. Today\u2019s figures would mark a poor result for Labour. It would drop from 262 seats at the last general election to 250. The Tories would rise by four from 317. The Lib Dems would gain four seats, reaching 16; the SNP would go up four to 39 and Ukip once more would win nothing. Here is a Times graphic setting out the YouGov results. And here are two graphics from the YouGov write-up of the survey. Here are the main points from Andrea Leadsom\u2019s Today interview. Leadsom, the leader of the Commons and one of the cabinet\u2019s leading Brexiters, hinted that the UK was no longer pushing for actual changes to the withdrawal agreement as the means of resolving the backstop issue. She said that it was important not to be \u201cpurist\u201d and that what mattered was ensuring the UK could not be held in the backstop permanently, not how that was achieved. (See 8.38am.) She did not rule out that possibility that the final vote on the Brexit deal could be held in the week before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. She said Theresa May wanted to put a new deal to a vote in the Commons as soon as possible. And she confirmed that May will bring amendable motion on Brexit for debate in the Commons on Wednesday February 27 if the deal has not been reached by then. When it was put to her that this meant the final vote might take place after the EU summit scheduled to start on Thursday 21 March, Leadsom did not deny this. She said: It is a negotiation. It is not possible to predict the future. But the meaningful vote will come back to parliament as soon as the issue around the backstop has been sorted out. She said she was confident that all the legislation that needed to be passed by 29 March would be passed by then. When it was put to her that parliament was not passing the necessary legislation, she denied this. She went on: Much of the preparations for Brexit, whether there is a deal or no deal, takes place in secondary legislation, something that is not often covered by media ... We have up to 600 statutory instruments [to pass]. We have now laid 411 of them ... They are being passed ... Those that need to be passed by 29 March, I am confident will be passed. There is a huge amount of work going on in the committee rooms. She insisted that Theresa May\u2019s letter to Jeremy Corbyn at the weekend did in practice rule out the UK staying in the customs union for good. (Some readers thought that May was leaving the door open to customs union membership in the letter because she did not explicitly say she would never agree to this.) Leadsom refused to say whether or not she would remain as a cabinet minister if May were to opt for remaining in the customs union, implying she might resign. Theresa May is going to give a statement to MPs about Brexit this afternoon. As the Guardian reports in its overnight story, she is going to ask the Commons to her another fortnight\u2019s grace to keep pushing for changes to the Irish backstop. Or, as May herself will put it, according to an extract from her statement released by Number 10 in advance, she will urge MPs to told their nerve. She will say: The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House has required and deliver Brexit on time. By getting the changes we need to the backstop; by protecting and enhancing workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections; and by enhancing the role of parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, repeated this line when she was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. But much more interesting was what she said about the sort of concession on the backstop that might be acceptable to the UK government. Two weeks ago, in the \u201cnext steps\u201d debate in the Commons after her Brexit deal was rejected by MPs, May said that she wanted \u201clegally binding change to the withdrawal agreement\u201d, involving the \u201cre-opening\u201d of that agreement. To many Brexiters in the party, the \u201cre-opening the withdrawal agreement\u201d part of that demand was crucial; they were not happy with the idea that it might just be reinterpreted by an addendum (something the EU has hinted it would consider). But this morning Leadsom, who is one of the most prominent Brexiters in the cabinet, suggested that re-drafting the text of the withdrawal agreement was no longer a red line. Here is the crucial exchange in her interview with Today\u2019s Mishal Husain. MH: Are you still holding out, you personally holding out, for changes to the withdrawal agreement? AL: You know, the point is to ensure that the UK cannot be held in a backstop permanently. How it\u2019s achieved is not something to be purist about. MH: So, as far as you are concerned then, words that are added to the political declaration would be good enough for you? AL: I would not speculate on what exactly the outcome needs to be. MH: But you have not said that you are wedded to changes to the withdrawal agreement. AL: I\u2019m wedded to delivering what parliament has said they would support, and that is some either unilateral means, or alternative arrangements, for the UK to not be held in the backstop permanently. I will post more from the interview shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 10am: The Commons home affairs committee takes evidence on the settled status scheme from the3million, which represents EU nationals in the UK, NHS Employers and the Rights of Women campaign. 11.30am: Greg Clark, the business secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 12.30pm: May makes a statement to MPs about Brexit. Also today David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, and Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, are meeting MEPs in Strasbourg. And Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is meeting his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit and May\u2019s statement to MPs. I plan to post a summary when I finish, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

In a written parliamentary statement following Guardian revelations that the abusive practice was spreading in the UK, the Home Office said it was committed to challenging the cultural attitudes behind all \u201chonour-based abuse\u201d, but gave no indication it would legislate. \u201cBreast-ironing is child abuse and it is illegal,\u201d the equalities minister, Susan Williams wrote in an answer to a parliamentary question tabled by the cross-bench peer Alex Carlile. \u201cNo one should suffer because of who they are or which community they are born into.\u201d British Border Force officers at ports and airports are trained to look for signs of those at risk of abuse and conduct regular joint operations with the police to raise awareness with potential victims of honour-based abuse, including breast-ironing, Lady Williams said. \u201cWhile there is no specific offence of breast-ironing, the police have a range of other offences at their disposal to deal with any cases they encounter,\u201d she added. \u201cThis includes offences of common assault, actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm. There are also specific offences of child cruelty and causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm, both of which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d Lord Carlile said the government position was a clear acceptance that breast ironing is a series offence. \u201cWhat we need now is for the police and Crown Prosecution Service to gather evidence and bring cases,\u201d he told the Guardian. The minister\u2019s statements came after the Guardian revealed anecdotal evidence of dozens of recent cases of the practice, in which a girl\u2019s chest is \u201cironed\u201d with a hot stone to delay breast formation. One woman living in the suburbs of an English city told how she started ironing her daughter\u2019s chest at the first sign of puberty. The child developed bruising and the mother was questioned by police, before being released with a caution. The police can prosecute offenders under assault laws, Williams said. \u201cThere are also specific offences of child cruelty and causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm, both of which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment,\u201d she noted. The perpetrators, usually mothers, consider the practice a traditional measure that protects girls from unwanted male attention, sexual harassment and rape. In west Africa, where the idea is thought to have originated, perpetrators have told the Guardian that the aim is to delay breast development so as to forestall sexual activity in pre-teen girls. Medical experts and victims regard it as child abuse that could lead to physical and psychological scars, infections, inability to breastfeed, deformities and breast cancer. Community workers in London, Yorkshire, Essex and the West Midlands have all reported cases of breast-ironing, but the custom is extremely secretive and there is no official data on how widespread it is. Police have said they will prosecute, but can do little without allegations and witnesses coming forward. Some experts say a specific law against breast-ironing could help, citing a similar experience with the criminalisation of forced marriage. But the government has indicated it is not minded to legislate. One activist who was a victim in childhood, Margaret Nyuydzewira, has estimated at least 1,000 women and girls have been subjected to the abuse in the UK. There has been no systematic study or formal data collection exercise. The government has previously said it is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to stamping out the practice.",

And I only have brand new tattoos.</p> <p>I came late to tattooing. Having narrowly avoided getting a Celtic band in 2003, it took me a full 14 years before I actually sat down in the tattoo chair. That meant I also avoided the late 1990s/early 2000s Chinese symbol trend, a fashion Ariana Grande recently revived when she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/31/ariana-grande-mocked-for-japanese-tattoo-typo-leave-me-and-my-grill-alone\" title=\"\">\u201csmall barbecue grill\u201d</a> inked on to her palm \u2013 but also that I will never be able to claim any of my tattoos were some sort of youthful indiscretion.</p> <p>I\u2019m unable to shake off that sense of being an outsider, something of a fraud.

      "bodyText": "There were two significant moments in the tattooing world last week. First, Adam Levine, of the curiously popular band Maroon 5, took his top off during the Super Bowl, revealing to the world a sprawling collection of ink. Then Justin Bieber stripped off for an US Vogue cover shoot with Hailey Baldwin, tattoos visible in every shot, his artwork more the focus than the clothes Vogue had dressed him in. Rarely do tattoos appear so prominently on the front of such a prestigious fashion magazine. Bieber\u2019s tattoos making a rare centre-stage appearance on the cover of Vogue should earn sleeves extra kudos \u2013 but has it? Some are wondering if tattoos have finally gone mainstream, jumped the shark (one of Levine\u2019s tattoos is actually of a shark), or even become uncool. But of course, people have been wondering this for years. Decades, even. \u201cYou can go back to 1880, and even probably beforehand,\u201d says Dr Matt Lodder, a tattoo expert and lecturer in art history at the University of Essex, \u201cand there are articles about \u2018Now tattoos are middle class\u2019, or \u2018Shock horror, women are getting tattoos now\u2019, or whatever it may be.\u201d Lodder, whose exhibition British Tattoo Art Revealed is touring the UK, adds that while \u201cmore people are getting tattoos than ever\u201d, another reason they seem more common is that in 2019 we all have the freedom to show more skin than in, say, the 1950s. \u201cIf your bank manager had a tattoo, you\u2019d never see it,\u201d Lodder says. \u201cNow, we\u2019re much more comfortable about showing skin and rolling up sleeves.\u201d But as someone who has tattoos, I felt distinctly uncomfortable seeing Levine prancing about topless during the Super Bowl. Seeing him held up, in front of hundreds of millions of viewers, as the example of a tattooed man is like your boss declaring they, too, went to that niche music festival, or someone you dislike declaring they are also into that obscure sitcom. He\u2019s ruining it for the rest of us. The mostly negative response to Levine\u2019s artwork may be partly because so much of it looks new. The lines are too crisp, the ink too dark. It\u2019s also a bit too on-point. It\u2019s all tigers and roses: a look that prompted one Twitter user to muse that Levine \u201cis tattooed like he\u2019s the main character in Memento but the mystery is where he left his Juul [e-cigarette]\u201d. That\u2019s probably what makes me uncomfortable: there\u2019s something distinctly uncool about a brand new tattoo. And I only have brand new tattoos. I came late to tattooing. Having narrowly avoided getting a Celtic band in 2003, it took me a full 14 years before I actually sat down in the tattoo chair. That meant I also avoided the late 1990s/early 2000s Chinese symbol trend, a fashion Ariana Grande recently revived when she had \u201csmall barbecue grill\u201d inked on to her palm \u2013 but also that I will never be able to claim any of my tattoos were some sort of youthful indiscretion. I\u2019m unable to shake off that sense of being an outsider, something of a fraud. And seeing Levine hopping about during the middle of an American football game, all crisp tattoos and dad dancing, brought all my own paranoia to the surface. I\u2019m a bit embarrassed. It was a bit too close to home. \u201cThere are plenty of super-cool tattooed people and there are some people that absolutely aren\u2019t,\u201d Lodder says. \u201cAdam Levine being tattooed doesn\u2019t affect me at all, the same way Robbie Williams doesn\u2019t, or Samantha Cameron doesn\u2019t.\u201d That\u2019s a better way to look at it. All tattoos were created equal. It\u2019s just \u2026 it\u2019s Adam Levine. And sometimes Justin Bieber.",

It\u2019s below. The bits in bracket are mine, and mostly taken from <strong>Katharine Murphy\u2019s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/13/nine-facts-about-the-medical-evacuation-bill\">explainer on the bill.</a></p> \n  <p>Where has <strong>Shayne Neumann</strong> been in the last 24 hours?</p> \n  <p>Mr Neumann\u2019s assertion that <strong><em>\u2018there is no difference between Labor and Liberal when it comes to our border protection regime\u2019 </em></strong>is exposed for what is and always has been \u2013 a ruse, a lie.</p> \n  <p><strong>(Politics)</strong></p> \n  <p>That Labor\u2019s invisible immigration spokesman would try to make that case today is laughable.</p> \n  <p>What Labor has done \u2013 via \u2018Shorten\u2019s law\u2019 \u2013 will completely unravel offshore processing and in so doing begin dismantling Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) \u2013 the Coalition\u2019s successful suite of policies to stop the boats.</p> \n  <p><strong>(It will not. The bill, which was an amended government bill, changes nothing in terms of OSB or border protection regime)</strong></p> \n  <p>Offshore processing is one of three pillars of OSB \u2013 it makes it clear to anyone considering attempting to come to Australia illegally by boat that they will not reach Australia.</p> \n  <p>Now Labor has provided the pathway from Manus and Nauru to Australia.</p> \n  <p><strong>(Again, there is no new pathway.)</strong></p> \n  <p>It has taken the decision-making power from the Government of the day and handed it to any two activist doctors who can decide \u2013 sight unseen \u2013 that someone in Manus or Nauru must be brought to Australia for a \u2018medical assessment\u2019.<br></p> \n  <p>(<strong>T</strong><strong>his is a lie. The minister can object on three grounds. From the explainer: First, the minister can refuse the transfer if he or she disagrees with the clinical assessment.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The second grounds for refusal is if the minister reasonably suspects that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security \u201cwithin the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Sticking with security, the transfer can also be knocked back if Asio advises the minister that transfer of the person to Australia may be prejudicial to security \u201cand that threat cannot be mitigated\u201d.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The third grounds for refusal is if the minister knows that the transferee has a substantial criminal record and the minister reasonably believes the person would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The decision needs to be made within 72 hours.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>If the minister denies the transfer request on health grounds (as opposed to security or criminal grounds), then the issue goes to an Independent Health Advice Panel \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The panel then conducts a second assessment and reports within 72 hours. If the panel reports the person should be transferred on health grounds, and the other vetoes I\u2019ve mentioned are not in force, then the view of the panel prevails.)</strong></p> \n  <p>This is the second pillar of OSB that Labor is destroying.</p> \n  <p>It has already declared that it will end Temporary Protection Visas instead of providing only Permanent Protection Visas to illegal arrivals in future which guarantees them residence in Australia and a path to citizenship.</p> \n  <p><strong>(They are not illegal arrivals, they are unauthorised arrivals. Labor\u2019s platform, ratified at conference, says these Temporary Protection Visas place refugees in an ongoing State of uncertainty and prevent meaningful settlement, creating hardship for refugees and denying Australia the benefit of their contribution. Labor will abolish Temporary Protection Visas and Safe Haven Enterprise Visas and transition eligible refugees onto permanent visa arrangements. It is for those who are already on protection visas and have no certainty of status.)</strong></p> \n  <p>Does anyone really believe that Labor will have the fortitude to continue the remaining pillar of OSB \u2013 boat turn-backs?</p> \n  <p><strong>(Politics)</strong></p> \n  <p>The answer is obvious.</p> \n  <p>Just as obvious is the fallacy that Labor is \u201clock step\u201d \u2013 \u201cno difference\u201d \u2013 with the Coalition on border protection.</p> \n  <p>Labor supports OSB \u2013 unfortunately for Bill Shorten it stands for Open Soft Borders.</p> \n  <p><strong>(More politics)</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T07:08:33.058Z\">at 7.08am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c63be42e4b04a6f567de7c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T06:51:22.169Z\">6.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It may be that the valedictory statements have pushed back the tabling of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation grant Senate committee report until later tonight, or even tomorrow morning. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c63bd58e4b00ef6acc6cffd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T06:50:35.335Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>First Dog</strong> has given his take on the last few days.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/13/is-the-government-embattled-is-this-a-massive-victory-for-the-opposition-what-does-it-mean\">You\u2019ll find it here</a></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/13/is-the-government-embattled-is-this-a-massive-victory-for-the-opposition-what-does-it-mean\">Is the government embattled?

Smith</strong>, to consider allowing a motion to refer <strong>Tim Wilson </strong>to the privileges committee over his handling of the franking credit inquiry.</p> \n  <p>The essence of the complaint is:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Tim Wilson authorised a partisan website <a href=\"http://stoptheretirementtax.com/\">stoptheretirementtax.com</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/08/labor-asks-afp-to-investigate-tim-wilson-over-electoral-roll-information\">part-funded by Geoff Wilson</a> which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/12/tim-wilson-to-assess-at-least-97-franking-credit-inquiry-submissions-he-helped-write\">garners submissions opposed to Labor\u2019s policy</a> and signs submitters up to a Wilson Asset Management petition.</li> \n   <li>Geoff Wilson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/06/pm-under-pressure-to-sack-tim-wilson-over-use-of-franking-credits-inquiry\">boasted to investors</a> in September that he worked with Tim Wilson, who chairs the House Economics Committee, to coordinate inquiry hearings with Wilson Asset Management roadshow events to help investors come to protest against Labor\u2019s policy.</li> \n   <li>Tim Wilson declared that he is a shareholder in two funds managed by Wilson Asset Management on the parliament\u2019s pecuniary interest register but failed to make a declaration in public hearings including the 30 November hearing at which Geoff Wilson gave evidence.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Burke questioned whether Tim Wilson had \u201corganised the committee\u2019s hearing schedule and locations at the behest of a person with a vested interest in the inquiry\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis also raises the question as to whether the actions of the chair amount to an improper interference with the free exercise of his own committee\u2019s authority or functions, such as to constitute a contempt of the House,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Burke suggested that given Tim Wilson\u2019s shareholding through his self-managed superannuation fund, he \u201cmay be impacted by the very policy his committee is inquiring into\u201d in his retirement.</p> \n  <p>He questioned whether Tim Wilson had breached standing orders that \u201cno member may sit on a committee if he or she has a particular direct pecuniary interest\u201d in the matter under inquiry.</p> \n  <p>Burke noted that as a result of the stoptheretirementtax website the committee will be using \u201cevidence written by the chair\u201d lodged through a website \u201cparty funded by a person with a vested interest\u201d in the inquiry.</p> \n  <p>In its first iteration the website required users to sign the Wilson Asset Management petition to register to attend hearings, although it has since been modified to remove that requirement.</p> \n  <p>Burke said the website \u201ccontinues to create the misleading impression that in order to attend people are required to register even though that is not the case\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Burke said that in effect people were \u201cforced to provide their private information to a commercial enterprise\u201d and the website was likely to discourage people with a different view on Labor\u2019s policy from attending hearings.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs such, in its deliberations the committee will be forced to rely on evidence which has been prejudiced by the actions of the chair.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Burke also noted reports that Tim Wilson had not intervened when the Liberal MP Andrew Wallace encouraged people to join the Liberal party and did not stop membership forms being handed out at the 30 January inquiry hearing.</p> \n  <p>The Liberal MP Jason Falinski also posted Liberal A-frames outside the hearing in Dee Why, he said.<br></p> \n </div> \n

mounting a major campaign.</p> \n  <p>Representatives of First Nations in the Murray-Darling Basin, who are in Canberra today, want a royal commission because they say their people had borne the brunt of mismanagement of the river system.</p> \n  <p>Burke said Labor might consider supporting a royal commission in the future, but don\u2019t hold your breath.

The actual issue here, of course, is that we are talking about search warrants that were executed in relation to a raid on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union that was looking at law breaking when the leader of the opposition was secretary of that union. That is what we are talking about here. The allegations are that donations were made from that union in an unlawful way. They weren\u2019t properly authorised, and one of those donations went directly to the leader of the opposition\u2019s own election campaign.</p> \n  <p> We have the Registered Organisations Commission that exists to make sure that members\u2019 money is actually used to benefit members, but, of course, we know that the Australian union movement has a culture where members\u2019 money is made to benefit the people who run that union. That is what we were investigating here. If you had nothing to hide, of course, all you would do is cooperate with that investigation.

So people that have been alleged to have been involved in sexual relationships with minors on Manus, people that have been alleged to have committed murder in one case, in Iran, these are the people that now will be permitted to come under what Labor\u2019s passed through the Lower House.</p> \n  <p> Question: How many is this by the way?</p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>We\u2019re just going through cases now, but there are at least about nine cases that I\u2019ve cited already where there are significant concerns about individuals and under Labor\u2019s now \u2013 if it passes through the Senate \u2013 law, we will see people coming as of right now effectively. It bypasses the minister and it puts the power to make decisions effectively into the hands of activist doctors.</p> \n  <p>Now, one of the lies that\u2019s going round at the moment Leon, is that there is no medical support on Nauru for example. The reality is that there are 60 medical professionals paid for by the Australian taxpayer on Nauru at the moment. The population of people, boat people on Nauru is 427. Now 60 medical professionals for 400 people is a higher per capita rate than you will find in Adelaide or any other regional area, remote area, capital city in the country.</p> \n  <p>So we need to be very clear that already medical support is provided, if somebody can\u2019t get the level of care that they need on Nauru, they\u2019re bought to Australia and we\u2019ve done that in many cases. This is really a complete unravelling of offshore protection, which has been one of the main pillars of Operation Sovereign Borders and I really fear that Mr Shorten\u2019s decision will result in boats restarting, kids going back into detention and it\u2019s unconscionable.

They can see his arrogance, as well as his recklessness, his absolute weakness in standing up for our national interests. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Bill Shorten has not learned from the failures of the Rudd Labor government.

And when you act against the advice of the experts, including the chief of the defence force, the head of Asio and the head of the federal police, I promise you, there\u2019s a price to pay. </p> \n   <p>Now, Mr Shorten has made a decision for political reasons that is going to see people come to our country who have serious allegations against them in relation to potential criminal activities. </p> \n   <p>Let\u2019s be very frank about this: this is a very problematic position that Bill Shorten has put our country in and he needs to explain why he has taken a decision that is inconsistent with the advice from our intelligence, our law enforcement and our operations sovereign borders agencies.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Now let\u2019s be clear \u2013 in the briefing, which the government declassified, the advice included this:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>Although people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in potential illegal immigrant (PII) intent \u2013 not smuggler marketing.</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>PIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention. However, PIIs will probably remain sceptical of smuggler marketing and await proof that such a pathway is viable, or that an actual change of policy has occurred, before committing to ventures.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The boat turnback policy remains in place. As for those with \u201cserious allegations against them in relation to potential criminal activities\u201d, the government has refused to give numbers, or examples on that. You can not be found to be a refugee with a serious criminal history and most of the people on Manus and Nauru have been judged, by both the UNHCR and Australian authorities, to be refugees. That is not an easy process.</p> \n  <p>The government has also been medically evacuating people off Nauru and Manus \u2013 but it has just been done through the courts. This has not resulted in an influx of arrivals.</p> \n  <p>The boats didn\u2019t stop coming. They have just been turned back. That is a documented fact. The medical evacuation bill maintains ministerial discretion for those rare cases that involve criminality. The medical review panel will be appointed by the government and will include Border Force officers. The bill only applies to the current cohort on Manus and Nauru. The advice makes it clear that while the people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australia\u2019s policy, those they are marketing to will \u201cprobably remain sceptical ... and await proof\u201d that a pathway to settlement in a western country is actually viable.</p> \n  <p>The government established an agreement with the US to settle some of the families on Nauru there and that did not result in an influx of boats \u2013 and that was an actual policy that settled refugees in a western country.</p> \n  <p>The asylum seekers and refugees sick enough to be transferred to Australia for treatment will remain in detention.

      "bodyText": "That is where we will leave you today. It\u2019s been a big week and after the last few days, I think we all need a bex and a lie down. Obviously, for me, when I say bex, I mean vodka, but insert whatever self-care aid is necessary. Tomorrow is Close the Gap. That should shift the narrative. It deserves to have the full attention of the parliament. But we\u2019ll see. The government and Labor are now locked in a battle to the death and the outcome is largely going to depend on how everyone in voter land treats what they are hearing. Politics is one thing. Politicising human tragedy is another.0 Hakeem al-Araibi will be in the Parliament tomorrow, along with Craig Foster and Kate Gill, to play a soccer friendly on one of the ovals here. A very human reminder of the people behind this mess. And why caring and compassion isn\u2019t weak. It\u2019s vital. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, who just doesn\u2019t stop, and the Guardian Canberra team of Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp. And of course, the rest of the Guardian brains trust who are unseen, but always remembered. It\u2019s been another messy day, but thank you to you for following along with us. We couldn\u2019t do it without you. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning, but, please \u2013 take care of you. From the valedictories Peter Dutton has put out a statement. It\u2019s below. The bits in bracket are mine, and mostly taken from Katharine Murphy\u2019s explainer on the bill. Where has Shayne Neumann been in the last 24 hours? Mr Neumann\u2019s assertion that \u2018there is no difference between Labor and Liberal when it comes to our border protection regime\u2019 is exposed for what is and always has been \u2013 a ruse, a lie. (Politics) That Labor\u2019s invisible immigration spokesman would try to make that case today is laughable. What Labor has done \u2013 via \u2018Shorten\u2019s law\u2019 \u2013 will completely unravel offshore processing and in so doing begin dismantling Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) \u2013 the Coalition\u2019s successful suite of policies to stop the boats. (It will not. The bill, which was an amended government bill, changes nothing in terms of OSB or border protection regime) Offshore processing is one of three pillars of OSB \u2013 it makes it clear to anyone considering attempting to come to Australia illegally by boat that they will not reach Australia. Now Labor has provided the pathway from Manus and Nauru to Australia. (Again, there is no new pathway.) It has taken the decision-making power from the Government of the day and handed it to any two activist doctors who can decide \u2013 sight unseen \u2013 that someone in Manus or Nauru must be brought to Australia for a \u2018medical assessment\u2019. (This is a lie. The minister can object on three grounds. From the explainer: First, the minister can refuse the transfer if he or she disagrees with the clinical assessment. The second grounds for refusal is if the minister reasonably suspects that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security \u201cwithin the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d. Sticking with security, the transfer can also be knocked back if Asio advises the minister that transfer of the person to Australia may be prejudicial to security \u201cand that threat cannot be mitigated\u201d. The third grounds for refusal is if the minister knows that the transferee has a substantial criminal record and the minister reasonably believes the person would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct. The decision needs to be made within 72 hours. If the minister denies the transfer request on health grounds (as opposed to security or criminal grounds), then the issue goes to an Independent Health Advice Panel \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. The panel then conducts a second assessment and reports within 72 hours. If the panel reports the person should be transferred on health grounds, and the other vetoes I\u2019ve mentioned are not in force, then the view of the panel prevails.) This is the second pillar of OSB that Labor is destroying. It has already declared that it will end Temporary Protection Visas instead of providing only Permanent Protection Visas to illegal arrivals in future which guarantees them residence in Australia and a path to citizenship. (They are not illegal arrivals, they are unauthorised arrivals. Labor\u2019s platform, ratified at conference, says these Temporary Protection Visas place refugees in an ongoing State of uncertainty and prevent meaningful settlement, creating hardship for refugees and denying Australia the benefit of their contribution. Labor will abolish Temporary Protection Visas and Safe Haven Enterprise Visas and transition eligible refugees onto permanent visa arrangements. It is for those who are already on protection visas and have no certainty of status.) Does anyone really believe that Labor will have the fortitude to continue the remaining pillar of OSB \u2013 boat turn-backs? (Politics) The answer is obvious. Just as obvious is the fallacy that Labor is \u201clock step\u201d \u2013 \u201cno difference\u201d \u2013 with the Coalition on border protection. Labor supports OSB \u2013 unfortunately for Bill Shorten it stands for Open Soft Borders. (More politics) It may be that the valedictory statements have pushed back the tabling of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation grant Senate committee report until later tonight, or even tomorrow morning. First Dog has given his take on the last few days. You\u2019ll find it here \u201cPolitics is not easy,\u201d finishes David Leyonhjelm, in what is his last speech in the chamber. David Leyonhjelm is now delivering his valedictory statement. He is leaving the federal parliament for a shot at the NSW state parliament. Thank you to those who keep their eyes out for me \u2013 Labor, the Greens and enough of the crossbench have passed this motion, which will force Michaelia Cash to give a five-minute speech on what has come out of the federal court AWU case. Labor, Greens, Centre Alliance, Derryn Hinch, Tim Storer, and One Nation voted for it. To move \u2014 That the Senate \u2014 (a) notes that, on 25 October 2017, the Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education (Senator Cash) told a supplementary Budget estimates hearing that her media adviser, Mr De Garis, had received information that raids on the AWU may take place \u201cfrom a media source\u201d; (b) further notes that, in court proceedings on 12 February 2019, Mr De Garis has now named the Minister\u2019s then Chief of Staff as the source of the information; and (c) orders the Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education, to attend the Senate at 2 pm on Thursday, 14 February 2019, prior to questions being called on, to make a statement of not more than five minutes to correct the record. It is worth noting, as I go back over the day, that Shayne Neumann has not been sent out to speak on the medical evacuation bill, despite it falling under his portfolio. Anthony Albanese has been the main Labor spokesperson on this, with Brendan O\u2019Connor (a former minister in this space) also wading in. Ron Boswell and Fiona Nash are both in the gallery to support Wacka. Wacka is talking about all the times he has worked with other senators, of other political persuasions, to get things done. Its nice to hear. What a treat on 2GB - a prime ministerial double-header with Tony Abbott followed by Scott Morrison. As far as I can work out the biggest threats to national security are Bill Shorten, the independents and our very own Katharine Murphy for pointing out the inconvenient fact that the medevac bill only applies to the current cohort \u2013 not future arrivals. Abbott responded to that inconvenient fact: Now [the message of the people smugglers] is going to be \u2018get on a boat, get to Nauru, get sick, get to Australia and stay in Australia\u2019. Sure Labor will say that\u2019s not what the fine print says. But the people smugglers are not going to be drawing their customers\u2019 attention to the fine print, they\u2019re going to say \u2018hey have we got a deal for you\u2019. And Morrison gave us the nuances don\u2019t matter schtick: All the journalists down here in Canberra in the bubble. They think all these little nuances matter. And the Labor party think it too. The people smugglers they just turn up to someone sitting in Indonesia and say \u2018guess what they changed the laws down there in Australia you can get on a boat now, let\u2019s go\u2019. They think they\u2019re all glued to listening to journalists in Canberra explaining the intricacies of things \u2013 it\u2019s nonsense. Abbott was prepared to say that security agencies had detected \u201cadditional chatter\u201d from people smugglers. Morrison said he couldn\u2019t confirm this but when it comes to waking the beast \u201cBill Shorten has given it a big poke\u201d. Abbott used the medevac bill to attack independents challenging Liberals in safe seats (like his own, Warringah): The Labor [arty can\u2019t be trusted to keep our country safe, it can\u2019t be trusted to protect our borders. When it comes to boarder protection Labor party is bad, but the independents are worse. Because Labor are only able to do this because they have the support of six of seven independents including three independents in what would normally be Liberal seats pretending to be Liberal-lite. They\u2019re not Liberal-lite, they\u2019re worse than Labor.\u201d Morrison said it was a fair assessment that the medevac bill meant Shorten was not fit to be prime minister. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got the ticker for it.\u201d He said: When it comes to national security you don\u2019t trade in it \u2013 it\u2019s an area of pure conviction. You do things because you believe it, you don\u2019t flip and flop as he\u2019s done here.\u201d John \u2018Wacka\u2019 Williams is giving his valedictory statement to the House. This piece, from the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s Judith Ireland is a very nice tribute to the outgoing Nationals senator. Michaelia Cash\u2019s former media adviser, David de Garis, has finished given evidence in the federal court after today revealing he worked with an aide to Michael Keenan to leak information about police raids to the media. The AWU\u2019s lawyer, Herman Borenstein QC, tendered email, text messages and call logs from De Garis\u2019 work laptop and mobile phone that were acquired as part of a separate federal police investigation and subpoenaed by the AWU. De Garis conceded he had deleted three text messages he had exchanged with Michael Tetlow (Keenan\u2019s former staffer) about the leaks. He did so before his work phone was collected by parliamentary staff shortly after he resigned, the court heard. \u201cCan I suggest to you that item 20 is a message from Teltow saying warrants are under way and your response is to thank him,\u201d Borenstein said, referring to an exchange between the two. De Garis said deleting the messages \u201cprobably wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do\u201d. Cash\u2019s former chief of staff, Ben Davies, will take the witness stand in the civil trial tomorrow. De Garis said on Tuesday that Davies had tipped him off about the raids on the AWU offices, which the union says were resulted from a \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d probe by the union regulator, the Registered Organisations Commission. If you are still wondering what the medical evacuation bill is actually about, I recommend you read this from Katharine Murphy: Nine facts about the medical evacuation bill Tony Abbott just spoke on 2Gb, followed by Scott Morrison. Yup. Paul Karp is listening for you. Anthony Albanese: We wanted to make sure that the very simple principle, that I have spoken about with you before, that you can be tough on people smugglers, without being weak on humanity. That is my firm belief. That is what we ensured occurred with the legislation that was carried, not just in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate today. And it is interesting that Derryn Hinch, who I think is someone of integrity, got a security briefing and then voted for the legislation.\u201d Anthony Albanese is responding to what Peter Dutton said on Sky. He said there are already 400 people in Australia, receiving treatment, and with their families, that is 900 people, already here. \u201cYou can have strong border security without losing your soul,\u201d he says. He says the bill just codifies what is already happening. \u201cThis has no impact whatsoever on the current border protection policy that is in place.\u201d Peter Dutton, not saying that the medical evacuation bill only applies to the current cohort: Let\u2019s be frank. There are two points to make here, is that nuance will be lost on the people in Indonesia and Sri Lanka (not if you promote it, David Speers interjects). No, we are dealing with people who are unscrupulous. We are talking about people who presided over an arrangement where men, women and children went to the bottom of the ocean. These are organised crime syndicates. If you think they are going to say to people you can\u2019t get to Australia, you are kidding yourself. The second point I would make, is that you\u2019ve seen what Labor has done in opposition, imagine what they will do if they are elected into government. If you think they are not going to bring people from Manus and Nauru, newly arrived on boats, I just think it defies credibility.\u201d It looks like the government\u2019s big stick energy legislation is coming up for debate tomorrow \u2013 and it is possible the Greens have the numbers for an amendment which would stop the government from being able to underwrite funding for coal projects. If it comes off, that would be another defeat. If it comes off. Definitely one to watch. Peter Dutton is now refusing to say that the medical evacuation bill will only apply to the current cohort. He also calls it a \u201cnuance\u201d. But refuses to say it. Just a couple of minutes after saying that there are people who are watching every word on this. Peter Dutton is on Sky News today. He says it is a \u201cstatement of the obvious\u201d that people have a \u201cparticular interest in this\u201d and \u201cas we have said all along, people watch every word, every debate on this, in this country\u201d. *Flashback to when the prime minister repeatedly refused to say that the medical evacuation bill only applies to the current cohort this morning* Brendan O\u2019Connor says whether Labor would keep Christmas Island open or not is a \u201chypothetical question\u201d. Why is is being opened? Why is the prime minister sending a message to people smugglers that Christmas Island is being opened. Never mind why would we close it, why would it be opened? What is the need to do that? The fact is he should be maintaining his ... maintain the policies, we support the government with respect to border protection policies. It is the prime minister, in the view of Labor and I believe in the view of most people in this country, that he has acted improperly, he has acted dishonestly in terms of how he has represented the legislation ... and he really should rethink his position. This is not a sustainable position of a prime minister that really wants to deal with this issue properly and is commensurate with his office.\u201d Jackson Williams is the Sky News NZ bureau chief. It doesn\u2019t look like New Zealand is happy with the decision to reopen Christmas Island. Brendan O\u2019Connor just ramped up Labor\u2019s rhetoric against what the government has been saying around the medical evacuation bill. The prime minister today in the most outrageous, dishonest press conference I have seen from a prime minister in my 18 years in this place, has actually done the opposite \u2013 sending a message, he is advertising like the ad man he is, to people smugglers, that business is open. That is an outrageous act, that is a treacherous act, it is an act that should not be conducted by a prime minister, but clearly under pressure, he has really gone the low road and that is a terrible thing for any prime minister.\u201d Brendan O\u2019Connor says Labor will keep the border protection policies which are in place. Brendan O\u2019Connor is speaking on what has come out of the federal court case today, where the AWU is attempting to have the raid on its offices declared unlawful (and therefore means any evidence gathered during the raid would be unuseable by the government). He is also speaking on the government\u2019s rhetoric around the medical evacuation bill. \u201cIt is extraordinary, it is reprehensible, it should be condemned,\u201d he says. I posted a tweet with a picture of the portrait before, but for those who missed it: Linda Burney on her portrait: I am humbled because I am reminded that we all serve in this place, and we enter this place having been lifted up on the shoulders of many others. This is not just about the portrait of me, this is about those who have come before me, and those that will come after. This is about all of us \u2013 and I want to really stress that \u2013 it is all about all of us. There is a little bit of all of us in this painting. It is also about those who were generous with their time, and those whose sacrifices have gone unsung and unannounced. But in my heart and mind, everyone here has helped build this subject. Whether you\u2019re a parliamentarian, a friend, a colleague, someone that works here in the parliament, I know many of you here because you see this as a historic occasion. It is an honour to serve. We say that often, but we all know it truly is. There is something beyond oneself in that service. I am constantly reminded about the significance of the election of the first Indigenous woman to the House of Representatives \u2013 young men and women from both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal backgrounds understand what that election means too \u2013 because they tell me so \u2013 that it\u2019s been important for them \u2013 and that of course is extraordinarily generous. This portrait is about First Nations women. It is about First Nations people , but as I said there\u2019s a little bit of all of us in it. And in turn, I am driven in this place and energised by my work \u2013 of what young people \u2013 women and men \u2013 say to me. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, has asked the Speaker, Tony Smith, to consider allowing a motion to refer Tim Wilson to the privileges committee over his handling of the franking credit inquiry. The essence of the complaint is: Tim Wilson authorised a partisan website stoptheretirementtax.com part-funded by Geoff Wilson which garners submissions opposed to Labor\u2019s policy and signs submitters up to a Wilson Asset Management petition. Geoff Wilson boasted to investors in September that he worked with Tim Wilson, who chairs the House Economics Committee, to coordinate inquiry hearings with Wilson Asset Management roadshow events to help investors come to protest against Labor\u2019s policy. Tim Wilson declared that he is a shareholder in two funds managed by Wilson Asset Management on the parliament\u2019s pecuniary interest register but failed to make a declaration in public hearings including the 30 November hearing at which Geoff Wilson gave evidence. Burke questioned whether Tim Wilson had \u201corganised the committee\u2019s hearing schedule and locations at the behest of a person with a vested interest in the inquiry\u201d. \u201cThis also raises the question as to whether the actions of the chair amount to an improper interference with the free exercise of his own committee\u2019s authority or functions, such as to constitute a contempt of the House,\u201d he said. Burke suggested that given Tim Wilson\u2019s shareholding through his self-managed superannuation fund, he \u201cmay be impacted by the very policy his committee is inquiring into\u201d in his retirement. He questioned whether Tim Wilson had breached standing orders that \u201cno member may sit on a committee if he or she has a particular direct pecuniary interest\u201d in the matter under inquiry. Burke noted that as a result of the stoptheretirementtax website the committee will be using \u201cevidence written by the chair\u201d lodged through a website \u201cparty funded by a person with a vested interest\u201d in the inquiry. In its first iteration the website required users to sign the Wilson Asset Management petition to register to attend hearings, although it has since been modified to remove that requirement. Burke said the website \u201ccontinues to create the misleading impression that in order to attend people are required to register even though that is not the case\u201d. Burke said that in effect people were \u201cforced to provide their private information to a commercial enterprise\u201d and the website was likely to discourage people with a different view on Labor\u2019s policy from attending hearings. \u201cAs such, in its deliberations the committee will be forced to rely on evidence which has been prejudiced by the actions of the chair.\u201d Burke also noted reports that Tim Wilson had not intervened when the Liberal MP Andrew Wallace encouraged people to join the Liberal party and did not stop membership forms being handed out at the 30 January inquiry hearing. The Liberal MP Jason Falinski also posted Liberal A-frames outside the hearing in Dee Why, he said. Tony Burke has taken to the floor to raise an issue of privilege \u2013 it looks like Labor is moving on Tim Wilson. Scott Morrison calls time on question time. The Greens will introduce a motion calling for a royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin plan later this afternoon, but the move is doomed to fail after Labor said it would not support a further inquiry. \u201cWe will soon have four extensive pieces of analysis into the Murray-Darling Basin \u2013 the Productivity Commission review, the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission, the Academy of Sciences review into the fish kills and the review commissioned by the minister,\u201d the shadow water spokesman, Tony Burke, said. \u201cAction needs to be taken now and the fish kills over summer have made clear just how urgent that action is,\u201d he said. Labor is introducing a bill this afternoon to repeal the 1,500GL cap on water buybacks as a first step. But that move will be met with ferocious opposition from farmers and the government whose National party MPs fear the economic impacts in rural Australia. The National Farmers Federation said it had collected hundreds of signatures overnight opposing a resumption of the hated water buybacks and is mounting a major campaign. Representatives of First Nations in the Murray-Darling Basin, who are in Canberra today, want a royal commission because they say their people had borne the brunt of mismanagement of the river system. Burke said Labor might consider supporting a royal commission in the future, but don\u2019t hold your breath. Any inquiry into the plan would canvass the political compromises that Burke made in the lead-up to the plan being signed in 2012. Andrew Wilkie asks a question about the Tasmanian bushfire response. Scott Morrison is listing what the government has done. Trent Zimmerman gets a dixer asking about alternative approaches for keeping women safe. #deathtodixers Anne Aly to Scott Morrison: Why is the government claiming that the recommendations of the banking royal commission can\u2019t be implemented before the election while yesterday saying it was possible to start legislating the recommendations? Isn\u2019t the truth that this government just can\u2019t be trusted to implement the recommendations of the royal commission? Josh Frydenberg: I\u2019d say to the member for Cowan she should have a word to the member for McMahon and tell him to get his skates on and produce a response to the royal commission. From those opposite, we\u2019ve had zip. Zero. Nothing. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. Where is the Labor party\u2019s response to the royal commission? All we have seen is stunts. The leader of the opposition, the Evel Knievel of Australian politics. The stunt master. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Scott Morrison: I have also asked the home affairs department to provide advice on the implementation of the measures that were set out in the parliament yesterday and were voted upon \u2013 moved and supported by the Labor party in defiance of the national security advice that they were very well aware of. There is an eerie ring to what we are seeing. The leader of the Labor party stood here last night and he talked about getting the balance right on border protection. I remembered that phrase very clearly. Because there was another leader of the Labor party who said just that. It was Kevin Rudd. He said, \u201cOur policy is clear cut. It\u2019s balanced. We\u2019ve got the balance right\u201d. A balance that led to 800 boats, 50,000 arrivals, 1,200 people dead at sea, all on the heads of those who sit opposite. All on the heads \u2013 on your head, your head and your head. They were all there willing it on. I remind them of the words of Senator Evans who said, \u201cThe scrapping of TPVs fulfils the Rudd government\u2019s ... The measure would not compromise the government\u2019s commitment to protecting Australia\u2019s borders\u201d. He said that on 13 May 2008. 2008. We know what followed. That set the boats running again. This leader of the Labor party does not have the strength to lead this country, to keep Australians safe and secure and he demonstrates his weakness in this place yesterday beyond measure. The Australian people have got this man\u2019s number. It comes up with a big fat zero when it comes to strength to secure our borders. The threat to the government of extra sitting weeks to discuss banking reforms appears to have receded after Andrew Wilkie expressed scepticism, a change of heart after full-throated support last week. Wilkie said that \u201cso soon and so few\u201d extra sitting days would \u201cnot allow time to properly prepare, scrutinise and debate the necessary bills in both houses of parliament\u201d. Wilkie told Guardian Australia the change of heart came after a treasury briefing and seeing the Law Council\u2019s view. The Law Council wants banking reforms referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission rather than rushed through in extra sitting weeks. \u201cI\u2019m sceptical that adding six days to the parliamentary sitting calendar would achieve any meaningful progress on legislating the bank royal commission recommendations,\u201d he said. We are all the Mars rover today. Cathy O\u2019Toole to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister find it so hard to just admit he got it wrong when he blocked the royal commission? Why is he repeating the same mistake with his part-time parliament which will stop recommendations of the royal commission being implemented before the election? Morrison: I refer her to my answer on this yesterday but I am very surprised that the member for Herbert would not come in here and ask me about what we are doing to support the people of Townsville during the floods. This was the whole answer. Christopher Pyne, in his dixer answer on defence spending, accidentally just admitted no one watches his Sky News show: I thought the shadow minister for defence has finally had a win. He doesn\u2019t have much of a profile but he\u2019s finally had a win. Pyne and Marles, featuring Christopher Pyne and Richard Marles, is something that exists. He quickly realises his mistake: Except when he is on my show! Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm reports he was the last senior member of the government holding out against a banking royal commission? Can he also confirm he is the key senior member of the government now holding out against extra sittings of the parliament to finally implement the recommendations of the royal commission he delayed? Josh Frydenberg: Mr Speaker, can the member for McMahon confirm there are 3,000 retirees in his electorate that he has told, \u201cDon\u2019t vote for Labor\u201d, because the reality is the member for McMahon has had an opportunity to provide to the Australian people a comprehensive formal response to the banking royal commission. Despite all the huff and the puff of how important this is, he\u2019s been left wanting, Mr Speaker. He\u2019s been left wanting with empty hands. With empty hands. Etc, etc, etc. Clare O\u2019Neil to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret describing the royal commission as a populist whinge? Given that this sort of attitude delayed the royal commission for almost two years, why is the prime minister repeating his mistake by refusing to schedule extra sittings to implement recommendations of the royal commission? You know how this goes. Josh Frydenberg yells some things. And then everyone gets a little chance to regroup, because Michael McCormack takes the floor, giving us time to update the elevator music in our head. At 2.44pm, Tony Abbott walks into the chamber for question time. The government backbenches are ENERGISED today. Christian Porter takes a dixer and includes this: What was it you did not want to talk about last night? There is no discretion for this government, or our minister, to stop the transfer of a person who is being investigated for, charged with or on trial for, or even awaiting sentence, for a serious criminal offence. This isn\u2019t a hypothetical issue. We are well aware of the reporting of a potential transferee on Manus Island charged with four counts of sexual penetration of a minor under the PNG summary offences and crimes against children act. We are aware of another potential transferee who has been charged with an indecent act with a child under 16, detained in Nauru and yet to have their first court appearance. There is another potential transferee charged with assault of a treating psychiatrist. None of those cases could result in the minister exercising the discretion to stop the transfer. Just think about what we were prevented from debating last night. Two doctors could initiate a process where the minister has no discretion to bring someone to Australia, who is charged with assaulting a doctor offshore, coming to Australia to get further assessment by a doctor onshore. We could not stop that transfer. That is absolute madness and something we were stopped fulsomely debating last night. What a ridiculous situation that you gagged debate and rammed through such an outrageous situation where ministerial discretion is reduced over serious criminality. You know what? If they had such a big win last night on border protection, why not a single question on it today? The government side goes off. It\u2019s like the Nickelback concert of their dreams, where Chad plays Photograph AND You remind me, given their reaction. (I just assume a lot of people who get excited about yelling SHAME listen to Nickelback.) David Lipson is the ABC Indonesia correspondent: Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: It is a matter of record that after Labor called for a banking royal commission in April 2016 many Australians were still subsequently ripped off by the banks. How many people does the prime minister think suffered during the 600-day period that he opposed Labor\u2019s banking royal commission? Will the prime minister at least say sorry to this group of victims who suffered because of his decision to put big banks ahead of the victims of banking scandals? It\u2019s Josh Frydenberg who takes it again and says all the same things. Please just fire me into the sun and get this over with. After a tumultuous morning, the high court case seeking to challenge Al-Kateb is going ahead. The lawyers for the plaintiff were unable to get the instructions from him they wanted, which was to have the case referred back to a single judge (after arguments about statelessness didn\u2019t go well this morning). Ron Merkel QC noted the high court could make the order itself, but it declined. Arguments on the case have now begun. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: The prime minister and every member of his government voted against a banking royal commission 26 times. Having delayed the royal commission, the government should not delay parliament implementing its recommendations. Given that the parliament is only scheduled to sit for 10 days in eight months, why won\u2019t the prime minister schedule extra sittings of the parliament to implement the recommendations of the royal commission? Josh Frydenberg is back: The member for McMahon hasn\u2019t even provided his response to the royal commission and he wants extra sitting weeks. He says, \u201cWe have, we have\u201d. An in-principle agreement. What is your message to the 17,000 mortgage brokers employing 26,000 people across the country? What is your message on once-only default? What is your message on once-only default? Does the member for McMahon agree with the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who said of our approach on mortgage brokers, \u201cI think the government is right to be cautious about going the full way and making the borrower pay\u201d? That\u2019s what the governor of the Reserve Bank said. ME Bank, owned by industry funds, has said about that recommendation, \u201cI do not think it\u2019s about making the consumer pay\u201d. When we talk about extra sitting weeks, none other than the Law Council of Australia said, \u201cParliament must hasten slowly. We must take time to get this right. We must ensure a real opportunity to set this right through meaningful reform is not lost in the race to the election.\u201d That\u2019s the Law Council of Australia sending the Labor party a message about their stunts.\u201d He continues, but it\u2019s pretty much what was in the last answer. It is nice though that the government needs to hear Labor\u2019s policy before moving on with their own though. Because that appears to be what Frydenberg is saying. I\u2019ve been inside for quite a few hours \u2013 can someone tell me if outside there are a bunch of people wearing bejewelled von Dutch trucker hats? Is there a lot of Playboy merch around? Is It Wasn\u2019t Me and Lady Marmalade suddenly top of the charts again? Because in here it is the early 2000s and if we have gone back in time I\u2019ll happily dig out my velour tracksuit, because there are some mistakes I would love to make again. Tanya Plibersek (who sounds like she has a cold) to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: Why won\u2019t the prime minister say sorry to the victims of the banks for voting 26 times against the banking royal commission? Josh Frydenberg takes this one: It\u2019s the Labor party that needs to say sorry to the victims of Opes Prime. It\u2019s the Labor party that needs to say sorry to the victims of Storm Financial, Mr Speaker. It\u2019s the Labor party that needs to say sorry to the victims of Trio Capital because the leader of the opposition was proudly saying, when he was the financial services minister, that we have the best regulators and the best banks in the world and he did not call a royal commission when they were in office for six years. Mr Speaker, I want to show the Labor party what a response to the royal commission looks like. That\u2019s what it looks like. It\u2019s got a heading, it\u2019s got a heading, it\u2019s got a title, it\u2019s got 40 pages, it\u2019s got 76 responses to 76 recommendations, Mr Speaker. The Labor party have had eight, nine days to respond to the royal commission and what have we seen? We\u2019ve only seen stunts, Mr Speaker. We want to know what more the Labor party can give than just they agree in principle because we looked up the definition of \u201cin principle\u201d, it\u2019s general idea although the details are not established. What is the Labor party saying to the 17,000 mortgage brokers? Are they going to say to the 17 ,000 mortgage brokers, small businesses, that they ignore the advice of the Productivity Commission? Are they going to say to the 17,000 mortgage brokers employing 26,000 people that they don\u2019t care about competition? Are they going to say to the 17,000 mortgage brokers that they want to give a big free kick to the big banks, Mr Speaker? Are they going to give the big banks a $2.6bn free kick as a result of their response to the royal commission? What about once-only default when it comes to super? Where is Labor\u2019s position? We are going to see some weasel words but where is Labor\u2019s position? The member for McMahon has had over a week, he was demanding we respond, demanding we release it so he could rush out his response but it is nowhere to be seen. The member for McMahon, the member for Hotham, they\u2019ve gone missing. They are running around the gallery whispering sweet nothings in the ears of the journalists saying, \u201cThe response will come\u201d. It\u2019s an in-principle support. I tell you what, the 17,000 mortgage brokers, the small businesses across all your electorates want to know what are you going to do for their future or are you going to end their businesses in your response to the royal commission, whenever we get it? Josh Frydenberg just managed to include the economy scare campaign line with the border security scare campaign line, and I think a part of me actually just died inside listening to it. But I tell you what weakens a country\u2019s budget. It\u2019s the same thing that weakens a country\u2019s national security and that, Mr Speaker, is weak borders. Bets on who is the first to suggest we just build a wall around the country? The Coalition leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, has said that both he and the prime minister have \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Michaelia Cash. In October 2017 Cash was forced to correct her evidence to Senate estimates when her media adviser, David De Garis, came forward as the source of the leak about the AWU raids. De Garis has since named Ben Davies, her former chief of staff, as his source for the information in the federal court. In response to a question from Labor\u2019s Penny Wong, Cormann said that Cash\u2019s claims that her office had nothing to do with the AWU raid leak were \u201cbased on her knowledge at the time\u201d. \u201cThis is also a matter that is currently before the courts, as such it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for the government to comment further,\u201d he said. Wong then quotes ministerial standards which require \u201clawful and disintererested\u201d exercise of ministerial powers, and Cormann responds that \u201cthere is nothing in the smear and innuendo that in any way contradicts the statement Senator Cash made in Senate estimates and to the Senate about these matters\u201d. There was a follow-up question earlier, to Michael Keenan: Is the minister willing to repeat the answer he gave the parliament outside of the parliament without the benefit of parliamentary privilege and is he willing to provide that statement as sworn evidence to any relevant inquiry? But it was ruled out of order. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: Malcolm Turnbull has said he\u2019s sorry for not calling the banking royal commission sooner. But since the final report was released, the prime minister and members of his cabinet have refused 10 times to say sorry for delaying the banking royal commission for nearly two years. Given that Malcolm Turnbull was decent enough to say sorry to the victims of the banks, why is he no longer the prime minister of Australia? Morrison: I refer the member to my answer yesterday. On the subject of sorries, when will the Labor party apologise for 50,000 people turning up on 800 boats? When will the Labor party apologise for 1,200 deaths at sea? When will the Labor party apologise for destroying the border protection regime? Simple question. He sits down and says \u201cI\u2019m finished\u201d (he means the answer). Yup. Yup, it\u2019s a trashfire. Peter Dutton: Mr Speaker, and if anybody had any doubts about what Labor would be like in relation to border protection, people who thought that maybe the Labor party had learned their lesson over the last six years ... Mr Shorten was going to support ... let me say to those people: Have no doubt this man sitting opposite me is not fit to be the prime minister of the country. Let there be no doubt about that at all, Mr Speaker. He has shown a reckless course of action that will see people coming from Manus Island who have been accused of being in sexual relationships with 14-year-old girls. There is a person who stands accused of murder in Iran who, under the Labor party\u2019s proposal, will have a right of entry into our country. They can scream all they like, Mr Speaker. They are the facts. They are the facts, Mr Speaker. Far from standing strong on borders, this leader of the opposition has demonstrated that he is even worse, that he is even weaker, Mr Speaker, than Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard combined. Scott Morrison took a dixer on national and border security, which included this: The Labor party did less in six years than we did in last year alone, Mr Speaker. As they let bikies and criminals and rapists and others stay in the country because they simply don\u2019t have the mettle to make the decisions to protect Australia and to keep Australians safe. Members on both sides. You have to have a strong economy to deliver all this but above all, you\u2019ve got to have the ticker and the leadership to deliver it. Something the leader of the Labor party does not possess. The election campaign is still months away. Months. Labor\u2019s Doug Cameron has started the Senate question time attack by asking the small business minister, Michaelia Cash, about evidence in the AWU raid trial. This morning Cash\u2019s former media adviser, David De Garis, told the federal court that the potential damage to Bill Shorten \u201cwould have been at least part of my thinking\u201d when he leaked news of impending police raids on the AWU\u2019s offices. Cash replied: \u201cSenator Cameron is presenting me with information of which I am unaware. As this matter is before the courts I don\u2019t propose to comment any further.\u201d Just on that answer, here is part of a question time from early last year, following Alice Workman\u2019s February 2018 report: Mr DREYFUS: My question is to the Minister for Human Services. I refer to a report last night from BuzzFeed News that the office of the then justice minister tipped off a newsroom so that TV cameras turned up at the sites of AFP raids before the police even did. A spokesperson for the minister is quoted in that report as saying yesterday: \u2018Neither the minister nor anyone in his office informed media outlets prior to the execution of search warrants.\u2019 Is that statement accurate? The SPEAKER: Before I call the minister\u2014this is why I wanted to listen to the question carefully \u2013 I want to be fully satisfied that the question relates to the minister\u2019s current portfolio. I\u2019ll hear from the manager of opposition business. Mr Burke: In taking a point of order, Speaker, if I can quote from page 555 of Practice: However, in a case when a minister had issued a statement referring to earlier responsibilities, a question relating to the statement was permitted. It\u2019s only on that basis that the question refers. The SPEAKER: In that context, I\u2019m satisfied the minister can answer the question. Mr KEENAN (Stirling \u2013 Minister for Human Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Transformation) (14:10): The answer to the member\u2019s question is yes, but we will not be distracted by this enormous nonsense that you see from the Labor party. The actual issue here, of course, is that we are talking about search warrants that were executed in relation to a raid on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union that was looking at law breaking when the leader of the opposition was secretary of that union. That is what we are talking about here. The allegations are that donations were made from that union in an unlawful way. They weren\u2019t properly authorised, and one of those donations went directly to the leader of the opposition\u2019s own election campaign. We have the Registered Organisations Commission that exists to make sure that members\u2019 money is actually used to benefit members, but, of course, we know that the Australian union movement has a culture where members\u2019 money is made to benefit the people who run that union. That is what we were investigating here. If you had nothing to hide, of course, all you would do is cooperate with that investigation. But what has happened is that the Labor party and that union have run an enormous amount of interference \u2013 this is just another example \u2013 as opposed to actually answering questions about the lawful administration of that union. Well, we won\u2019t be distracted. Nobody on this side of the House believes that any organisation in this country is above the law. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t say that for the Labor party. Ms Rishworth interjecting\u2014 The SPEAKER: The member for Kingston is warned. We are straight into it, today. Brendan O\u2019Connor to Michael Keenan: My question is to the minister for human services and refers to previous answers he has given in his current portfolio given on the raids on the AWU when TV cameras turned up before the police. On 1 March last year, the minister confirmed to the House no less than three times that neither he, nor anyone in his office, informed media outlets prior to the execution of the search warrants. Does the minister stand by the three answers he gave? Keenan: The answer to the question is yes, I do stand by those statements. I was justice minister for 4.5 years. Every single day, myself and my office dealt with sensitive information. We had protocols associated with dealing with that information and we continue to make sure those protocols were adhered to in all circumstances. Now, let me remind the House what this investigation is actually about. The AWU offices were raided in search of documents about wrongdoing by the leader of the opposition when he was in charge of that union. The treasurer! When he was in charge of that union, donations were made to GetUp and to his own campaign fund. The question that the Australian federal police were investigating about whether those donations were made in a lawful way or whether the law was broken. The response of the AWU has been, for 18 months, to run interference, to try and close down this police investigation. Now, if those documents don\u2019t incriminate the leader of the opposition, why is it they can\u2019t be made public? What is it that the leader of the opposition is trying to hide? I don\u2019t have questions to answer about this matter, the leader of the opposition does. For those wondering, Penny Wong accepted this at 11.45am: LGBTQ young people Tony Lee (General Manager, Minus 18) and Anna Brown (CEO, Equality Australia) will today present a joint petition to Senators in CANBERRA calling for the removal of discrimination from our schools.\u201d Scott Morrison walked in with Darren Chester right behind him. He\u2019s having chats with Josh Frydenberg. We are in the chamber for question time, so it\u2019s time for \u2018Who\u2019s that MP\u2019. It\u2019s an easy one (at least for me) Andrew Laming. He\u2019s very cranky at the Labor Queensland government for something over the Redlands hospital. Kerryn Phelps welcomed the bill passing the Senate (now it just needs royal assent, but Scott Morrison has confirmed it will \u201cfollow the usual processes\u201d). This is good legislation. What we\u2019ve done here is to ensure that the seriously ill people who are on Manus and Nauru who cannot get the treatment they need there because their medical practitioners there say they cannot, are able to get that treatment in a timely fashion. Until now, hundreds of cases have had to fight their way through the courts. People literally fighting for their lives through the courts, to get the treatment that they need while they are on Australia\u2019s watch. This just is not a situation that could be tolerated any further. What our Parliament and our Senate have done in the past few days is to say enough is enough. It is time for the Australian government, having done the job of stopping the boats and preventing unnecessary deaths at sea, to now prevent unnecessary deaths on Manus Island and Nauru. This legislation achieves that. Importantly, it\u2019s important to note that this legislation is confined to the current cohort of people on Manus Island and Nauru. It does not provide any kind of attraction to people to leave where they are and to try to make the journey to Australia because they will not be considered as part of this legislation. This is designed to solve a medical problem with a medical solution. We did have messages last night from some of the people on Manus Island who said that for the first time they were experiencing some degree of hope that they could get the medical care that they need, that they would maybe have their pain relieved, their distress relieved, by getting appropriate medical attention. Of course, a remote area like Manus or Nauru can\u2019t hope to provide the specialist services and investigations that a centre in Australia can provide. We know that from practising remote medicine in Australia, that people living in remote parts of Australia can\u2019t always get the care that they need and need to come to a major centre to receive that care. So it is with the people who are suffering on Manus Island and Nauru. I\u2019m proud of what the Parliament has achieved these last two days and I commend the Parliament for the action it\u2019s taken. It\u2019s now up to the government to make sure the people who need the medical care are not run through the courts unnecessarily and they get the care they so desperately need.\u201d It is the downhill slide into question time. Prediction \u2013 it is going to be feral, and probably just a little bit gross. Because that is where we are at this year. I\u2019ve just been reminded that the Senate committee looking into the Great Barrier Reef Foundation funding grant is due to table its report his afternoon. Catherine King tells the National Press Club Labor will not increase the Medicare levy, if it wins government. We don\u2019t have intentions to increase the Medicare levy. As I said, unfortunately, that damage the government did, the $3bn, is gone. It\u2019s difficult for us to come to office and replace that money but we will have a bit to say about what we want to do for primary care and what we\u2019re going to do about out-of-pocket costs particularly when it comes to patients suffering from cancer for example. We\u2019ll have a bit to say about that in the weeks ahead.\u201d Chris Knaus has filed this story: Labor will use an oversight in Tim Wilson\u2019s declaration of financial interests to ramp up pressure on the Liberal MP at the centre of the row over a parliamentary inquiry into the opposition\u2019s franking credits policy. Federal MPs are required to fully disclose all their involvement in corporate structures. The requirement is designed to boost transparency and prevent hidden conflicts of interest, but both major parties have at times failed to fully comply. Wilson, in his register of interests, has properly declared that he is a beneficiary of a family investment trust, Bolger-Wilson Investments Pty Ltd. But he has made a minor error by not declaring he is also a director or shareholder of the entity. Peter Dutton talking to 5AAA Adelaide radio this morning put a figure on the number of criminals the government is talking about: Dutton: This is a terrible situation because the Labor Party, Mr Shorten, has introduced a law which will allow people to come from Manus and Nauru that have serious criminal difficulties. So people that have been alleged to have been involved in sexual relationships with minors on Manus, people that have been alleged to have committed murder in one case, in Iran, these are the people that now will be permitted to come under what Labor\u2019s passed through the Lower House. Question: How many is this by the way? Dutton: We\u2019re just going through cases now, but there are at least about nine cases that I\u2019ve cited already where there are significant concerns about individuals and under Labor\u2019s now \u2013 if it passes through the Senate \u2013 law, we will see people coming as of right now effectively. It bypasses the minister and it puts the power to make decisions effectively into the hands of activist doctors. Now, one of the lies that\u2019s going round at the moment Leon, is that there is no medical support on Nauru for example. The reality is that there are 60 medical professionals paid for by the Australian taxpayer on Nauru at the moment. The population of people, boat people on Nauru is 427. Now 60 medical professionals for 400 people is a higher per capita rate than you will find in Adelaide or any other regional area, remote area, capital city in the country. So we need to be very clear that already medical support is provided, if somebody can\u2019t get the level of care that they need on Nauru, they\u2019re bought to Australia and we\u2019ve done that in many cases. This is really a complete unravelling of offshore protection, which has been one of the main pillars of Operation Sovereign Borders and I really fear that Mr Shorten\u2019s decision will result in boats restarting, kids going back into detention and it\u2019s unconscionable. But that\u2019s what he\u2019s put in place and it\u2019s clearly what Mr Albanese and others don\u2019t properly understand. Back in February last year, Alice Workman from Buzzfeed reported a journalist telling her they received a tip off about the AWU raids from Michael Keenan\u2019s office. Here is the response then: A spokesperson for Keenan told BuzzFeed News: \u201cNeither the minister or anyone in his office informed media outlets prior to the execution of search warrants\u201d. More from Luke at the AWU court hearing: A media adviser for the then justice minister, Michael Keenan, worked together with David De Garis to leak news of impending police raids on the AWU in October 2017, a court has heard. De Garis, former media adviser to then employment minister Michaelia Cash, told the federal court on Wednesday he told Keenan staffer Michael Tetlow that the raids were set to occur late that afternoon. Under questioning from the AWU\u2019s barrister, Herman Borenstein QC, De Garis said he told Tetlow that \u201cI understood that the raids were going to occur\u201d. \u201cWe organised to disseminate this information to the media together,\u201d he said. \u201cAmong ourselves.\u201d De Garis said he called print journalists from the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and Fairfax while Tetlow called TV media. Asked why he told Tetlow, he said because the raids were being conducted by federal police, which sat within the justice minister\u2019s portfolio. \u201cHe seemed the appropriate person to speak to,\u201d he said. De Garis said on Tuesday that he had learned of the raids from Cash\u2019s former chief of staff Ben Davies. Davies and Cash are scheduled to give evidence this week. Andrew Hastie, the chair of the joint parliamentary intelligence and security committee has released this report on the bill to give police more powers at airports: The bill introduces new powers for police constables and protective services officers working at major airports throughout Australia. Powers include the ability to issue directions in order to safeguard aviation security. Under the proposed laws, an individual could be ordered to leave an airport, or to not take a specified flight, for a period of up to 24 hours. The chair of the committee, Mr Andrew Hastie MP, said: \u2018During its review of the bill, the committee examined whether the new powers were proportional to the threat posed to aviation security. It also considered whether oversight and accountability mechanisms were sufficient and appropriate. The committee made nine recommendations in relation to the bill. These recommendations include an improvement to transparency and accountability requirements, allow for expedited judicial review of move-on directions, and ensure the new laws do not interfere with the right to peaceful assembly and protest.\u2019\u201d Catherine King is at the National Press Club today. She\u2019ll be delivering Labor\u2019s health plan. Gabrielle Chan wrote about that this morning: A Labor government would set up a permanent policy-making body called the Australian Health Reform Commission to address challenges such as chronic disease, cost barriers, long hospital waiting times and workforce shortages. The shadow health minister, Catherine King, will announce the promise on Wednesday to implement an independent body similar to the Productivity Commission, with commissioners appointed for five years. King says if Labor is elected, the commission\u2019s priorities would be directed through the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). However, she flagged reform of primary care to deal with an aging population, rising chronic disease burden and improving access to public hospital specialists as early priorities. And so is this court case The protest is still under way Richard Di Natale also held a doorstop this morning: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got nothing, when you\u2019ve got no plan for the country, all you\u2019ve got is fear and division, that\u2019s what this desperate move from a desperate prime minister is about. Opening up Christmas Island is a political tactic to continue to sow the seeds of fear and division within the community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister wants to run around the country, thump his chest, sound tough on innocent people seeking asylum because he\u2019s got nothing else. He\u2019s got no climate policy, he\u2019s got no energy policy, no plan to improve people\u2019s standard of living, address wage stagnation, tackle the housing crisis. He\u2019s got nothing. \u201cWe would welcome the opportunity to fight an election against Scott Morrison because he\u2019s got nothing. He\u2019s empty, he\u2019s hollow, all he\u2019s got is fear and division. And a leader does not divide the country in the way that Scott Morrison is trying to do. This is an insight into a prime minister who is an empty vessel, a hollow human being. A man who professes his Christian credentials and then says to innocent people \u2018you won\u2019t get the care that you need\u2019. There\u2019s nothing Christian about that. \u201cBring on an election. Bring it on now. Let\u2019s end this chaos, the circus that has been this Parliament.\u201d Bill Shorten spoke at the unveiling of Linda Burney\u2019s portrait, and told this story: Linda spent the first 10 years of her life here in Australia living as a non-citizen. As a little girl at school, she was taught \u2013 in her words \u2013 that she was descended from people who were \u2018as close to Stone Age as possible\u2019. She wasn\u2019t counted in the Commonwealth census until the age of 14. But imagine from today, from that background, her portrait will hang on the wall of the Commonwealth Parliament for as long as we have a Commonwealth Parliament. But what is noteworthy I suggest to you is the journey between those two points and it is Linda\u2019s story to tell. It\u2019s a story of personal resilience, extraordinary resolve, a fighting spirit worthy of the character of the great Wiradjuri people. But when I look at the portrait, I will see simply a story of hope. It is the hope that I\u2019ve also witnessed in the eyes of First Nations children, when Linda explains to them she\u2019s a shadow minister, a politician, a parliamentarian. The hope this portrait will offer to all of the schoolchildren who visit our nation\u2019s capital and our nation\u2019s parliament, who will pass through the space her portrait occupies. I also think the story behind this portrait carries a lesson for all Australia. It speaks a broader truth of the self-defeating folly of discrimination. The fact it has taken 119 years to unveil a portrait of an Aboriginal woman as a member of parliament is embarrassing. But the portrait will remind us that we are all - whoever we are and whatever our circumstances - that we are all collectively diminished by racism and prejudice.\u201d Mike Bowers has been very busy this morning: Centre Alliance have introduced a bill into the Senate, which would, if successful, see ministers undergo a security check. From Rex Patrick\u2019s release: \u201cIt is a curious fact that federal ministers have long been exempted from any form of security checking,\u201d Rex said. \u201cThis anomaly should be corrected to strengthen confidence in the integrity of the highest levels of government.\u201d \u201cMinisters of state occupy positions of the highest trust within the Australian government. Cabinet ministers are privy to the most sensitive decisions and information, including the highest levels of national security classified information. Other ministers and assistant ministers also have routine access to highly sensitive information including national security information.\u201d \u201cTens of thousands of Australian public servants, Defence Force personnel and government contractors are required to undergo comprehensive and highly intrusive security checking. Security clearance requirements apply to all staff of ministers, but not to ministers themselves.\u201d \u201cThe current Australian Protective Security Policy Framework advances no reasons to support this exemption. This policy has been in place for many decades but has never been explained or justified. Ministers are simply taken on trust.\u201d Michaelia Cash\u2019s former media adviser, David De Garis, has told a court it was likely the potential damage to Bill Shorten \u201cwould have been at least part of my thinking\u201d when he leaked news of impending police raids on the AWU\u2019s offices. Justice Mordecai Bromberg ruled this morning that lawyers for the union could cross-examine De Garis about his motivation for leaking the information. The AWU\u2019s barrister, Herman Borenstein QC, suggested to De Garis that damaging Bill Shorten\u2019s reputation would have been a consideration given his role as a political staffer. De Garis replied: \u201cPerhaps. It would have been at least part of my thinking, I\u2019m sure.\u201d The AWU is trying to have an investigation by the Registered Organisations Commission ruled unlawful, arguing that the leaking of the raids on 24 October 2017 shows the entire investigation was politically motivated. The commission is investigating donations made to GetUp! while Shorten was the union\u2019s leader. The hearing is continuing. It doesn\u2019t sound as though things are going too smoothly for the plaintiff in the high court case at the moment. Helen Davidson is covering it for us and will have an update soon. A large group \u2013 about 100 \u2013 of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are protesting in the foyer of Parliament House. Seed Indigenous Youth Climate Network put out this statement about the protest: \u201cPeople have travelled to Canberra from all across the continent to speak out about the destruction of country and water from extractive fossil fuel industries that are fuelling the climate crisis,\u201d Amelia Telford of the Seed Indigenous Youth Climate Network said. \u201cAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are hit first and worst by climate change. We are hurting in the face of water shortages, extreme heat, environmental pollution and the destruction of country and culture. \u201cWe\u2019re fed up with governments and big business destroying country, threatening precious water and putting the future of our children and younger generations on the line.\u201d Linda Burney, as the first Aboriginal woman elected to the House, now has a portrait: Penny Wong will hold a press conference at 11.45. Bob Katter says he has told Scott Morrison that he would find it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to allow the parliament to rise without doing something about the banks. He tells Sky News that Morrison asked him \u201cwhat would you want out of it\u201d. He says he wants \u201csubstantive action\u201d or he would find it difficult not to vote for parliament to come back. Reconstruction loans are on the top of his agenda. And, by the sound of it, he wants the government to form its own bank \u2013 loaning money at the same rate it receives it for. But, because it is Katter, he says he will need promises from Labor to consider bringing parliament back. So, if neither promise him anything, he\u2019ll \u2026 do nothing? Strap in. All the gloves are off. Ayes: 36 Noes: 34 Labor, the Greens, Tim Storer, Derryn Hinch and Centre Alliance all vote yes. There is short burst of applause. The Senate is voting on the medical evacuation bill. It WILL pass, with Derryn Hinch\u2019s support. Derryn Hinch on why he is voting yes: I have been briefed by both sides of this parliament. I had a half-hour briefing with security forces this morning. I do have some doubts about some aspects of it. I\u2019m glad that the 24 hours is pushed back, that the Labor party amendments pushed that back and now goes to virtually 72 hours, add things on to it, it can get to one week. What really swayed me was the amendment that I\u2019m surprised the Greens agreed to, that is the one that will apply only to people who are currently on Nauru or on Manus that. It is not an encouragement, I believe to people smugglers who are despicable and should be despised, because it will only apply to people who are there. And people are transferred off Manus and brought back to Australia, according to the home affairs department \u2013 they assured me today they will remain in detention in some manner or form. So they will not be coming here and wandering around the streets of Australia. They\u2019ll be coming here for medical attention. I will acknowledge that the government has spent a lot of more money on medical facilities on Nauru and also at Manus but there are conditions which cannot be taken care of there. The doctors who have worked there say there\u2019s some medical conditions, medical situations, where they just cannot possibly be done there and they should be brought here. So I\u2019m \u2013 I am still perplexed by some aspects of it, and I was quite happy to be accused of flip flopping if it had gone the other way, because what we voted for in December, according to the solicitor general, might not even be constitutional. That was another aspect that came up yesterday. So it has been a very tortured 24 hours. There\u2019s been a lot of pressure from a lot of people on all sides of the chamber but that\u2019s part of this job and now I can proudly say that, yes, I don\u2019t need the full five minutes, I can give it to some other people to you can, ta. I think it\u2019s the right decision. It\u2019s a humanitarian decision because in the Justice party world we tried to look after young people, old people, sick people. Well, all those three categories still apply in these amendments and, therefore, I will be supporting them. On the reopening of Christmas Island, that comes from this part of the declassified security advice: On transfer to Australia, the individuals would be detained under the Migration Act 1958 (Migration Act) and placed in held detention or in community detention by way of a residence determination. Placing up to 1000 people in held detention will put pressure on the detention network and with risk assessments, some, but not all, may be suitable for community detention. Those not suitable for community detention would be placed in held detention, likely necessitating the stand-up of the Christmas Island facility and removing our hot contingency fall back for Operation Sovereign Borders. Penny Wong\u2019s office has released the transcript of her speech from this morning. Here is where she got angry: We will never let the people smugglers back in business. We have been clear that we support offshore processing, turnbacks when safe to do so and regional resettlement \u2013 and we are responsible. You don\u2019t see us leaking classified information for political purposes \u2013 a completely shameful act by those opposite, by those who represent those opposite. We act on the advice from agencies, as demonstrated in the constructive negotiations and the amendments which were put and agreed against the votes of the government in the lower house. Those amendments enhance the security arrangements, extend the time frame of the government to refuse transfers and ensure that this legislation is ring-fenced. They only apply to a fixed number of people who are already in regional processing. The bill requires the government to listen to the advice of doctors. It is not prospective and, of course, this legislation will continue the practice where people who are transferred for medical will continue to be held in detention as a default, and only the minister can approve their release. There are lies being told about this bill by those opposite, and they are doing it because they are desperate. They are desperate. They are led by a desperate prime minister, who is leading a bitterly divided government. He is clearly only concerned about one thing: clinging on to his job. That is the only thing this has always been about. The shenanigans we saw at the end of last year: filibuster, filibuster and then sending the House of Representatives home before you could deal with a national security bill. There was brinkmanship with national security. The telecommunications legislation was a national security bill, and you packed up shop in the lower house and played brinkmanship with national security! And you have the gall to come into here and talk about being responsible? You know the party that was responsible on that day? It was the Labor party. And we will continue to be responsible while you play politics with national security. Well, we don\u2019t. We don\u2019t. Rather than running these lies, why don\u2019t you just call an election? Can we just take a moment to look back at that press conference, at this moment between David Speers from Sky and Scott Morrison: Speers: Prime minister, just on medevac, are you willing to say to would-be asylum seekers this will not apply to you if you come now? Morrison: If we\u2019re re-elected it won\u2019t apply to anybody because I will reverse it. Speers asks the question again. Morrison: I can only say what the law says. It\u2019s not my law. I think it\u2019s a foolish law. It\u2019s a foolish law and it\u2019s not one that I support. Speers: For the sake of deterring arrivals do you say it does not apply to new arrivals? Morrison: I\u2019ll be engaging in direct messaging as part of Operation Sovereign Borders with people smugglers and with those who might be thinking on getting on boats. Not the first time I have done that \u2013 to send very clear messaging that my government is in control of the borders. As long as my government is here you can expect strong border protection and resolved to be in place. Under a Labor government you can expect them to see fold like a pack of cards, like Bill Shorten did yesterday. He would not say it. The prime minister, who has spent the past 24 hours telling us our borders will now be over run because of this medical evacuation bill, would not say that it only applies to the cohort already on Manus and Nauru, which is a key part of the bill. He would not say the words, despite telling us that people smugglers and those they market to, are watching this very closely. He. Would. Not. Say. It. Let that sink in. Scott Morrison, pulled up on his comment that: So if they don\u2019t come, it will be because of the work and the decisions we are now taking and the actions we are putting in place. If they do come, you can thank the Labor party and Bill Shorten because he is the one who has led this process. is asked by Sarah Martin from the West Australian: \u201cAre you in control of the borders or not?\u201d Morrison: Of course I am \u2013 what I\u2019m saying is that the Labor party has weakened our border protection. That is true. But what remains is the resolve and strength and conviction of my government, myself as prime minister, Peter Dutton as home affairs minister, and that still remains a big hurdle for them to get over. I can tell you the bar they have to clear if Bill Shorten is prime minister is lower than a snake\u2019s belly. Let\u2019s remember that Derryn Hinch made this decision after receiving a security briefing this morning. He heard the same thing the government did. Derryn Hinch: It has been a very tortured 24 hours, it has been a lot of pressure, from a lot of people that is part of this job, but now I can proudly say, yes, I think it is the right decision, I think it is a humanitarian decision. The Victorian senator said he believes, after his security briefing today, that the bill is sound. Scott Morrison will not say, in this press conference, that the bill only applies to the current cohort \u2013 which is what the bill says \u2013 to deter people smugglers. Question: Are you willing to say to would-be asylum seekers this will not apply to you if you come now? Morrison: If we\u2019re re-elected it won\u2019t apply to anybody because I will reverse it \u2026 I can only say what the law says. It\u2019s not my law. I think it\u2019s a foolish law. It\u2019s a foolish law and it\u2019s not one that I support. Question: For the sake of deterring arrivals do you say it does not apply to new arrivals? Morrison: I\u2019ll be engaging in direct messaging as part of Operation Sovereign Borders with people smugglers and with those who might be thinking on getting on boats. Not the first time I have done that \u2013 to send very clear messaging that my government is in control of the borders. As long as my government is here you can expect strong border protection and resolved to be in place. Under a Labor government you can expect them to see fold like a pack of cards like Bill Shorten did yesterday. Question: Aren\u2019t you weakening that message, though? Morrison: No. Question: By not spelling out in some detail ... Morrison: I said I\u2019m going to be engaged in very clear and direct messaging to anyone who thinks they should get on a boat, I\u2019m here. And I will stop you. And if Scott Morrison loses the fight against putting in extra sitting days, will he call an election? I\u2019m not engaging on those sort of issues. We will continue to work our issues through the parliament and we\u2019ll deal with them as they present. We will continue to take strong action when it comes to the royal commission. There are matters before the parliament even now that we\u2019re working through. We\u2019re putting in place the arrangements which doesn\u2019t require legislation to activate cases and go back 10 years to be considered by Afac and many other recommendations. We\u2019re taking objection on the royal commission. We will continue to do that and we\u2019ll do it in a calm, responsible way. We won\u2019t \u2013 see, I\u2019m glad you raised this because we\u2019re getting an insight into Bill Shorten. He has taken a reckless approach to border management. I mean, last year he had his senators vote for this bill in the form which he told us yesterday was dangerous and required amendment yet he was prepared to have his own members of the House vote for it last December \u2013 a wreck lest act on our borders which he only doubled down yesterday and now he says we should recklessly prepare legislation in response to 40 recommendations without having the opportunity to consider unintended consequences and ensure the consultant case is done and this legislation is done correctly as the Law Council has advised. Bill Shorten has a very reckless opportunistic approach to these serious matters. I\u2019m not going to take that approach. We will continue to govern in a calm and responsible way and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing today. Everybody else can flap their arms about. My arms are firmly by my side and I\u2019m very focused on the job I have got ahead of me. Why won\u2019t he go to an election? We\u2019ll go to the election in May. I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by the Labor Party from handing down a surplus budget in April. I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by the Parliament from distracting my attention from the things that need to be attended to, which I got to tell you right now in addition to cleaning up the mess on our borders that Labor Party created yesterday, my focus is also very firmly focussed on what is unfolding in North Queensland and for our cattle industry and those devastated communities. Now, I haven\u2019t heard much, I haven\u2019t heard much, on that front but I can tell you there\u2019s a lot of that being addressed in my office just in here and in our cabinet room and my meetings with ministers. I\u2019m very focussed on that issue at the moment as I am on this issue. And will continue to be. I\u2019m not going to debt distracted by all the frankly - I know you don\u2019t like the phrase - but the bubble nonsense of people going on about all sorts of precedents all the rest of it. Frankly, not interested. I got too many other important things to focus on.\u201d Katharine Murphy had this exchange with Scott Morrison: Murphy: Your government MPs, people like Tony Abbott, are saying that as a consequence of the bill that passed the House yesterday, it\u2019s now get on a boat, get to Nauru, get sick and get to Australia when the law that passed the House ... Morrison: That is entirely possible. That is entirely possible. Murphy: If I can finish? That \u2013 get to Australia. The law that passed the House yesterday, I don\u2019t know what will pass the Senate because it hasn\u2019t happened yet, but the law that passed the House yesterday clearly ring fences to the current cohorts. So what Mr Abbott is saying is not true. Morrison: No, I\u2019m sorry, Katharine, you failed to understand that people smugglers don\u2019t deal with the nuance of the Canberra bubble. They deal with the psychology of messagings of whether things are stronger or whether things are weaker. It might be all fine and nice to talk about these nuances here in this courtyard but when you\u2019re in a village in Indonesia and someone is selling you a product, there\u2019s no \u2013 there\u2019s no protections or truth in advertising laws for people smugglers. They just sell the message and what Tony Abbott has said is exactly what the people smugglers will be saying. Murphy: Prime minister ... Morrison: No, I\u2019m going over here. Murphy: It is not a nuance, it is a fact. Morrison: It is a nuance which the people smugglers will ignore and what is true today, Katharine, what is true today is as a result of what happened in the parliament yesterday and what is happening in the Senate now is our border protection laws are weaker than they were days ago. That\u2019s a fact. Scott Morrison: Now, I want to make a couple of other points because there is a lot of misinformation and, frankly, lies, that are being put around. There are more than 60 medical professionals on Nauru, for 420 people. If that says there is no medical facilities available on Nauru, then that is ridiculous. Tell me another part of this country that has one medical professional for every seven people. There is, in fact, one medical \u2013 I should say mental health professional for every 14 people on Nauru. On top of that, there is no one in detention on Nauru, not one person. And, as you already know, apart from the four who will be transferred to the United States, there are no children on Nauru. So the Labor party cannot absolve themselves by telling themselves lies as motivation for what they did in the parliament yesterday and what they are doing now. They have done what they have done. Bill Shorten has done what he has done out of manifest weakness, an inability to stand up to the left wing of his own party, the Greens and others who have plied pressure to him, he has nod strength on this issue and he cannot be trusted to follow through on any of the border protection measures that our government has put in place. So we are taking the decisions and the action to clean up the mess that the Labor party has once again created and we will be undertaking all our efforts to do just that. Scott Morrison says he has authorised the reopening of the Christmas Island detention centre. We have approved putting in place the reopening of the Christmas Island detention facilities, both to deal with the prospect of arrivals as well as dealing with the prospect of transfers. The full cost of those was set out in the declassified briefing which you\u2019ve already seen and the final costings of those will be dealt with by the re-ramping of facilities. That will be dealt with by home affairs. In relation to the implementation of the laws passing through the Senate, I\u2019ve asked the Department of Home Affairs for an implementation report. I will await that report and then take further decisions on that once I have that information available to me. My job now is to ensure that the boats don\u2019t come. My job now is to everything within my power and in the power of the government to ensure that what the parliament has done to weaken our borders does not result in boats coming to Australia. It is still the case that our government is running border protection in this country and that, of itself, is a great deterrent, because they know our resolve. The people smugglers know my resolve. They know Peter Dutton\u2019s resolve. They know we will do everything in our power to stop them at every point. And we remain standing here to ensure that they don\u2019t come. So if they don\u2019t come, it will be because of the work and the decisions we are now taking and the actions we are putting in place. If they do come, you can thank the Labor party and Bill Shorten because he is the one who has led this process. He has led this process to weaken and compromise our borders. The prime minister says he called a meeting with security agencies this morning and is now adopting a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d after their advice, to strengthen Operation Sovereign Borders. I understand the Senate will be passing the bill that went through the House yesterday. Earlier today I convened a meeting of the national security committee to take the decisions that were necessary following on from the contingency planning that had been put in place over the last couple of weeks. That contingency planning and the decisions I\u2019ve taken this morning together with the other NSC ministers is there is a range of strengthenings that have been put in place in terms of Operation Sovereign Borders and their operations. I want to stress that all of the actions and decisions that we are taking are implementing the recommendations of these agencies and the officials as presented to us this morning. We are adopting all of the recommendations they have put, based on their advice in response to the decisions that have been taken in the Australian parliament. We\u2019re implementing them all 100%. Everything they are asking for, they are getting and that has involved a strengthening of the capacity of Operation Sovereign Borders across a whole range of fronts. I am not at liberty to go into the detail of what they are for obvious reasons. This parliament has already tipped its hand enough to the people smugglers. I won\u2019t be doing that in compromising our operations and how we now address the consequences of what this parliament is doing to our borders. The whole motion, as moved by Jacinta Collins: Labor is attempting to limit debate speeches to five minutes and the debate to 30 minutes. That comes after last year\u2019s filibustering saw the debate stretch into hours and hours. Another procedural motion. It\u2019s being dragged out. Ayes: 33 Noes: 31 Won by the same cohort. Jacinta Collins is now moving the motion that the bill report the message from the House \u2013 that the bill be dealt with immediately, ahead of all other Senate messages. That motion is also won by Labor and the crossbench members in support of the bill (Tim Storer, Centre Alliance and the Greens. Derryn Hinch has voted yes on the procedural motions, but we\u2019ll wait to see if he votes yes on the actual bill). Ayes: 33 Noes: 31 Scott Morrison is about to start his press conference. The chamber is dividing again, to see if that motion is agreed to. That brings on the bill. Labor is moving that the bill be agreed to without amendment or debate. No word on which way Derryn Hinch will vote as yet. The vote is won by Labor and the crossbench. Ayes: 32 Noes: 31 The doors are locked. It looks as though Derryn Hinch is sitting with Labor \u2013 on the motion to bring the bill on. No sign of Derryn Hinch in the chamber as yet, with 1.30 on the bells. Scott Ryan is calling for a vote on the suspension motion. If this is won, the Senate will deal with the bill immediately. Cory Bernardi says if a refugee or asylum seeker on Nauru or Manus Island hasn\u2019t claimed to have a mental illness, then \u201cthat means you are mentally ill because you haven\u2019t gamed the system enough\u201d. That is where this debate is going. FFS. Cory Bernardi also mentions the bill allowing \u201cpaedophiles\u201d into the country, as well as rapists, including those who haven\u2019t been convicted. That\u2019s been a strong theme today. It couldn\u2019t be that Derryn Hinch, as the swing vote, has made a career on fighting sex crimes, particularly paedophilia, could it? Meanwhile, Labor has announced this: Labor will introduce amendments in the Senate today to overhaul a government bill \u2013 the Treasury Laws Amendment (Strengthening Corporate and Financial Sector Penalties) Bill 2018: Increasing jail time for the most serious corporate crimes from 10 to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment More than double the proposed cap on financial penalties to $525m This would mean that for the conduct revealed in the royal commission report \u2013 including fees for no service \u2013 bankers would face an extra five years in jail. \u201cThere are lies being told on this bill by those opposite, and they are doing it because they are desperate,\u201d Penny Wong says. Wong is angry. Proper angry. She mentions how the government sent the House home before the encryption bill was passed last year, so it wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the bill, accusing the government of \u201cplaying politics\u201d with national security. Penny Wong calls the government\u2019s changing position on the importance of the bill as \u201ca pattern of deceit\u201d from a government with nothing left but \u201csmear and fear\u201d. Mitch Fifield is arguing that border security is the responsibility of the elected government of the day. But again, the government does not consider this bill to be a matter of \u201cvital importance\u201d \u2013 the loss of which can act as a trigger for an election. So it is both critically important, and not, depending on which argument is being made at the time. Scott Morrison has announced a press conference for 10.15 in the prime minister\u2019s courtyard \u2013 where the serious-serious press conferences are held. Richard Di Natale is supporting the motion. He is lashing out at the government for its \u201cfear campaign\u201d. \u201cI fear that this bill is still not certain to pass. We\u2019ll find that out in the next couple of moments.\u201d Di Natale says the bill is about \u201crestoring some fundamental decency\u201d to Australia\u2019s offshore detention policies. Again, putting aside that you can not be judged to be a refugee and have a serious criminal record, and that most on Manus and Nauru have been found to be refugees, anyone taken to Australia under this legislation will remain in detention. They will not be released into the community, unless the minister says so. The government, unsurprisingly, will not be supporting the motion. Mathias Cormann: What this motion by the Labor party shows to the Australian people, is just how cocky, how reckless, how irresponsible and how weak Bill Shorten is as leader of the Labour party. Bill Shorten is demonstrating to all Australians that he does not have the strength of character or the good judgment required to be prime mnister of Australia. In pursuit of a short-term tactical political advantage, he has decided to compromise our national security and to compromise our border protection arrangements. What Labor is doing here today is trying to ram through this Senate legislation which will weaken our border protection arrangements. So let\u2019s just remind ourselves what the Labor party tried to do in the Senate very incompetently, I might add, back in December. Back in December, the Labor party tried to ram through the Senate legislation, which Bill Shorten yesterday had to admit would have denied the opportunity for the government to turn away criminals from Australia, would have pulled apart at the heart of our border protection arrangements, which is the product people smugglers want to sell. Why did Bill Shorten move amendments yesterday? Because he realised that having failed to ask for security advice from our national security agencies, with that failed gag motion in the Senate in December last year, he tried ... he convinced his Labor senators in this chamber to support legislation which he had to admit in the end would have put our border security arrangements at serious, serious risk. And let me just say that the ALP amendments which were passed by Labor, the Greens, the crossbench and in the Reps yesterday still leaves Australia exposed. Here are some of the people which would be forced to bring to Australia on the say-so of doctors \u2013 people charged with bad conduct but not convicted with offences under foreign law, or convicted but sentenced to less than 12 months in prison. Plenty of countries hand down pretty lenient sentences for things like beating your wife or paedophilia, if they hand down a sentence at all. It is hard to convict people of things like rape in some countries because women\u2019s testimony is worth much less than that of men. A person charged, but not sentenced for say murder or paedophilia on Nauru will not be caught by the exemption. Australian security agencies might be well aware of a person engaging in paedophilia on Nauru but the person need not have been charged or sentenced. The upshot is that as a result of Bill Shorten\u2019s bill \u2013 and it will be on his head \u2013 as a result of Bill Shorten\u2019s bill, rapists, murderers, and paedophiles will still get a free pass into this country. Bill Shorten should be ashamed of himself. He should be ashamed of himself. People involved in criminal organisations \u2013 a person may be a member of a criminal drug-dealing gang for example, people reasonably suspected of people smuggling. All people that would ... forced into Australia courtesy of the legislation that Labor is seeking to ram through this Senate. People whose general past conduct shows they\u2019re not of good character. For example, people who consort with criminals, people whose bad conduct is not criminalised in the relevant home jurisdiction. People who have been convicted of a lot of low-level offences. People who have been fighting guards on Nauru or Manus. People who have touched up nurses. People who have threatened violence. People who have bragged about going into crime and drug-dealing when they get to Australia. These are the people that the Labor party together with the Greens wants to bring into Australia. People who centre incited racial discord on Nauru or Manus. People who pose a risk of doing the following in Australia \u2013 engaging in criminal conduct in Australia or harass, molest or intimidate or stalk another person in Australia, or vilify a segment of the Australian community, or incite discord in the Australian community or a segment of that community or represent a danger to the Australian community or to a segment of that community, whether by way of being liable to become involved in activities that are disruptive to, or in violence threatening harm to that community or segment or in any other way. So the Australian people can now see the cockiness of Bill Shorten. They can see his arrogance, as well as his recklessness, his absolute weakness in standing up for our national interests. Bill Shorten has not learned from the failures of the Rudd Labor government. Kevin Rudd thought that he could be tough and soft at the same time and of course the disastrous results were there for all to see \u2013 1,200 deaths at sea. Labor is at it again. This time they don\u2019t even want to wait for an election. Jacinta Collins on why the Senate should deal with this bill now: We\u2019ve moved this motion this morning because the opposition believes that, given the events in the House of Representatives yesterday, the issue should be given precedence over all other business until it is resolved. And the volatility in this place just highlights that further. The House of Representatives yesterday made amendments to the home affairs legislation amendment, miscellaneous measures bill 2018 that was considered in the Senate on the final sitting day of 2018. These amendments mean that the government must now listen to advice of doctors about whether sick refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island should be evacuated to Australia for medical care. Labor worked with the crossbench members of the other place to secure important amendments to strengthen this bill. Labor has been doing the same thing in the Senate, and has been working closely with senators across the crossbench to make sure these amendments are supported in both houses of parliament. The passing of these amendments in the house yesterday afternoon marked the first time a government has lost a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives in 90 years. This is a significant event and one that surely means the issue deserves priority consideration this morning in the Senate. The hysterical response, the hysterical response from the Liberal government to the events of the House of Representatives, just shows how desperate they are. We have a dangerous and volatile prime minister. The attempts of the government today to prevent this issue from being dealt with as a matter of priority show they are scared, just scared of losing another vote. They are a government that is divided. They are a government in chaos. They are a government, put simply, out of control. The government cannot be surprised that this matter would be top of our priority list in the Senate today. Labor is moving to suspend standing orders in the Senate. We are right into it. The bells are ringing, meaning parliament is about to begin. Yay. Meanwhile, here is where the vote rests. Welcome to your next few months. Peter Dutton also accused Bill Shorten of going against the advice of security agencies. I had an early-morning briefing this morning from the senior leadership group within the Australian Border Force in relation to our planning around what we think may be the outcome of the decision taken by Bill Shorten yesterday. The question for Mr Shorten today is: whether or not his action, is accordance with the advice that he received from the intelligence agencies only a few days ago? Is the advice that he received from the agencies consistent with the position that he took in parliament? Or has he acted against the advice of people, including the director general of Asio, the Australian federal police commissioner, the head of the Department of Home Affairs, the chief of the defence force and others? So Mr Shorten needs to explain where he has gone wrong, because I don\u2019t believe that he\u2019s acted in accordance with that advice. And when you act against the advice of the experts, including the chief of the defence force, the head of Asio and the head of the federal police, I promise you, there\u2019s a price to pay. Now, Mr Shorten has made a decision for political reasons that is going to see people come to our country who have serious allegations against them in relation to potential criminal activities. Let\u2019s be very frank about this: this is a very problematic position that Bill Shorten has put our country in and he needs to explain why he has taken a decision that is inconsistent with the advice from our intelligence, our law enforcement and our operations sovereign borders agencies. Now let\u2019s be clear \u2013 in the briefing, which the government declassified, the advice included this: Although people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in potential illegal immigrant (PII) intent \u2013 not smuggler marketing. PIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention. However, PIIs will probably remain sceptical of smuggler marketing and await proof that such a pathway is viable, or that an actual change of policy has occurred, before committing to ventures. The boat turnback policy remains in place. As for those with \u201cserious allegations against them in relation to potential criminal activities\u201d, the government has refused to give numbers, or examples on that. You can not be found to be a refugee with a serious criminal history and most of the people on Manus and Nauru have been judged, by both the UNHCR and Australian authorities, to be refugees. That is not an easy process. The government has also been medically evacuating people off Nauru and Manus \u2013 but it has just been done through the courts. This has not resulted in an influx of arrivals. The boats didn\u2019t stop coming. They have just been turned back. That is a documented fact. The medical evacuation bill maintains ministerial discretion for those rare cases that involve criminality. The medical review panel will be appointed by the government and will include Border Force officers. The bill only applies to the current cohort on Manus and Nauru. The advice makes it clear that while the people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australia\u2019s policy, those they are marketing to will \u201cprobably remain sceptical ... and await proof\u201d that a pathway to settlement in a western country is actually viable. The government established an agreement with the US to settle some of the families on Nauru there and that did not result in an influx of boats \u2013 and that was an actual policy that settled refugees in a western country. The asylum seekers and refugees sick enough to be transferred to Australia for treatment will remain in detention. They will be sent back once treated. None of the government\u2019s arguments make sense. And just in case you missed the exchanges between Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten yesterday our video team has rounded them up ... Bill Shorten responded to some of those attacks this morning: Last night was not about an election. Last night was about the simple proposition that Australia is strong enough to treat people humanely. And I think there ought to be an election as soon as possible. This is an incompetent divided government. They\u2019re running a protection racket for the banks. It is disgraceful we now have a part-time parliament in Australia. Imagine any of you, and millions of our fellow Australians, ringing up the boss and saying, \u2018I only want to come to work 10 days in the next eight months\u2019 \u2013 you\u2019d get the sack \u2026 They should have an election. My determination is to get on to the issues that are affecting everyday Australians. This government doesn\u2019t want to talk about the fact that everything is going up except their wages. This government\u2019s got no plan to deal with the falling housing approvals released on Monday. This government has no plan to deal with the fact the millions of Australians are dipping into household savings just to make ends meet. They clearly failed the test of energy prices and they have no plan on climate change. This is a government whose run out of governing. Or put another way \u2013 a government who doesn\u2019t want to be in parliament isn\u2019t really in government. If anyone didn\u2019t believe the government thinks it has found its election campaign issue, you might change your mind after reading this from Peter Dutton this morning: I think we found ourselves in a situation where the Australian public has seen Mr Shorten in the full limelight. People suspected that there was a question mark over the judgment of Mr Shorten. In the parliament yesterday, they had their suspicions confirmed. He\u2019s a weak leader. He\u2019s had advice from the heads of the most significant intelligence agencies in our country and he\u2019s gone against that advice. He\u2019s acted against the advice of the agencies in relation to border protection policy. It\u2019s reckless and he\u2019s demonstrated to the Australian public he doesn\u2019t deserve to be the prime minister of this country. Meanwhile all of this is going on in the shadow of the high court, which is being asked to hear a case involving a key part of Australia\u2019s border security policy. As Helen Davidson (who received a shoutout in the parliament yesterday for her ongoing reporting of Hakeem al-Araibi\u2019s plight) reports: A proposed high court challenge to a key immigration case could retrospectively affect every instance of onshore detention in the past 15 years if successful, the federal government has said. On Wednesday the high court will hear a request to challenge Al Kateb v Godwin, a controversial 2004 ruling about a stateless man who no country would take after Australia rejected his asylum claim, and which effectively enabled indefinite detention in Australia. The case is brought on behalf of Said Imasi, another stateless man who has been locked up for nine years with almost no prospect of deportation or release, his lawyers claim. The minister for home affairs and the immigration department will fight Imasi\u2019s case, and in published submissions have forcefully rejected the plaintiff\u2019s arguments and warned of drastic consequences to the current system which allows the indefinite detention of stateless people, asylum seekers and other non-citizens. \u201cIf Al-Kateb is overruled, that would alter \u2013 with retrospective effect \u2013 the understanding of the [Migration] Act upon which unlawful non-citizens have been detained since 2004,\u201d its submission said. Peter Dutton had a lot of praise for Derryn Hinch this morning. Anyone would think there was a piece of legislation hanging in the balance. It seems to me that Derryn Hinch is showing the leadership that Mr Shorten lacks. Mr Hinch has asked for a briefing. He\u2019ll receive that briefing. We\u2019ll provide that very shortly and he wants to be informed by the experts. There\u2019s no sense calling in the experts, including the chief of the defence force, the people who know Operation Sovereign Borders well, the general in charge, the head of the Australian federal police, and then ignoring that advice. And that\u2019s exactly what I think Mr Shorten has done here. Now, Mr Hinch has asked for the advice. We\u2019ll provide him with the advice. But it\u2019s very clear that in in scrambling and dismantling of Operations Sovereign Borders as proposed by Bill Shorten, is going to see, I think, a return of boats. It\u2019s going to see people going back into detention. Australians voted in 2013 and sent Labor a very strong message to say that they didn\u2019t support the open border policy of the Labor party and it seems to me that the Labor party just hasn\u2019t heard that message.\u201d While the rhetoric is gearing up over border security, there is also the banking royal commission kicking along. The government may be forced into recalling parliament to deal with it \u2013 if Labor can get all of the crossbench on board. That makes Bob Katter, who usually abstains or sides with the government on these matters, crucial. He says he is open to looking at recalling parliament, which would bring everyone back here in March, before the only other scheduled sitting in April, when the budget will be handed down (after which, the election will be called). But Katter had some interesting things to say to Sabra Lane on AM this morning. I am having discussions, with George Christensen, and we are formulating some proposals that we want in banking. I personally, am very, very reluctant to let this parliament rise, without some action \u2013 quite frankly, that inquiry was a complete waste of time, except to scare the hell out of the banks. If you read, what we wanted to have looked at, none of it was looked at, none of the recommendations are worth two bob, in my opinion. I mean Apra and Asic are still in place. The policemen, who didn\u2019t police anything, they were lapdogs, not attack dogs or watch dogs [are still in place] ... We are discussing new laws now ... we are discussing new laws at this very moment and I can see no reason why the government can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t look at some things, some simple, but vitally important things at the very heart of the banking problems. Katter says he is \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with the idea of the parliament rising without dealing with it. One of the things that will most influence my decision is to whether the government as a matter of good faith, passes some simple, unequivocal action that needs to be taken. Well, the night\u2019s break has done nothing to calm things down in this place. Peter Dutton has ramped things up to 11. Let\u2019s be very frank about this \u2013 this is a very problematic position that Bill Shorten has put our country in and he needs to explain why he has taken a decision that is inconsistent with the advice from our intelligence, our law enforcement and our operations sovereign borders agencies. The government, despite saying the bill will threaten the nation\u2019s border security, will not go to an election, as Scott Morrison says he doesn\u2019t believe the bill to be of \u201cvital importance\u201d \u2013 which would make it a de facto vote of no confidence and send us to the polls. I\u2019ve already said that these are not matters that go to issues of confidence and I don\u2019t consider them in those terms. The government has never put them in those terms and the independent members who voted on this bill this evening did not consider them in those terms, which is related to the form of words that you\u2019ve just put to me. So instead we are going to spend the next few months arguing border security. But the bill itself is not done yet \u2013 it has to go back to the Senate, where Derryn Hinch is the key vote. He has asked for a security briefing before he makes any decision. As always, we\u2019ll follow along with all the developments. Of which there will be many. You\u2019ve got me, Mike Bowers and the Guardian brains trust on deck for you. Find us in the comments and on Twitter. A kind soul just brought me a coffee, so I am ready to go! Let\u2019s get into it.",

Sent to live in Birmingham by the Home Office immigration authorities, he and his family were granted indefinite leave to remain last year. Now Othman, 54, is keen to get his career back on track. A pilot project in the Black Country is not only giving him valuable work experience in the UK, it could offer a solution to the growing crisis in NHS staffing levels. Latest figures show that there are more than 100,000 vacancies for doctors and nurses. Brexit threatens to exacerbate the shortages: 9% of licensed doctors in the UK come from the European Economic Area, while in the West Midlands alone, EU nationals account for 10% of all nursing staff.

In each case their throats were cut, and four of them had their entrails removed. Kelly, the only one of \u201cthe canonical five\u201d, as Jack the Ripper\u2019s known victims are called, to die in her bed, was completely mutilated.

Hallie Rubenhold fleshes out their stories from the scraps that are available: coroner\u2019s inquests (three of which are missing); \u201ca body of edited, embellished, misheard and re-interpreted newspaper reports\u201d; parish registers; court registers; birth, marriage and death records; rate books and the archives of the London workhouses. For accounts of poverty in London she turns to Francis Place, Henry Mayhew and Charles Booth; she gets facts and figures from Mrs Beaton. With the documentary veracity of a set of Hogarth prints, Rubenhold follows the victims\u2019 doomed footsteps from birth to death. Except that there is no attempt to imagine each woman\u2019s last moments, or describe the state of her body, or further the search for their killer. Instead she asks how it is that these women \u2013 all of them somebody\u2019s daughter, somebody\u2019s sister, somebody\u2019s lover \u2013 ended up alone and destitute on the streets of Whitechapel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a1b8f6321d22ac1d1501ca9821e66449c1aed9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a1b8f6321d22ac1d1501ca9821e66449c1aed9e/0_0_4744_6641/714.jpg\" alt=\"The Police News front page on 17 November 1888.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Police News front page on 17 November 1888.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lordprice Collection/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their lives are grimly similar: born into hardship, they moved from the briefest of childhoods into a cycle of childbearing, alcohol dependence, poverty, emotional despair and homelessness. They died in hell, but they lived in hell, too \u2013 not least, Rubenhold argues, because they were born female: \u201cTheir worth was compromised before they had even attempted to prove it.\u201d</p> <p>Nichols, daughter of a blacksmith, spent her first years in Dawes Court, where Dickens had imagined Fagin living with his pickpockets in <em>Oliver Twist</em>. Her break came when she and her husband, William, qualified for accommodation in one of the newly built Peabody Buildings on Stamford Street in Lambeth. This allowed them, for the first time, an inside lavatory. But after four years of fighting \u2013 William was carrying on with the widow next door \u2013 Polly left her husband and children and entered the workhouse. There were, Rubenhold shows, few other options available to her. Eight years later, the inquest into Nichols\u2019s death shaped itself as an investigation into her moral character: \u201cDo you consider that she was very cleanly in her habits?\u201d the coroner asked her former roommate. In other words, was Nichols a prostitute and thus deserving of her fate? There is no evidence, Rubenhold argues, that Nichols or Chapman or Eddowes ever worked as prostitutes; the police conviction that the killer targeted women of \u201cbad character\u201d perverted the inquiry. The Ripper\u2019s victims, she suggests, were targeted not because they were soliciting sex but because they were drunk and homeless and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 asleep. The killer preyed on women whom nobody cared about and who wouldn\u2019t be missed.</p> <p>Chapman\u2019s story is one of addiction: she might have become middle class had she not become an alcoholic. The daughter of a soldier, Annie grew up in lodgings near the Knightsbridge barracks where six of her siblings died of scarlet fever in three weeks. Her father later cut his throat. She married a gentleman\u2019s coachman, moved to a cottage on his employer\u2019s Berkshire estate, and kept photographs of her children on the mantelpiece. She would stay sober for months and then be found drunk and disorderly in the street: eventually she left the cottage before her family were thrown out. There were, once again, few other options available to her. \u201cWhat her murderer claimed on that night,\u201d Rubenhold writes, \u201cwas simply all that remained of what the drink had left behind.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>They died in hell, but they lived in hell, too \u2013 not least because they were female: their worth was compromised before they even tried to\u00a0prove it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Elisabeth Gustafsdotter, later known as Elizabeth Stride, was a Swedish farmer\u2019s daughter from Torslander. She went into domestic service \u2013 the \u201cgolden ticket\u201d for a working-class girl \u2013 but contracted syphilis. She came to Britain where she found and soon afterwards left (probably due to a scandal) a good position in a house at Hyde Park; she married, and soon afterwards left, a carpenter called John Stride; she set up a coffeehouse that failed. For her final years she supported herself by posing as a disaster victim, which in many ways she was.</p> <p>Eddowes \u2013 who died on the same night as Stride \u2013 ran away from Wolverhampton to London where she hooked up with an Irish rover called Thomas Conway. Together, she and Conway, sporting matching tattoos, tramped the country as chapbook sellers: being literate, Catherine was able to write down Conway\u2019s ballads. Five hundred members of her family turned out for her funeral.</p> <p>No one, after the death of Kelly, claimed to have known her, but it was \u201ceasy enough\u201d, Rubenhold shows, for a woman to reinvent herself in the 19th century. Mary Jane probably came from a good family and fell into the wrong hands; whatever happened to her, she left her home in Cardiff (although she claims to have been Irish) and ended up in a west London brothel. To reconstruct her time in the whorehouse \u2013 what she wore, what she earned, where she went \u2013 Rubenhold turns to My Secret Life, the memoir of the pseudonymous \u2018Walter\u2019. A series of setbacks brought her from the West End to the East End where, at 25, she was the youngest and the last of the Ripper\u2019s victims.</p> <p><em>The Five</em> is not simply about the women who were murdered in Whitechapel in the autumn of 1888: it is <em>for</em> them. This is a powerful and a shaming book, but most shameful of all is that it took 130 years to write.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper is published by Doubleday (\u00a316.99).

There were, once again, few other options available to her. \u201cWhat her murderer claimed on that night,\u201d Rubenhold writes, \u201cwas simply all that remained of what the drink had left behind.\u201d Elisabeth Gustafsdotter, later known as Elizabeth Stride, was a Swedish farmer\u2019s daughter from Torslander. She went into domestic service \u2013 the \u201cgolden ticket\u201d for a working-class girl \u2013 but contracted syphilis. She came to Britain where she found and soon afterwards left (probably due to a scandal) a good position in a house at Hyde Park; she married, and soon afterwards left, a carpenter called John Stride; she set up a coffeehouse that failed. For her final years she supported herself by posing as a disaster victim, which in many ways she was. Eddowes \u2013 who died on the same night as Stride \u2013 ran away from Wolverhampton to London where she hooked up with an Irish rover called Thomas Conway. Together, she and Conway, sporting matching tattoos, tramped the country as chapbook sellers: being literate, Catherine was able to write down Conway\u2019s ballads. Five hundred members of her family turned out for her funeral. No one, after the death of Kelly, claimed to have known her, but it was \u201ceasy enough\u201d, Rubenhold shows, for a woman to reinvent herself in the 19th century. Mary Jane probably came from a good family and fell into the wrong hands; whatever happened to her, she left her home in Cardiff (although she claims to have been Irish) and ended up in a west London brothel. To reconstruct her time in the whorehouse \u2013 what she wore, what she earned, where she went \u2013 Rubenhold turns to My Secret Life, the memoir of the pseudonymous \u2018Walter\u2019. A series of setbacks brought her from the West End to the East End where, at 25, she was the youngest and the last of the Ripper\u2019s victims. The Five is not simply about the women who were murdered in Whitechapel in the autumn of 1888: it is for them. This is a powerful and a shaming book, but most shameful of all is that it took 130 years to write. \u2022 The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper is published by Doubleday (\u00a316.99).

      "body": "<h2>The Bros fan</h2> <p><strong>Amanda Bradshaw, 46, academic writer from Lowton, Lancashire</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve been a Bros fan for more than 30 years. I\u2019ve got every single release, including the original 1987 12in of I Owe You Nothing, which wasn\u2019t a hit \u2013 I found it in the basement of Debenhams in Wigan a couple of years later and I cried. Every time they were on TV, I\u2019d be ready with the remote control so I could record them, and I\u2019d watch each appearance on a loop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"04292d20b7591176837beaf6b915004ddbf52572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04292d20b7591176837beaf6b915004ddbf52572/136_0_2208_2759/800.jpg\" alt=\"Amanda Bradshaw with Matt Goss \u2026 \u2018He spent so much time with everybody.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amanda Bradshaw with Matt Goss \u2026 \u2018He spent so much time with everybody.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Bradshaw</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five years ago, I found out that Matt Goss was coming to do a signing at HMV in Manchester. For the week before, I was transported back to being a 15-year-old. I was so excited that I was finally going to meet him, I decided I was going to get his autograph and have it tattooed on. It would be on the back of my leg, so no one would see it, but I would know it was there. It would be a permanent memory. It was also poignant for me; when I first adored Bros, when I was 14 or 15, my mum and dad had just got divorced, and it sounds like a cliche, but music \u2013 not just Bros \u2013 got me through a really difficult time. Having the tattoo was like marking the occasion.</p> <p>Matt was very gracious at that signing; he spent so much time with everybody. He was very insistent about where he should put his autograph, and then he gave me advice about how to have it tattooed, none of which I remembered. When I got home, I showed it to my partner, Gavin, and told him about my plan. He thought it was hilarious. I got the tattoo done two days later. In the meantime, I covered the autograph with sticky tape to make sure it didn\u2019t come off in the shower. When I peeled off the tape \u2013 I don\u2019t know anything about the physics of ink and sticky tape \u2013 I was just thinking, \u201cPlease don\u2019t let the tape peel the ink off.\u201d I went into a tattooist on the way home from work and it took 20 minutes and cost \u00a360. I\u2019ve never regretted it.</p> <h2>The Gloria Estefan fan</h2> <p><strong>Matt Hemley, 39, theatre journalist from London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02f5b5187631d95a9be9bb65b4c44141d02e4882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02f5b5187631d95a9be9bb65b4c44141d02e4882/0_252_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hemley with Gloria Estefan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hemley with Gloria Estefan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Hemley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My partner jokes that I have Gloria Estefan locked in a cupboard. Thankfully, I have the self-awareness to know that my flat shouldn\u2019t be dominated by her, so most of my collection is in boxes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got her music on every format \u2013 CDs, tapes and LPs, although when I was a teenager the LPs just decorated my walls because I didn\u2019t have a record player. My whole room was taken up with her. And her label was good at sending stuff if you wrote in \u2013 a courier once arrived with billboard posters and a lifesize standup cutout figure of her. That came to university with me, and my housemates would decorate her every Halloween. Nowadays, I just keep a few signed photos out in frames, and if I\u2019m home alone I\u2019ll watch one of her concerts on DVD. I never get bored with singing along.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b25045349ba1ffa835bab2735dc700d7b9a40a83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25045349ba1ffa835bab2735dc700d7b9a40a83/91_56_2788_3486/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Most of my collection is in boxes.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Most of my collection is in boxes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Hemley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It began when I was 11. My dad had heard her song Go Away, and he wanted it for his birthday. I bought it for him, but I loved it and I pinched it, and I\u2019ve loved her ever since. I loved the vibrancy of her music, and its uplifting nature. I was a gay teen and there was something very comforting about it.</p> <p>Twelve years ago, I was working for Broadcast magazine, covering radio. I found out that she was going in to LBC, so I contacted the PR, asking if I could come in and say hello, and they arranged for me to sit in on an hour-long interview. I gave her a Christmas pudding because I thought that was something she would never have had in Cuba, where she\u2019s from. Last summer, I was invited to dinner in London with her, and she told everyone about the Christmas pudding. I was amazed she remembered.</p> <p>Then, when Twitter launched, I started following her, and after a few tweets she realised who I was and followed me back. Every year on my birthday she sends me a direct message, and they have become more and more personal. But I think my favourite memory is from 2015, when I went to the opening night of the musical about her life, On Your Feet!, on Broadway. I knew she would be there, so at the interval, I looked to see what room she would go into. When the second act began, she didn\u2019t come out immediately, so I made my way over. When she came out, I approached her. Her bodyguards came forward, but she said: \u201cI know this person. How are you, Matt?\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so proud.</p> <h2>The Bon Jovi fan</h2> <p><strong>Melissa Holmes, 42, web developer from Derbyshire</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7293c8c72c22635a127e53e663393110c013662\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7293c8c72c22635a127e53e663393110c013662/0_126_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa Holmes (left) waiting for her big Bon Jovi moment in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melissa Holmes (left) waiting for her big Bon Jovi moment in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melissa Holmes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m hearing-impaired, but that doesn\u2019t stop me enjoying Bon Jovi\u2019s music and melody. I have listened to the CDs hundreds of times. Live shows can be a little frustrating, however because, although I can follow along when they play, when Jon Bon Jovi tells stories or gives little speeches those can be difficult, if not impossible, to understand. I was at Giants Stadium in New Jersey and Jon gave some kind of thank-you speech near the end of the show, and whatever he said had some fans in tears. Everyone was talking about it afterwards, but I\u2019d hardly made out a word.</p> <p>If you include solo shows by Jon and Richie Sambora [the band\u2019s former guitarist], as well as TV appearances where they have played live, I have seen them 83 times in seven countries. The main thing is the atmosphere, but also I kept going back because I really wanted to hear two specific songs live: Hey God and Dry County. They didn\u2019t play either at my first show in 1995, and I was gutted. So, to avoid missing out again, I did every show that I could: I did all three England shows in 1996, and then I did every ticketed show in the UK and Ireland that Jon, Richie or the band did from 1997 until 2009, plus a few shows elsewhere in Europe and in the US. It took me until show 52 in Dublin in 2006 before I finally heard Dry County live, and, while I did get to hear Hey God in 1996, they didn\u2019t play it again at a show I was at until London 2011, which I think was show 80 for me.</p> <p>I\u2019ve arrived at venues anything up to 32 hours beforehand to try to get front row; sometimes with sleeping bags and tents, sometimes not \u2013 we started with tents in 2006, I think. Before then, everyone just sat out. I\u2019ve been threatened (along with other fans) with having the cops called on me in the US when we wanted to camp out before a show. Luckily, it got resolved, and we camped \u2013 and we got front row.</p> <h2>The Monkees fan</h2> <p><strong>Iain Lee, 45, broadcaster from London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a6c793977e0df60672a218a3c0088f654c01bed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a6c793977e0df60672a218a3c0088f654c01bed/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Lee, Monkees superfan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Lee, Monkees superfan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Percival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seeing the Monkees live for the first time in 1989 was amazing. It was spiritual. It was joy and ecstasy unlike anything else. For a 15-year-old, it was a little bit sexy. Despite the mullet he had at the time, Davy Jones was a sexually attractive man, and, I\u2019m going to say it, I fancied him.</p> <p>It had all started with the TV show \u2013 9.25 in the morning during the school holidays. Some people have their Bowie moment \u2013 when they saw him on Top of the Pops doing Starman \u2013 but mine was seeing the Monkees mime Valleri. Shit! This is it, man!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3514fa291b81b27b39aa0fe0e52ecd272e2ddcb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3514fa291b81b27b39aa0fe0e52ecd272e2ddcb7/358_0_3246_4056/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m going to say it, I fancied Davy Jones.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m going to say it, I fancied Davy Jones.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Messer/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I went to Our Price in the Queensmere shopping centre in Slough to buy a greatest hits album, but they had two: one double, and one with a couple of new songs. I didn\u2019t have enough money for both of them, so I went to the fountain they\u2019d just installed outside the shopping centre \u2013 which was normally filled with bubbles from people putting washing-up liquid in \u2013 and I stole the extra \u00a32.50 I needed. That was the first sign of obsession: stealing to feed my habit.</p> <p>Since then, I\u2019ve probably spent \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3250,000 on the Monkees \u2013 on buying things, on travelling to see them, and on setting up 7a Records to release really obscure Monkees records and solo material. The label is a very expensive hobby, but we do it to make the records I want in my collection that don\u2019t actually exist. And the spending started early: at 14, I was convincing my mum to write out international money orders for \u00a3100, which I\u2019d send to the US, and then six months later I\u2019d get some really shitty-quality live bootlegs back.</p> <p>The single most expensive thing I\u2019ve got is a 1967 Monkees Gretsch guitar, which cost about \u00a33,500. I wouldn\u2019t say that ended my marriage, but it didn\u2019t go down particularly well with my wife.</p> <h2>The U2 fan</h2> <p><strong>Beth Nabi, 40, university professor from Jacksonville, Florida</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"071162089d88af761478067e6f72fae34b17046c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071162089d88af761478067e6f72fae34b17046c/0_17_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Nabi with The Edge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Nabi with The Edge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Nabi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve seen U2 73 times in 10 countries since the first time in 1997, and even found an opportunity to merge my love of the band with my academic research.</p> <p>I teach graphic design and digital media, and I had been studying U2\u2019s visual identity as a fan. I went to Vancouver for the start of their 2015 tour \u2013 everyone goes out early to hang around the rehearsals, so there\u2019s this great community \u2013 and I noticed lots of the people had U2 tattoos, and it hit me: I wanted to capture this. I wanted to know what marks they put on their bodies and why. From then on, I documented the fans in line. I would interview them and document them, asking: \u201cWhat does this band mean to you that you have them on your body?\u201d And now the U2 Tattoo Project has had an exhibit in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And it has been on the U2 official site, which was mind-blowing. As a fan: holy shit! Bono may know my name! For any fan to have their idol aware of them is sublime.</p> <p>In 2017, when they toured playing The Joshua Tree in full, I wanted to work the U2 Tattoo Project in Europe, and see what the fan culture was like in those cities. I try not to think about how much that cost \u2013 the first rule of fandom is don\u2019t look at your bank account. I went to every city for every show, but the night of the second Rome show, I had been talking to fans all day, I was exhausted from the heat, and I was overwhelmed and I needed a break. I sold my ticket to another fan and I walked around the city. I went to the Colosseum instead of going to see U2. It was a huge moment: I have a ticket and I\u2019m walking away. It was big step in my development: I came, I saw, I conquered.</p> <h2>The Bruce Springsteen fan</h2> <p><strong>Sindy Grewal, 54, executive coach from London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd7bb891df6990e14fa4edec4510859ad60abc53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7bb891df6990e14fa4edec4510859ad60abc53/0_649_2760_1655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sindy Grewal at Springsteen\u2019s Broadway show in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sindy Grewal at Springsteen\u2019s Broadway show in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sindy Grewal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I grew up in a traditional Asian family, and teenage girls weren\u2019t really allowed to go to concerts. I wanted to see Springsteen on the River tour in 1981, but none of my siblings would go with me, so I couldn\u2019t go. However, my mother bought me a ticket to see him at Wembley on the Born in the USA tour in 1985. I was overwhelmed, and I cried when he did Independence Day. I\u2019ve now seen him well over 50 times, although that isn\u2019t much compared with lots of superfans, but my friends know I\u2019ll cry if he does Thunder Road, especially the acoustic version.</p> <p>For me, the important things are the live shows. I\u2019m not a collector. I don\u2019t have every edition of everything that has come out. I don\u2019t have 15 versions of the same album. I\u2019ve never really got that. Instead, I travel to see him because I feel that he\u2019s different in different places: there\u2019s something about the way he relates to each different audience. Seeing him at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, his home state, with his people, had a real sense of community. When I saw him in Australia, because it was such a long time since he\u2019d played there, there was the sheer enthusiasm of everyone. Pittsburgh was unusual because so many of his songs are about places like that \u2013 the Johnstown Company, which is mentioned in The River, is in Pittsburgh. I have to keep going to see him because I keep thinking he may not be playing much longer: I may never see him again, if he decides to stop touring.</p> <h2><strong>The</strong> <strong>Take That fan</strong></h2> <p><strong>Janie Burden, 34, music promoter from Somerset</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7179e8e30bf341b9b868cc091dc1ce35a2cfa6c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7179e8e30bf341b9b868cc091dc1ce35a2cfa6c7/0_143_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Janie Burden with Robbie Williams.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janie Burden with Robbie Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Janie Burden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I suppose my strangest piece of memorabilia is a piece of carpet from HMV in Manchester. It was in 2006, when Take That did a signing there. A group of us camped outside the night before \u2013 it was so cold; in hindsight we should have taken a Thermos and some sandwiches \u2013 because it was a big adventure. After the signing, some staff came out with bits of carpet, and they said it was the carpet Take That had been standing on. No clue about which member had stood on it, or even if really the soles of their shoes had just brushed it. It lived in the boot of my car for a while because I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it. Every time people saw if, they would ask why I had a piece of carpet in the boot, and I\u2019d tell them someone from Take That might have stood on it. They\u2019d look at me and say: \u201cOh. OK.\u201d</p> <p>I first got into them through my older sister \u2013 I was six and she was 18 \u2013 but it was when they reformed in 2005 that I became a superfan. They were my first band, they were back and I was the right age. I started camping out because I wanted to meet all of them.</p> <p>The most memorable meeting was when Robbie Williams rejoined in 2010 and they did a Radio 1 live lounge appearance. In the early 90s, they had brought out a set of Take That dolls \u2013 you can see who they\u2019re meant to be, but they don\u2019t really look like the members \u2013 and I got a set, although they sold out really quickly. My sister told me: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare ever take them out of their boxes.\u201d So at Radio 1, it wasn\u2019t just that I got to see all five of them together again, but I also got Robbie to sign my doll. And now I\u2019ve got all five of them in their boxes, signed.</p>",

Every time they were on TV, I\u2019d be ready with the remote control so I could record them, and I\u2019d watch each appearance on a loop. Five years ago, I found out that Matt Goss was coming to do a signing at HMV in Manchester. For the week before, I was transported back to being a 15-year-old. I was so excited that I was finally going to meet him, I decided I was going to get his autograph and have it tattooed on. It would be on the back of my leg, so no one would see it, but I would know it was there. It would be a permanent memory. It was also poignant for me; when I first adored Bros, when I was 14 or 15, my mum and dad had just got divorced, and it sounds like a cliche, but music \u2013 not just Bros \u2013 got me through a really difficult time. Having the tattoo was like marking the occasion. Matt was very gracious at that signing; he spent so much time with everybody. He was very insistent about where he should put his autograph, and then he gave me advice about how to have it tattooed, none of which I remembered. When I got home, I showed it to my partner, Gavin, and told him about my plan. He thought it was hilarious. I got the tattoo done two days later. In the meantime, I covered the autograph with sticky tape to make sure it didn\u2019t come off in the shower. When I peeled off the tape \u2013 I don\u2019t know anything about the physics of ink and sticky tape \u2013 I was just thinking, \u201cPlease don\u2019t let the tape peel the ink off.\u201d I went into a tattooist on the way home from work and it took 20 minutes and cost \u00a360. I\u2019ve never regretted it. The Gloria Estefan fan Matt Hemley, 39, theatre journalist from London My partner jokes that I have Gloria Estefan locked in a cupboard. Thankfully, I have the self-awareness to know that my flat shouldn\u2019t be dominated by her, so most of my collection is in boxes. I\u2019ve got her music on every format \u2013 CDs, tapes and LPs, although when I was a teenager the LPs just decorated my walls because I didn\u2019t have a record player. My whole room was taken up with her. And her label was good at sending stuff if you wrote in \u2013 a courier once arrived with billboard posters and a lifesize standup cutout figure of her. That came to university with me, and my housemates would decorate her every Halloween. Nowadays, I just keep a few signed photos out in frames, and if I\u2019m home alone I\u2019ll watch one of her concerts on DVD. I never get bored with singing along. It began when I was 11. My dad had heard her song Go Away, and he wanted it for his birthday. I bought it for him, but I loved it and I pinched it, and I\u2019ve loved her ever since. I loved the vibrancy of her music, and its uplifting nature. I was a gay teen and there was something very comforting about it. Twelve years ago, I was working for Broadcast magazine, covering radio. I found out that she was going in to LBC, so I contacted the PR, asking if I could come in and say hello, and they arranged for me to sit in on an hour-long interview. I gave her a Christmas pudding because I thought that was something she would never have had in Cuba, where she\u2019s from. Last summer, I was invited to dinner in London with her, and she told everyone about the Christmas pudding. I was amazed she remembered. Then, when Twitter launched, I started following her, and after a few tweets she realised who I was and followed me back. Every year on my birthday she sends me a direct message, and they have become more and more personal. But I think my favourite memory is from 2015, when I went to the opening night of the musical about her life, On Your Feet!, on Broadway. I knew she would be there, so at the interval, I looked to see what room she would go into. When the second act began, she didn\u2019t come out immediately, so I made my way over. When she came out, I approached her. Her bodyguards came forward, but she said: \u201cI know this person. How are you, Matt?\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so proud. The Bon Jovi fan Melissa Holmes, 42, web developer from Derbyshire I\u2019m hearing-impaired, but that doesn\u2019t stop me enjoying Bon Jovi\u2019s music and melody. I have listened to the CDs hundreds of times. Live shows can be a little frustrating, however because, although I can follow along when they play, when Jon Bon Jovi tells stories or gives little speeches those can be difficult, if not impossible, to understand. I was at Giants Stadium in New Jersey and Jon gave some kind of thank-you speech near the end of the show, and whatever he said had some fans in tears. Everyone was talking about it afterwards, but I\u2019d hardly made out a word. If you include solo shows by Jon and Richie Sambora [the band\u2019s former guitarist], as well as TV appearances where they have played live, I have seen them 83 times in seven countries. The main thing is the atmosphere, but also I kept going back because I really wanted to hear two specific songs live: Hey God and Dry County. They didn\u2019t play either at my first show in 1995, and I was gutted. So, to avoid missing out again, I did every show that I could: I did all three England shows in 1996, and then I did every ticketed show in the UK and Ireland that Jon, Richie or the band did from 1997 until 2009, plus a few shows elsewhere in Europe and in the US. It took me until show 52 in Dublin in 2006 before I finally heard Dry County live, and, while I did get to hear Hey God in 1996, they didn\u2019t play it again at a show I was at until London 2011, which I think was show 80 for me. I\u2019ve arrived at venues anything up to 32 hours beforehand to try to get front row; sometimes with sleeping bags and tents, sometimes not \u2013 we started with tents in 2006, I think. Before then, everyone just sat out. I\u2019ve been threatened (along with other fans) with having the cops called on me in the US when we wanted to camp out before a show. Luckily, it got resolved, and we camped \u2013 and we got front row. The Monkees fan Iain Lee, 45, broadcaster from London Seeing the Monkees live for the first time in 1989 was amazing. It was spiritual. It was joy and ecstasy unlike anything else. For a 15-year-old, it was a little bit sexy. Despite the mullet he had at the time, Davy Jones was a sexually attractive man, and, I\u2019m going to say it, I fancied him. It had all started with the TV show \u2013 9.25 in the morning during the school holidays. Some people have their Bowie moment \u2013 when they saw him on Top of the Pops doing Starman \u2013 but mine was seeing the Monkees mime Valleri. Shit! This is it, man! I went to Our Price in the Queensmere shopping centre in Slough to buy a greatest hits album, but they had two: one double, and one with a couple of new songs. I didn\u2019t have enough money for both of them, so I went to the fountain they\u2019d just installed outside the shopping centre \u2013 which was normally filled with bubbles from people putting washing-up liquid in \u2013 and I stole the extra \u00a32.50 I needed. That was the first sign of obsession: stealing to feed my habit. Since then, I\u2019ve probably spent \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3250,000 on the Monkees \u2013 on buying things, on travelling to see them, and on setting up 7a Records to release really obscure Monkees records and solo material. The label is a very expensive hobby, but we do it to make the records I want in my collection that don\u2019t actually exist. And the spending started early: at 14, I was convincing my mum to write out international money orders for \u00a3100, which I\u2019d send to the US, and then six months later I\u2019d get some really shitty-quality live bootlegs back. The single most expensive thing I\u2019ve got is a 1967 Monkees Gretsch guitar, which cost about \u00a33,500. I wouldn\u2019t say that ended my marriage, but it didn\u2019t go down particularly well with my wife. The U2 fan Beth Nabi, 40, university professor from Jacksonville, Florida I\u2019ve seen U2 73 times in 10 countries since the first time in 1997, and even found an opportunity to merge my love of the band with my academic research. I teach graphic design and digital media, and I had been studying U2\u2019s visual identity as a fan. I went to Vancouver for the start of their 2015 tour \u2013 everyone goes out early to hang around the rehearsals, so there\u2019s this great community \u2013 and I noticed lots of the people had U2 tattoos, and it hit me: I wanted to capture this. I wanted to know what marks they put on their bodies and why. From then on, I documented the fans in line. I would interview them and document them, asking: \u201cWhat does this band mean to you that you have them on your body?\u201d And now the U2 Tattoo Project has had an exhibit in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And it has been on the U2 official site, which was mind-blowing. As a fan: holy shit! Bono may know my name! For any fan to have their idol aware of them is sublime. In 2017, when they toured playing The Joshua Tree in full, I wanted to work the U2 Tattoo Project in Europe, and see what the fan culture was like in those cities. I try not to think about how much that cost \u2013 the first rule of fandom is don\u2019t look at your bank account. I went to every city for every show, but the night of the second Rome show, I had been talking to fans all day, I was exhausted from the heat, and I was overwhelmed and I needed a break. I sold my ticket to another fan and I walked around the city. I went to the Colosseum instead of going to see U2. It was a huge moment: I have a ticket and I\u2019m walking away. It was big step in my development: I came, I saw, I conquered. The Bruce Springsteen fan Sindy Grewal, 54, executive coach from London I grew up in a traditional Asian family, and teenage girls weren\u2019t really allowed to go to concerts. I wanted to see Springsteen on the River tour in 1981, but none of my siblings would go with me, so I couldn\u2019t go. However, my mother bought me a ticket to see him at Wembley on the Born in the USA tour in 1985. I was overwhelmed, and I cried when he did Independence Day. I\u2019ve now seen him well over 50 times, although that isn\u2019t much compared with lots of superfans, but my friends know I\u2019ll cry if he does Thunder Road, especially the acoustic version. For me, the important things are the live shows. I\u2019m not a collector. I don\u2019t have every edition of everything that has come out. I don\u2019t have 15 versions of the same album. I\u2019ve never really got that. Instead, I travel to see him because I feel that he\u2019s different in different places: there\u2019s something about the way he relates to each different audience. Seeing him at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, his home state, with his people, had a real sense of community. When I saw him in Australia, because it was such a long time since he\u2019d played there, there was the sheer enthusiasm of everyone. Pittsburgh was unusual because so many of his songs are about places like that \u2013 the Johnstown Company, which is mentioned in The River, is in Pittsburgh. I have to keep going to see him because I keep thinking he may not be playing much longer: I may never see him again, if he decides to stop touring. The Take That fan Janie Burden, 34, music promoter from Somerset I suppose my strangest piece of memorabilia is a piece of carpet from HMV in Manchester. It was in 2006, when Take That did a signing there. A group of us camped outside the night before \u2013 it was so cold; in hindsight we should have taken a Thermos and some sandwiches \u2013 because it was a big adventure. After the signing, some staff came out with bits of carpet, and they said it was the carpet Take That had been standing on. No clue about which member had stood on it, or even if really the soles of their shoes had just brushed it. It lived in the boot of my car for a while because I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it. Every time people saw if, they would ask why I had a piece of carpet in the boot, and I\u2019d tell them someone from Take That might have stood on it. They\u2019d look at me and say: \u201cOh. OK.\u201d I first got into them through my older sister \u2013 I was six and she was 18 \u2013 but it was when they reformed in 2005 that I became a superfan. They were my first band, they were back and I was the right age. I started camping out because I wanted to meet all of them. The most memorable meeting was when Robbie Williams rejoined in 2010 and they did a Radio 1 live lounge appearance. In the early 90s, they had brought out a set of Take That dolls \u2013 you can see who they\u2019re meant to be, but they don\u2019t really look like the members \u2013 and I got a set, although they sold out really quickly. My sister told me: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare ever take them out of their boxes.\u201d So at Radio 1, it wasn\u2019t just that I got to see all five of them together again, but I also got Robbie to sign my doll. And now I\u2019ve got all five of them in their boxes, signed.",

Better known as Prince Leonard, Casley died early on Wednesday after being admitted to an Australian hospital with a lung infection over the weekend. The prince, who abdicated the throne to his son in 2017, had lived with emphysema for 20 years. His youngest son, Prince Graeme, the sovereign of the micronation, told Perth Now his father was \u201ca man of small stature but a man of big shoes\u201d. \u201cHe was so sharp of mind right to the last 24 hours, it was incredible,\u201d Graeme said. \u201cHis emphysema was manageable but he was susceptible to bugs and he was so frail. \u201cThis time he didn\u2019t have any resistance to fight the infection and he slowly went downhill. \u201cHe\u2019s a man that lived three lifetimes, and he did very well to get to 93.\u201d Casley founded the principality of Hutt River \u2013 about 500km north of Perth \u2013 in 1970 after a dispute with the state government over wheat production quotas.

After his wheat quotas were cut, Casley lodged a $52m compensation case against the Western Australian government and has claimed he made the decision to secede from Australia when the government reacted by seeking to compulsory acquire his land. Casley had been locked in a series of legal battles with the Australian Taxation Office for a number of years, and in 2017 was ordered to pay $3m in income tax.

      "bodyText": "A stranger\u2019s debt from a mail order company has been allocated to my credit report and is affecting my credit rating. It is linked to a previous address, and the missed payments were made after I moved out. The issue arose when my bank reduced my credit card limit saying my credit report with Callcredit gave it cause for concern. The records are clearly erroneous as they contain different spellings of my name and a different date of birth. I complained to Noddle, Callcredit\u2019s credit report checker, which told me the mail order company would not remove the file reference. I then complained to Callcredit which accepted its data was incorrect and promised to correct my file. I then received a letter at my current address from a debt collection agency. I can only assume Callcredit gave it my details. How can business and credit agencies be so lax in their use of data and effectively cause harassment and financial loss to a person who has done nothing wrong? KS, Manchester Most of us are only dimly aware of credit reference agencies, but these multimillion-pound companies document and rate our spending habits in exhaustive detail.

      "body": "<p>South Sudan\u2019s cash-strapped government is spending almost half of the money ear-marked for the country\u2019s fragile peace deal on funding renovations for politicians\u2019 homes.</p> <p>Two sets of internal government documents seen by the Guardian show that in December and January more than $135,000 (\u00a3105,000) was authorised by the National Pre-Transitional Committee (NPTC) \u2013 the group charged with overseeing the initial phases of the peace deal and managing money allocation \u2013 to renovate two politicians\u2019 houses. They include the home of first vice president Taban Deng Gai, and that of the late Dr John Garang. His widow, Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior, is expected to be one of the country\u2019s five vice presidents under the new agreement.</p> <p>The war-torn nation has been struggling to pay for the bulk of the peace deal\u2019s implementation, citing a lack of funds and calling on the international community for help.</p> <p>The government had originally pledged more than $1.4m to the peace fund but only deposited $400,000 into the account, Henry Odwar \u2013 deputy chairman for the opposition and deputy for the NPTC \u2013 told the Guardian. He has called into question the allocation of renovation funds and said he tried to stop the transaction but was outvoted by government members on the peace committee. \u201cHow will the international community look at us?\u201d he said. </p> <p>Martin Elia Lomuro, South Sudan\u2019s minister of cabinet affairs, insisted that the money is being used as stipulated in the peace agreement. \u201cThere\u2019s money to spend on accommodation for the people coming to run the country,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At least one advocacy group is calling the choice of funding priorities troubling.</p> <p>\u201cThe parties\u2019 signatory to the peace deal say the implementation is slow due to a lack of funds but surprisingly they are allocating money to renovate public officials\u2019 houses.

      "bodyText": "South Sudan\u2019s cash-strapped government is spending almost half of the money ear-marked for the country\u2019s fragile peace deal on funding renovations for politicians\u2019 homes. Two sets of internal government documents seen by the Guardian show that in December and January more than $135,000 (\u00a3105,000) was authorised by the National Pre-Transitional Committee (NPTC) \u2013 the group charged with overseeing the initial phases of the peace deal and managing money allocation \u2013 to renovate two politicians\u2019 houses. They include the home of first vice president Taban Deng Gai, and that of the late Dr John Garang. His widow, Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior, is expected to be one of the country\u2019s five vice presidents under the new agreement. The war-torn nation has been struggling to pay for the bulk of the peace deal\u2019s implementation, citing a lack of funds and calling on the international community for help. The government had originally pledged more than $1.4m to the peace fund but only deposited $400,000 into the account, Henry Odwar \u2013 deputy chairman for the opposition and deputy for the NPTC \u2013 told the Guardian. He has called into question the allocation of renovation funds and said he tried to stop the transaction but was outvoted by government members on the peace committee. \u201cHow will the international community look at us?\u201d he said. Martin Elia Lomuro, South Sudan\u2019s minister of cabinet affairs, insisted that the money is being used as stipulated in the peace agreement. \u201cThere\u2019s money to spend on accommodation for the people coming to run the country,\u201d he said. At least one advocacy group is calling the choice of funding priorities troubling. \u201cThe parties\u2019 signatory to the peace deal say the implementation is slow due to a lack of funds but surprisingly they are allocating money to renovate public officials\u2019 houses. So it\u2019s disturbing when they then challenge donors for lack of interest [in funding] the peace deal,\u201d said Edmund Yakani, executive director for Community Empowerment for Progress Organisation, a local civil society group. The new deal, which has been riddled with delays, missed deadlines and questionable political will, has been met with reluctance by the international community. The UK, US and Norway, the troika group that helped usher South Sudan to independence in 2011, didn\u2019t sign the agreement, citing concerns about the \u201cparties\u2019 level of commitment\u201d. South Sudan\u2019s five-year civil war caused the death of close to 400,000 people and displaced millions. More than half the population, seven million people, rely on humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. The government has a history of big spending on its officials. In July it gave $16m in car loans to 400 MPs, according to government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. At the same time, civil servants across the country hadn\u2019t been paid in months.

      "bodyText": "Labor has pushed to refer Liberal MP Tim Wilson to the privileges committee over politicisation of a parliamentary inquiry into the opposition\u2019s franking credit policy. On Wednesday Tony Burke, the manager of opposition business, asked the speaker, Tony Smith, to give precedence to a motion to refer Wilson, questioning whether he had harmed the \u201cdignity of the parliament and its committee system\u201d. Tim Wilson authorised a partisan website stoptheretirementtax.com part-funded by Geoff Wilson, his first-cousin, once-removed, which garners submissions opposed to Labor\u2019s policy and signs submitters up to a Wilson Asset Management petition. In September Geoff Wilson boasted to investors that he had asked Tim Wilson, who chairs the House economics committee, to schedule inquiry hearings alongside Wilson Asset Management roadshow events to help investors protest against Labor\u2019s policy. Burke questioned whether Tim Wilson had \u201corganised the committee\u2019s hearing schedule and locations at the behest of a person with a vested interest in the inquiry\u201d. \u201cThis also raises the question as to whether the actions of the chair amount to an improper interference with the free exercise of his own committee\u2019s authority or functions, such as to constitute a contempt of the house,\u201d he said. Tim Wilson declared on the pecuniary interest register that he is a shareholder in two funds managed by Wilson Asset Management but failed to make a declaration in public hearings, including the 30 November hearing at which Geoff Wilson gave evidence. Burke suggested that given Tim Wilson\u2019s shareholding through his self-managed superannuation fund, he \u201cmay be impacted by the very policy his committee is inquiring into\u201d in his retirement. He questioned whether Tim Wilson had breached standing orders that \u201cno member may sit on a committee if he or she has a particular direct pecuniary interest\u201d in the matter under inquiry. Tim Wilson has denied having a conflict of interest, telling Guardian Australia he \u201cwill not be affected by Labor\u2019s retirement tax\u201d. Burke noted that as a result of the Stop the Retirement Tax website, the committee will be using \u201cevidence written by the chair\u201d lodged through a website \u201cpartly funded by a person with a vested interest\u201d in the inquiry. Tim Wilson has consistently defended the Stop the Retirement Tax website, arguing it is clearly a \u201ccampaign site\u201d with \u201cno subtlety\u201d, and users are able to edit the pro forma message opposing Labor\u2019s policy, refuse to sign the petition or pass their details on. In its first iteration the website required users to sign the Wilson Asset Management petition to register to attend hearings, although it has since been modified to remove that requirement. Burke said the website still \u201ccontinues to create the misleading impression that in order to attend people are required to register even though that is not the case\u201d. Burke said that before the changes people had been \u201cforced to provide their private information to a commercial enterprise\u201d and the website was likely to discourage people with a different view on Labor\u2019s policy from attending hearings. \u201cAs such, in its deliberations the committee will be forced to rely on evidence which has been prejudiced by the actions of the chair.\u201d Burke said it was \u201cnot clear who has access\u201d to contact details provided through the site. Guardian Australia has reported that people who made submissions via the website were then contacted by Wilson Asset Management. Burke noted that Tim Wilson had not intervened at the 30 January inquiry hearing when Liberal MP Andrew Wallace encouraged people to join the Liberal party and did not stop membership forms being handed out. Liberal MP Jason Falinski also posted Liberal A-frames outside the hearing in Dee Why, he said. Shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has written directly to the privileges committee to complain that Tim Wilson failed until Wednesday to declare whether he is a director or shareholder of Bolger-Wilson Investments Pty Ltd, although Wilson did declare he is the beneficiary of that family investment trust. The speaker Tony Smith said he would \u201ccarefully consider\u201d the matters raised and report back to the house.",

His lawyers argue that he has almost no prospect of release or removal from Australia, which rendered his detention unlawful as it was no longer a means to facilitate removal.</p> <p>It sought to reopen the controversial 2004 Al-Kateb v Godwin ruling, which enabled indefinite detention in Australia.</p> <p>The high court usually takes weeks or months to deliver its ruling but on Wednesday they adjourned for just minutes, finding \u201cno factual basis\u201d to answer two legislative questions, awarding no relief to M47, and ordering the plaintiff pay costs.</p> <p>The questions before the bench related to powers under the migration act to detain and deport unlawful non-citizens.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s ruling does not prevent further attempts to challenge Al-Kateb.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/12/scott-morrison-suffers-historic-defeat-as-labor-and-crossbench-pass-medevac-bill\">Scott Morrison suffers historic defeat as Labor and crossbench pass medevac bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>M47 has previously told Guardian Australia that he believes \u2013 but does not know \u2013 that he was born in the Canary Islands and was taken to the Western Sahara, which is a disputed territory, as a newborn baby. Investigations into his identity have focused on the possibility he is Algerian or Moroccan.</p> <p>Pre-hearing submissions from the government said its success would potentially affect every case of onshore detention in the past 15 years. Alison Battisson, a lawyer for M47, who cannot be named because of reporting restrictions, hoped it would be the case which started the end of indefinite arbitrary detention in Australia.</p> <p>However, after relentless questioning of the man\u2019s interactions with the immigration department, his lawyers requested the full bench allow a retreat of sorts, setting aside the orders which referred the case from a single high court judge to the full bench.</p> <p>His lawyer, Ron Merkel QC, had requested further time to seek \u201cinformed instruction\u201d from his client, who had not agreed to the legal team\u2019s request that they take the step back.</p> <p>More than 90 minutes later, the situation had not changed, and Merkel suggested the high court could make the order itself. It declined and instructed both parties to begin arguments.</p> <p>The full bench earlier sought to hear arguments about whether M47 is in fact stateless \u2013 a fact that had to be established if the Al-Kateb ruling was to be challenged through his circumstances.</p> <p>Merkel said the immigration department had investigated the man\u2019s identity for nine years and made no headway. Entreaties to Norway, the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada to resettle him had all been refused.</p> <p>He thus had no reasonable prospect of release from detention or removal to another country, Merkel suggested.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/13/nine-facts-about-the-medical-evacuation-bill\">Nine facts about the medical evacuation bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the judges questioned if he could provide information that established his identity and potentially facilitate his deportation, ending his indefinite detention.</p> <p>\u201cWhat clearly sets this case apart from other cases, including al-Kateb, is that a large part of the difficulty in establishing [his identity] is that the plaintiff\u2026 has volunteered many various inconsistent conflicting accounts,\u201d said justice Geoffrey Nettle.</p> <p>Merkel accepted there was an issue of \u201ccredibility\u201d but that it didn\u2019t change the fact there was no current information or forthcoming information from the government\u2019s investigations.</p> <p>\u201cThis credibility issue ultimately comes down to no more than the department suspects \u2026 that the plaintiff has concealed information which might assist.

      "bodyText": "The high court has rejected an attempt to reopen a controversial ruling which effectively enabled indefinite immigration detention in Australia. The full bench in Canberra took the highly unusual step of delivering an immediate judgement, after a tumultuous day which saw the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers seek to stop them hearing the case and have it sent back to a single judge for reassessment. The change in tack came after arguments on his statelessness appeared to come unstuck under animated questioning from the judges on his credibility, with justice Michelle Gordon querying whether he had \u201cthe keys in his pocket to get himself out\u201d of detention by providing more information about his background. The case was brought on behalf of an allegedly stateless man, referred to in court as plaintiff M47, who has been held in immigration detention for nine years. His lawyers argue that he has almost no prospect of release or removal from Australia, which rendered his detention unlawful as it was no longer a means to facilitate removal. It sought to reopen the controversial 2004 Al-Kateb v Godwin ruling, which enabled indefinite detention in Australia. The high court usually takes weeks or months to deliver its ruling but on Wednesday they adjourned for just minutes, finding \u201cno factual basis\u201d to answer two legislative questions, awarding no relief to M47, and ordering the plaintiff pay costs. The questions before the bench related to powers under the migration act to detain and deport unlawful non-citizens. Wednesday\u2019s ruling does not prevent further attempts to challenge Al-Kateb. M47 has previously told Guardian Australia that he believes \u2013 but does not know \u2013 that he was born in the Canary Islands and was taken to the Western Sahara, which is a disputed territory, as a newborn baby. Investigations into his identity have focused on the possibility he is Algerian or Moroccan. Pre-hearing submissions from the government said its success would potentially affect every case of onshore detention in the past 15 years. Alison Battisson, a lawyer for M47, who cannot be named because of reporting restrictions, hoped it would be the case which started the end of indefinite arbitrary detention in Australia. However, after relentless questioning of the man\u2019s interactions with the immigration department, his lawyers requested the full bench allow a retreat of sorts, setting aside the orders which referred the case from a single high court judge to the full bench. His lawyer, Ron Merkel QC, had requested further time to seek \u201cinformed instruction\u201d from his client, who had not agreed to the legal team\u2019s request that they take the step back. More than 90 minutes later, the situation had not changed, and Merkel suggested the high court could make the order itself. It declined and instructed both parties to begin arguments. The full bench earlier sought to hear arguments about whether M47 is in fact stateless \u2013 a fact that had to be established if the Al-Kateb ruling was to be challenged through his circumstances. Merkel said the immigration department had investigated the man\u2019s identity for nine years and made no headway. Entreaties to Norway, the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada to resettle him had all been refused. He thus had no reasonable prospect of release from detention or removal to another country, Merkel suggested. However, the judges questioned if he could provide information that established his identity and potentially facilitate his deportation, ending his indefinite detention. \u201cWhat clearly sets this case apart from other cases, including al-Kateb, is that a large part of the difficulty in establishing [his identity] is that the plaintiff\u2026 has volunteered many various inconsistent conflicting accounts,\u201d said justice Geoffrey Nettle. Merkel accepted there was an issue of \u201ccredibility\u201d but that it didn\u2019t change the fact there was no current information or forthcoming information from the government\u2019s investigations. \u201cThis credibility issue ultimately comes down to no more than the department suspects \u2026 that the plaintiff has concealed information which might assist. But the department is not able to identify what that information is,\u201d he said. \u201cWell that\u2019s chicken and egg, isn\u2019t it,\u201d replied chief justice Susan Kiefel. \u201cThere\u2019s doubts all the way through.\u201d The department said it had written to the plaintiff on 8 November, requesting he meet with the Algerian and Moroccan embassies again to establish whether he was a native of those countries. He had previously refused to speak Arabic for an Algerian voice analyst. Merkel said M47\u2019s accent had been affected by nine years of detention. Algeria had already analysed an older recording of his voice, finding with 80% confidence that he was not Algerian. Morocco had refused any claim over him, and there was no suggestion it would change its mind, he said. However, the judges asked why the man was not cooperating if he had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d. \u201cAbsent his cooperation, one can\u2019t know what the prospects are,\u201d said justice Patrick Keane. After a short adjournment Merkel requested the case be adjourned to another date as the plaintiff had offered to meet with both embassies and further cooperate with the department. The solicitor general Stephen Donaghue, acting for the immigration minister, opposed the request, saying the issues at hand had been \u201csquarely dealt with\u201d. He presented examples of the M47\u2019s inconsistent statements, including an admission that he told Moroccan officials during a phone call that he was Algerian. The high court will publish their reasons for the decision at a later date.",

We\u2019ve stayed overnight in hostels, inns or friends\u2019 places and despite having lived here for 20 years, we\u2019ve discovered miles of footpaths we\u2019ve never been on. Linear journeys are so much more motivating than circular ones and the brilliant thing is, you\u2019re always heading home. Chris Batten",

      "bodyText": "Standing on the steps of the Brooklyn courthouse amid flurries of sleet and snow, US attorney Richard Donoghue hailed the conviction of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n as a famous victory in America\u2019s longest conflict. \u201cThere are those who say the war on drugs is not worth fighting. Those people are wrong,\u201d he said. But that war \u2013 now nearly half a century old \u2013 shows no sign of ending, and neither does the trade in illegal narcotics. In the course of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s eleven week trial, prosecutors presented the Sinaloa Federation as a vertically-integrated organization with a clear chain of command leading all the way up to one all-powerful boss: El Chapo. But Guzm\u00e1n was arrested nearly three years ago, since which: \u2022 Production of coca, the raw material of cocaine, has soared: 171,000 hectares were used to grow coca in Colombia in 2017 \u2013 up 25,000 hectares (17%) on the year before. Provisional figures for 2018 suggest a further increase to record levels; most Colombian cocaine is shipped by Mexican cartels and their partners to the USA and Europe. \u2022 The appetite for cocaine in the US and Europe remains insatiable \u2013 cocaine prices in the UK are at their highest since 1990 and the drug is purer than it has been for a decade \u2013 and while supplies of methamphetamine and synthetic drugs soar. \u2022 Mexico set new records for murder, with 25,394 homicides in the first nine months of 2018, 18% up on the 21,460 recorded in the same period of 2017, the highest figure since records began in 1997, according to the interior ministry. In his final report to the nation, Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto blamed the surge on the police\u2019s inability to combat small criminal gangs which arose after Guzm\u00e1n and other major cartel leaders were captured. But even before El Chapo\u2019s trial, there was always widespread suspicion that successive Mexican governments had collaborated with the Sinaloa cartel against rivals less easy to control, to forge a \u201cPax Mafiosa\u201d. On the ground, Sinaloa remains a force to be reckoned with, still shipping drugs north even as the fight for local markets in Mexico sends murder rates soaring. Where the cartel is overstretched \u2013 or torn apart by internecine war \u2013 rival factions ramp up the violence and other cartels emerge to fill the vacuum. Once seen as a newcomer eager to make its mark, the Jalisco New Generation cartel is now a major player. The Zetas are no longer as strong as they once were, but they never lost the north-east and west coasts, nor the world\u2019s busiest international trade crossing from Nuevo Laredo into Laredo, Texas. Meanwhile Mexican society has become brutalised: in the shadow of narco-trafficking violence come killings over other illicit economies, femicides and appalling levels of domestic violence. The products \u2013 cocaine, meth, heroin - flow with the same official impunity with Guzm\u00e1n arrested, extradited and convicted as at any other time. And Mexico\u2019s new president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador seems as committed as his predecessors to the militarized anti-drugs strategy that has only contributed to the bloodshed. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s conviction is a historic moment, but its legacy could be measured against that of less trumpeted moments in the narco-narrative. One was an appeal by then Colombian president Juan Manual Santos to the Organisation of American States at its summit in Cartage\u00f1a in 2010, to tear up the war on drugs battle plan, and start again on the basis of \u201cco-responsibility\u201d between \u201cproducing\u201d nations torn apart by violence over narco-traffic, and \u2018consuming\u2019 countries where the noses, veins and pill-wrappers are, and where the money gets \u201ccleaned\u201d. The response from President Barack Obama was a rare admission that \u201cit\u2019s really a two-way situation here\u201d \u2013 but the war on drugs raged on, racking up more statistics of death and loss. Then there are those other figures: the dollars. The most revealing testimony of the trial came from Jes\u00fas Zambada Garc\u00eda, the accountant of the Sinaloa cartel. He explained how a successful shipment to New York would yield $390m in clear profit, to share between five investors, including his brother Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda \u201cEl Mayo\u201d who co-founded the federation with Guzm\u00e1n. Asked how many shipments he would make in a year to US entrepots, Zambada replied: \u201chundreds\u201d. There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that is not still the case \u2013 only that there is a vacancy around the investment opportunity table. An exhaustive report on the micro- and macro-economies of cocaine, published in 2012 by two academics at the Universitad de los Andes in Bogot\u00e1 concluded that 2.6% of the street value of cocaine from Colombia stays there, while 96.4% swills through distribution networks and banks in \u201cconsuming\u201d countries. \u201cColombian society has suffered to almost no economic advantage from the drugs trade\u201d, said one of the report\u2019s authors Alejandro Gav\u00edria, \u201cwhile huge profits are made by criminal distribution networks in consuming countries, and recycled by banks which operate with nothing like the restrictions that Colombia\u2019s own banking system is subject to\u201d. At Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s trial, we heard about shipments, from Colombia via Mexico to the US, but this language that never reached the courtroom; the money always went \u201cback to Mexico\u201d: planes and Samsonite bags of cash flown and hauled here and there. But we know it doesn\u2019t stay in Mexico. Across the East River from the Brooklyn courthouse is the US headquarters of HSBC, through which hundreds of millions of dollars of profits were laundered for distribution through the \u2018legal\u2019 economy. The Wachovia bank did the same with even greater amounts, admitted to the US district court of southern Florida. In both cases, the punishment was admonition. An indictment of Guzm\u00e1n filed in El Paso in 2012 accuses him of running \u201ca vast money-laundering apparatus\u201d.

None of this language featured at trial. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s defence lawyers also adopted the vision of a single integrated cartel, only they argued that it was ruled by El Mayo \u2013 the man who co-founded the federation with El Chapo \u2013 and then shopped him to the authorities.

      "bodyText": "Animal rights activists have launched an unprecedented legal challenge to the slaughter of dolphins in Japan, claiming that fishermen are routinely violating animal welfare laws and exceeding government-set quotas. The London-based organisation Action for Dolphins and the Japanese NGO Life Investigation Agency on Wednesday submitted evidence they hope will halt the annual dolphin hunts in Taiji, a whaling town on Japan\u2019s Pacific coast, the Guardian can reveal. \u201cDolphins are mistakenly viewed as \u2018fish\u2019 in Japan, and therefore domestic laws protecting mammals from cruelty have not been applied to them,\u201d claimed Sarah Lucas, chief executive of Action for Dolphins. The lawsuit, filed with the Wakayama district court, \u201casserts that dolphins are biologically mammals, and the cruelty inflicted on them in Taiji is \u201cillegal under Japan\u2019s own laws\u201d. The allegations made against Yoshinobu Nisaka, the governor of Wakayama prefecture, where Taiji is located, include that he has allegedly abused his power by issuing permits to fishermen who violate Japan\u2019s animal welfare laws and catch quotas. It is unknown whether those allegations will be denied. A prefectural government official declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian, saying it was unaware of the lawsuit. The Taiji drive hunts gained notoriety after the release of the 2009 Oscar-winning documentary The Cove, whose graphic footage of dolphins being slaughtered with knives, turning the surrounding sea a crimson red, shocked audiences around the world. If the challenge succeeds, those permits will be declared invalid, and the dolphin hunts in Taiji will not be allowed to continue, Action for Dolphins said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about casting moral aspersions on Japan, but about compliance with the country\u2019s own laws\u201d said spokeswoman Angie Plummer. \u201cWe are trying to depoliticise the debate.\u201d Lucas said claims by Taiji officials that dolphins were killed humanely using new slaughter methods were false. \u201cThe method used to kill dolphins during the hunt is exceptionally cruel,\u201d said Lucas, who was awarded 110,000 yen by a Japanese court three years ago after she was prevented from entering Taiji\u2019s whale museum to check on the welfare of a captive baby albino bottlenose. \u201cA metal rod is repeatedly stabbed into the back of the dolphin\u2019s neck and a wooden plug is inserted into the open wound to prevent blood loss. This means the dolphins die a slow, painful death, taking several minutes to bleed out or drown in their own blood.\u201d The suit also claims that fishermen in Taiji routinely flout catch limits set by the government. It presents evidence that fishermen in the town have illegally caught more than 400 dolphins and whales in excess of their quotas in the past five years. Under the Japanese legal definition, the quotas should include not only dolphins that are killed deliberately or sold to aquariums, but also those that are caught and released \u2013 sometimes after several days \u2013 and that die from collateral causes such as drowning or injury, the group claims. \u201cThe irresponsible overhunting of hundreds of dolphins and whales has contributed to the near elimination of some species in Japanese waters,\u201d Lucas said. Yoshifumi Kai, a senior official with Taiji\u2019s fisheries cooperative, said he had yet to read the lawsuit but denied that local fishermen exceeded quotas or killed dolphins inhumanely. \u201cJapanese authorities do not require us to count released dolphins as part of the official quota,\u201d Kai told the Guardian, adding that dolphins killed for food were not left die prolonged deaths. \u201cIn most cases they die straight away, although that doesn\u2019t happen 100 percent of the time. That doesn\u2019t just apply to dolphins, though \u2013 the same thing happens to cattle.\u201d Some of the dolphins captured at Taiji are killed and their meat sold in supermarkets and restaurants, but the most attractive specimens are spared and sold to aquariums for up to tens of thousands of pounds each, according to Lucas. In 2015, Action for Dolphins took legal action against the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums that resulted in 62 Japanese aquariums facing expulsion from the body unless they agreed to stop buying dolphins captured in Taiji. The town\u2019s whale museum, however, quit the Japanese branch of the world association in protest and continues display and sell locally caught cetaceans. Taiji\u2019s fishermen insist they have no intention of ending the hunts, saying they are part of the town\u2019s whaling heritage and a vital source of income for the local economy.",

Instead, politicians carry on as if nothing is amiss.</p> <p>The same goes for the democratic emergency. Almost everywhere trust in governments, parliaments and elections is collapsing. Shared civic life is replaced by closed social circles that receive entirely different, often false, information. The widespread sense that politics has become so corrupted that it can no longer respond to ordinary people\u2019s needs has provoked a demagogic backlash that in some countries begins to slide into fascism. But despite years of revelations about hidden spending, fake news, front groups and micro-targeted ads on social media, almost nothing has changed.</p> <p>In Britain, for example, we now know that the EU referendum was won with the help of widespread cheating. We still don\u2019t know the origins of much of the money spent by the leave campaigns. For example, we have no idea who provided the <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/brexitinc/adam-ramsay/fresh-concerns-raised-over-dup-s-secret-brexit-donation\" title=\"\">\u00a3435,000 channelled through Scotland</a>, into Northern Ireland, through the coffers of the Democratic Unionist party and back into Scotland and England, to pay for pro-Brexit ads. Nor do we<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/01/arron-banks-referred-to-agency-over-suspected-offences-in-brexit-campaign\" title=\"\"> know the original source of the \u00a38m that Arron Banks</a> delivered to the Leave.EU campaign. We do know that both of the main leave campaigns have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/01/leave-eu-arron-banks-insurance-company-fined-data-breaches-information-commissioner-audit\" title=\"\">fined for illegal activities</a>, and that the conduct of the referendum has damaged many people\u2019s faith in the political system. But, astonishingly, the government has so far failed to introduce a single new law in response to these events. And now it\u2019s happening again.</p> <p>Since mid-January an organisation called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=GB&amp;view_all_page_id=1625300137516491\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s Future</a> has spent \u00a3125,000 on Facebook ads demanding a hard or no-deal Brexit. Most of them target particular constituencies. Where an MP is deemed sympathetic to the organisation\u2019s aims, the voters who receive these ads are urged to tell him or her to \u201cremove the backstop, rule out a customs union, deliver Brexit without delay\u201d. Where the MP is deemed unsympathetic, the message is: \u201cDon\u2019t let them steal Brexit; Don\u2019t let them ignore your vote.\u201d</p> <p>So who or what is Britain\u2019s Future? Sorry, I have no idea. As <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/brexitinc/peter-geoghegan/revealed-dark-money-brexit-ads-flooding-social-media\" title=\"\">openDemocracy points out</a>, it has no published address and releases no information about who founded it, who controls it and who has been paying for these advertisements.

But he didn\u2019t revisit the concept until a decade later. Over several months in 2015, Serrano photographed medieval torture implements, victims of torture and staged simulated torture sessions with volunteers.</p> <p>\u201cIn a lot of my work, I combine the real with the unreal,\u201d he says. \u201cReal Klansmen, real dead people, but in an unreal environment: the studio.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"101904cac6bfefad12ae86034b57b8399e327674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/101904cac6bfefad12ae86034b57b8399e327674/0_166_758_455/500.jpg\" alt=\"The \u2018pear of anguish\u2019.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horrible history \u2026 the \u2018pear of anguish\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Serrano.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The photographs in the exhibition are overwhelming: their size (about two-and-a-half by two metres), the use of saturated colours and the dramatic contrasts recall classical Renaissance painting. But while their form is archetypal and grandiose, the content is contemporary and lurid. There are photographs of historical torture devices displayed as grotesque, opulent still lives. One such device, the \u201cpear of anguish\u201d, is even laid out on velvet. \u201cMost torture museums have replicas of torture instruments, not the real thing,\u201d says Serrano. \u201cIt\u2019s torture as curiosity or entertainment, like going to the movies or a wax museum. I went to some of those, but I also went to Hever Castle in Kent, where they have authentic instruments of torture. The copy always pales next to the real thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8336b17d569b5f676acfbb50b76916146fad07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8336b17d569b5f676acfbb50b76916146fad07f/974_177_3784_4730/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andres Serrano.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candid cameraman \u2026 Andres Serrano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The series also includes images of historic locations where torture took place in the not-so-distant past. Serrano visited several Holocaust memorial museums in Germany and Austria, as well as a Stasi prison in Berlin where thousands of people had been incarcerated and interrogated, some for years. He also photographed actual victims of torture, such as the \u201chooded men\u201d \u2013 14 men in their 20s suspected of involvement with the IRA in 1971. While in custody, the British army subjected them to the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_techniques\">\u201cfive techniques\u201d</a>: hooding, stress-positions, white noise, sleep deprivation, and food and water deprivation. None of the men were ever convicted of a criminal offence. \u201cI brought a black hood with me, like the ones placed over their heads during the entire time of their detainment,\u201d says Serrano. \u201cThey were shocked, because it was reliving something they never wanted to go through again. We talked for a while and then they said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 I was very grateful to them \u2013 that was very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Did he worry about including victims of such brutal practices? \u201cI never have misgivings about my work. My feelings don\u2019t change over time. I was very happy to be able to photograph them.\u201d</p> <p>One of the central images in the exhibition is a triptych that mimics the infamous photograph of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi, who was imprisoned and interrogated by the CIA at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003. Captives at Abu Ghraib were subjected to physical and psychological distress, sexual abuse and humiliation. Serrano says he recreated the image with a volunteer because he saw it as the ultimate symbol of modern-day torture .</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d13de29ecd174bc74f0d6609dbb4155a5ca62eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d13de29ecd174bc74f0d6609dbb4155a5ca62eb/0_766_3302_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled XIV from the Torture series.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modern horror \u2026 Untitled XIV from the Torture series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Serrano; courtesy of the artist and a/political.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another image that stands out is the portrait of former CIA analyst and whistleblower John Kiriakou. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/25/cia-whistleblower-john-kiriakou-prison\">Kiriakou revealed</a> the agency\u2019s use of waterboarding to interrogate al-Qaida prisoners in 2007.

      "bodyText": "Andres Serrano has never shied away from controversy. Back in 1987 his work Piss Christ \u2013 a photograph of a plastic crucifix submerged in a glass of his own urine \u2013 led to accusations of blasphemy, and the work is still the subject of protests whenever it appears in exhibitions. You would hope the New York photographer\u2019s latest series could summon similar righteous anger. It delves into the world of torture, throughout history and up to the present day. Ten photographs from the series are currently on display at Stills Gallery in Edinburgh, Scotland. The idea for the series was first planted in Serrano\u2019s mind in 2005 after he shot a hooded man for an article about torture. \u201cThe Abu Ghraib story had just come out, so torture was on everyone\u2019s mind,\u201d he says. But he didn\u2019t revisit the concept until a decade later. Over several months in 2015, Serrano photographed medieval torture implements, victims of torture and staged simulated torture sessions with volunteers. \u201cIn a lot of my work, I combine the real with the unreal,\u201d he says. \u201cReal Klansmen, real dead people, but in an unreal environment: the studio.\u201d The photographs in the exhibition are overwhelming: their size (about two-and-a-half by two metres), the use of saturated colours and the dramatic contrasts recall classical Renaissance painting. But while their form is archetypal and grandiose, the content is contemporary and lurid. There are photographs of historical torture devices displayed as grotesque, opulent still lives. One such device, the \u201cpear of anguish\u201d, is even laid out on velvet. \u201cMost torture museums have replicas of torture instruments, not the real thing,\u201d says Serrano. \u201cIt\u2019s torture as curiosity or entertainment, like going to the movies or a wax museum. I went to some of those, but I also went to Hever Castle in Kent, where they have authentic instruments of torture. The copy always pales next to the real thing.\u201d The series also includes images of historic locations where torture took place in the not-so-distant past. Serrano visited several Holocaust memorial museums in Germany and Austria, as well as a Stasi prison in Berlin where thousands of people had been incarcerated and interrogated, some for years. He also photographed actual victims of torture, such as the \u201chooded men\u201d \u2013 14 men in their 20s suspected of involvement with the IRA in 1971. While in custody, the British army subjected them to the so-called \u201cfive techniques\u201d: hooding, stress-positions, white noise, sleep deprivation, and food and water deprivation. None of the men were ever convicted of a criminal offence. \u201cI brought a black hood with me, like the ones placed over their heads during the entire time of their detainment,\u201d says Serrano. \u201cThey were shocked, because it was reliving something they never wanted to go through again. We talked for a while and then they said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 I was very grateful to them \u2013 that was very difficult.\u201d Did he worry about including victims of such brutal practices? \u201cI never have misgivings about my work. My feelings don\u2019t change over time. I was very happy to be able to photograph them.\u201d One of the central images in the exhibition is a triptych that mimics the infamous photograph of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi, who was imprisoned and interrogated by the CIA at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003. Captives at Abu Ghraib were subjected to physical and psychological distress, sexual abuse and humiliation. Serrano says he recreated the image with a volunteer because he saw it as the ultimate symbol of modern-day torture . Another image that stands out is the portrait of former CIA analyst and whistleblower John Kiriakou. Kiriakou revealed the agency\u2019s use of waterboarding to interrogate al-Qaida prisoners in 2007. It\u2019s the only picture that does not represent torture overtly, although as Serrano points out: \u201cJohn knows a lot about torture. He wrote a book about it and paid the price for it. He\u2019s an expert on the subject.\u201d Serrano says his photographs are not meant to be political and that they are \u2013 to some degree \u2013 open to interpretation. \u201cViewers may see narratives and threads that I\u2019m not aware of,\u201d he says. So what does he think the series contributes to the understanding of torture as a phenomenon? \u201cYou would know better than me,\u201d he replies. \u201cBut if I were to ask, \u2018What have we learned about torture?\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019d have to say we haven\u2019t learned anything at all.\u201d Torture is the Stills Gallery, Edinburgh, Scotland until 3 March 2019.",

It is largely comprised of Shaw\u2019s paintings of Tile Hill, the estate he grew up on that has obsessed him ever since he started painting. The drizzly visions of an empty, everyman England transcend their bleak settings, inviting viewers to project on to them their own childhood ennui. A rope dangling from a tree, a lock-up garage left open, a broken goalpost: each one suggests possible youthful adventures \u2013 or traumas.</p> <p>Back in 2011, they gained him a Turner prize nomination. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like them in existence, either in writing or in painting,\u201d says Mark Hallett, who helped curate the show. \u201cCertainly not as rich or complex in terms of chronicling a particular kind of place \u2013 the British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jan/14/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety\">council estate</a> \u2013 which has been so important in postwar Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Sorting through his childhood influences has been illuminating for Shaw: together they form a kind of self-portrait revealing new things about their subject. He\u2019d always assumed his ideas came from Samuel Beckett or Proust, yet now he could see the path his artistic development took, starting as early as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-we-love-the-ladybird-books\">Ladybird books</a>, which were illustrated with the same lack of flamboyance he sees in his own work. There are several Ladybird books on display \u2013 including one on Great Artists \u2013 but it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ladybird-books.com/books/vera-southgate/the-gingerbread-boy/2122267\">The Gingerbread Boy</a> that seems to have struck a chord with the red-headed artist. \u201cBecause that was me,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery fight in my life has been over the colour of my hair.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5d1e015b4dfdbdd540c49bebe0f30a8bea6726c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d1e015b4dfdbdd540c49bebe0f30a8bea6726c8/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youthful influences \u2026 the artist\u2019s memorabilia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youthful influences \u2026 the artist\u2019s memorabilia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did he get beaten up a lot? \u201cIf I said yes, it would make me seem more interesting wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d He smiles. \u201cI was certainly beaten up a lot more than I beat up. There were big lads hanging around, and that made the myths of fairytales seem all the more relevant.\u201d</p> <p>Shaw\u2019s collection of pin badges attest to a well-cultivated outsider status \u2013 the Fall and Throbbing Gristle. \u201cPeople at school would be listening to the Jam and they\u2019d see a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/15/joy-division-10-of-the-best\">Joy Division</a> badge and say, \u2018Who the fuck are they? That\u2019s just arty farty poofty wank!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There was one band, however, that did unite Shaw and his classmates. He says it felt tremendously exciting going into school the day after \u201cfrom Coventry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/03/specials-terry-hall-horace-panter-lynval-golding-hope-what-else-have-we-got-encore-interview\">the Specials</a>!\u201d had been uttered on Top of the Pops, and he still marvels at the access locals had to the group. \u201cYou could get on a bus and go stand outside their house,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx_7xjpySK0\">the Beatles in Help!</a> \u2013 they\u2019d come out and have a chat with you.\u201d</p> <p>The Specials inspired some of Shaw\u2019s early art \u2013 he\u2019d paint homeless people and kids he\u2019d see in the streets of the ghost town. \u201cI would have liked to have formed a band, but if you haven\u2019t got any friends\u2026\u201d He trails off, making a comedy glum face.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There's a reason my stuff was ignored. It were shit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s hard not to make the connection between Shaw\u2019s work and the Smiths record in his collection (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/13/viv-nicholson-morrissey-smiths-cover-star-football-pools-spend\">Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now, featuring pools winner Viv Nicholson</a> as the cover star). When he was younger, Shaw would visit galleries with his dad, marvelling at the artwork but feeling a sense of alienation from their grand settings. The paintings they constantly painted said nothing to him about his life \u2013 hence one of the motivations for the Tile Hill series, which contain references to all sorts of masters, from Rembrandt to Poussin, while placing them firmly in the present day.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt liberating to find this language in paint that could articulate a kind of folkism,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd suddenly I wasn\u2019t ashamed of saying I was an artist. Even now, I can go to the pub down the road, and if someone asks what I do I can tell them I\u2019m a painter and show them my work. Whereas if I was making abstract stuff I\u2019d be going\u2026\u201d He hangs his head in mock embarrassment, the stereotypical Midlander uncomfortable with any trace of pretension.</p> <p>The Tile Hill estate is located on the edge of Coventry, where the city ends and woodland begins. These woods have long been a fascination for Shaw, and it\u2019s no coincidence that some of the vinyl sleeves in the Paul Mellon collection \u2013 The Fall\u2019s Live at the Witch Trials, Echo and the Bunnymen\u2019s Crocodiles \u2013 feature trees. Shaw decided to explore these woods for his My Back to Nature series, painted while he was the National Gallery\u2019s artist in residence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c4c77f0abba4873cb05c96f53a8cf87678880b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c4c77f0abba4873cb05c96f53a8cf87678880b3/206_182_5188_6342/818.jpg\" alt=\"The Call of Nature \u2026 Shaw in the woods.\" width=\"818\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Call of Nature \u2026 Shaw in the woods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Gallery/courtesy of the artist and Wilkinson Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wandering around the gallery alone, he started to notice the sheer debauchery going on on the walls, and made the link to the goings-on in his own forests. Where Titian might paint a nymph writhing in sexual pleasure, Shaw saw the equivalent in the discarded pages of porn magazines that would be blown through the forest. There\u2019s a wonderful video of Shaw browsing the National\u2019s collection, unable to stifle his giggles as he points out various lewd Carry On-esque scenes embedded in the classics.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I <em>wanted</em> to do when I went to the National Gallery,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was what I used to do as a kid. So I\u2019d hoped that when I went to the National Gallery as a serious artist in residence, it might be an opportunity for me to grow up.\u201d</p> <p>He remembers his dad being similarly unable to keep a straight face during their visits there when he was a child. \u201cHe\u2019d be saying, \u2018Look at this great painting by Piero della Francesca \u2013 and the guy at the back in his Y-fronts.\u2019 So there was always this loftiness mixed with a sort of earthiness, the sacred and the profane, which is a very English thing. I think that\u2019s what makes some of the British art of the 90s interesting. It has an artiness and pretentiousness about it, but at the same time it\u2019s taking the piss a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Shaw is the same age as the Young British Artists whose careers exploded in the 90s. Back then, his work involved more cutting-edge methods \u2013 film-making, performance art. When nobody came knocking to make him a superstar too, he felt he\u2019d missed the boat. \u201cAlthough there was a reason why my stuff was ignored,\u201d he concedes. \u201cIt were shit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6003b77b62f149dfeb806de50fe28efd4f3ba497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6003b77b62f149dfeb806de50fe28efd4f3ba497/316_72_3562_2710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Back That Used to Be the Front, 2008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s nothing remotely magical about it\u2019 \u2026 The Back That Used to Be the Front, 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the artist and Wilkinson Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It must have come as a surprise, I say, that recognition arrived along after he\u2019d turned his hand to the less fashionable world of paint. \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s still a surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cEven today it\u2019s a surprise, I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019d want to talk to me. Why do you think I turned up? I don\u2019t think I deserve any interest at all.\u201d</p> <p>When he was nominated for the Turner, he wrote about being worried that he would finally get found out. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing remotely magical about any of it. About my take on anything or my ability or nothing. There are better painters, better collectors of music, better everything. So every time I do an interview I\u2019m thinking, \u2018You should really go and see this painter instead.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I often think I'm finished with Tile Hill. Then I'll visit my mum, pop out for a walk \u2013 and get inspired once more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hallett, who\u2019s nearby, rolls his eyes. He points out just how much American audiences loved the retrospective when it was in the US last year \u2013 not for its quaint Britishness as much as for its relatability, which survived the trip over the Atlantic. Even Shaw concedes that he\u2019s often told a pond or a tree will remind someone of something and he\u2019ll think: \u201cYou were brought up in Sweden. What the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>But of course, the pond or the tree is not what people are really seeing. \u201cIt\u2019s more the increasing distance between myself and the place I grew up,\u201d he says. Shaw cites Rembrandt\u2019s decade-spanning series of self-portraits as an influence, before returning to his pop roots: \u201cI just wanted to make a painting that had all the feeling of the Beatles\u2019 In My Life, or I\u2019d Rather Not Go Back to the Old House by the Smiths.\u201d</p> <p>His Tile Hill paintings certainly succeed in this. To look at them is to see a life reflected back in all its fullness. Perhaps that\u2019s why he keeps returning. \u201cI often think I\u2019m finished with them,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I\u2019ll visit my mum who still lives there, pop out for a walk, and I get inspired once more.

It wasn\u2019t the National Gallery.\u201d The exhibition is linked to a major retrospective of Shaw\u2019s work at Bath\u2019s Holburne museum. It is largely comprised of Shaw\u2019s paintings of Tile Hill, the estate he grew up on that has obsessed him ever since he started painting. The drizzly visions of an empty, everyman England transcend their bleak settings, inviting viewers to project on to them their own childhood ennui. A rope dangling from a tree, a lock-up garage left open, a broken goalpost: each one suggests possible youthful adventures \u2013 or traumas. Back in 2011, they gained him a Turner prize nomination. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like them in existence, either in writing or in painting,\u201d says Mark Hallett, who helped curate the show. \u201cCertainly not as rich or complex in terms of chronicling a particular kind of place \u2013 the British council estate \u2013 which has been so important in postwar Britain.\u201d Sorting through his childhood influences has been illuminating for Shaw: together they form a kind of self-portrait revealing new things about their subject. He\u2019d always assumed his ideas came from Samuel Beckett or Proust, yet now he could see the path his artistic development took, starting as early as the Ladybird books, which were illustrated with the same lack of flamboyance he sees in his own work. There are several Ladybird books on display \u2013 including one on Great Artists \u2013 but it\u2019s The Gingerbread Boy that seems to have struck a chord with the red-headed artist. \u201cBecause that was me,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery fight in my life has been over the colour of my hair.\u201d Did he get beaten up a lot? \u201cIf I said yes, it would make me seem more interesting wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d He smiles. \u201cI was certainly beaten up a lot more than I beat up. There were big lads hanging around, and that made the myths of fairytales seem all the more relevant.\u201d Shaw\u2019s collection of pin badges attest to a well-cultivated outsider status \u2013 the Fall and Throbbing Gristle. \u201cPeople at school would be listening to the Jam and they\u2019d see a Joy Division badge and say, \u2018Who the fuck are they? That\u2019s just arty farty poofty wank!\u2019\u201d There was one band, however, that did unite Shaw and his classmates. He says it felt tremendously exciting going into school the day after \u201cfrom Coventry, the Specials!\u201d had been uttered on Top of the Pops, and he still marvels at the access locals had to the group. \u201cYou could get on a bus and go stand outside their house,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like the Beatles in Help! \u2013 they\u2019d come out and have a chat with you.\u201d The Specials inspired some of Shaw\u2019s early art \u2013 he\u2019d paint homeless people and kids he\u2019d see in the streets of the ghost town. \u201cI would have liked to have formed a band, but if you haven\u2019t got any friends\u2026\u201d He trails off, making a comedy glum face. It\u2019s hard not to make the connection between Shaw\u2019s work and the Smiths record in his collection (Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now, featuring pools winner Viv Nicholson as the cover star). When he was younger, Shaw would visit galleries with his dad, marvelling at the artwork but feeling a sense of alienation from their grand settings. The paintings they constantly painted said nothing to him about his life \u2013 hence one of the motivations for the Tile Hill series, which contain references to all sorts of masters, from Rembrandt to Poussin, while placing them firmly in the present day. \u201cIt felt liberating to find this language in paint that could articulate a kind of folkism,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd suddenly I wasn\u2019t ashamed of saying I was an artist. Even now, I can go to the pub down the road, and if someone asks what I do I can tell them I\u2019m a painter and show them my work. Whereas if I was making abstract stuff I\u2019d be going\u2026\u201d He hangs his head in mock embarrassment, the stereotypical Midlander uncomfortable with any trace of pretension. The Tile Hill estate is located on the edge of Coventry, where the city ends and woodland begins. These woods have long been a fascination for Shaw, and it\u2019s no coincidence that some of the vinyl sleeves in the Paul Mellon collection \u2013 The Fall\u2019s Live at the Witch Trials, Echo and the Bunnymen\u2019s Crocodiles \u2013 feature trees. Shaw decided to explore these woods for his My Back to Nature series, painted while he was the National Gallery\u2019s artist in residence. Wandering around the gallery alone, he started to notice the sheer debauchery going on on the walls, and made the link to the goings-on in his own forests. Where Titian might paint a nymph writhing in sexual pleasure, Shaw saw the equivalent in the discarded pages of porn magazines that would be blown through the forest. There\u2019s a wonderful video of Shaw browsing the National\u2019s collection, unable to stifle his giggles as he points out various lewd Carry On-esque scenes embedded in the classics. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do when I went to the National Gallery,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was what I used to do as a kid. So I\u2019d hoped that when I went to the National Gallery as a serious artist in residence, it might be an opportunity for me to grow up.\u201d He remembers his dad being similarly unable to keep a straight face during their visits there when he was a child. \u201cHe\u2019d be saying, \u2018Look at this great painting by Piero della Francesca \u2013 and the guy at the back in his Y-fronts.\u2019 So there was always this loftiness mixed with a sort of earthiness, the sacred and the profane, which is a very English thing. I think that\u2019s what makes some of the British art of the 90s interesting. It has an artiness and pretentiousness about it, but at the same time it\u2019s taking the piss a bit.\u201d Shaw is the same age as the Young British Artists whose careers exploded in the 90s. Back then, his work involved more cutting-edge methods \u2013 film-making, performance art. When nobody came knocking to make him a superstar too, he felt he\u2019d missed the boat. \u201cAlthough there was a reason why my stuff was ignored,\u201d he concedes. \u201cIt were shit.\u201d It must have come as a surprise, I say, that recognition arrived along after he\u2019d turned his hand to the less fashionable world of paint. \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s still a surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cEven today it\u2019s a surprise, I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019d want to talk to me. Why do you think I turned up? I don\u2019t think I deserve any interest at all.\u201d When he was nominated for the Turner, he wrote about being worried that he would finally get found out. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing remotely magical about any of it. About my take on anything or my ability or nothing. There are better painters, better collectors of music, better everything. So every time I do an interview I\u2019m thinking, \u2018You should really go and see this painter instead.\u2019\u201d Hallett, who\u2019s nearby, rolls his eyes. He points out just how much American audiences loved the retrospective when it was in the US last year \u2013 not for its quaint Britishness as much as for its relatability, which survived the trip over the Atlantic. Even Shaw concedes that he\u2019s often told a pond or a tree will remind someone of something and he\u2019ll think: \u201cYou were brought up in Sweden. What the fuck are you talking about?\u201d But of course, the pond or the tree is not what people are really seeing. \u201cIt\u2019s more the increasing distance between myself and the place I grew up,\u201d he says. Shaw cites Rembrandt\u2019s decade-spanning series of self-portraits as an influence, before returning to his pop roots: \u201cI just wanted to make a painting that had all the feeling of the Beatles\u2019 In My Life, or I\u2019d Rather Not Go Back to the Old House by the Smiths.\u201d His Tile Hill paintings certainly succeed in this. To look at them is to see a life reflected back in all its fullness. Perhaps that\u2019s why he keeps returning. \u201cI often think I\u2019m finished with them,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I\u2019ll visit my mum who still lives there, pop out for a walk, and I get inspired once more. My wife will say, \u2018Oh no, not again.\u2019\u201d He shakes his head, exasperated by his lack of free will. \u201cIn a sense, I\u2019m painting my own departure \u2013 to keep going, until the final painting is empty, and you\u2019re no longer casting any shadow on it.\u201d He muses on this for a while. \u201cThat\u2019s when you paint the greatest painting of your life. But the fact is, you\u2019ll never be around to paint it.\u201d \u2022 George Shaw: A Corner of a Foreign Field is at Holburn Museum, Bath, until 6 May. The complementary exhibition Secondhand Daylight is at Paul Mellon Centre, London, until 3 May.",

The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).</p>\n    <p>Each of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do Oscar winners win?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:&nbsp;it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There are some amazing and almost dreamlike scenes in the film, left-field adventures which never look extraneous, but like the things that can happen in real, rather than surreal life: a family trip to friends in the country featuring a hair-raising shooting trip, a New Year\u2019s party which culminates in a forest fire and one guest singing an earnest Scandinavian hymn.

Could these digital innovations \u2013 mostly confined to new, populist parties \u2013 help revitalise our liberal democracies?</p> \n<p>The pioneers of digital democracies were the pirate parties of northern Europe who first broke through in Sweden, Germany and Iceland about a decade ago, using an online decision-making platform called <a href=\"https://liquidfeedback.org/\" title=\"\">LiquidFeedback</a>. One of its founders, Andreas Nitsche, <a href=\"http://www.liquid-democracy-journal.org/issue/2/The_Liquid_Democracy_Journal-Issue002-06-Liquid_Democracy_Provides_No_Alternative_to_the_Republic.html\" title=\"\">said the idea</a> was that \u201cempowering the ordinary members would make these parties more responsive to the demands of society\u201d.</p> \n<p>More recently, the fiercely anti-establishment M5S and the Spanish leftwing populist party Podemos have led the way. \u201cOrdinary citizens will become protagonists, abandoning the current system of delegate democracy in the hands of politicians,\u201d said the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, who masterminded the M5S digital strategy. Given the discredited status of Italy\u2019s political class, this narrative appealed to many citizens.</p> \n<p>M5S made digital democracy its core creed, with its anthem proclaiming: \u201cWe are not a party, we are not a caste, one man, one vote, one man, one vote.\u201d A variety of new parties have followed suit, to the point where digital democracy has now become a must for all new political movements that want to be seen as in sync with the times.</p> \n<p>The central innovation is the \u201cparticipatory platform\u201d. This is an online portal, often part of the official party website, that hosts a number of interactive features. These might include donations, training sessions, discussions on policy and online ballots for primaries, elections of party officers, or strategic decisions, for instance whether to enter an alliance or the position to take on a specific policy.</p> \n<p>The M5S platform is named Rousseau, after the Genevan political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Casaleggio liked to describe it as the \u201ccollective intelligence of the movement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Podemos has a participation portal named <em>Participa</em> (\u201cparticipate\u201d). It comprises a voting area and a discussion system named <em>Plaza Podemos</em> (Podemos Square) that is similar to Reddit, with threaded discussions and upvote/downvote functionalities, which earned it the moniker of \u201cReddit party\u201d.</p> \n<p>These sites closely mimic the logic of social media platforms, with discussions, votes, likes and other metrics to assess users\u2019 views. For Miguel Ardanuy, a former participation coordinator of Podemos, the ultimate aim of this \u201cplatformisation of the party\u201d is to \u201cconstruct a different model of party, a party more open and responsive to society, where you do not need a membership card in order to participate\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

M5S is in government in Italy. Podemos rapidly surged to become Spain\u2019s third largest political force, and underpins the present administration. There are few historical precedents of new political parties achieving comparable results in such a short time.</p> \n<p>This electoral prowess largely derives from an ability to recruit a large base of members. Podemos and the leftist French group La France Insoumise (France Defiant) boasted more than 500,000 members each at the start of 2019, putting them in Europe\u2019s political major league. (M5S has fewer \u2013 about 150,000; some blame a cumbersome registration process for this.)</p> \n<p>Opting for a free membership system, similar to the free sign-up model of digital companies such as Facebook, Google or Twitter, has radically lowered the barrier to entry compared with traditional parties. \u201cWe built an open and flexible structure eliding the traditional separation between members and sympathisers,\u201d said Guillaume Royer, who led the development of La France Insoumise\u2019s own platform.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f94081d93f981d26a4304b687e022fe866f1239d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f94081d93f981d26a4304b687e022fe866f1239d/0_0_1503_894/1000.png\" alt=\"The online platform of Italian party Five Star Movement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"595\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rousseau online platform of Italian party M5S, with sections for discussions, tutorials, policy debate and fundraising</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M5S</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The platforms enable parties to solicit ideas from members which can be evaluated by experts before being submitted to a wider online vote. M5S, Podemos and La France Insoumise have all crowdsourced ideas this way for their election manifestos.</p> \n<p>Yet in practice, most of the online voting tends to relate to the election of officials, or yes/no internal referendums. E-ballots have often been used more as a means of propaganda, to demonstrate the cohesion of party members, rather than as an opportunity for a genuine and pluralist internal debate.</p> \n<p>Online consultations have often returned highly anticipated super-majority results, with in some cases more than 80% of voters supporting the winning option that was almost invariably the option favoured by the party leadership.</p> \n<p>Out of more than 40 referendums carried out by M5S, there have been just two instances in which members have gone against the leadership\u2019s will. Of the dozen online referendums held by Podemos since 2014, there has been not a single case of rank-and-file rebellion.</p> \n<p>For instance, when Podemos\u2019s leader, Pablo Iglesias, was nominated as party candidate for prime minister in the next elections, he secured 90% of the votes. There was no competition. But barely one in 10 members took part in the ballot.</p> \n<p>According to M5S activist Davide Bono, this tendency towards unanimity stems from the fact that \u201cactivists share a strong collective identity and agree on many common points\u201d. However, landslide results also hint at the strong control exercised by the party leadership over internal decision-making.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e2990e1104f46d644be9fd7011486033f9611f4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2990e1104f46d644be9fd7011486033f9611f4/0_0_2480_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salvini\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">League leader Matteo Salvini arrives at the Lower House in Rome.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giuseppe Lami/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are a number of ways in which the leadership can influence internal consultations. The staff responsible for the management of digital platforms are often directly dependent on the party leadership, and therefore liable to pressure.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, apparently trivial things, such as the formulation of questions, the timing of votes or even the order of options on the ballot, can steer voters towards the preferred option.</p> \n<p>Finally, the leadership can create a mood conducive to its own will. David Puente, a former employee of Casaleggio, recounts how, in anticipation of important decisions, the employees and the all-important blog of party co-founder Beppe Grillo would adopt a certain line with the aim of influencing the decision. \u201cIt was enough for Grillo to say A, and the members would vote A.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/17/revealed-how-italy-populists-used-facebook-win-election-matteo-salvini-luigi-di-maio\">Revealed: how Italy's populists used Facebook to win power</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Far from being the protagonists, party members are more akin to non-player characters, or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/us/politics/npc-twitter-ban.html\" title=\"\">NPCs</a>, to use a term often used in digital subcultures. They are agents who can only respond to the stimuli coming from above, with little room for proactive intervention.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wasted opportunity,\u201d said Yago Bermejo Abati, the project coordinator of Media Lab Prado in Madrid, who was originally involved in designing Podemos\u2019s participation portal. \u201cGiven all the initial hope, this is a great disappointment.\u201d Party members themselves seem to have become wary of digital democracy\u2019s limits, as seen in the falling number of participants in the online consultations of Podemos and M5S.</p> \n<p>These failings may merely be teething problems of a new tendency that seems here to stay. A number of mainstream political parties have already integrated digital democracy functions. In the UK, the Labour party allowed members to vote online in the 2016 leadership election, and the leftwing, pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum has created its own participatory platform called <a href=\"https://my.peoplesmomentum.com/\" title=\"\">MyMomentum</a>.</p> \n<p>In Spain, the ruling socialist party, PSOE, used online voting in 2016, allowing members to express their opinion on a coalition government proposal. Local mayoralties in cities such as Barcelona, Madrid and Reykjavik are carrying out online consultations and, since entering government, M5S has created a \u201cministry of direct democracy\u201d.</p> \n<p>We may be only just starting to understand how digital democracy can help address the crisis of legitimacy that is affecting different levels of the political process.</p> \n<p><em>Follow the Guardian\u2019s series </em><em>on the rise of populism at</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-new-populism\" title=\"\"><em>www.gu.com/new-populism</em></a></p> \n<p>\u2022 Paolo Gerbaudo is a political sociologist and the director of the Centre for Digital Culture at King\u2019s College London<em> </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was the biggest decision in the party\u2019s young life, a turning point that will define its reputation for years to come. But when Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement (M5S) had to resolve whether or not to join the far-right Lega, or League, in a coalition government last May, it didn\u2019t retreat into a conclave of party leaders. It asked members to vote online. An overwhelming 94% supported the move. The process was perhaps the most striking example of an emerging trend at the heart of 21st-century politics \u2013 the use of digital technology to bring people into the hearts of movements from Italy and Spain to France, Scandinavia to the UK. The digital world has taken a great deal of criticism for subverting open societies, but could it also be a motor for a democratic revival? Could these digital innovations \u2013 mostly confined to new, populist parties \u2013 help revitalise our liberal democracies? The pioneers of digital democracies were the pirate parties of northern Europe who first broke through in Sweden, Germany and Iceland about a decade ago, using an online decision-making platform called LiquidFeedback. One of its founders, Andreas Nitsche, said the idea was that \u201cempowering the ordinary members would make these parties more responsive to the demands of society\u201d. More recently, the fiercely anti-establishment M5S and the Spanish leftwing populist party Podemos have led the way. \u201cOrdinary citizens will become protagonists, abandoning the current system of delegate democracy in the hands of politicians,\u201d said the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, who masterminded the M5S digital strategy. Given the discredited status of Italy\u2019s political class, this narrative appealed to many citizens. M5S made digital democracy its core creed, with its anthem proclaiming: \u201cWe are not a party, we are not a caste, one man, one vote, one man, one vote.\u201d A variety of new parties have followed suit, to the point where digital democracy has now become a must for all new political movements that want to be seen as in sync with the times. The central innovation is the \u201cparticipatory platform\u201d. This is an online portal, often part of the official party website, that hosts a number of interactive features. These might include donations, training sessions, discussions on policy and online ballots for primaries, elections of party officers, or strategic decisions, for instance whether to enter an alliance or the position to take on a specific policy. The M5S platform is named Rousseau, after the Genevan political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Casaleggio liked to describe it as the \u201ccollective intelligence of the movement\u201d. Podemos has a participation portal named Participa (\u201cparticipate\u201d). It comprises a voting area and a discussion system named Plaza Podemos (Podemos Square) that is similar to Reddit, with threaded discussions and upvote/downvote functionalities, which earned it the moniker of \u201cReddit party\u201d. These sites closely mimic the logic of social media platforms, with discussions, votes, likes and other metrics to assess users\u2019 views. For Miguel Ardanuy, a former participation coordinator of Podemos, the ultimate aim of this \u201cplatformisation of the party\u201d is to \u201cconstruct a different model of party, a party more open and responsive to society, where you do not need a membership card in order to participate\u201d. \u201cWe live in an era of disintermediation, where we are bypassing the old middlemen, such as travel agencies,\u201d said Roberto Fico, a M5S politician and the current president of the Italian parliament\u2019s lower chamber, the Chamber of Deputies. \u201cDigital democracy embodies the same tendency applied to politics, allowing people to have a say directly on important decisions without depending on their representatives.\u201d The strategy has proven highly successful, enabling parties short of economic resources to achieve huge reach and scale. M5S is in government in Italy. Podemos rapidly surged to become Spain\u2019s third largest political force, and underpins the present administration. There are few historical precedents of new political parties achieving comparable results in such a short time. This electoral prowess largely derives from an ability to recruit a large base of members. Podemos and the leftist French group La France Insoumise (France Defiant) boasted more than 500,000 members each at the start of 2019, putting them in Europe\u2019s political major league. (M5S has fewer \u2013 about 150,000; some blame a cumbersome registration process for this.) Opting for a free membership system, similar to the free sign-up model of digital companies such as Facebook, Google or Twitter, has radically lowered the barrier to entry compared with traditional parties. \u201cWe built an open and flexible structure eliding the traditional separation between members and sympathisers,\u201d said Guillaume Royer, who led the development of La France Insoumise\u2019s own platform. The platforms enable parties to solicit ideas from members which can be evaluated by experts before being submitted to a wider online vote. M5S, Podemos and La France Insoumise have all crowdsourced ideas this way for their election manifestos. Yet in practice, most of the online voting tends to relate to the election of officials, or yes/no internal referendums. E-ballots have often been used more as a means of propaganda, to demonstrate the cohesion of party members, rather than as an opportunity for a genuine and pluralist internal debate. Online consultations have often returned highly anticipated super-majority results, with in some cases more than 80% of voters supporting the winning option that was almost invariably the option favoured by the party leadership. Out of more than 40 referendums carried out by M5S, there have been just two instances in which members have gone against the leadership\u2019s will. Of the dozen online referendums held by Podemos since 2014, there has been not a single case of rank-and-file rebellion. For instance, when Podemos\u2019s leader, Pablo Iglesias, was nominated as party candidate for prime minister in the next elections, he secured 90% of the votes. There was no competition. But barely one in 10 members took part in the ballot. According to M5S activist Davide Bono, this tendency towards unanimity stems from the fact that \u201cactivists share a strong collective identity and agree on many common points\u201d. However, landslide results also hint at the strong control exercised by the party leadership over internal decision-making. There are a number of ways in which the leadership can influence internal consultations. The staff responsible for the management of digital platforms are often directly dependent on the party leadership, and therefore liable to pressure. Furthermore, apparently trivial things, such as the formulation of questions, the timing of votes or even the order of options on the ballot, can steer voters towards the preferred option. Finally, the leadership can create a mood conducive to its own will. David Puente, a former employee of Casaleggio, recounts how, in anticipation of important decisions, the employees and the all-important blog of party co-founder Beppe Grillo would adopt a certain line with the aim of influencing the decision. \u201cIt was enough for Grillo to say A, and the members would vote A.\u201d Far from being the protagonists, party members are more akin to non-player characters, or NPCs, to use a term often used in digital subcultures. They are agents who can only respond to the stimuli coming from above, with little room for proactive intervention. \u201cIt\u2019s a wasted opportunity,\u201d said Yago Bermejo Abati, the project coordinator of Media Lab Prado in Madrid, who was originally involved in designing Podemos\u2019s participation portal. \u201cGiven all the initial hope, this is a great disappointment.\u201d Party members themselves seem to have become wary of digital democracy\u2019s limits, as seen in the falling number of participants in the online consultations of Podemos and M5S. These failings may merely be teething problems of a new tendency that seems here to stay. A number of mainstream political parties have already integrated digital democracy functions. In the UK, the Labour party allowed members to vote online in the 2016 leadership election, and the leftwing, pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum has created its own participatory platform called MyMomentum. In Spain, the ruling socialist party, PSOE, used online voting in 2016, allowing members to express their opinion on a coalition government proposal. Local mayoralties in cities such as Barcelona, Madrid and Reykjavik are carrying out online consultations and, since entering government, M5S has created a \u201cministry of direct democracy\u201d. We may be only just starting to understand how digital democracy can help address the crisis of legitimacy that is affecting different levels of the political process.

Hungering for adventure, and with few economic opportunities on offer, he quickly signed up. \u201cWe had nothing \u2013 it was tough living back then,\u201d he told film-makers in a documentary for Al Jazeera English\u2019s People &amp; Power series. \u201cI wanted to have money like other people.\u201d As European powers drew on their colonies for more personnel in the 1940s, Mbiuki\u2019s wartime recruitment and subsequent deployment would form part of the largest single movement of African men overseas since the transatlantic slave trade. But he had little idea of where he would end up or, indeed, what was at stake. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we were fighting for,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were just like their boys.\u201d Following basic training with the King\u2019s African Rifles (KAR), Mbiuki was among thousands of Africans whom Britain shipped off to Burma in 1944 to recapture the country from Japanese forces. Embarking from Mombasa, and crammed into overcrowded cabins below deck, he faced rough seas and miserable conditions. \u201cThere were a lot of people vomiting \u2013 it was really bad,\u201d he said. Once ashore, pushing deeper into enemy territory with minimal rations, Mbiuki went through hell, coming up against tropical disease, thick jungle and regular ambushes. \u201cWe started fighting the Japanese straight away,\u201d said Mbiuki. \u201cWhile we were looking for each other there would be gunfire. Then we would run towards it. It was really rough.\u201d Among Burma\u2019s battlegrounds was the infamous Kabaw Valley, which, in the words of one KAR historian, was a \u201cdepression of thick teak forest and seething mud, continuously drenched with perpetual downpours of torrential rain\u201d. In this hostile land, thousands of miles from home, Mbiuki witnessed many of his countrymen killed in action. \u201cYou see one soldier fall down, then another fall down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get scared and know things are getting bad. But you can\u2019t go back. You can\u2019t go back.\u201d Mbiuki fell ill and was briefly hospitalised, his body covered in boils. \u201cMost of the time, when you thought of what had happened, you\u2019d want to run away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you would just say, \u2018God help me. God help me. One day I\u2019ll go home.\u2019\u201d But Mbiuki\u2019s eventual return to Kenya hardly brought a hero\u2019s welcome. As with all demobilised soldiers, he was eligible for a service payment known as a war gratuity \u2013 but British policy ruled that his ethnicity and colonial origins should earn him less than his white counterparts. As a private, he could receive three and a half shillings for each month that he had fought for Britain. But a white soldier of the same rank would get 10 shillings \u2013 almost three times more. The decades since his wartime service have not dimmed the acute sense of betrayal that this flagrant inequality fostered in Mbiuki and in other elderly African veterans like him. \u201cThey should have known how much we had helped them,\u201d said Mbiuki, speaking in his dilapidated shack where he now lives alone. \u201cWe were abandoned, just like that.\u201d \u2022 Forgotten Heroes of Empire, a film by Jack Losh and Alessandro Pavone, will air on Al Jazeera English on Wednesday at 10.30pm",

      "bodyText": "When the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school commandeered the streets of Washington DC to march for their lives last year, Anthony Borges was still in a Florida hospital, fighting for his. The soft-spoken 15-year-old, then a freshman at the school in Parkland, had been shot five times during the onslaught of violence on 14 February 2018, which left 17 students and teachers dead. Anthony came close to becoming the 18th. His wounds were horrific. He spent more than two months in hospital, the longest of any survivor from the shooting. His family are still stunned he survived. Now, 13 operations later, Anthony and his family spoke to the Guardian in their first extended interview since he was released from hospital last April. While the Parkland massacre became the focal point for a new generation of activism, fronted by a group of outspoken Marjory Stoneman Douglas students, Anthony\u2019s plight slipped away from the public\u2019s imagination. He has no association with the movement and does not want to be asked about it. He has not returned to the school, just a few miles from his house, since the shooting. The memories are still too vivid and traumatic. When we meet, in a bright, open-plan living room at his home in a gated community, I am under instructions not to ask him about the day of the shooting. It has been two months since his last surgery, when a colostomy bag was removed from his abdomen. Anthony has learned to walk again and recently did away with the crutches he had needed for support. \u201cIt was like being born [again] \u2026 being a baby.

      "bodyText": "A wire fox terrier named King is America\u2019s top canine after earning the title of best in show on Tuesday night in a Westminster Kennel Club dog show touched by eleventh-hour controversy. The crowd at Madison Square Garden seemed almost taken aback when judge Peter Green revealed his verdict over a pair of overwhelmingly popular favorites: a longhaired dachshund looking to break a centuries-spanning hoodoo and a charismatic Sussex spaniel back in the final ring for the second year in a row. Maybe they shouldn\u2019t have been: the outcome marked the 15th time a wire fox captured the highest prize in the 143-year history of the country\u2019s most prestigious dog show, more than any other breed by a wide margin. Scottish terriers, the second most frequent winner, have triumphed eight times at the oldest continuously held sporting event in the United States after the Kentucky Derby. \u201cOverwhelming,\u201d said Gabriel Rangel, the veteran California handler who steered King to the sweetest of his 47 overall best in show titles, many of which came on the European circuit. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that.\u201d The poised seven-year-old from Brazil with the lustrous tricolor coat and deliberate gait, a former Crufts group winner whose official champion\u2019s name is Kingarthur Van Foliny Home, was the last dog standing after a winnowing-down process that began on Monday morning with nearly 2,800 entries in 203 breeds and varieties hailing from all 50 states and 14 other countries, including Russia, Mexico, Canada and Japan. On a bitterly cold Tuesday night in midtown Manhattan, he won the crown over a stacked field of five other group winners, among them a Havanese named Bono (awarded reserve best in show), a bouvier des Flandres named Baby Lars and a boxer named Wilma. A fourth, the crowd-pleasing Burns, was attempting to become the first dachshund to win best in show since the breed was first entered in 1877. Another, the expressive spaniel Bean, won the sporting group for a second consecutive year only to again be pipped at the final hurdle. The dramatic coronation was preceded by a spot of controversy as a seventh contender expected to compete for the big prize \u2013 Colton the schipperke, named best in the non-sporting group on Monday \u2013 was declared ineligible right before start of Tuesday\u2019s night session due to a conflict of interest: the arbiter Green\u2019s longtime partner, it turned out, has co-owned dogs with one of Colton\u2019s co-owners. Yet Colton\u2019s best in breed and best in group wins remained intact and he was allowed to make a lap of honor with the final septet before the rare step of his excusal from the ring ahead of Green\u2019s final assessment. The schipperke\u2019s handler, Christa Cook, had stepped aside gracefully in a Facebook post shortly after the disqualification was made public: \u201cWe do not wish to diminish or detract from this great event, in this amazing venue, on this very special evening, therefore we will not participate in this evening\u2019s Best In Show to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\u201d Said a club spokesperson in a statement issued midway through Tuesday\u2019s group judging: \u201cThese types of things happen at dog shows and the rules are such to maintain the integrity of the sport.\u201d The 56-year-old Rangel, who was overcome with emotion in the immediate aftermath of King\u2019s victory, has now helmed three Westminster best in show winners after Sadie the Scottie in 2010 and another wire fox named Sky in 2014.

      "bodyText": "A geriatric expert has warned nursing homes are \u201creaching for the script pads too early\u201d, prescribing sedatives and anti-depressants to elderly people and putting them at greater risk of death, stroke, disability and pneumonia. Geriatrician Edward Strivens said the drugs were useful in about 10% of cases. But up to 80% of dementia patients are taking some form of psychotropic drug. \u201cThe side effects will often outweigh the possible benefits,\u201d Strivens told the aged care royal commission hearing in Adelaide on Wednesday. He said the drugs are a last resort but too often they were used as a first resort and the medication should never be a substitute for good quality care. \u201cWhen all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail,\u201d he said. Strivens said nursing homes should be guided by the mantra: \u201cstart low, go slow and review regularly\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about using the smallest possible dose for the briefest possible time and making sure it works,\u201d he said. In some cases people ended up on a cocktail of drugs because they are prescribed medications to counter the side effects of other pills. \u201cBefore you know it you\u2019ve got half a dozen different medications,\u201d Strivens said. He said when grappling with residents\u2019 agitated behaviour, nursing homes should consider underlying causes and the life stories of residents. The disruption of daily routines that happens when entering a residential facility can be a major source of agitation. He gave the example of \u201cold bushies\u201d in far north Queensland who were used to getting up early, including one patient he saw who had worked as a baker and would wake up at 2am everyday \u2013 a routine that was difficult to maintain in an aged care facility. Meanwhile, the federal government has been accused of playing games with accountability for the national queue for home care packages. The waiting list ballooned to 127,000 people last year and the commission has been told supply is not keeping up with demand. The federal health department gave the aged care minister, Ken Wyatt, a fourth quarter data report on 10 September last year, but the government chose to release the information publicly until 28 September, on the eve of the AFL grand final. Third quarter data was on Wyatt\u2019s desk on 23 July last year but didn\u2019t enter the public domain until 17 August, well after the Super Saturday by-elections held on July 28. According to a late health department answer to an outstanding Senate estimates question released overnight, second quarter data was submitted 26 February and made public eight days later. The department\u2019s answer said it aimed to finalise the data report eight weeks after the end of the quarter and the timing of publication was a \u201cmatter for government\u201d. Labor\u2019s aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, seized on the delays in releasing the data and said the government can not be trusted to fix the problem. \u201cThis revelation clearly shows the Liberal government cared more about avoiding bad headlines than being honest with older Australians,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe least the Liberal government can do for the older Australians waiting on this list is be transparent about \u2026 wait times for home care packages.\u201d Older Persons Advocacy Network spokesman, Craig Gear, told the commission on Tuesday people are waiting for 18 to 24 months for home care packages and that was unacceptable. Wait times should be three months maximum, he said. He said people were reluctant to take interim packages. \u201cThere\u2019s some concerns about, \u2018If I take this package now, I will be stuck and this is all I will receive,\u2019\u201d Gear said. The government announced a $662m funding increase on Sunday which will cover an extra 10,000 older people for subsidised care in their homes as well as a boost to residential care.",

      "body": "<p>It might be the first waste incinerator the neighbours actually want next door. The shop at the foot of the Amager Bakke waste-to-energy project in Copenhagen is packed with families desperate to be among the first to try its unique selling point: the ski slope on the roof.</p> <p>\u201cI live so close by that I could follow the development,\u201d says Ole Fredslund, who lives in neighbouring Amager, as he helped his sons Felix and Victor strap on their boots as the slope opened its lifts for the first time on Tuesday. \u201cI guess 90% of the focus is on the fact that there\u2019s a skiing hill coming, so in a way it\u2019s very clever. Everybody talks about the ski hill to be, not the waste plant to be.\u201d</p> <p>Ten minutes and three magic carpet lifts later, we are standing next to three short fir trees at the top of a blue run, an artificial slope consisting of green and turquoise bristles. Through the smoke from the next door Amagerv\u00e6rket power plant, Sweden is visible across the straits and to the other side a wide span of central Copenhagen.</p> <p>The idea of topping a municipal plant with an urban ski resort won a string of accolades for the Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) before the first shovel was even lifted. Time Magazine judged it one of the most innovative 50 ideas of 2011. Two years ago the architectural model went on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p> <p>The building is wrapped in a facade of aluminium planters which will later drip with greenery. In the original plan, the chimney was to blow smoke rings, one for every tonne of CO2 generated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4eb2e271f2687ec107ceb053a9b2c0be14579352\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb2e271f2687ec107ceb053a9b2c0be14579352/0_82_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman on Copen Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman on Copen Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ritzau Scanpix/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But turning BIG\u2019s inspired architectural sketches into reality has been challenging, says Patrick Gustafsson, the project manager who was hired \u201cto prove it is actually a sound idea and not just a fantastic idea\u201d. \u201cNo one has ever done this before, and that\u2019s maybe for a reason, I sometimes think,\u201d he laughs.</p> <p>Above the carpet lifts, workers in fluorescent orange jackets are still finishing the landscaping on the steeper black and red runs and on the button lift that will serve them.</p> <p>\u201cThe roof is very steep, actually too steep for a ski slope.

      "bodyText": "It might be the first waste incinerator the neighbours actually want next door. The shop at the foot of the Amager Bakke waste-to-energy project in Copenhagen is packed with families desperate to be among the first to try its unique selling point: the ski slope on the roof. \u201cI live so close by that I could follow the development,\u201d says Ole Fredslund, who lives in neighbouring Amager, as he helped his sons Felix and Victor strap on their boots as the slope opened its lifts for the first time on Tuesday. \u201cI guess 90% of the focus is on the fact that there\u2019s a skiing hill coming, so in a way it\u2019s very clever. Everybody talks about the ski hill to be, not the waste plant to be.\u201d Ten minutes and three magic carpet lifts later, we are standing next to three short fir trees at the top of a blue run, an artificial slope consisting of green and turquoise bristles. Through the smoke from the next door Amagerv\u00e6rket power plant, Sweden is visible across the straits and to the other side a wide span of central Copenhagen. The idea of topping a municipal plant with an urban ski resort won a string of accolades for the Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) before the first shovel was even lifted. Time Magazine judged it one of the most innovative 50 ideas of 2011. Two years ago the architectural model went on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The building is wrapped in a facade of aluminium planters which will later drip with greenery. In the original plan, the chimney was to blow smoke rings, one for every tonne of CO2 generated. But turning BIG\u2019s inspired architectural sketches into reality has been challenging, says Patrick Gustafsson, the project manager who was hired \u201cto prove it is actually a sound idea and not just a fantastic idea\u201d. \u201cNo one has ever done this before, and that\u2019s maybe for a reason, I sometimes think,\u201d he laughs. Above the carpet lifts, workers in fluorescent orange jackets are still finishing the landscaping on the steeper black and red runs and on the button lift that will serve them. \u201cThe roof is very steep, actually too steep for a ski slope. It has an incline of 45%,\u201d Gustafsson explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shovel earth up there, you need to find a way of anchoring it, and then you also have to anchor a ski surface, plants, trees. It starts to get complicated.\u201d The ski resort alone has ended up costing 92m Danish kroner (\u00a38m). The first day of skiing is more than a year late and it is only a two-day preview, with the slope now scheduled to be finished by May. The smoke ring mechanism has been put on hold, in part because Peter Madsen, the artist who helped design it, was sentenced to life in prison for murder. Christian Engels, the chief executive of Copenhill, as the ski facility is called, says he aims to provide a condensed version of a holiday in the Alps: \u201cThe full package, skiing, apres ski, everything, boiled down into a three- or four-hour experience.\u201d People living in the enormous apartment complex 150 metres away were given advance notice of the two-day opening, so they had a chance to snap up the half-price tickets.

The advertisement reads: \u201c5G without Huawei is like rugby without New Zealand\u201d, referring to the upcoming nationwide rollout of the mobile technology. National telco Spark has been temporarily banned from using Huawei equipment in the rollout after the New Zealand\u2019s spy agency the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) warned it would pose \u201csignificant national security risks\u201d. The advertisement, in newspapers owned by Stuff and the New Zealand Herald, also claims consumers may miss out on the latest technology and end up paying more. Numerous governments around the world have longstanding concerns about the company\u2019s relationship with China\u2019s security and intelligence services. Its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, is under house arrest in Canada, facing US charges of conspiring to violate sanctions on Iran. Countries that have raised concerns or issued bans on the use of Huawei 5G technology include the US, Australia, Japan, the UK, India, Germany and Italy. Andrew Little, the minister responsible for the GCSB, said the company was not banned from operating in New Zealand, and the matter was between Huawei and Spark. Spark was taking time to collate information and advice about the company, Little said, but added it would be the minister who had the final say. Huawei\u2019s advertising blitz is designed to appeal to the average New Zealander, experts say, by invoking the national sport \u2013 and religion \u2013 rugby. Huawei has repeatedly lobbied the government to explain why it has not been allowed to participate in the 5G rollout, but the advertisements represent a significant escalation in efforts at a time when relations between China and New Zealand appear strained. Andrew Bowater, Huawei New Zealand\u2019s deputy managing director, said the government had not been willing to engage in any dialogue, and the company deserved an explanation. \u201cThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by Huawei presented and we strongly reject the notion that our business threatens New Zealand in any way.

Here\u2019s what the AKC has to say about these fine animals:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People familiar with this group invariably comment on the distinctive terrier personality. These are feisty, energetic dogs whose sizes range from fairly small, as in the Norfolk, Cairn or West Highland White Terrier, to the grand Airedale Terrier. Terriers typically have little tolerance for other animals, including other dogs. Their ancestors were bred to hunt and kill vermin.

      "bodyText": "What a night! What drama! Yet in the end it was an unsurprising winner as the King becomes the 15th of his breed to be named America\u2019s top dog. He was shown by Gabriel Rangel, who is now a three-time best in show winner as a handler. That\u2019s one short of the all-time record of four shared by \u2026 Peter J Green, who made tonight\u2019s final decision. That\u2019s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check a full report of the night here. A bit of a tepid reaction from the crowd as this building was ready to explode if either Burns or Bean was named the winner. Instead it\u2019s King, who becomes the 15th Wire Fox Terrier to win the top prize. That\u2019s most of any breed \u2026 by far. The next closest is the Scottish Terrier with eight. Bono the Havanese wins Reserve Best in Show! And there\u2019s only one thing left to decide ... Green has made his decision and he\u2019s heading to the officials\u2019 table to notify them before letting the handlers and spectators know. First the Reserve Best in Show will be announced ... sort of a runner up. Then the big prize. \u201cThey all look beautiful,\u201d a microphone catches him saying. The dogs and their handlers step forward and Green is having a final look. The crowd is buzzing. They come alive as he moves in front of the Longhaired Dachshund. And he\u2019s going to send them around again, one by one: first the Bouvier Des Flandres, then the Boxer, then the Sussex Spaniel, then the Dachshund (big pop!), then the Wire Fox Terrier and finally the Havanese. Green continues down the line. The biggest crowd reaction is clearly for Bean the Sussex Spaniel and Burns the Longhaired Dachshund, who can break a centuries-spanning hoodoo if he wins. No Dachshund of any variety has ever won Best in Show. The final assessment begins. First to make the circuit is Baby Lars the Bouvier Des Flandres, followed by Wilma the Boxer and the others. Finally, the public-address announcer reveals the conflict of interest and that Colton the Schipperke \u2013 but only after he\u2019s given his lap of honor. The lights go down, the crowd swells and seven group winners are announced into the arena one by one. The biggest crowd reaction is for Bean the Sussex Spaniel, who enters third and struts onto the Madison Square Garden floor to cascades of applause from the upper reaches of the arena. Burns the Longhaired Dachshund is right behind him, though. Indeed, Colton the Schipperke is introduced seventh despite being ineligible for Best in Show (even though no one in the crowd has been made aware unless they\u2019ve been checking the news on their phones). I guess they\u2019re letting him trot. Nearly 2,800 dogs from 203 breeds and varieties and 50 different states and 14 foreign countries came to New York with a dream, but only one will come away with the title of Best in Show. The moment of truth is here as Green steps forward to inspect the septet. The judge tasked with conferring Best in Show honors to one of these magnificent six dogs is Mr Peter J Green of Bowmansville, Pennsylvania. A native of Wales with more than 60 years of experience as an owner, breeder and professional handler, Green will make the final decision (though his unclear role in Colton\u2019s abrupt ineligibility will no doubt be a talking point in tonight\u2019s aftermath). Green, who emigrated to the US permanently in 1963, is regarded by many as the most accomplished dog handler in the sport today. He\u2019s helmed a record-tying four Best in Show winners at Westminster (1968, 1977, 1994, and 1998) and another a Crufts (2005), making him one of only two handlers to steer a dog to the top prize at both prestigious events. He\u2019s also a nine-time winner at the vererable Montgomery County Kennel Club Terrier Show in Pennsylvania. He began his judging career after retiring from the ring in 2006. And with tonight\u2019s assignment Green will make even more history: he will become the first person ever to have handled and judged a Best in Show winner at Westminster and Crufts. How\u2019s that for a pub trivia trump card? King the Wire Fox Terrier wins the Terrier group and the final field of six for Best in Show is set. They are ... Burns the Longhaired Dachshund, winner of the Hound group Bono the Havanese, winner of the Toy group Baby Lars the Bouvier Des Flandres, winner of the Herding group Bean the Sussex Spaniel, winner of the Sporting group Wilma the Boxer, winner of the Working group King the Wire Fox Terrier, winner of the Terrier group Oddly enough, there\u2019s a placard for the Schipperke on the floor. They\u2019ve made no public announcement of Colton\u2019s disqualification. Will be interesting to see how this is handled. And King wins the Terrier group, continuing the breed\u2019s longtime supremacy at Westminster! Ms Christine Erickson will judge the Terrier group. She\u2019s handpicked a large group with lots of variety and quality including the Wire Fox, Jack Russell, American Staffordshire, Scottie, Wheaton, Skye and a few others I can\u2019t quite spot from press row. They circle the ring once \u2026 and again \u2026 Great work by Amy B Wang of the Washington Post in tracking down a Facebook post from Colton\u2019s handler, shedding light on his disqualification. Read the entire thing here. Meanwhile, the Terrier group is finished and we\u2019ll have a winner shortly. A hearty reception for Carmen the Scottish Terrier. This breed, aside from being the most popular US presidential pet, is the second most decorated breed in Westminster\u2019s 142-year annals with eight Best in Shows. An even bigger reaction moments later for Crawford, a beautiful Soft Coated Wheaton Terrier. Big pop for Isaac the Norwich Terrier. Probably the biggest reaction of this group from the crowd, whose energy has seemed to dip over the last half hour. So many good girls and good boys in this group! The Wire Fox Terrier, Glen of Imaal Terrier, Irish Terrier and Kerry Blue Terrier take us into a commercial break. One last run after we return, after which we\u2019ll have our Terrier group winner ... and our completed field of six for Best in Show. After a few more here\u2019s the Debit the Smooth Fox Terrier. Herbert Hoover owned two of them. The breed has won Best in Show four times but none since 1910. And it\u2019s a bit deceiving considering the same Smooth Fox \u2013 Ch Warren Remedy \u2013 accounts for three of them. In fact, that lovely canine remains the only dog to win Best in Show three times at Westminster. We\u2019re breezing through the Terriers now: Bedlington Terrier, Border Terrier, Colored Bull Terrier, White Bull Terrier and Cairn Terrier. You might remember the latter from The Wizard of Oz. We\u2019re off and running in the final group. It\u2019s the Airedale Terrier, the American Hairless Terrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, then a gorgeous Australian Terrier named Bacon, who won the highly competitive Montgomery County Kennel Club Terrier Show in Pennsylvania. Now it\u2019s the Terrier group, the group that\u2019s produced the most Best in Show winners in Westminster history by quite a bit. Ms Christine Erickson (Mesa, Arizona) will judge. Here\u2019s what the AKC has to say about these fine animals: People familiar with this group invariably comment on the distinctive terrier personality. These are feisty, energetic dogs whose sizes range from fairly small, as in the Norfolk, Cairn or West Highland White Terrier, to the grand Airedale Terrier. Terriers typically have little tolerance for other animals, including other dogs. Their ancestors were bred to hunt and kill vermin. Many continue to project the attitude that they\u2019re always eager for a spirited argument. Most terriers have wiry coats that require special grooming known as stripping in order to maintain a characteristic appearance. In general, they make engaging pets, but require owners with the determination to match their dogs\u2019 lively characters. So here\u2019s where things stand. Five of the six dogs who will compete for Best in Show have been chosen. Burns the Longhaired Dachshund, winner of the Hound group Bono the Havanese, winner of the Toy group Baby Lars the Bouvier Des Flandres, winner of the Herding group Bean the Sussex Spaniel, winner of the Sporting group Wilma the Boxer, winner of the Working group All that remains to fill out the field of six is the winner of the Terrier group, which is coming up next. This guy is sitting in the front row, dead center. I have so many questions. And the Boxer bitch takes it! Wilma wins the Working group. She\u2019s won 57 Best in Shows in her career, but none would be bigger than tonight. It\u2019s the third time the breed has won the group in the last four years. Says handler Michael Shepherd: \u201cIt\u2019s the stuff you dream of.\u201d And now Mr James Moses will judge. He\u2019s picked out the Akita, the Cane Corso, the Pyrenees, the Rottweiler, the Siberian Husky, the Portuguese Water Dog \u2026 a few others. Oh boy. The tension is high! Swells of applause from the crowd for Aristo the St Bernard, a New Jersey dog with hometown support. One to keep an eye on. Nick the Siberian Husky, the top-ranked in his breed, also prompts a big reaction. After Bolt the Standard Schnauzer and Joanah the English Setter, it\u2019s going to be in the hands of the judge .... After Peyton the Great Pyrenees and Beatrice the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, it\u2019s Addison the Komondor! This mop-looking dog, an ancient breed regarded as the king of the Hungarian livestock guardians, is always a crowd favorite and tonight is no exception. Moments later it\u2019s another lusty roar for Maximus, the Neapolitan Mastiff who tips the scales at 165lbs and whose favorite snack is filet mignon. He\u2019s perfectly named and certainly one to watch ... Another commercial break as we pause at the halfway point of the Working group. And it seems the Westminster Kennel Club has released an official statement addressing Colton\u2019s disqualification. After the Black Russian Terrier and Boerboel ... it\u2019s Wilma the Boxer from Aubrey, Texas! She takes the arena to hearty cheers. The breed has done quite well at Westminster in recent years, most recently when a beauty named Devlin won the group in 2017 and finished second one year earlier. First it\u2019s Nick the Akita, who is retiring today as the winningest Akita in history. He\u2019s followed by the Alaskan Malamute and Anatolian Shepherd Dog. Then a swell of applause for the Damon the Bernese Mountain Dog! What a good boy! Now it\u2019s the Working group. They will be judged by Mr James Moses (Wentzville, Missouri). Here\u2019s what the American Kennel Club has to say about these fine, fine canines: Dogs of the Working group were bred to perform such jobs as guarding property, pulling sleds and performing water rescues. They have been invaluable assets to man throughout the ages. The Doberman Pinscher, Siberian Husky and Great Dane are included in this group, to name just a few. Quick to learn, these intelligent, capable animals make solid companions. Their considerable dimensions and strength alone, however, make many working dogs unsuitable as pets for average families. And again, by virtue of their size alone, these dogs must be properly trained. So here\u2019s where things stand. Four of the six dogs who will compete for Best in Show have been determined. Let it be said: the Killer B\u2019s are on the swarm! Burns the Longhaired Dachshund, winner of the Hound group Bono the Havanese, winner of the Toy group Baby Lars the Bouvier Des Flandres, winner of the Herding group Bean the Sussex Spaniel, winner of the Sporting group All that remains to fill out that field are the winners of the Working group and the Terrier group. If you\u2019re joining us late and wondering what happened to Colton the Schipperke, last night\u2019s winner of the Non-Sporting group, he was ruled ineligible shortly before tonight\u2019s group judging due to an ownership conflict. Scandal! Bean the Sussex Spaniel wins the Sporting group for the second year in a row! The crowd goes wild! We have our first winner of the night and handler Per Ingar Rismyhr couldn\u2019t be more thrilled. Mr Douglas Johnson is narrowing the field. I\u2019m seeing the English Setter, the Irish Setter, the American Water Spaniel, the Springer Spaniel, the Black Cocker Spaniel and the Sussex, who is clearly the crowd favorite. After the Spinone Italiano, it\u2019s the Vizsla. This particular Vizsla is apparently part-owned by Gary Dell\u2019Abate (a/k/a Baba Booey) of Howard Stern Show fame. And after the Weimaraner, Wirehaired Pointing Griffon and Wirehaired Vizsla ... we\u2019re down to crunch time. Spaniel run! The Clumber, Black Cocker, Ascob Cocker, Parti-Color Cocker, English Cocker, English Springer, Field, Irish Water, Sussex and Water Springer. Spaniels have historically enjoyed great success at Westminster ever since a Parti-Color called Ch Midkiff Miracle Man won the group in the first year it was judged in 1924. Big cheers for the seven-year-old Sussex Spaniel named Bean, who won the Sporting group last year and is looking to repeat ... and perhaps go one step further to Best in Show. Notably, English Springer Spaniels have won the group 15 times, most recently in 2015. We\u2019re back from a commercial break midway through the Sporting group. Next up is the American Water Spaniel, one of the few original American breeds and a versatile hunting dog, not to mention the official state dog of Wisconsin. Now the Setters: English, Gordon, Irish and Irish Red &amp; White, all of whom get warm receptions. The Irish Setter holds the competition record for most group placements (55) and most consecutive group placements (12, from 1933-44). Interestingly, however, an Irish Setter has never won Best in Show in 142 previous years. Fun fact: famous English setter owners include Clark Gable, Brigitte Bardot and Annie Oakley. No official word on tonight\u2019s attendance but the entire lower bowl and most of the upper tiers looks appear nearly full, creating a terrific atmosphere for these fine, fine animals. Biggest pop of the night so far is for the Golden Retriever. Goldens are the third most popular breed in the United States according to AKC registration. Alas, despite their popularity, a Golden Retriever has never won Westminster. Next up is a trio of retrievers: the Chesapeake Bay, the Curly-Coated and the Flat-Coated. None of the three have ever been named Best in Show despite having been entered in the competition since 1877, 1926 and 1926, respectively (though a Flat-Coated Retriever did make the Best in Show finals once in 2001). The first five to show are the Brittany, Lagotti Romagnoli, Pointer and German Shorthaired Pointer and German Wirehaired Pointer. The German Shorthaired Pointer has been entered in the competition since 1935, three times winning Best in Show (in 1974, 2005 and 2016). Strike the above! Colton the Schipperke has been ruled ineligible due to an ownership conflict with Peter Green, the Best in Show judge. This is not entriely unusual in the dog show world, though it\u2019s rare at this level. It doesn\u2019t take away from Colton\u2019s Best of Breed or Best of Group win, but he won\u2019t be advancing to the final round tonight. That means only six dogs will be competing for Best in Show later tonight rather than the usual seven. First up tonight is the Sporting group. They will be judged by Mr Douglas Johnson of Bloomington, Indiana. This group has produced a total of 20 Best in Show winners through the years \u2013 second only to the Terrier group (46) \u2013 most recently the German shorthand pointer named CJ in 2016. Here\u2019s what the American Kennel Club has to say about the Sporting Group: Naturally active and alert, Sporting dogs make likeable, well-rounded companions. Members of the group include pointers, retrievers, setters and spaniels. Remarkable for their instincts in water and woods, many of these breeds actively continue to participate in hunting and other field activities. Potential owners of Sporting dogs need to realize that most require regular, invigorating exercise. There\u2019s already a bit of history in the offing tonight. Specifically, none of the four breeds that have advanced to the final seven have ever won Best in Show. Dachshunds, for all their popularity, have yet to bring home the top prize in the 142 years they\u2019ve entered. Burns, the winningest longhaired dachshund in history, is only the second of his breed to even win the Hound group. The other? His great-grandfather Ben in 1998. Schipperkes have been entered since 1891, but Colton\u2019s surprise win on Monday marked the first time the small Belgian breed has ever won the group and reached the final round. The Bouvier des Flandres has done slightly better with three appearances in the final septet, most recently in 2007. And no Havanese has ever won, though the national dog of Cuba didn\u2019t first enter until 2000. Four of the seven group winners who will compete for the title of Best in Show were decided on Monday night. The remaining three groups (Sporting, Working and Terrier) will be judged tonight in advance of the final round. Burns the Longhaired Dachshund won the Hound group ... ... Bono the Havanese won the Toy group ... ... Colton the Schipperke won the Non-Sporting group ... ... and Baby Lars the Bouvier Des Flandres won the Herding group. Hello and welcome to New York for the final night of Westminster! We\u2019re ringside at Madison Square Garden for the 143rd edition of the nation\u2019s most prestigious dog show, the oldest continuously held sporting event in the United States after the Kentucky Derby, and there\u2019s an unmistakable electricity in the air as the title of America\u2019s top dog will be chosen from the nearly 2,800 canines from 203 different breeds and varieties hailing from all 50 states and 14 other countries, including Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Canada and Japan. Tonight one will emerge from the pack. Last year it was Flynn, the Bichon Frise. Who will bring home the hardware in 2019? Bryan will be here shortly. While you wait, here\u2019s his story on the Hotel Pennsylvania, the 100-year-old landmark across the street from Madison Square Garden which becomes a veritable hotel for dogs during Westminster week.",

      "bodyText": "A media adviser for the then-justice minister, Michael Keenan, worked together with David de Garis to leak news of impending police raids on the Australian Workers Union, a court has heard. The admission from De Garis on Wednesday draws a second government minister\u2019s office into the controversy \u2013 which prompted the AWU\u2019s decision to challenge the union regulator in the courts. De Garis, then-employment minister Michaelia Cash\u2019s former media adviser, told the federal court on Wednesday he told Michael Tetlow, a staffer in Keenan\u2019s office, about the impending raids on the union\u2019s Melbourne and Sydney offices in October 2017. He was also asked if he informed Cash about his decision to tell the media about the raids. De Garis said he couldn\u2019t remember: \u201cI\u2019d probably remember [if I did], I imagine it\u2019s no, but, not that I recall.\u201d Under questioning from the AWU\u2019s barrister, Herman Borenstein QC, De Garis revealed he worked with Tetlow to spread news of impending police raids to the media. \u201cWe organised to disseminate this information to the media together,\u201d he said, adding \u201camong ourselves\u201d. De Garis said he had called print journalists from the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and Fairfax while Tetlow called television media. Asked why he had chosen to inform Tetlow, De Garis replied that the raids were being conducted by federal police, which sat within the justice minister\u2019s portfolio. \u201cHe seemed the appropriate person to speak to,\u201d he said. TV and print photographers were present when federal police raided the union\u2019s offices about 4pm on 23 October 2017, to seize documents requested by the union regulator, the Registered Organisations Commission (the Roc). The AWU has brought the case in order to strike out the investigation into donations made to GetUp! dating back to 2006, arguing the probe was politically motivated. Bill Shorten was the union\u2019s leader at the time. Earlier on Wednesday, De Garis said it was likely the potential damage to Bill Shorten \u201cwould have been at least part of my thinking\u201d when he leaked news of impending police raids on the AWU\u2019s offices. Borenstein suggested to De Garis that damaging Shorten\u2019s reputation would have been a consideration given his role as a political staffer. De Garis replied: \u201cPerhaps. It would have been at least part of my thinking, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Borenstein tendered email, text messages and call logs from De Garis\u2019 work laptop and mobile phone that were acquired as part of a federal police investigation and subpoenaed by the AWU. De Garis conceded he had deleted three text messages he had exchanged with Tetlow about the leaks. He did so before his work phone was collected by parliamentary staff upon his resignation, the court heard. \u201cCan I suggest to you that item 20 is a message from Tetlow saying warrants are underway and your response is to thank him,\u201d Borenstein said, referring to an exchange between the two. De Garis said deleting the messages \u201cprobably wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do\u201d. On Tuesday, De Garis revealed he learned of the raids from Cash\u2019s former chief of staff Ben Davies. Asked on Wednesday whether Davies would have expected him to leak the information to the media, De Garis said \u201che might have assumed I would\u201d but \u201che certainly didn\u2019t expect me to\u201d. \u201cBut there might have been an inference that I would but \u2026 not an expectation,\u201d De Garis said. After Cash was forced to correct evidence she provided to a Senate estimates hearing in the wake of the raids, Cash said that \u201cone staffer\u201d was involved, referring to De Garis, who immediately resigned his post. Davies is set to give evidence on Thursday and Cash will appear the following day. The Roc\u2019s then acting media adviser Mark Lee and senior Roc official Chris Enright are also scheduled to be called by the AWU. Keenan has previously said federal police informed his office \u201cof the intention to execute search warrants immediately prior to them being executed, as is usual practice\u201d. In February last year, Keenan\u2019s office told BuzzFeed News: \u201cNeither the minister or anyone in his office informed media outlets prior to the execution of search warrants.\u201d During Question Time on Wednesday, Keenan told the House he stood by this statement. In the Senate, Cash was also asked about De Garis\u2019 evidence, but declined to respond, citing the ongoing court proceedings. The case continues.",

Eyewitnesses told the outlet multiple shots were fired during the assault.

      "bodyText": "Rapper Rich the Kid and his entourage were reportedly the victims of a robbery outside of a Los Angeles recording studio. The musician, whose legal name is Dmitri Roger, and his entourage were attacked on Tuesday near the Westlake Recording Studio in West Hollywood. The news was first reported by website TMZ. Eyewitnesses told the outlet multiple shots were fired during the assault. Footage showed the rapper talking to paramedics at the scene following the attack, KABC added. A spokeswoman for the LA county sheriff\u2019s department confirmed there was an incident at the 7200 block of Santa Monica Boulevard, where the studio is located, but couldn\u2019t confirm the involvement of the rapper. The spokeswoman added she was not aware of any injuries and not aware of anyone being transported to the hospital. The West Hollywood sheriff station later confirmed a robbery occurred on the block and said the victims were treated at the scene for minor injuries. \u201cWhen deputies arrived at the location they found three male black assault victims,\u201d the station said in a statement. The victims stated \u201cthree male black suspects confronted them in the alley behind a business and demanded their money and jewelry. The victims were then physically assaulted by the suspects.\u201d \u201cAs the suspects drove away, a shooting occurred by an unknown male suspect\u201d, the statement continued. \u201cThe shooting suspect has not been located or identified.\u201d Westlake Recording Studio did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Rich the Kid said: \u201cRich is OK.\u201d The spokesperson declined to add further details. Earlier on Tuesday, Rich the Kid posted for an Instagram photo holding what appeared to be several stacks of cash. This is a developing story. Check back later for updates.",

      "bodyText": "With the medical evacuations bill now cleared by the Senate, and with politicians coming off the long run with all kinds of misleading claims about what this package does, let\u2019s spell out some basic facts. How do the medical evacuation procedures work? The new legislation sets out the conditions by which sick people on Nauru and Manus Island can be transferred to Australia for medical treatment. In the event there is medical advice from two or more treating doctors that a person needs to be evacuated, the home affairs minister has grounds for refusal. What discretion does the responsible minister have? Ministerial discretion applies in three areas. First, the minister can refuse the transfer if he or she disagrees with the clinical assessment. The second grounds for refusal is if the minister reasonably suspects that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security \u201cwithin the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d. Sticking with security, the transfer can also be knocked back if Asio advises the minister that transfer of the person to Australia may be prejudicial to security \u201cand that threat cannot be mitigated\u201d. The third grounds for refusal is if the minister knows that the transferee has a substantial criminal record (I\u2019ll give you some definitions on that in a minute) and the minister reasonably believes the person would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct. The decision needs to be made within 72 hours. If the minister denies the transfer request on health grounds (as opposed to security or criminal grounds), then the issue goes to an Independent Health Advice Panel \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. The panel then conducts a second assessment and reports within 72 hours. If the panel reports the person should be transferred on health grounds, and the other vetoes I\u2019ve mentioned are not in force, then the view of the panel prevails. What is a substantial criminal record for the purposes of this legislation? There has been lots of talk since the political temperature has started to rise around this issue about rapists, paedophiles and murderers coming to Australia for medical treatment \u2013 courtesy of this law. To define a substantial criminal record, the bill references section 501(7) of the Migration Act. That definition says a substantial criminal record applies for the purposes of a character test if the person has been sentenced to death; life imprisonment; a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more; has been in prison for two or more terms where the total is 12 months or more; if the person has been acquitted of an offence on the grounds of unsoundness of mind or insanity, and as a result the person has been detained in a facility or institution; or the person has been found by a court to not be fit to plead in relation to an offence, and the court has nonetheless found that on the evidence available the person committed the offence, and as a result the person has been detained in a facility or institution. Who is on the independent medical panel? The panel will be made up of the commonwealth chief medical officer, the home affairs department\u2019s chief medical officer, and at least six others (a nominee of the president of the Australian Medical Association, of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, and an expert in paediatric health). They will not be paid for their service to avoid a constitutional problem with the bill. Who do these new procedures apply to? Despite what you might hear in the political debate, the answer to this is simple. The new procedures only apply to the cohort of asylum seekers currently on Nauru and Manus Island, not to any new boat arrivals. The legislation says a person is \u201ca relevant transitory person if the person is in a regional processing country on the day this section commences\u201d. Will people be out of detention once they arrive in Australia for medical treatment? No. The legislation says any transitory person who is brought to Australia for a temporary purpose must be kept in immigration detention while in Australia. \u201cThat immigration detention must continue until the time of removal from Australia or until the minister determines that immigration detention is no longer required.\u201d To put that simply, anyone transferred to Australia for treatment will remain in detention unless the minister decides otherwise. Do the new medical evacuation procedures destroy the border protection regime? People will make all sorts of contentions about this point, but the facts don\u2019t point to that conclusion. The architecture of offshore detention remains in place. Boat turn backs remain in place. The new legislation has one job. It codifies the means by which people can be medically transferred to Australia, and makes clinicians more central in decisions about duty of care than they are currently. The government has already transferred a number of people to Australia for medical treatment, often after contested court proceedings. Doctors have more influence in this system than under the status quo, but we are not inventing the wheel here. Will the people smugglers view the change in Australia as a green light to restart operations? That\u2019s entirely possible \u2013 particularly given some of the misleading claims flying around in the public debate at the moment and being amplified on social media and in some news outlets. Given those febrile, hyperbolic conditions, it is entirely possible that the change in Australian law will be used in marketing by people smugglers. The home affairs department is clearly very concerned about the impact of the changes according to a ministerial brief that was released by the Morrison government over the weekend. But the departmental language on the specific point of whether people smugglers would be activated or not was nuanced. What does the advice from the home affairs department say about whether people smugglers would be activated or not? This is their advice. \u201cPeople smugglers pay particular attention to perceived or actual changes in Australia\u2019s policy. Although people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in Potential Illegal Immigrant (PII) intent \u2013 not smuggler marketing,\u201d home affairs officials said. \u201cPIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention.

      "bodyText": "Large parts of New South Wales and the ACT have been blanketed in dust after a cool change blew clouds of fine particles over eastern Australia, causing a sharp drop in air quality. As government scientists in NSW confirmed December and January as the state\u2019s dustiest ever, millions of people woke on Wednesday to find a reddish hue in the morning sky and cars coated in dust. The dust cloud stretched 1,500km from western NSW to the ocean, reaching Canberra on Tuesday afternoon and pushing over Sydney and a large area of eastern NSW overnight. NSW health authorities issued air quality warnings for the Illawarra, upper Hunter, south-west Sydney, north-west Sydney and the south-west slopes advising people, especially those with heart and lung conditions, to stay inside as much as possible. The air quality index in south-west Sydney was listed as very poor with levels of PM10 particles between 150-199, and hazardous in the Illawarra and and south-west slopes with PM10 levels of over 200 \u2013 the same as parts of Delhi, one of the world\u2019s most polluted cities. PM10 particles are those less than 10 micrometers in diameter, which are small enough to enter into the lungs and can cause serious health problems including asthma and heart and lung problems. However, a southerly wind was expected to blow the dust away from the Sydney and coastal area on Wednesday. The dust storm followed another hot day across eastern Australia on Tuesday with temperatures reaching the mid-30s in Sydney and coastal areas and into the low 40s in some parts further inland. Dust storms are caused when strong winds lift loose earth and sand from arid landscapes and deposit them high in the atmosphere. The dust is then caught up in cold fronts and dumped back on the land. A spokesperson for the NSW office of environment and heritage said December and January had been the dustiest on record. December had 23 hours of dust, which is defined as visibility less than 10km, while January had an average of 38 hours of dust across its 21 stations in western NSW.

Scott Morrison confirmed on Wednesday he was \u201cworking with Bob Katter \u2026 on the reconstruction of the cattle industry in northern Australia\u201d as the independent MP laid out an ambitious series of demands including to abolish two key financial regulators and reduce debt for cattle farmers. Katter is one of the key crossbench votes Labor needs to recall parliament for two extra sitting weeks in March to discuss banking reforms. But Katter has a $200m commitment for water infrastructure from the Morrison government which could be at risk if he joins the insurrection. The threat to the government receded on Wednesday when Andrew Wilkie \u2013 who had previously supported an extension of parliament \u2013 said that \u201cso few\u201d extra sitting days would \u201cnot allow time to properly prepare, scrutinise and debate the necessary bills in both houses of parliament\u201d. Wilkie told Guardian Australia the change of heart came after a treasury briefing and seeing the Law Council\u2019s view. It wants banking reforms referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission rather than rushed through in extra sitting weeks. \u201cI\u2019m sceptical that adding six days to the parliamentary sitting calendar would achieve any meaningful progress on legislating the bank royal commission recommendations,\u201d Wilkie said. Earlier, Katter told Sky News he is negotiating with the prime minister and had told him he would find it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to allow parliament to conclude without achieving reform on banking issues. Katter said he was formulating a package alongside Nationals MP George Christensen, with the involvement of the government backbencher possibly making the plan easier for the prime minister to accept. \u201cWe want some substantial action and I if I don\u2019t get that I will find it very difficult to see how I wouldn\u2019t give an extension of time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say the same to the ALP \u2013 I\u2019ll only give you an extension of time if I get a couple of things that I believe will never come out [otherwise].\u201d Katter complained that a number of banking issues had remained unaddressed by the royal commission, including that banks can \u201cforeclose on you any time they like\u201d and there had been a lack of \u201ccompensation and retribution\u201d for victims despite four senior departures at AMP and NAB. Katter said the two \u201clapdog\u201d regulators \u2013 the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority \u2013 \u201cneed to go\u201d. Katter\u2019s central proposal is for a cattle reconstruction board which would allow the government to borrow at 2.4% interest and provide low-interest loans to cattle farmers. \u201cI don\u2019t think any government should loan it out and let the banks get the benefit \u2026 You take the bank debt, we will take it off you at a 30% discount.\u201d Katter said the proposal is \u201cat the very heart of banking reform\u201d because banks raise interest rates on struggling industries but governments should \u201cuse banking to put the interest rate down when you\u2019re in trouble\u201d. Asked if this constituted a government bank, Katter responded \u201cI suppose you could say that\u201d but he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make it difficult for the free marketeers in the Liberal party and the Labor party to swallow it\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For the editors of the West Australian, the government\u2019s defeat over the medical evacuations bill was nothing short of catastrophic. The historic vote was illustrated on the front page of the Kerry Stokes-owned paper with a cartoon countdown to the first \u201cillegal boat arrival\u201d \u2013 and an unflattering photo of Bill Shorten finger pointing. The Stokes organ ran with the line pushed by the prime minister who said Labor had opened the floodgates for the return of the boats and the weakening of border protection. \u201cHow many illegal boats will arrive before the election?\u201d the West Australian asked in what was perhaps the most hysterical of the front pages on Wednesday. \u201cPM\u2019s historic loss on border protection sets up same old election battle.\u201d The story also dominated the Rupert Murdoch-owned papers around the country, with every masthead savaging Labor for the historic defeat. Perhaps surprisingly, the return of Hakeem al-Araibi to Melbourne airport on Tuesday, 77 days after he was arrested in Thailand, didn\u2019t make the front pages. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s headlined screamed \u201cGrin reapers\u201d and was accompanied by a photograph of Wentworth MP Kerryn Phelps smiling and embracing fellow crossbenchers Julia Banks and Rebekha Sharkie. \u201cKerryn Phelps was all smiles after consigning the Morrison government to a historic loss on the floor of the House of Representatives with Labor\u2019s full backing,\u201d the front-page story said. The Herald Sun was the most sedate of the Murdoch papers, running a small story on the bottom left-hand side of the tabloid front page saying: \u201cPM slaps Shorten over loss\u201d with no photograph. The Underbelly-style story of drug lord Tony Mokbel being bashed in jail was too good a Melbourne yarn to move aside for politics. Mokbel wearing a bad wig was the featured photograph. The Nine-owned papers ran with the government\u2019s historic loss, but stayed away from the scare tactics of suggesting a flotilla of boats was on the horizon. The Canberra Times went with a down-page headline of \u201cPM\u2019s historic defeat\u201d, the Sydney Morning Herald said \u201cHistoric loss for PM\u201d with the same celebratory photograph of the three crossbenchers used by the Telegraph, and the Melbourne Age said \u201cPM suffers historic defeat over refugees\u201d. The Australian Financial Review added a flavour of the fierce political battle in parliament with the headline \u201cScoMo toughs out historic loss\u201d over photographs of the two leaders in the house.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for me tonight. Here\u2019s what happened this afternoon: California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, took on Trump in his first State of the State address, discussing his decision to pull troops from the border and promising to push for progressive policies. He also shared that he is limiting the scope of the high-speed rail, and no longer pursuing his predecessor\u2019s plan to build a line from Los Angeles to San Francisco. The Senate overwhelmingly approved a new public lands package that protects millions of acres of wilderness, expands national monuments, and secures funding for the Land and Water Conservation fund, which reinvests revenue from offshore drilling into conservation. Trump is expected to sign a bipartisan agreement to ensure the government doesn\u2019t shut down again. It provides only $1.375bn for border security rather than the $5.7bn he\u2019s been fighting for. In an unexplained tweet, the president countered that he would be getting $23 billion from other sources. The Minnesota senator and 2020 presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar went on Fox News tonight to talk about her campaign and address reports that she was abusive to her staff. She also announced that she\u2019s raised $1m from supporters online in the two days since her official announcement. Thanks for reading! See you tomorrow. Klobuchar is also on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d with Bret Baier this evening, and is the first of the Democratic presidential hopefuls to appear on the network. Known as a moderate, she described the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d as aspirational and described herself as \u201ca Democrat and not a socialist\u201d. She also pushed back against Huffpost\u2019s reporting, which alleged that Senator Harry Reid asked her to change her behavior toward staff. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, who officially announced her bid for the presidency over the weekend, that donors have pledged $1 million online in just two days. Her announcement came amidst allegations of abuse from former staffers, who spoke anonymously to Huffpost. Republican Senator Rand Paul pulled away from his party today, voting against moving William Barr\u2019s Attorney General nomination forward. Senator Paul just released his statement on the vote, citing concerns on Barr\u2019s record. Here\u2019s his statement in full: I am unable to support Bill Barr\u2019s nomination to be the next Attorney General. While I support President Trump and have supported most of his nominees, I have too many concerns about the record and views of this nominee. Bill Barr was a leading proponent of warrantless surveillance, and his overall record on the Fourth Amendment is troubling to me. I remain concerned that Bill Barr does not agree with our bipartisan efforts to reform our criminal justice system. Finally, Bill Barr has a troubling record on the Second Amendment. For these reasons, I voted today against his nomination for Attorney General\u201d. President Trump, who earlier today expressed dissatisfaction with a bipartisan border security deal that would give him just $1.375 billion for 55 new miles of fencing along the southern border, tweeted this afternoon that his plan will \u201cbe hooked up with lots of money from other sources\u201d. The White House has not yet clarified what this means or where that money would come from, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters earlier today that Trump would still need Congressional approval for investing funds from other budgets toward the wall. Tonight Starbucks CEO Howard Shultz will appear on CNN for the network\u2019s second town hall on the 2020 presidential race ahead of several high-profile democrats \u2014 even though he hasn\u2019t yet declared if he is running. Democrats are expressing concerns, Huffpost reports, that this is a bad sign for how the media will cover their party\u2019s campaigns and that history will repeat itself. Per HuffPost: The Schultz rollout has been an epic train wreck from a messaging and execution standpoint, and that has to be part of the appeal to the show\u2019s producers,\u2019 said a Democratic adviser to one of the 2020 candidates. \u2018If 2016 showed us anything, it\u2019s that the camera follows controversy\u2019. \u2018As someone who was on Hillary\u2019s campaign in 2016, it really feels like major media didn\u2019t learn their lesson,\u2019 a different senior 2020 campaign staffer said. \u2018Just because someone says something loud doesn\u2019t mean you have to pay attention to them\u2019\u201d. Today the Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation protecting millions of acres of public lands and reinforcing the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The sweeping public lands package aims to protect 1.3 million acres of wilderness, condenses the areas where mining is allowed, and secures funding for the LWCF, a popular program hampered during the government shutdown that reinvests revenue from offshore drilling into conservation efforts. The bipartisan Natural Resources Management Act passed 92-8, showing that \u201cthere are bipartisan spirits alive in the United States Senate to support access for hunting, fishing and recreating to our public lands\u201d Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington who co-introduced the bill said in a press conference. William Barr has gotten one step closer to becoming attorney general, clearing a procedural vote in the Senate that will advance his nomination, Reuters reports. It\u2019s expected that he will be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate this week despite concerns from Democrats. This is Gabrielle Canon taking over for Ben Jacobs. Earlier today, newly inaugurated California governor Gavin Newsom gave his first State of the State address, promising to take on the Trump Administration and enact progressive policies championed by his constituents. Saying the President\u2019s state of the union was \u201cfundamentally at odds with California values\u201d, Newsom began his speech responding to what he called the \u201cso called border emergency\u201d and spoke about the actions he took Tuesday to pull troops from the Southern border, a move that deviated from his predecessor Jerry Brown who had adhered to Trump\u2019s requests for troops. \u201cCalifornia will not be part of this political theater\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer to the White House, with all do respect, is no more division no more xenophobia. No more nativism.\u201d The new governor also raised eyebrows by announcing he will pump the breaks on completing the high-speed rail project, saying that construction from Los Angeles to San Francisco would be too costly and would take too long. Instead, new plans for the railway would only go through California\u2019s agricultural region in the Central Valley. He outlined his outlook on water issues in the state, called out problems with the education system, and spoke about the homelessness crisis, announcing the a new commission on homelessness. He shared plans for a new incentive package to address affordability in the state, pushed cities to meet housing goals, and told legislators that he would sign a rent stability package if proposed. \u201cIf we want a California for all, we have to build housing for all\u201d, he said, adding \u201cwe cannot defer this anymore\u201d over applause. He also shared his plan to help seniors in a \u201cnew master plan on aging\u201d that includes a task force on Alzheimer\u2019s headed by former first lady Maria Shriver, and said he wanted to create a \u201cdata dividend\u201d that would redistribute the wealth made by tech companies. Negotiators in both parties have reached a deal to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown before the Friday deadline. President Donald Trump though is still skeptical about this. Mark Kelly, an astronaut and husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, announced he will run for Senate in Arizona in 2020 as a Democrat. The seat is currently held by appointed Republican incumbent Martha McSally. The White House condemned an attack on a BBC cameraman at a Trump rally yesterday in El Paso. Sign up for our morning briefing for a new perspective on the US. We\u2019ll email you a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads. Subscribe now. The Senate just passed major conservation legislation. The Washington Post reports: The bill protects 1.3 million acres as wilderness, the nation\u2019s most stringent protection that prohibits even roads and motorized vehicles. It permanently withdraws from mining more than 370,000 acres of land around two national parks, including Yellowstone, and permanently authorizes a program to spend offshore drilling revenue on conservation efforts. A House vote on the border security deal to avoid another government shutdown could come as early as tomorrow according to Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. A number of Democrats will unveil legislation on Wednesday that will allow people between the ages of 50-64 to buy into Medicare. The idea of expanding Medicare has long been popular among Democrats. There were past proposals to allow people over 55 to buy in and, on the left, Medicare for All has become a rallying cry. The White House has issued a statement condemning the attack on the BBC cameraman at the Trump rally in El Paso last night. For the first time in American history, the national debt now exceeds $22 trillion. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the sponsor of the Green New Deal in the Senate, has condemned Mitch McConnell\u2019s pledge to bring the legislation up for a vote as sabotage. In an interview, New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker expresses doubt that Donald Trump will even be the Republican nominee in 2020, echoing comments made by Elizabeth Warren over the weekend. Norm Eisen, a former White House lawyer in the Obama administration and a vocal Trump critic, has joined the House Judiciary Committee as a part time staffer. Eisen will help beef up efforts by House Democrats to conduct oversight on the White House, particularly in relation to the Russia investigation. An entire federal agency is at the break of collapse. The Merit Systems Protection Board, a federal office that rules on personnel issues for federal employees, will enter a twilight zone at the end of the month. The board has three members who rule on appeals of decisions from administrative judges about a variety of issues relating to firing and suspending workers. However, none has been confirmed since Trump has taken office and the only remaining member whose term has yet to expire will depart at the end of February. As the Washington Post reports: At midnight on Feb. 28 . . . the board could enter uncertain legal territory. Justice Department attorneys have told Robbins that once he leaves, the office could be operating illegally. House and Senate lawmakers, scrambling to head off a crisis, have scheduled hearings for this week. CNN has opinion polling show both name id and net favorability for a number of 2020 presidential candidates and potential candidates among Democrats. For the most part, candidate favorability tracks with how many people have heard of the candidate. The one exception is Starbucks mogul Howard Schultz who is deeply unpopular. Cory Booker is holding a campaign event in a New Hampshire video arcade Sunday. This is Booker\u2019s second major video game event after playing Pacman with a Washington Post reporter in October. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he would bring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal to the Senate floor for a vote. This would force Democrats to take a position on the issue, including many 2020 presidential candidates to vote on a resolution that Republicans have panned as a \u201csocialist manifesto\u201d. The GOP believes it can exploit Democrats\u2019 vote on this issue as part of an effort to paint the entire party as radical, and too-far left. The resolution, which has been endorsed by several political aspirants, has next to no chance of passing the Senate. They also seek to drive a wedge among Democrats on the issue. The BBC reporter whose cameraman was assaulted last night at the Trump rally in El Paso has just filed his report on the event. Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, is at risk of seeing one of his biggest initiatives in office be overturned. Hogan, who has been mooted as potential primary opponent of Donald Trump, decreed that public schools in the Old Line State couldn\u2019t open until Labor Day. However, the Maryland general assembly is poised to overturn that through veto-proof legislation. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced today that the state would not move forward on a controversial and hugely expensive project to link San Francisco and Los Angeles via high speed rail. Mark Meadows, one of the leaders of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, doesn\u2019t think there will be another shutdown and that Trump will accept the deal from congressional negotiators. Iowa caucus season is truly underway. Albia, Iowa, a town of less than 4,000, will host a spaghetti dinner with three different presidential candidates on Sunday night. The White House Correspondents Association has issued a statement on the attack on a BBC cameraman at the Trump rally Monday night in El Paso. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced today that we would bring the Green New Deal proposed by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to a vote on the floor of the Senate. While the proposal has rapidly become orthodoxy among many Democrats, Republicans already see political opportunity in forcing swing state senators to pick between the left of the Democratic Party or swing voters who look askance of many of the more radical aspects of the policy. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has risen to the defense of her friend and Democratic colleague, Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, after the president called on Omar to \u201cresign from Congress\u201d over comments she made that were widely denounced as anti-semitic. Ocasio-Cortez pointed to a double-standard in the way Republicans have reacted to Omar and to the president, who has his own long history of making controversial and insensitive remarks. A joke in the HBO show Veep was inspired by an unsubstantiated rumor about senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s alleged poor treatment of her staff, according to Slate. A representative called the rumor \u201ccompletely false\u201d and said it was \u201cridiculous.\u201d Senator Susan Collins, a Republican who is up for re-election in 2020, defended her vote for controversial supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh after he dissented from a decision to put an abortion law on hold in Louisiana. \u201cI have always been concerned about preserving Roe v. Wade\u201d Collins told CNN recently. Collins, one of the few Republicans who supports abortion rights, said Kavanaugh assured her during the confirmation process that he would not overturn the landmark Supreme Court that legalized abortion access. \u201cTo say that this case, this most recent case, in which he wrote a very careful dissent, tells you that he\u2019s going to repeal Roe v Wade I think is absurd,\u201d she said. Democrats believe the Maine Republican is vulnerable after her vote for Kavanaugh, who was narrowly confirmed to the court after facing allegations of sexual misconduct. Yahoo is out with a new story building on a spate of stories that allege senator and now-presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar created a toxic work environment for staff in her Washington office. The story includes an explanation of why so many former staffers are afraid to go on the record with reporters. Speaking out could lead to retribution from Klobuchar, should she be able to identify them. She has been known to grow irate at staffers who find work elsewhere, calling their new employers to have the offers rescinded. The practice, which three former staffers for Klobuchar described and one other Capitol Hill veteran confirmed, was seen as vindictive, mystifying and counterproductive. It was also a sign of how far Klobuchar would go to punish those who she thought betrayed her. Klobuchar addressed the allegations after her campaign announcement in Minneapolis on Sunday. The three-term senator told reporters that she can \u201cbe tough\u201d and \u201cpush people\u201d but said she has staff who have worked for her for years and gone on to work in senior roles elsewhere in government. Trump told reporters he would \u201cadd whatever I have to add\u201d to the government funding agreement reached by Congress. But he can\u2019t actually do that. The taunting from right-wing commentators started with Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity last night and continues today. Trump reversed-course on government funding negotiations last year after conservatives like Ann Coulter attacked him over the deal. That decision triggered a 35-day shutdown, during which 800,000 federal employees and countless contractors went without pay. Trump puts on his \u201cbuilder\u201d hat in a tangent about how \u201cunattractive\u201d walls have given the barriers a bad rap. \u201cI never kid about construction. I love construction and I know how to do it for the right price,\u201d he said, promising to build a \u201cbeautiful-looking structure\u201d along the southern border. Mexican drug lord \u2018El Chapo\u2019 was found guilty: Trump addressing reporters in the Cabinet room has also called on freshman congresswoman Ilhan Omar to resign both from Congress and from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Omar apologized \u201cunequivocally\u201d for her comments on Twitter, which were widely condemned as \u201canti-semitic\u201d. Trump, who has longed faced charges of racism, sexism and anti-semitism and blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d after a deadly neo-Nazis rally in Virginia, said Omar\u2019s remarks are \u201cdeep-seeded, in her heart\u201d and said her apology was \u201clame\u201d and \u201cnot appropriate\u201d. More comments from the president: Crowd size has long been a preoccupation of the president. And Monday\u2019s rally in El Paso was no different. During the rally, Trump claimed that 69,000 people signed up to be here\u201d and that the local fire department was able to squeeze and extra 2,000 people into the area to hold \u201c10,000\u201d people in total. \u201cThere has never been anything like this in the history of our country,\u201d Trump said, thanking the fire department. The El Paso Fire Department, however, corrected the record. It said the facility held 6,500 people and that\u2019s how many were allowed in, according to the El Paso Times. Meanwhile, they estimated that the crowd size for a rally protesting the Trump administration\u2019s border policies \u2013 and featuring El Paso native and possible presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 drew between 10,000 and 15,000 people. Freezing rain prevented a congressional delegation from landing in Detroit, where headed to attend the memorial service for former congressman John Dingell. After being unable to land, the plane was routed back to Washington. But the weather didn\u2019t stop them from remembering Dingell. Embattled Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who is facing calls to resign after the revelation of racist images on his medical school yearbook page, announced on Tuesday that his administration restored the voting rights of 10,992 previously convicted felons. \u201cI believe in second chances,\u201d he said in a statement. One of the key sticking points in negotiations over border security was immigration detention. The deal, as drafted, is an attempt to rein in immigrant detention, which has greatly expanded under Trump. This explainer from Vox\u2019s Dara Lind is a must read. It\u2019s not just a partisan fight. It\u2019s an inter-branch fight over whether the deference that the executive branch generally gets on immigration extends to budgeting, or whether Congress\u2019 \u201cpower of the purse\u201d can force the administration to make decisions about who it really needs to detain. And while the detention deal is a new effort by Congress to rein in the executive branch, we won\u2019t know for several months whether it\u2019s worked. This is a grim count: The jury of one is still out: Mouners are gathering in Dearborn, Michigan, to pay their respects to former Michigan congressman John Dingell, who died on Thursday. He was 92. Dingell, remembered as a \u201cGiant of the House\u201d and the longest-serving member of Congress, served with 2,427 members of the House, or 22 percent of the House\u2019s total membership, 11 presidents, and 11 speakers of the House, according to the historian for the House of Representatives. After his retirement he became something of a celebrity on Twitter. A sampling of his wisecracks, as curated by BuzzFeed. NBC is reporting that the Senate Intelligence Committee have found \u201cno direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, according to both Democrats and Republicans on the committee.\u201d The Republican chair of the committee, Richard Burr, had said as much this weekend in an interview with CBS: \u201cIf we write a report based upon the facts that we have, then we don\u2019t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.\u201d He also said the investigation was nearing it\u2019s end: \u201cWe know we\u2019re getting to the bottom of the barrel because there\u2019re not new questions that we\u2019re searching for answers to.\u201d NBC is reporting that Democratic Senate investigators are not disputing Burr\u2019s characterizations, though they contend it lacks necessary context. \u201cWe were never going find a contract signed in blood saying, \u2018Hey Vlad, we\u2019re going to collude,\u201d one Democratic aide told NBC. New polling by the Washington Post-Schar School found that Americans view Robert Mueller as far more credible than Trump, but the public\u2019s view of the investigation is scattered. \u201c Fifty-six percent to 33 percent, more say they trust Mueller\u2019s version of the facts than Trump\u2019s. And by nearly as wide a margin, more believe Mueller is mainly interested in \u201cfinding out the truth\u201d than trying to \u201churt Trump politically,\u201d according to the Washington Post. \u201cStrong majorities of Democrats and Republicans say Mueller\u2019s report should be made public in its entirety, with 81 percent overall supporting its release.\u201d The GOP shared some new messaging as Donald Trump prepares for his re-election bid in 2020. The wording is conspicuously close to the same as Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign slogan in 2016: \u201cStronger Together\u201d. On Tuesday, Clinton clapped back. In a positive sign for the tentative agreement on government funding, senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he looks forward to \u201creviewing the full text as soon as possible and hope the Senate can act on this legislation in short order\u201d. \u201cI know I speak for members on both sides of the aisle when I say that we are grateful to our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their leadership and are eager to see them complete this work,\u201d he continued in remarks on the Senate floor this morning. \u201cAs we speak, our colleagues are working hard to produce full legislative text.\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called the agreement \u201cwelcome news\u201d and said the \u201cparameters of this are good.\u201d \u201cI urge President Trump to sign this agreement. We must not have a re-run of what happened a few months back,\u201d he said in remarks on the Senate floor. It\u2019s a time-honored tradition in presidential politics for a candidate to cop to smoking, snorting or inhaling an illegal substance in their youth. Bill Clinton famously admitted that he had \u201cexperimented\u201d with marijuana as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University but \u201cdidn\u2019t inhale.\u201d Years later, Barack Obama called back Clinton\u2019s remark and admitted he \u201cinhaled frequently\u201d. Even ultra-conservative Rick Santorum confessed to smoking weed but added that he was ashamed and the experience was \u201cnot all it\u2019s made up to be.\u201d Which brings us to 2020. On Monday, presidential contender Senator Kamala Harris, raised in Berkeley, California, admitted to smoking weed in an interview with The Breakfast Club. (The admission was part of a discussion about legalizing marijuana, which she said she supports, telling the hosts that of course she does: \u201cHalf my family is from Jamaica!\u201d) When Charlamagne Tha God asks if she has ever smoked, she replied: \u201cI have. And I did inhale,\u201d she said . \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d She went on detail the experience of smoking a joint in college, possibly while listening to Tupac and Snoop. One problem: Watch the full conversation here: The two major pieces were funding for physical barriers along the border \u2013 a wall, fencing, \u201csteel slats\u201d \u2013 and the number of detention beds for immigrants detained by enforcement officers within the US. A bipartisan, bicameral group of negotiators have tentatively agreed to allot $1.375bn for border barriers and Democrats dropped their demand for a cap on the number of detention beds for interior enforcement. However, the overall number of detention would drop from 49,057 to 40,520. Trump has made no decision yet on whether he will accept the bipartisan funding agreement, Reuters is reporting according to a White House official. At Donald Trump\u2019s rally in El Paso last night, a supporter violently shoved a BBC cameraman. Trump apparently saw the attack, checked that everything was ok with a thumbs up sign and carried on with his speech, according to the BBC. Congressman Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, is also considering running for the Arizona Senate seat. After Kelly\u2019s announcement this morning Gallego tweeted that he is \u201clooking seriously\u201d at a run and will make an announcement soon. Some news out of the west this morning. Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, announced that he will run for the Arizona senate in 2020. The Democrat will challenge Republican Senator Martha McSally, who was appointed to the seat formerly held by Arizona senator John McCain in 2018. McSally was appointed to the seat after losing an election to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema for the state\u2019s other Senate seat, which came open after Senator Jeff Flake announced his retirement. The 2020 election will be watched closely as a bellwether of political change in the Sunbelt states. The race will determine who will serve the final two years of McCain\u2019s term, until 2022. The winner will have to run again for the seat to serve a full six-year term. Hi and welcome to our live coverage from Washington. Late on Monday night lawmakers on Capitol Hill reached an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d to fully fund the US government and stave off another partial shutdown. The tentative deal includes $1.375bn for border \u201cbarrier fencing\u201d \u2013 not a concrete wall from sea to shining sea. This is far less than the $5.7bn Trump is seeking to build his wall. We expect to hear more from the president today about whether he would sign such legislation when it comes to his desk. Both chambers of Congress are in session today and we expect to hear a lot more about the possible accord to avoid a government shutdown.",

      "bodyText": "The commander of US forces in South Korea has said he has seen \u201clittle to no verifiable change\u201d in North Korea\u2019s military capabilities, just weeks away from a second summit between Donald Trump and regime leader Kim Jong-un. General Robert Abrams, the new head of US Forces Korea, said last year\u2019s summit between the two leaders had helped reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula, but had not led to substantive changes. Trump and Kim met in June last year in a bid to resolve tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program, and the two signed off on a vaguely-worded document in which Kim pledged to work towards \u201cthe denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d. After the first summit, Trump tweeted that \u201cthere was no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea\u201d and that \u201ceverybody can now feel much safer\u201d. Abrams told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday: \u201cLittle to no verifiable change has occurred and North Korea\u2019s military capabilities and that North Korea was continuing its winter military training at historic norms. \u201cFurther, North Korea\u2019s conventional and asymmetric military capabilities along with their continued development of advanced conventional systems remains unchecked. These capabilities continue to hold the United States, the Republic of Korea and our regional allies at risk.\u201d Trump and Kim are set to meet in Hanoi on 27 and 28 February for a second summit. Abrams noted that it had been 440 days since North Korea\u2019s last \u201cprovocative action\u201d and credited diplomatic efforts and international sanctions for leading to a \u201csignificant reduction in tension\u201d. Despite the bonhomie of Kim and Trump\u2019s first meeting, progress has since stalled with the two sides disagreeing over what Kim\u2019s pledge means. Analysts say tangible progress on denuclearisation will be needed if the talks are to avoid being dismissed as \u201creality TV\u201d. After that first summit, Trump called off large-scale joint exercises with South Korea. Abrams said \u201cit is necessary to maintain a postured and ready force to deter any possible aggressive actions,\u201d but stressed that the two allied militaries continue to train together at a lower level.

In the trailer, two women loudly slap Sestero\u2019s character Georgie before the three men, drunk, walk home. \u201cWater, look at that,\u201d intones Wiseau as the road they are walking down floods up to their waists and the big shark begins to circle. The film \u2013 whose trailer has been described as \u201cpreposterous\u201d, \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201ccompletely crazy\u201d \u2013 is already promising to be quotable. The trailer ends with five seconds of oddly performative strangled screams, and has been shared online a week after it premiered ahead of a screening of The Room in London. One guest, writing for Film Futter, described the trailer as \u201cso unexpected and weird that my colleague and I both briefly wondered if we had any hallucinogenic drugs added to our beer before\u201d. Although the trailer suggests some of the film has already been shot, Wiseau reportedly told the audience in London he intends on shooting and premiering it in 2019. Doubts have already been cast on whether the film will ever make it, with entertainment reporter Germain Lussier claiming it is \u201cmostly a joke and probably not going to happen \u2026 they aren\u2019t planning on making it a movie\u201d. Sestero also starred in The Room, the 2003 film often described as the \u201cworst movie ever\u201d, and which Wiseau directed, wrote, starred in, produced and somehow also financed. After its release, Sestero told the near-unbelievable tale of the film\u2019s making in his book, The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, The Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made. In 2017, the book was turned into a Golden Globe-winning movie by James Franco. Franco played Wiseau, his brother Dave Franco played Mark, and Sestero and Wiseau themselves also made cameos. If Big Shark does eventuate, it will be Wiseau\u2019s first feature film since The Room, which continues to be both ridiculed and loved in equal measure. While the jury is still out on whether Wiseau is in on the joke, he doesn\u2019t appear too hard done by. He tweeted out a poster of Big Shark on Tuesday, along with a link to his online store, which sells Tommy Wiseau-branded merchandise including underwear, watches, clothes and a \u201cdogeee toy\u201d. He also tweeted a cult-favourite quote from The Room: \u201cWhat a story Mark.\u201d",

In one instance a \u201clow\u201d effort case took 422 days to get a decision, of which 413 days was inactivity.

The ANAO began its review into the department\u2019s processes after concerns were raised by the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Refugee Council of Australia, members of parliament and others about the length of time it was taking to process conferral applications. Conferrals \u2013 applications by current permanent residents \u2013 made up 92% of last year\u2019s 259,815 citizenship applications, alongside descent, adoption and resumption. \u201cProcessing times have increased and long delays are evident between applications being lodged and decisions being taken on whether or not to confer citizenship,\u201d it said. \u201cSignificant periods of inactivity are evident for both complex and non-complex applications accepted by the department for processing.\u201d The growing demand for citizenship was driven by the simplest cases, it said, largely \u201cpeople with good supporting documents who arrived in Australia on a skilled visa\u201d. In July last year the simplest cases made up 71% of all applications, a jump from 54% in January 2015. Medium and highly complex cases totalled just 5%. It found increased applicant screening processes were a significant driver of the inefficiencies, and also noted citizenship law changes had prompted a marked increase in applications during the examined time period. However the department had been slow to implement its \u201csuite\u201d of initiatives to improve efficiency, the report found, had not set key performance indicators to show parliament and other stakeholders how it was doing, and had no quality checks on application decisions. \u201cThe lack of externally reported key performance indicators for processing time efficiency means transparent and meaningful information is not being provided to the parliament and other stakeholders so as to hold home affairs accountable for its performance,\u201d the ANAO said. The ANAO made three recommendations, only one of which the department fully agreed to: a revision of the funding model for citizenship activities. The department agreed in principle to establish and monitor performance but disagreed with the recommendation to reintroduce key performance indicators for parliament and other stakeholders and to publish more details about its decisions. In its response the department said it would \u201calways prioritise [national security and community safety] over speed\u201d. It disagreed with the finding of inefficiency, citing a doubling of application refusals over three years to 6.8% in the first five months of 2017-18. It said it had dedicated \u201csignificant resources\u201d to addressing the 41 individuals since 2014 whose citizenship was revoked or had ended on national security and community safety grounds. \u201cCases with adverse indicators take a disproportionate level of effort and time to resolve, often requiring the assistance of various other agencies and partners,\u201d it said.",

Corcoran said PNG police knew that nine cars were stolen, parts had gone missing and some of the returned cars were \u201cpretty seriously damaged\u201d. The South Pacific archipelago of 7.3 million people pulled out all the stops at the Apec summit, hoping to put itself on the world map and lure investment. Aid money poured in from China and Australia to prepare for the event. But images of the Maseratis being unloaded at the airport, even as the government grappled with a polio outbreak, that proved a lightning rod for public anger. Government spokesman Chris Hawkins said a global event had to be hosted properly, and added that many of the vehicles not yet returned were either in government lots or being used by paramedics, firefighters and other public servants. Police believe six of the nine stolen cars are still around Port Moresby, while three have found their way to Mount Hagen, in the country\u2019s rugged highlands. Corcoran was confident of finding them because he has a master list of who signed them out. \u201cBasically, I know where all 284 vehicles that I\u2019ve got to collect are,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 February 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation as the Asia-Pacific Economic Corporation. This has been corrected.",

They will also have to avoid placing gambling adverts on parts of websites that are popular with children, and stop using celebrities or other people who appear to be under 25 in their promotions.</p> <p>The rules will mean many well-known footballers will not be allowed to feature in gambling adverts because of their age, while bookmakers will also be banned from advertising with social media influencers who are popular with children.</p> <p>The changes, which will come into effect from April, are designed to clarify existing standards amid growing concern over the prevalence of gambling promotions in all forms of media. They introduce a blanket requirement for gambling operators to use \u201call the tools available to them on a social network platform to prevent targeting their ads at under-18s\u201d.</p> <p>Increasing attention is being paid to the presence of gambling ads in computer games that are popular with children. Earlier this month the advertising watchdog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/06/im-a-celebrity-app-maker-forced-to-pull-gambling-adverts\">banned gambling ads</a> that appeared in ITV\u2019s I\u2019m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here app for breaking rules designed to stop under-18s from being encouraged to bet.</p> <p>The advertising regulator recently banned three Coral Interactive ads for featuring animated images of a rainbow, a pot of gold and a leprechaun, because they were likely to appeal to children.

      "bodyText": "Gambling adverts will no longer be allowed to appear on websites or in computer games that are popular with children, under new rules designed to stop irresponsible gambling. Bookmakers will be required to use every targeting tool possible to ensure online gambling promotions are not seen by under-18s. They will also have to avoid placing gambling adverts on parts of websites that are popular with children, and stop using celebrities or other people who appear to be under 25 in their promotions. The rules will mean many well-known footballers will not be allowed to feature in gambling adverts because of their age, while bookmakers will also be banned from advertising with social media influencers who are popular with children. The changes, which will come into effect from April, are designed to clarify existing standards amid growing concern over the prevalence of gambling promotions in all forms of media. They introduce a blanket requirement for gambling operators to use \u201call the tools available to them on a social network platform to prevent targeting their ads at under-18s\u201d. Increasing attention is being paid to the presence of gambling ads in computer games that are popular with children. Earlier this month the advertising watchdog banned gambling ads that appeared in ITV\u2019s I\u2019m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here app for breaking rules designed to stop under-18s from being encouraged to bet. The advertising regulator recently banned three Coral Interactive ads for featuring animated images of a rainbow, a pot of gold and a leprechaun, because they were likely to appeal to children. A William Hill advert appearing within the app New MarioKart 8 Trick was also banned for not being appropriately targeted away from children. Last year, with the threat of regulation looming, the gambling industry confirmed it would press ahead with a voluntary ban on betting adverts during pre-watershed sport programmes from the start of the next football season. However, this voluntary change will not block children from seeing gambling promotions during football matches, due to the prevalence of gambling companies that sponsor team shirts. The rules were announced by the Committee of Advertising Practice, which writes the UK advertising code.
