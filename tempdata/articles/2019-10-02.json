After months of what she described as terrifying verbal abuse, humiliation and financial control unbeknown to her friends, family and colleagues, she described how she eventually gained the courage to leave a partner. She spoke during a debate on the domestic abuse bill, which the Speaker, John Bercow, said had been \u201csimultaneously horrifying and as moving a contribution\u201d as he had heard in his 22 years in the Commons. Duffield, 48, who won Canterbury for Labour from the Tories in 2017, said domestic abuse was often very different from the images presented on TV. She said: \u201cOften we see the same images and stereotypes on TV. Housing estates, working-class families, drunk men coming home from the pub.

We are incredibly proud of her.\u201d The domestic abuse bill will for the first time include economic control and manipulative non-physical abuse within definitions of domestic abuse. It will also introduce new domestic abuse protection notices and domestic abuse protection orders to further protect victims and prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in the family courts. There was a risk that with parliament\u2019s prorogation the bill would not have time to become law. During its second reading on Wednesday, Theresa May, who introduced the bill, said it was a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity to make significant change to support victims.",
