Hundreds of thousands of Iranians, including soldiers, students, clerics and chador-clad women holding small children, marched through the capital in freezing rain on Monday to mark the anniversary. State television showed crowds carrying Iranian flags in cold rainy weather, shouting \u201cDeath to Israel, Death to America\u201d \u2013 trademark chants of the revolution \u2013 as well as burning US flags and carrying portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shia cleric who toppled the Shah in an Islamic uprising that still haunts the west. The Times reported that the crowds also chanted \u201cDeath to Theresa May\u201d. \u201cThe presence of people today on the streets all over Islamic Iran \u2026 means that the enemy will never reach its evil objectives,\u201d a defiant President Hassan Rouhani told those thronging Tehran\u2019s Azadi (Freedom) Square, decrying a \u201cconspiracy\u201d involving Washington. A pre-prepared resolution was read out ahead of Rouhani\u2019s speech that proclaimed \u201cunquestioning obedience to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u201d and called Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d. In a tweet written on the anniversary that he also sent out in Farsi, Trump said the revolution had been a complete failure. \u201c40 years of corruption. 40 years of repression. 40 years of terror.

The routes leading up to the square in Tehran were packed with people as loudspeakers blared revolutionary anthems and slogans. Life-size replicas of Iranian-made cruise and ballistic missiles stood in a statement of defiance after the US last year reimposed sanctions following its withdrawal from a deal on Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. Rouhani lambasted calls from the United States and Europe for a fresh agreement to curb Iran\u2019s missile programme. \u201cWe have not, and will not, request permission from anyone for increasing our defensive power and for building all kinds of \u2026 missiles,\u201d he told the crowd. Speaking from a flower-festooned stage overlooking the square, the president warned that Iran was now far stronger than when it faced off against Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq in a devastating 1980-1988 war. \u201cToday the whole world should know that the Islamic Republic of Iran is considerably more powerful than the days of the war,\u201d Rouhani said. Yadollah Javani, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards\u2019 deputy head for political affairs, said Iran would demolish cities in Israel if the United States attacked. \u201cThe United States does not have the courage to fire a single bullet at us despite all its defensive and military assets. But if they attack us, we will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground,\u201d Javani told the state news agency IRNA.

They would do well to take that into account.\u201d Iranians face mounting economic hardships many blame on the country\u2019s clerical leaders, and pictures on social media showed some people also demonstrating against corruption, unemployment and high prices. In 2018 Iran cracked down on protests over poor living standards that posed the most serious challenge to its clerical elite since a 2009 uprising over disputed elections. Prices of basic foodstuffs have soared since Trump withdrew Washington from world powers\u2019 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In January Rouhani said Iran was dealing with its worst economic crisis since the Shah was toppled. But he remained defiant on Monday as Iranians recalled the end of a monarch who catered to the rich. \u201cThe Iranian people have and will have some economic difficulties but we will overcome the problems by helping each other,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar \u201cunequivocally\u201d apologized on Monday for comments that suggested American support for Israel was fueled by political donations from a pro-Israel lobby group \u2013 a remark condemned by House Democratic leaders for raising \u201cantisemitic tropes and prejudicial accusations\u201d. \u201cAnti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,\u201d she said in a statement posted on Twitter. \u201cMy intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole.\u201d The response came after members of House leadership, including the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and majority leader, Steny Hoyer, called on Omar to \u201cimmediately apologize for these hurtful comments\u201d. \u201cLegitimate criticism of Israel\u2019s policies is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate that the United States and Israel share,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cBut Congresswoman Omar\u2019s use of antisemitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel\u2019s supporters is deeply offensive.\u201d Republicans were already threatening action against Omar and the Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib \u2013 the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress \u2013 over past comments that have been denounced as antisemitic. The women, both outspoken critics of the Israeli government, have faced charges of antisemitism since arriving in Congress last month. The controversy began with a tweet on Sunday night, when Omar responded to a journalist who accused the Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, of \u201cattacking free speech\u201d by targeting Omar and Tlaib, who is Palestinian American, for expressing a divergent view on Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby,\u201d Omar responded, a reference to Benjamin Franklin, whose face is on the $100 bill. That tweet generated a response from a Jewish journalist who asked Omar who she believed was \u201cpaying American politicians to be pro-Israel\u201d. The congresswoman replied: \u201cAIPAC,\u201d referring to influential pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee. Aipac does not contribute to political campaigns though there is a long tradition of lawmakers from both parties attending its annual conference and congressional trips to Israel. In her own statement, Omar said: \u201cWe have to always be willing to step back and think though criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d she added, \u201cI reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be Aipac, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry. It\u2019s gone on too long and we must be willing to address it.\u201d Another senior Democrat, the House judiciary committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, called the tweets \u201cdeeply disappointing and disturbing\u201d and said Omar had appeared to \u201ctraffic in old antisemitic tropes about Jews and money\u201d. Lawmakers should debate the \u201crelative influence of a particular organization on our country\u2019s policy-making process\u201d, Nadler said, but they must also be \u201cextremely careful not to tread into the waters of antisemitism or any other form of prejudice or hate\u201d. The House foreign affairs chairman, Eliot Engel, like Nadler a Democrat from New York, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d for a member of Congress to make such a comment. Omar serves on Engel\u2019s committee. The House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California said it was \u201cnever acceptable to give voice to, or repeat, antisemitic smears\u201d. \u201cThat goes for Rep Omar, and it also goes for Republicans who have trafficked in antisemitic attacks on George Soros and others,\u201d he said. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) accused Omar of promoting the \u201cugly antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews have an outsized influence over politics\u201d. \u201cThese tweets are part of a disturbing pattern of behavior that must end,\u201d said the ADL chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt. \u201cThe congresswoman needs to understand that these comments promote dangerous stereotypes and are hurtful to her Jewish constituents and Jewish Americans throughout the country.\u201d Omar recently apologized for comments on Israel including a tweet in which she said it had \u201chypnotized the world\u201d.

Referring to controversial instances in the 2016 Republican primary, it added: \u201cElected officials must be extremely aware that tropes about Jewish money and political influence have been used for centuries to target and stigmatize our community.\u201d Donald Trump, whose campaign came under fire for instances of alleged antisemitism, has received staunch support from Israel for policies including the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. At home, however, he has faced criticism for refusing to condemn neo-Nazis after a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly.

He said the Ligue \u201cnever aimed to coordinate hateful campaigns targeting anyone. But it doesn\u2019t serve to minimise or deny the evidence.

Six people have been suspended for their role in the closed Facebook group Ligue du LOL, a macho online \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d that reportedly harassed female and minority ethnic journalists for years.

I left the group six years ago \u2026 in the small world that was then Twitter, I saw that certain people were regularly targeted but I never guessed the depth of the trauma suffered. I was cowardly and too happy to be one of this band that the Twittersphere then admired, to intervene \u2026 I would like to say that I never did any of the photomontages, took part in raids or participated in the evenings described. This speaking out has above all made me realise that I was one of the tormentors.\u201d Hervaud wrote a long message on Twitter apologising for \u201ccondescending\u201d tweets he had posted on Friday when the scandal first broke, and said he offered \u201csincere if belated apologies to those he had hurt\u201d. He said the Ligue \u201cnever aimed to coordinate hateful campaigns targeting anyone. But it doesn\u2019t serve to minimise or deny the evidence. The permanent spirit of mockery and cynicism of the group obviously influenced the actions of certain more borderline members, notably those covered by anonymity, who, by the snowball effect inspired other internet users outside the group.\u201d He admitted some of the victim statements had \u201cliterally twisted my stomach\u201d. Christophe Carron, the editor of the French edition of the online magazine Slate, also admitted having been a member of the group but denied \u201csocially or professionally damaging anyone \u2026 or harassing anyone\u201d. The Lib\u00e9ration director, Laurent Joffrin, announced an internal investigation. \u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he said. In an apology published on Twitter, Glad said he had \u201ccreated a monster that escaped\u201d. \u201cThe object of the group was not to harass women, just to amuse ourselves. But quickly, our way of amusing ourselves became very problematic and we didn\u2019t realise this. We thought that everyone visible on the internet, by a blog, or Twitter account or something else, deserved to be mocked,\u201d Glad wrote. He added that he didn\u2019t realise that this could \u201cbecome a hell for the people targeted\u201d. Other Ligue members who have been suspended from their roles include Guilhem Malissen, a humorist on food podcast Bouffons, who apologised on Twitter; Renaud Loubert-Aledo, who worked at Publicis Consultants; and Guillaume Ledit, a journalist with Usbek &amp; Rica, a quarterly magazine \u201cexploring the future\u201d. Another member, Stephen des Aulnois, the founder of online pornographic magazine Tag Parfait, said he was suspending the website and stepping down voluntarily. The videomaker Florence Porcel said she had been the victim of an \u201conline lynching\u201d and had been humiliated when a member of the Ligue du LOL called her pretending to offer her a job, while recording the conversation. \u201cWhen the recording was made public, I cried from shame, humiliation and fear for three days. I didn\u2019t want to go out,\u201d she said. Porcel said she had also featured in a \u201cvery degrading pornographic photomontage \u2026 that was their method\u201d. Doucet admitted in a tweet that he had posed as a recruiter from a television station and called Porcel. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he wrote. The blogger and author Matthias Jambon-Puillet recounted, under his pseudonym Benjamin LeReilly, receiving anonymous insults and that a photomontage of him performing a sex act was sent \u2013 purportedly from him \u2013 to minors. Although he does not know who sent the insults, he said he believed they came from members of the league. The journalist M\u00e9lanie Wanga said she believed the league\u2019s members were finally getting what they deserved. \u201cImagine being a young, black woman journalist talking about blackface and apartheid and getting this stuff multiplied by 20 from your \u2018colleagues\u2019,\u201d she said, sharing tweets she suspected had come from unidentified members of the league. Capucine Piot, a former journalist now in marketing, said she had been the victim of several \u201cmocking\u201d photomontages and videos criticising her appearance. \u201cIt was very hard for a developing young woman. After reading so much dirt about myself \u2026 I was convinced I was worthless,\u201d she tweeted. Other victims have remained anonymous. \u201cThose guys, they thought they were making jokes but they were ruining our lives,\u201d said one. France\u2019s minister for digital affairs, Mounir Mahjoubi, described the men behind the Facebook group as \u201closers\u201d. \u201cIt is a group of guys high on their power at being able to make fun of other people. Except that their mockery had an effect in real life,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has released advice warning the government bill to lower the bar for stripping terrorists of Australian citizenship is unconstitutional as it prepares to dissent on the usually bipartisan security committee. The advice, written by Victorian QC Peter Hanks, said there is a \u201creasonable argument\u201d granting home affairs minister Peter Dutton the power to revoke citizenship merely on his subjective belief the person is a dual national is not supported by the constitution. The release of the advice comes after the shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told caucus on Monday night Labor is likely to issue a dissenting report on the bill on the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, a first for them in this term of opposition. As parliament resumes on Tuesday, the Coalition has focused on national security, picking up where it left off in 2018 when Labor passed the encryption bill on the final day of sittings. On Monday Scott Morrison argued that medical evacuations are a risk to border protection and the Coalition pressure produced new Labor qualifications to its support for the crossbench bill, which will come to a vote on Tuesday. But on the strengthening citizenship loss provisions bill, Labor has so far resisted Coalition pressure, citing concerns it could render people stateless and is unconstitutional. Shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus has also targeted Dutton for the \u201cabsolutely incompetent\u201d handling of the cancellation of Isis fighter Neil Prakash\u2019s citizenship without checking his Fijian citizenship with Fiji. The advice, seen by Guardian Australia, argues the commonwealth has the power to make laws for \u201cnaturalisation and aliens\u201d but not to define alien so broadly as to give it power over \u201cpersons who could not possibly answer the description of aliens\u201d. The bill says the minister will only need to be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d that a person would have another citizenship before revoking their Australian citizenship. The current law requires they be a dual citizen and the decision can be challenged in court if this is not in fact the case. Hanks said the bill \u201coperates on people who are (at least at present) Australian citizens\u201d and are therefore unlikely to meet the definition of alien in the constitution. Hanks said there was also a \u201creasonable argument\u201d that giving the minister power to revoke citizenship breaches the separation of executive and judicial power because that is in effect \u201ca form of punishment\u201d. He said there is a \u201cnot remote\u201d prospect the high court may find loss of citizenship is a punitive step as it is a form of \u201ccivil death\u201d, although he noted the court had upheld the power to revoke visas and the argument was \u201cpossibly not as strong\u201d as the first. \u201cOn balance I believe that there is a substantial risk that the proposed [section 35A] would be found to offend chapter III of the constitution.\u201d Hanks also noted it was arguable the bill prevents a person voting in federal elections, although that was likely to require an extension of the current law to succeed. Dreyfus said the government \u201ccannot ignore the advice from eminent constitutional lawyer Peter Hanks\u201d and similar concerns expressed by academics Kim Rubenstein and George Williams. In evidence in January, Williams warned the committee that the amendment could cause the high court to strike down the existing citizenship stripping powers, which have been in effect since 2015. \u201cLabor is focused on making strong national security laws that make Australians safer \u2013 not giving terrorists a win in the highest court in our land,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cThe government has not sought any assurances, even from its own solicitor-general, that this bill is constitutional. It\u2019s failed at even basic due diligence.\u201d In its submission, the home affairs department revealed the new powers are likely to bring just 18 people into the frame for potential loss of citizenship but labelled the powers a \u201ckey counter-terrorism tool\u201d.",

It\u2019s both a masterclass in how to be a loving and supportive family or friend to a trans person and how, as the transcendent line from Jill Soloway\u2019s award-winning series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/26/transparent-review-the-best-thing-on-tv-at-the-moment\" title=\"tr\">Transparent</a> goes: \u201cWhen one person transitions the entire family transitions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s transgender and he dresses up as a girl,\u201d says 10-year-old Izzy of her father, a mischievous security guard from Sheffield who is transitioning from Rupert to Vicky.</p> <p>Vicky recalls being fascinated by women\u2019s shoes in her mother\u2019s catalogues as an 11-year-old boy and how she suppressed her gender identity for 30 years, got married and had kids until \u201ceventually it came back\u201d.</p> <p>She worries about her deep voice, which leads to constant misgendering, and the impact of everything on her children: \u201cYou feel guilty, like you\u2019re taking something away from them \u2026 ie, a father.\u201d</p> <p>And what does Izzy make of her dad? \u201cHe\u2019s still my dad but we call him Vicky,\u201d she says. Later she is asked if she has advice for other children of trans parents. \u201cI\u2019ve got advice for Vicky,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cDress better.\u201d</p> <p>In Chesterfield, 56-year-old project manager Simon, whose transgender name is Jackie, is awaiting facial surgery. The plan is to physically transition in the next two years. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know what you are, do we?\u201d says Julie, Simon\u2019s wife of 35 years, who is fabulous and responds to all the transitions that transition brings with love, levity and a load of knitting.</p> <p>Weeks later, they are in hospital waiting for Simon to head into theatre. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t fancy you after?\u201d she wonders. She\u2019d like him to emerge looking like Tom Hiddleston \u201cbut that would be totally off what you want\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d Simon asks. It\u2019s a sweet bit of repartee but it also demonstrates the profound and often overlooked changes, in sexuality apart from anything else, that partners of trans people also undergo. Mostly, Julie is up for it. \u201cThe worst scenario would be to lose Jackie or Simon,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Less than a year later, she is helping Jackie weigh pudding rice to decide what breast size to choose. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to be soulmates,\u201d says Julie, knitting again. \u201cWe\u2019ve loved each other for nearly 40 years. That love doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d</p> <p>Cairo, who is having monthly testosterone injections, just wants people to \u201csee who I am\u201d. Men still hit on him. He gets misgendered a lot. \u201cWhat do I need to do to get people to understand that I\u2019m a man?\u201d he asks in frustration. His girlfriend isn\u2019t sure. \u201cI came into this relationship knowing who I was,\u201d she says of how she felt when Cairo came out as trans. \u201cI felt a bit betrayed. Can I be with a man?\u201d By the end, Cairo has been taking testosterone for almost a year, is on his first paid job as a male model, and single. \u201cPeople change,\u201d he says of the relationship ending. \u201cI\u2019m in such a happy place now.\u201d</p> <p>Like other recent Channel 4 programmes about gender identity (Genderquake, Trans Kids, Butterfly), The Making of Me explores trans people\u2019s lives from trans people\u2019s perspectives; the broad spectrum of lived experience so many of the toxic debates and culture wars obscure. Also, thankfully, without showing vast amounts of surgery.</p> <p>This simple approach is respectful and requisite in inflammatory times. One person\u2019s moral panic, after all, is another person\u2019s life. Which isn\u2019t to say the time for discussion is ever over, only that the time for empathy, listening and, well, living, is always now. As Jackie puts it after going to work as herself for the first time and finding a welcome sign in the women\u2019s toilets: \u201cI can just be me all the time. I can be happy.\u201d</p>",

Vicky recalls being fascinated by women\u2019s shoes in her mother\u2019s catalogues as an 11-year-old boy and how she suppressed her gender identity for 30 years, got married and had kids until \u201ceventually it came back\u201d. She worries about her deep voice, which leads to constant misgendering, and the impact of everything on her children: \u201cYou feel guilty, like you\u2019re taking something away from them \u2026 ie, a father.\u201d And what does Izzy make of her dad? \u201cHe\u2019s still my dad but we call him Vicky,\u201d she says. Later she is asked if she has advice for other children of trans parents. \u201cI\u2019ve got advice for Vicky,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cDress better.\u201d In Chesterfield, 56-year-old project manager Simon, whose transgender name is Jackie, is awaiting facial surgery. The plan is to physically transition in the next two years. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know what you are, do we?\u201d says Julie, Simon\u2019s wife of 35 years, who is fabulous and responds to all the transitions that transition brings with love, levity and a load of knitting. Weeks later, they are in hospital waiting for Simon to head into theatre. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t fancy you after?\u201d she wonders. She\u2019d like him to emerge looking like Tom Hiddleston \u201cbut that would be totally off what you want\u201d. \u201cWho?\u201d Simon asks. It\u2019s a sweet bit of repartee but it also demonstrates the profound and often overlooked changes, in sexuality apart from anything else, that partners of trans people also undergo. Mostly, Julie is up for it. \u201cThe worst scenario would be to lose Jackie or Simon,\u201d she says. Less than a year later, she is helping Jackie weigh pudding rice to decide what breast size to choose. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to be soulmates,\u201d says Julie, knitting again. \u201cWe\u2019ve loved each other for nearly 40 years. That love doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d Cairo, who is having monthly testosterone injections, just wants people to \u201csee who I am\u201d. Men still hit on him. He gets misgendered a lot. \u201cWhat do I need to do to get people to understand that I\u2019m a man?\u201d he asks in frustration. His girlfriend isn\u2019t sure. \u201cI came into this relationship knowing who I was,\u201d she says of how she felt when Cairo came out as trans. \u201cI felt a bit betrayed. Can I be with a man?\u201d By the end, Cairo has been taking testosterone for almost a year, is on his first paid job as a male model, and single. \u201cPeople change,\u201d he says of the relationship ending. \u201cI\u2019m in such a happy place now.\u201d Like other recent Channel 4 programmes about gender identity (Genderquake, Trans Kids, Butterfly), The Making of Me explores trans people\u2019s lives from trans people\u2019s perspectives; the broad spectrum of lived experience so many of the toxic debates and culture wars obscure. Also, thankfully, without showing vast amounts of surgery. This simple approach is respectful and requisite in inflammatory times. One person\u2019s moral panic, after all, is another person\u2019s life. Which isn\u2019t to say the time for discussion is ever over, only that the time for empathy, listening and, well, living, is always now. As Jackie puts it after going to work as herself for the first time and finding a welcome sign in the women\u2019s toilets: \u201cI can just be me all the time. I can be happy.\u201d",

Especially when you have people around you doing bad things.\u201d</p> \n<p>More than a month away from celebrating his 19th birthday, the first player born this millennium to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/09/jadon-sancho-england-borussia-dortmund\" title=\"\">represent England</a> and a trailblazer for his generation is holding court at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Westfalenstadion. Dressed in a turquoise green tracksuit and immaculate matching trainers, the unassuming Sancho does not come across as the most coveted teenager in world football as he makes a point of shaking hands with every journalist around the table with the greeting, \u201cnice to meet you\u201d. Clearly at ease in his surroundings in western Germany as he prepares for his return to London to face Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday, he is taller and broader in the shoulders than this time last year; something the makers of the Fifa video game may want to take note of. \u201cI am stronger than it says,\u201d he says, laughing. The boy from the Guinness Trust Buildings estate who left home at 12 has now become a man.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/11/will-dortmund-stutter-prove-a-useful-lesson-or-open-the-door-for-bayern\">Will Dortmund stutter prove a useful lesson or open the door for Bayern? | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cFor the kids that are in south London I hope I can give a positive message,\u201d he adds, intently. \u201cDon\u2019t do those bad things. You don\u2019t have to be footballers. You could focus on your school work. Education is the most important thing and a lot of kids in south London get distracted from education.\u201d</p> \n<p>Had he not been blessed with a talent with the ball that convinced his headteacher at Crampton primary school he was destined to be a star when she first saw him as a five-year-old, Sancho knows his story could have turned out very differently. Eight goals \u2013 including the brilliant finish from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/09/european-roundup-dortmund-bayern-bundesliga-serie-a-la-liga-ligue-1\" title=\"\">tight angle in Saturday\u2019s 3-3 draw with Hoffenheim</a> \u2013 and nine assists in the Bundesliga this season have allowed Lucien Favre\u2019s vibrant young Dortmund side to dream of winning a first title since 2012. His bold decision to reject a new contract with Manchester City worth \u00a330,000-a-week and move to Germany in search of first-team football is proving a masterstroke.</p> \n<p>Yet just like on the pitch, where his outstanding skill and dribbling speed have made him a social media sensation and earned comparisons with Neymar, Sancho has always been prepared to take risks. Having joined Watford aged seven, he would travel across London three nights a week to train and was later persuaded to leave his friends and family behind to join the club\u2019s affiliated school, Harefield Academy in Uxbridge, west London.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to go to that boarding school,\u201d Sancho reflects nearly seven years on. \u201cI wanted to stay at home and travel but the people around me told me what was best and I listened to them.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMy friends in Kennington always ask me: \u2018Can I have a shirt for my little brother or my cousin?\u2019 And I always send them shirts,\u201d says Jadon Sancho. \u201cI will never forget where I have come from because I know what it is like growing up in that area \u2026 it is not nice. Especially when you have people around you doing bad things.\u201d More than a month away from celebrating his 19th birthday, the first player born this millennium to represent England and a trailblazer for his generation is holding court at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Westfalenstadion. Dressed in a turquoise green tracksuit and immaculate matching trainers, the unassuming Sancho does not come across as the most coveted teenager in world football as he makes a point of shaking hands with every journalist around the table with the greeting, \u201cnice to meet you\u201d. Clearly at ease in his surroundings in western Germany as he prepares for his return to London to face Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday, he is taller and broader in the shoulders than this time last year; something the makers of the Fifa video game may want to take note of. \u201cI am stronger than it says,\u201d he says, laughing. The boy from the Guinness Trust Buildings estate who left home at 12 has now become a man. \u201cFor the kids that are in south London I hope I can give a positive message,\u201d he adds, intently. \u201cDon\u2019t do those bad things. You don\u2019t have to be footballers. You could focus on your school work. Education is the most important thing and a lot of kids in south London get distracted from education.\u201d Had he not been blessed with a talent with the ball that convinced his headteacher at Crampton primary school he was destined to be a star when she first saw him as a five-year-old, Sancho knows his story could have turned out very differently. Eight goals \u2013 including the brilliant finish from a tight angle in Saturday\u2019s 3-3 draw with Hoffenheim \u2013 and nine assists in the Bundesliga this season have allowed Lucien Favre\u2019s vibrant young Dortmund side to dream of winning a first title since 2012. His bold decision to reject a new contract with Manchester City worth \u00a330,000-a-week and move to Germany in search of first-team football is proving a masterstroke. Yet just like on the pitch, where his outstanding skill and dribbling speed have made him a social media sensation and earned comparisons with Neymar, Sancho has always been prepared to take risks. Having joined Watford aged seven, he would travel across London three nights a week to train and was later persuaded to leave his friends and family behind to join the club\u2019s affiliated school, Harefield Academy in Uxbridge, west London. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to go to that boarding school,\u201d Sancho reflects nearly seven years on. \u201cI wanted to stay at home and travel but the people around me told me what was best and I listened to them.

It\u2019s one of those disappointing moments. Martin Dubravka\u2019s a top class goalkeeper. There\u2019s going to be no blame laid at his door.

Times are hard, but Ashley\u2019s generosity knows no bounds. A mere 12 years since he pitched up in the north east, the owner has reached into his wallet to shatter the club\u2019s transfer record, further cementing his status as a club legend. Hurrah for Big Mike ...</p> <p>... said absolutely nobody in a black and white shirt. For while Almiron does look like a good signing, it\u2019s difficult to be that effusive about Ashley when Newcastle find themselves out of the bottom three on goal difference, weighed down by yet another relegation battle and at risk of losing Benitez at the end of the season. Newcastle\u2019s manager may well need to see a bit more ambition before he decides to extend his contract and stay at a club whose vast potential continues to be quashed by a joyless ownership. Benitez has done a brilliant job so far - the man beat Manchester City the other day! - and it\u2019s clear that he could bring back the glory years if he receives proper backing, but at the moment it\u2019s hard not to feel that this is all going to end in tears. </p> <p>In the short term, at least Newcastle can feel reasonably confident about staying up with Benitez in charge. Yet their fans must look at what Wolves are doing this season and wonder what would be possible if the suits were to show some more ambition. Wolves, managed by the very impressive Nuno Espirito Santo, are well on their way to establishing themselves as the best of the rest in their first season back in the top flight and have delighted their supporters with some magnificent football this season. They are looking good in seventh place after consecutive wins over Leicester, West Ham and Everton, have picked up results against every member of the Big Six, have reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and will fancy their chances of making it five wins on the bounce in all competitions this season. Molineux is bound to be rocking and Newcastle are likely to need some of that organisational magic from Benitez to get something here. A creative spark from Almiron also wouldn\u2019t go amiss. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 8pm GMT.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T17:23:08.457Z\">at 5.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Peter Lansley\u2019s report from Molineux. That\u2019s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye! Isaac Hayden speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put into words, the feeling we\u2019ve got. We thought we deserved the points. It looked a foul from the bench. I think the referee had played 94 and 52 seconds. It\u2019s another bit of bad luck. I thought we deserved the three points. It\u2019s one of those disappointing moments. Martin Dubravka\u2019s a top class goalkeeper. There\u2019s going to be no blame laid at his door. I made a mistake at the beginning of the season against Cardiff away and got sent off and almost cost the team.\u201d Newcastle might be annoyed about five minutes of added time, but everyone knows it\u2019s a minimum. They wasted the first minute with the Manquillo substitution and can have no complaints that Graham Scott kept playing after the allotted four minutes were up. Rafa Benitez looks absolutely furious, though it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s because of how much added time was added on, because he thought the equaliser should have been ruled out or because he\u2019s just annoyed with another costly error from Martin Dubravka. The Newcastle manager is livid. He\u2019s fuming as he walks off. It was a heartbreaking end for Newcastle, who were moments away from a crucial win before Willy Boly\u2019s 95th-minute equaliser. They were on course to rise to 13th thanks to a strike from Isaac Hayden; instead they find themselves a point above 18th-placed Southampton with 12 games to go. That\u2019s your lot! Adama Traore goes on one last surge down the right. He reaches the byline and hoicks a high cross to the far post. It should be Dubravka\u2019s. He should punch it away. But he tries to catch it and isn\u2019t strong enough. He makes a complete mess of it and that allows Boly to bundle it in with a combination of his head and chest! Dubravka appeals for a foul. There was no foul. Lascelles is furious with him. Wolves equalise! 90 min+5: Wolves pump the long ball forward. Jimenez sees a volley blocked. Then Ritchie blocks Traore\u2019s shot. And then... 90 min+4: One final corner for Wolves, won by Cavaleiro. It\u2019s headed away. 90 min+1: Newcastle eat some time with their third substitution, Ayoze Perez making way for Javi Manquillo. \u201cJust to add a woman\u2019s two penn\u2019th (a wife not a fianc\u00e9e), I would suggest mustard,\u201d Jill O\u2019Donnell says. 90 min: Almiron\u2019s cross is headed over by Perez. There will be four added minutes. 89 min: Moutinho\u2019s corner, Bennett\u2019s header, Dubravka\u2019s ball. 88 min: A corner to Wolves on the left. Boly almost gets his head to it in the six-yard box. Newcastle survive. Another corner.... 86 min: Mo Diame replaces Isaac Hayden, Newcastle\u2019s goalscorer. 82 min: Adama Traore replaces Matt Doherty. Wolves attack down the left, Cavaleiro twisting, turning and lifting a deep cross to the far post. Traore sidefoots it back into the middle and Jimenez heads woefully wide from close range! 81 min: Cavaleiro blasts over from 25 yards. Wolves are running out of ideas. 80 min: Wolves are getting Adama Traore ready. 78 min: Moutinho gives Almiron a rude introduction to English football, sliding to bring him down. A good old-fashioned reducer from, er, the silky Portuguese creator. 75 min: Hayden\u2019s receiving treatment after being fouled by Moutinho, which gives everyone a chance to have a breather. 72 min: This is what the Newcastle fans wanted to see: Miguel Almiron coming on to make his debut. The Paraguayan\u2019s given a huge cheer as he replaces Christian Atsu. 69 min: Helder Costa and Ivan Cavaleiro come on for Diogo Jota and Leander Dendoncker. 68 min: Lascelles picks up a booking for a cynical trip on Jimenez. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned today it\u2019s that David Dein is in the habit of making assumptions,\u201d JR in Illinois says. \u201cNow he\u2019s assuming how my theoretical fiancee would react?! Also, while I\u2019m here, I can\u2019t let his calling Newcastle\u2019s kit \u201cteal\u201d go unchallenged. It\u2019s not teal. It\u2019s closer to cyan or possibly electric blue.\u201d 66 min: Helder Costa will be on for Wolves soon. 65 min: Jimenez manages to bustle to the byline on the right and pull a cross into the area. A ricochet sees the ball run to Doherty, whose shot hits his own man! Newcastle survive again. 61 min: \u201cSimon Kirchin\u2019s link confirms something I\u2019ve always thought, the best football kits were worn during the sixties,\u201d Tom Shaw says. \u201cSmart, trim and clean looking with no graphics apart from a club crest. Worth checking your club\u2019s out and comparing it with the cluttered monstrosity they probably were today.\u201d 59 min: Jota with the shot again, Dubravka with the shot again. This could be a long 30 minutes or so for Newcastle. 57 min: Wolves look for an instant response, but Jota sees his shot from 18 yards saved by Dubravka, diving low to his right. This is a really well worked goal, though Rui Patricio has let himself down here. The move begins with Fabian Schar setting off on one of his trademark runs from deep. This time he decides not to shoot. Instead he slides a brilliant pass through to Hayden on the right, cutting Wolves open, and the midfielder\u2019s shot manages to squirm past Patricio, who really should have kept it out. Not that Newcastle care. That could be a huge goal for them. Newcastle snatch the lead! 53 min: Dubravka claims the corner. 52 min: Wolves are setting a brisk pace and Jota wins a corner on the left. 51 min: There\u2019s a minor row between Schar and Jota, both of whom get yellow cards after jutting heads together. 48 min: Wolves are o the front foot straight away, Jimenez playing a one-two with Jota and bursting into the area, but Lascelles manages to deflect the Mexican\u2019s shot wide for a corner. From which a flick-on from Jota at the near post should lead to the opening goal for Doherty. The Irish wing-back\u2019s only a yard out, but he\u2019s under pressure from Longstaff and manages to head over the bar! What a miss! 46 min: Wolves get the second half underway. Half-time emails \u201cHere you go, Wolves kits through the ages,\u201d Simon Kirchin says. \u201cKnock yourself out......\u201d \u201cIs Yedlin always this poor or is he having a particularly bad game today?\u201d Peter Campbell says. \u201cIs David Dein confused with the eponymous USA pretzel snack of Rold Gold, which being baked are consequently a much darker shade than the Wolves kit,\u201d C Johnston says. \u201cCall it amber, call it yellow, call it orange, that all rather misses the point,\u201d David Dein says. \u201cIf you got engaged and presented a fiancee with a ring that colour &amp; claimed it was old gold you can pretty much guarantee that she\u2019ll be departing in the kind of funk that would make Kevin Keegan proud and probably never to be seen again. Btw, Newcastle are in teal.\u201d It\u2019s been very tight. Not too many chances at either end. I\u2019ve seen worse games, though. See you in 15 minutes. 45 min: Perez slips a pass through to Rondon, who runs at Coady and tries to make room for a shot. Just when Rondon seems ready to blast home with his left foot, Coady sticks out a leg to divert the shot over! 44 min: Ritchie goes down in the Wolves area after running into Doherty, enraging the home fans. The Newcastle player\u2019s also not too happy. He thought it was a penalty and tells the referee as much in no uncertain terms. All that gets him is a booking for dissent. 43 min: A cross from Ritchie from the left somehow reaches Rondon at the far post, but the Newcastle forward can\u2019t sort out his feet and loses the ball. To belabour the point about newcastle\u2019s kit,\u201d Neil Hattersley says. \u201cEvery time the TV cuts to a close up of one of their outfield players I just assume they have a new keeper I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d 41 min: Jonny smacks a low shot through the mass of bodies from 20 yards, but Dubravka plunges to his right to make a good save. He even holds on to the ball. A good goalkeeper, Dubravka, despite that mistake against Spurs last week. 40 min: Newcastle creep forward, pressing on the right, and Hayden sends a cross into the area. Rondon\u2019s more alert than anyone - but the former West Brom striker can only glance a header straight at Patricio. 37 min: \u201cThe bigger issue surely is what colour is the Newcastle kit?\u201d Steven Franklin says. \u201cYou called it blue in your preamble but I\u2019d be inclined to call it turquoise.\u201d 35 min: The second corner comes to nothing. Moments later Jimenez almost makes something out of nothing on the left after being picked out by a raking pass from Neves. He tricks past Yedlin brilliantly, drives back from the byline, on to his right foot, and slams a low shot through the bodies. The ball\u2019s heading towards the far post, but Dubravka gets down to make the save. Jota can\u2019t do anything with the rebound. 34 min: Another Newcastle error in possession sparks another Wolves attack, which ends with Jimenez winning a corner on the right. Jota sends it in and Boly runs to the near post, only to see his header hit a Newcastle man and fly over. 32 min: Newcastle have their first decent attack of the evening. Sort of. Schar sends one wide from 25 yards. 30 min: Newcastle haven\u2019t been out of their half in any constructive way for a while. It\u2019s all Wolves. But Dubravka hasn\u2019t had to make a save yet. \u201cThat definitive guide to football kits, the 1960\u2019s Subbuteo catalogue lists Wolves shirts as Old Gold,\u201d Tom Shaw says. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me. 27 min: Wolves have had quite a few promising situations on the edge of the Newcastle area, only to botch the final pass. Their latest attack ends with Dendoncker curling over from 25 yards. They need more composure. 25 min: Wolves have had a good few minutes and are making most of the running. Newcastle\u2019s objective, you sense, is to kill the game. There\u2019s a danger it could run away from them if Wolves get the first goal soon. 23 min: A fascinating development is taking place in my inbox. \u201cNot to throw a monkey wrench (or \u201cspanner\u201d as you would call it) into David Dein\u2019s world view but I\u2019m not from (and have never even been to) the U.K. and I would not say Wolves are wearing orange,\u201d says JR in Illinois. \u201cI\u2019d call it amber.\u201d What have you done, David Dein? 20 min: \u201cIf you are hurting for quality emails let me express my retort to emailer David Deon that many in the states would rule that Wolve\u2019s kits are indeed old gold,\u201d Alex Alfonso says. \u201cIn fact, my university loved the color so much they named an entire alumni weekend after it (because that\u2019s what you do in middle-of-nowhere Indiana).\u201d 18 min: Now Wolves have a saunter down the right. The excellent Doherty pings in a cross and this time Jimenez has room to get a shot away, only to slash over the bar. He should have scored. 17 min: Wolves, dangerous down the left, attack down that flank again, Jonny breaking free and pulling a cutback towards Jimenez. The striker seems poised to stroke home, only for Atsu to steam in and make the tackle. Wolves scream for a penalty as Jimenez goes to ground, but a replay shows Atsu got the ball. 16 min: This is exactly like a game of chess. 13 min: Lejeune makes a poor error, gifting the ball straight to Wolves on the halfway line, but the centre-back\u2019s relieved to see Lascelles step in and stop Jimenez\u2019s charge towards goal. 11 min: Wolves have struggled to deal with defensive sides at home a few times this season and they will have to work hard to break down Newcastle. That said, the visitors are more ambitious than they were against Tottenham last week. 9 min: Ritchie has a saunter down the left and sends an absolutely hopeless cross into the Wolves area. 7 min: Jota collects a long ball into the Newcastle area, turns Yedlin and tries to cross. The ball floats over for a goal-kick. 4 min: Wolves have a look down the left, Jota combining with Jonny, who tries to sweep a clever pass to the far post for Jimenez, who can\u2019t quite make up the ground. Up the other end, Rondon has a go from the edge of the area. Straight at Rui Patricio. 3 min: \u201cAllow me to get something off my chest,\u201d says David Dein. \u201cWhy do you insist on perpetuating the myth that Wolves play in old gold? You ask anyone that isn\u2019t native to the UK what colour that shirt is and they will tell you it\u2019s orange. I can understand when textiles weren\u2019t capable of producing the colour gold cost effectively that but that was a time that is quite literally decades ago.\u201d Just because, to be honest. Peep! Newcastle, kicking from right to left in the first half, get the game underway. Mike Ashley is at Molineux tonight. Here come the teams! Wolves are in gold and black, Newcastle are in blue. An email! \u201cSupporting a failing team, like having a pet as a kid, is a necessary way of getting used to the fact of death,\u201d Ian Copestake says. \u201cMan City fans no longer have such an incessant exposure so let\u2019s top our hats to Newcastle\u2019s rabbit owning supporters.\u201d Wolves: Rui Patricio; Bennett, Coady, Boly; Doherty, Dendoncker, Moutinho, Neves, Jonny; Jota, Jimenez. Subs: Ruddy, Cavaleiro, Costa, Gibbs-White, Saiss, Vinagre, Traore. Newcastle: Dubravka; Yedlin, Lejeune, Schar, Lascelles, Ritchie; Hayden, Longstaff, Atsu, Perez; Rondon. Subs: Woodman, Fernandez, Manquillo, Diame, Almiron, Kenedy, Joselu. Referee: Graham Scott. Hello. With Rafael Benitez still defying very logical calls from Richard Keys to pump some of his own money into Newcastle United, special praise must be afforded to Mike Ashley for signing Miguel Almiron for \u00a321m. Times are hard, but Ashley\u2019s generosity knows no bounds. A mere 12 years since he pitched up in the north east, the owner has reached into his wallet to shatter the club\u2019s transfer record, further cementing his status as a club legend. Hurrah for Big Mike ... ... said absolutely nobody in a black and white shirt. For while Almiron does look like a good signing, it\u2019s difficult to be that effusive about Ashley when Newcastle find themselves out of the bottom three on goal difference, weighed down by yet another relegation battle and at risk of losing Benitez at the end of the season. Newcastle\u2019s manager may well need to see a bit more ambition before he decides to extend his contract and stay at a club whose vast potential continues to be quashed by a joyless ownership. Benitez has done a brilliant job so far - the man beat Manchester City the other day! - and it\u2019s clear that he could bring back the glory years if he receives proper backing, but at the moment it\u2019s hard not to feel that this is all going to end in tears. In the short term, at least Newcastle can feel reasonably confident about staying up with Benitez in charge. Yet their fans must look at what Wolves are doing this season and wonder what would be possible if the suits were to show some more ambition. Wolves, managed by the very impressive Nuno Espirito Santo, are well on their way to establishing themselves as the best of the rest in their first season back in the top flight and have delighted their supporters with some magnificent football this season. They are looking good in seventh place after consecutive wins over Leicester, West Ham and Everton, have picked up results against every member of the Big Six, have reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and will fancy their chances of making it five wins on the bounce in all competitions this season. Molineux is bound to be rocking and Newcastle are likely to need some of that organisational magic from Benitez to get something here. A creative spark from Almiron also wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Kick-off: 8pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Local news coverage could disappear unless the government provides direct financial support, according to an independent report on the future of the British media, which warns the industry\u2019s collapse poses a threat to the \u201clong-term sustainability of democracy\u201d. Dame Frances Cairncross was appointed by the government last year to investigate ways to secure the future of high-quality journalism in Britain. Her report has concluded there should be a public investigation into the dominance of Facebook and Google in the advertising marketplace. She also recommends a new regulator to oversee the relationship between news outlets and technology giants, which have taken much of the advertising revenue that used to subsidise reporting. But the Cairncross review also concluded that many local newspapers which are vital to a functioning democracy are owned by debt-laden publishers which have cut investment and sacked hundreds of journalists in an effort to maintain profit margins. She drew parallels with once-dominant businesses which have failed to make the digital leap, such as Kodak or Blockbuster, and said the priority should be ensuring high-quality journalism continues to be produced in Britain rather than attempting to save the newspaper industry in its current form. Key recommendations in the report include: Direct funding for public-interest news outlets, with public funds used to support the reporting of local democracy through a new institute of public interest news. An investigation by the competition regulator into the online advertising marketplace, which would consider whether Facebook and Google\u2019s position is too dominant. A new code of conduct between publishers and large tech companies, overseen by a regulator which would ensure tech firms treat news publishers fairly. Tax relief for publishers which invest in public interest journalism, potentially by giving charitable status to some publishers. Removing the 20% VAT tax on digital news subscriptions, bringing online paywalls in line with printed newspapers. Cairncross said that job losses at local newspapers meant there was a crisis in the coverage of democracy. \u201cThe cost of investigative journalism is great and rarely seems to pay for itself \u2026 given the evidence of a market failure in the supply of public-interest news, public intervention may be the only remedy.\u201d She added that there was no clear way to provide profitable coverage of a local council meeting, since such stories tend to attract few clicks on the internet. \u201cUltimately, the biggest challenge facing the sustainability of high-quality journalism, and the press, may be the same as that which is affecting many areas of life: the digital revolution means that people have more claims on their attention than ever before. \u201cMoreover, the stories people want to read may not always be the ones that they ought to read in order to ensure that a democracy can hold its public servants properly to account.\u201d Sales of printed newspapers have collapsed during the last decade, with revenue from print advertising following the same downward trend. Although audiences have switched online, even national publishers have struggled to make similar sums of money from digital advertising given the scale and targeting offered by the likes of Facebook and Google. Research commissioned for the Cairncross report found that the number of frontline journalists in the UK fell from an estimated 23,000 in 2007 to 17,000 today, with redundancies and closures of titles expected to continue. Local newspapers have been particularly badly hit by the changes, especially in the classified market. Revenues from advertising placed by small businesses with the three biggest regional publishing companies fell from \u00a32.8bn to \u00a3832m in the decade to 2016. However, publishers did not escape criticism. Cairncross pointed out that many local newspaper groups have had to deal with large pension and debt liabilities, built up when they went on costly acquisition sprees before the market collapsed in the late 2000s. Cairncross said this means the likes of Reach plc and JPI Media have had \u201cless money available for investment in the substantial innovation that a successful digital future requires\u201d, instead making cuts or restructuring their debt to the detriment of newsrooms. In an attempt to fix the problem she has proposed the establishment of an institute for public interest news, which could distribute funding from both the government and other sources, building on the success of the BBC local democracy reporter project and modest spending on journalism projects by Google and Facebook. She said an independent institution was necessary because if the state or large technology companies directly financed the production of news \u201cthe effect may be to undermine trust in the press still further\u201d. Cairncross concluded that the internet had been good for consumers, enabling them to read a wide variety of news sources for nothing. She also rejected proposals from publishers that Facebook and Google should be made to pay to include news content on their systems, warning that such a move could cause \u201csignificant harm to people who want to see news\u201d. She suggested that the BBC needed to avoid stepping on the toes of for-profit local news sites. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, said the government would consider the report in full and report back this year.

      "bodyText": "After the giddying excitement of the second day in St Lucia, one that produced 16 wickets and was headlined by an electric burst of genuine fast bowling from Mark Wood, came a slightly less helter-skelter third. The DJ in the party stand tried to rouse the audience with an assortment of thorax-thumping tunes. But for much of the action this felt out of kilter, with Test cricket\u2019s more natural rhythms to the fore as England tightened their grip on a game that is leaving a huge sense of \u201cwhat if\u201d regarding the two that came before. Having climbed the mountain and secured the series with a Test to spare, the West Indies attack finally creaked. Keemo Paul departed early with a badly torn quad muscle and thereafter the burden became heavier for Shannon Gabriel, Kemar Roach and Alzarri Joseph, despite support from Roston Chase. For England\u2019s top three \u2013 Rory Burns, Keaton Jennings and Joe Denly \u2013 this represented not just their final outing on tour but, given a lead of 142 at the start of the day, a golden opportunity to meet Joe Root\u2019s pre-match brief and make compelling cases for selection in this summer\u2019s Ashes series. With five and a half months before the one-off four-day Test against Ireland at Lord\u2019s \u2013 England\u2019s next and final outing in the format before taking on Australia from 1 August \u2013 it was bit of a throwaway line from Root. The World Cup means there is plenty of county cricket to come before the next Test selection and, as Haseeb Hameed discovered in 2017, when the Champions Trophy created a similar delay and he struggled back at Lancashire, even a positive sign-off from a winter tour guarantees little. Nevertheless England\u2019s openers here in St Lucia, Burns and Jennings, require strong starts to the season and in the case of the latter a compelling one that is not simply about his volume of runs for the Red Rose. Jennings, bowled off his thigh pad by Joseph after a 99-ball 23, swapped his usual swing of the bat for a wry smile and will doubtless feel unlucky to end his tour in such fashion. But in light of his struggle to play with much conviction up to this point, or indeed in any of his four innings in a seam-dominated series, England\u2019s selectors will surely be looking not simply at his output but whether greater fluidity at the crease is discernible. Burns, curiously, looks more the part despite his average after six Tests, 25, sitting a tick under his partner\u2019s 25.19 from 17.

The Surrey captain, perhaps conditioned by the demands of his county job, has shown little sign of being overawed by the step up and a pair of fine catches during Wood\u2019s day-two wrecking job point to a clear mind. Provided he does not flatline from here Burns looks better placed to remain in situ. All of which brings us to the more recently introduced Denly, who, after 20 in the first innings, produced an aesthetically pleasing \u2013 but numerically head-scratching \u2013 69 from No 3. How this innings is viewed may well depend on who is viewing it. Those who feel the 32-year-old has been over-promoted by his former Kent team-mate Ed Smith will point to an astonishing drop on 12 by Shimron Hetmyer at slip and a dismissal, under-edging Gabriel on the cut, that was loose both for the same shot striking fresh air the ball before and as the fast bowler was approaching a rest. But during his two and a half hours at the crease Denly also threaded crisp drives, played some smart uppercuts and offered stout defence when the trio of West Indian quicks were at their freshest.

He was arrested on arrival after Bahrain obtained an Interpol red notice arrest warrant against him, even though Interpol policy dictates that red notices cannot be issued against refugees on behalf of the countries they fled.</p> \n<p>Al-Araibi had been jailed and beaten in Bahrain during a crackdown on pro-democracy athletes. He was later sentenced in absentia to 10 years in jail over an act of vandalism he maintains he could not have committed because he was playing in a televised football match.</p> \n<p>Before Monday Bahrain had stood firm on its allegations against Al-Araibi and denial of all accusations of human rights abuses, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/01/hakeem-al-araibi-supporters-say-fifa-and-ioc-must-threaten-sanctions-against-bahrain\">a mounting international scandal</a>.</p> \n<p>Al-Araibi was released from Bangkok remand prison on Monday afternoon and was taken straight to Bangkok airport to board a midnight flight to Melbourne, where his wife and his Melbourne football team, Pascoe Vale, are expected to greet him when he lands.</p> \n<p>Looking tired but elated as he boarded the plane, Al-Araibi was prevented from speaking to the press by his escort of a dozen immigration officers, but beamed as he hurriedly said: \u201cI am so happy. I cannot wait to go home to my wife.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gulf democracy advocates and Al-Araibi\u2019s Thai lawyer had confirmed earlier that the Thai government had pulled the extradition case out of the courts.</p> \n<p>Thailand\u2019s head of immigration police, Surachate Hakparn, said the ministry of foreign affairs had received \u201cnew information\u201d and petitioned the court to drop the case.</p> \n<p>Chatchom Akapin, the director general of the international affairs department of the attorney general\u2019s office, said the primary reason was because \u201cthe Bahrain government no longer wants to pursue the extradition\u201d of al-Araibi. Chatchom said he did not know why Bahrain had dropped the extradition request. \u201cMr Hakeem is a free man now,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>The abrupt change in Bahrain\u2019s position came a day after <a href=\"https://www.bna.bh/en/HRHCrownPrincereceivestheMinisterofForeignAffairsofThailand.aspx?cms=q8FmFJgiscL2fwIzON1%2bDhf6xYXQdCgooLiFEXsJFdg%3d\">the Thai foreign minister visited the crown prince</a>, Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, in Manama to discuss \u201cbilateral relations between Bahrain and Thailand and reviewed areas of mutual interest\u201d.</p> \n<p>Bahrain\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs acknowledged the development in a vaguely worded statement, which maintained Al-Araibi\u2019s guilt.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its right to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr Al-Araibi,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>The Guardian has contacted the ministry for clarification.</p> \n<p>Australia has repeatedly demanded Al-Araibi\u2019s return, and as pressure increased on Thailand its foreign ministry released a statement last week saying it held no responsibility for the situation and the two nations had to sort it out between themselves.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jan/24/david-squires-on-saving-hakeem-al-araibi-before-its-too-late\">David Squires on ... saving Hakeem al-Araibi \u2013 before it's too late</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of advocacy of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said Al-Araibi\u2019s release was a \u201chuge victory for the human rights movement\u201d in the three nations involved, and globally.</p> \n<p>\u201cHakeem\u2019s ordeal ended after 76 days when there was a clear public stance and solidarity movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe football community, the human rights movement and all of those who dedicated their time and efforts to end this injustice were rewarded.\u201d</p> \n<p>The case has raised numerous serious questions about the practices of Interpol and Australian agencies that allowed Bahrain to use international law enforcement to chase down a refugee. The Australian federal police, acting as the local bureau of Interpol, notified Thailand that Al-Araibi was subject to a red notice and on his way to them, without also saying he was a refugee afforded Australian protection.</p> \n<p>Craig Foster, the former Australian football captain and commentator who has spearheaded the campaign to free Al-Araibi, said the most important thing was his immediate wellbeing.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be tears there tonight, as there are in our household right now,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He later said it was \u201ca win for people power\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a win for saying you can\u2019t contravene international law; we will not allow it to occur. And that\u2019s just people. It\u2019s been an amazing movement to be involved in.\u201d</p> \n<p>The case has also shone a spotlight on the governance and international power of world football organisations. Sheikh Salman Al Khalifa, a Bahraini royal, was criticised by al-Araibi in 2016 when he was seeking election to the presidency of Fifa.

      "bodyText": "The refugee Bahraini footballer Hakeem al-Araibi has boarded a flight to Australia after Thai authorities withdrew an extradition case against him. Thai authorities said the Bahraini government had decided to end its pursuit of Al-Araibi, who fled Bahrain in 2014 before being granted permanent residence in Australia, where he has lived since. Al-Araibi, 25, has spent more than 70 days in detention after travelling to Bangkok for a honeymoon with his wife on 27 November. He was arrested on arrival after Bahrain obtained an Interpol red notice arrest warrant against him, even though Interpol policy dictates that red notices cannot be issued against refugees on behalf of the countries they fled. Al-Araibi had been jailed and beaten in Bahrain during a crackdown on pro-democracy athletes. He was later sentenced in absentia to 10 years in jail over an act of vandalism he maintains he could not have committed because he was playing in a televised football match. Before Monday Bahrain had stood firm on its allegations against Al-Araibi and denial of all accusations of human rights abuses, despite a mounting international scandal. Al-Araibi was released from Bangkok remand prison on Monday afternoon and was taken straight to Bangkok airport to board a midnight flight to Melbourne, where his wife and his Melbourne football team, Pascoe Vale, are expected to greet him when he lands. Looking tired but elated as he boarded the plane, Al-Araibi was prevented from speaking to the press by his escort of a dozen immigration officers, but beamed as he hurriedly said: \u201cI am so happy. I cannot wait to go home to my wife.\u201d Gulf democracy advocates and Al-Araibi\u2019s Thai lawyer had confirmed earlier that the Thai government had pulled the extradition case out of the courts. Thailand\u2019s head of immigration police, Surachate Hakparn, said the ministry of foreign affairs had received \u201cnew information\u201d and petitioned the court to drop the case. Chatchom Akapin, the director general of the international affairs department of the attorney general\u2019s office, said the primary reason was because \u201cthe Bahrain government no longer wants to pursue the extradition\u201d of al-Araibi. Chatchom said he did not know why Bahrain had dropped the extradition request. \u201cMr Hakeem is a free man now,\u201d he added. The abrupt change in Bahrain\u2019s position came a day after the Thai foreign minister visited the crown prince, Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, in Manama to discuss \u201cbilateral relations between Bahrain and Thailand and reviewed areas of mutual interest\u201d. Bahrain\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs acknowledged the development in a vaguely worded statement, which maintained Al-Araibi\u2019s guilt. \u201cThe Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its right to pursue all necessary legal actions against Mr Al-Araibi,\u201d it said. The Guardian has contacted the ministry for clarification. Australia has repeatedly demanded Al-Araibi\u2019s return, and as pressure increased on Thailand its foreign ministry released a statement last week saying it held no responsibility for the situation and the two nations had to sort it out between themselves. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of advocacy of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said Al-Araibi\u2019s release was a \u201chuge victory for the human rights movement\u201d in the three nations involved, and globally. \u201cHakeem\u2019s ordeal ended after 76 days when there was a clear public stance and solidarity movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe football community, the human rights movement and all of those who dedicated their time and efforts to end this injustice were rewarded.\u201d The case has raised numerous serious questions about the practices of Interpol and Australian agencies that allowed Bahrain to use international law enforcement to chase down a refugee. The Australian federal police, acting as the local bureau of Interpol, notified Thailand that Al-Araibi was subject to a red notice and on his way to them, without also saying he was a refugee afforded Australian protection. Craig Foster, the former Australian football captain and commentator who has spearheaded the campaign to free Al-Araibi, said the most important thing was his immediate wellbeing. \u201cThere\u2019ll be tears there tonight, as there are in our household right now,\u201d he said. He later said it was \u201ca win for people power\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for saying you can\u2019t contravene international law; we will not allow it to occur. And that\u2019s just people. It\u2019s been an amazing movement to be involved in.\u201d The case has also shone a spotlight on the governance and international power of world football organisations. Sheikh Salman Al Khalifa, a Bahraini royal, was criticised by al-Araibi in 2016 when he was seeking election to the presidency of Fifa. Al-Araibi spoke out about Sheikh Salman\u2019s failure to protect Bahraini footballers during the crackdown and while he was head of the Bahrain football association. Sheikh Salman is now president of the Asian Football Confederation and vice-president of Fifa, but has said nothing publicly about the case. When pushed, the AFC suddenly announced Sheikh Salman had recused himself from regional responsibility 18 months earlier. Foster told SBS news the issues around this case were not just about Al-Araibi but about \u201cthe soul of sport\u201d and the circumstances around the actions of world football bodies and their leadership needed urgent investigation. \u201cFootball and sport needs to have a very significant look at itself after this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to say how do these people incarcerate athletes and torture some of them, and rise to positions of influence and prestige in global sport.\u201d",

Al-Araibi, 25, has spent more than 70 days in detention after travelling to Bangkok for a honeymoon with his wife on 27 November. Looking tired but elated as he boarded the plane, the footballer was prevented from speaking to the press by his escort of a dozen immigration officers, but beamed as he hurriedly said: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/thailand-to-free-bahraini-footballer-hakeem-al-araibi\">\u201cI am so happy. I cannot wait to go home to my wife.\u201d</a></p> <p><strong>Labor has shifted its position on the medical transfer bill.</strong> After a substantial rhetorical bombardment \u2013 including misrepresentations about the detail of the legislation \u2013 by the Morrison government, Labor will now seek agreement for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/11/labor-shifts-position-on-medical-transfer-bill-under-pressure-from-government\">three amendments</a> that might scuttle the proposal once it returns to the parliament, allowing Scott Morrison to claim a significant political victory. The three amendments are: increasing the discretion of the home affairs minister to refuse medical transfers for asylum seekers; to make the timeframes for decision making less restrictive; and to ensure the procedures only applied to the cohort now on Manus Island and Nauru.</p> <p><strong>It could take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/12/it-could-take-two-years-to-replace-flammable-cladding-in-melbourne-says-building-authority\">two years</a> to remove and replace Melbourne\u2019s combustible aluminium polyethylene composite panels</strong> \u2013 the building material implicated in London\u2019s Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 \u2013 from high-rise apartments and hotels, the Victorian Building Authority says. An audit of 2,000 buildings has found 360 to be high risk, 280 of moderate risk and 140 of low risk. Victoria is now calling for a nationwide ban on imports of the material. The Neo200 apartment building on Spencer Street, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/04/apartment-fire-in-melbournes-spencer-street-prompts-new-fears-over-cladding\">which caught fire last week</a>, was classified as a moderate risk.</p> <p><strong>Labor has asked the corporate regulator to investigate a lobbying firm that donated a large amount to the Queensland Liberal National party \u2013 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/12/labor-seeks-inquiry-into-firms-donations-to-liberals-despite-financial-trouble\">despite being in financial turmoil</a>. Shac Communications went bust in 2013 owing $129,000 \u2013 including to the tax office \u2013 but just before it was wound up the firm donated $112,000 to the LNP.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 12 February. Top stories Hakeem al-Araibi, the refugee Bahraini footballer, has boarded a flight to Australia after Thai authorities withdrew an extradition case against him. Thai authorities said the Bahraini government had decided to end its pursuit of Al-Araibi, who fled Bahrain in 2014 before being granted permanent residence in Australia, where he has lived since. Al-Araibi, 25, has spent more than 70 days in detention after travelling to Bangkok for a honeymoon with his wife on 27 November. Looking tired but elated as he boarded the plane, the footballer was prevented from speaking to the press by his escort of a dozen immigration officers, but beamed as he hurriedly said: \u201cI am so happy. I cannot wait to go home to my wife.\u201d Labor has shifted its position on the medical transfer bill. After a substantial rhetorical bombardment \u2013 including misrepresentations about the detail of the legislation \u2013 by the Morrison government, Labor will now seek agreement for three amendments that might scuttle the proposal once it returns to the parliament, allowing Scott Morrison to claim a significant political victory. The three amendments are: increasing the discretion of the home affairs minister to refuse medical transfers for asylum seekers; to make the timeframes for decision making less restrictive; and to ensure the procedures only applied to the cohort now on Manus Island and Nauru. It could take two years to remove and replace Melbourne\u2019s combustible aluminium polyethylene composite panels \u2013 the building material implicated in London\u2019s Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 \u2013 from high-rise apartments and hotels, the Victorian Building Authority says. An audit of 2,000 buildings has found 360 to be high risk, 280 of moderate risk and 140 of low risk. Victoria is now calling for a nationwide ban on imports of the material. The Neo200 apartment building on Spencer Street, which caught fire last week, was classified as a moderate risk. Labor has asked the corporate regulator to investigate a lobbying firm that donated a large amount to the Queensland Liberal National party \u2013 despite being in financial turmoil. Shac Communications went bust in 2013 owing $129,000 \u2013 including to the tax office \u2013 but just before it was wound up the firm donated $112,000 to the LNP. The shadow treasurer, Andrew Leigh, has written to Asic asking it to find out if the company put the donations before payments to creditors. He also believes the firm\u2019s directors could have breached corporate rules. World Questions have been raised about the US tax affairs of Tatiana Navka, a former Olympic ice dancing champion and the wife of Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, after records suggested she may have failed to declare her true income to US regulators and not disclosed foreign bank accounts. Theresa May is to update MPs on her Brexit progress on Tuesday, a day earlier than previously announced, No 10 has said, while stressing the prime minister had ruled out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal of a departure deal involving customs union membership. Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari was elected four years ago on a wave of disgust at the perceived avarice of Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration \u2013 but as he fights for a second term in Saturday\u2019s election, his efforts to bring corruption under control are widely seen as a failure. In northern India at least 99 people have died and scores have been admitted to hospital after drinking toxic alcohol. Police suspect the moonshine was laced with methanol.

In relishing the prospect of United\u2019s first ever meeting with Paris Saint-Germain in Tuesday\u2019s Champions League last-16 first leg, Solskj\u00e6r was once more in tune with those in the stands.

When our new coach came in he had a lot of confidence, a lot of determination, that was really helpful. We are trying to pay him back in kind and things are working out well at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>This, again, will chime sweetly for fans who grew, in the main, to detest Mourinho\u2019s dour approach. All managers require luck and the stars have aligned for Solskj\u00e6r with regard to the absences of PSG\u2019s Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Thomas Meunier through injury.</p> \n<p>\u201cAny team that is missing players like Neymar, Cavani, Meunier will miss them,\u201d says Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cBut it gives other players a chance. It makes it more unpredictable for us, who they will play. When you see that front three, you know how they will play so we are guessing a bit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Solskj\u00e6r has scouted the French champions. \u201cIt is difficult to compare games because when they play in the league, they know they are going to win it anyway so they approach it differently to the Champions League,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is always nice to see players live, you see different spaces, principles \u2013 you saw how lightning quick Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is. You try to do due diligence.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has been fantastic to see their progress. I played against them for Molde in 1995 in the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup.

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was again note-perfect when stating it has been too long since a great European night for Manchester United at Old Trafford. After 10 wins in 11 games under their interim manager, United supporters are enjoying the ride and the attacking style of play he has brought back to the club. In relishing the prospect of United\u2019s first ever meeting with Paris Saint-Germain in Tuesday\u2019s Champions League last-16 first leg, Solskj\u00e6r was once more in tune with those in the stands. Yet his populist act is backed up by a real sense that PSG can be eliminated from the competition. \u201cMaybe one of the last exciting knockout games was against Real Madrid, when Nani was sent off,\u201d he said. That was Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s final European game, a 2-1 loss in March 2013. \u201cWe had Bayern too [under David Moyes in 2014]. The players and the supporters have been looking forward to this, they have always been special these nights. Maybe my last [as a player] was Roma when we won 7-1. We lost 2-1 away [first] and the manager was so happy. He said: \u2018That\u2019s OK, we will win at home.\u2019\u201d Solskj\u00e6r believes United may surprise a few teams and go all the way to this year\u2019s final. If the notion of United reaching the competition\u2019s showpiece seems fanciful, so did the thought of United closing the 11-point gap to fourth place when the Norwegian took over from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in December. If still an outside prospect, Solskj\u00e6r has at least made his players believe anyone can be beaten. Modern football is all about man-management and his has been impeccable, particularly when compared with his predecessor. Anthony Martial, for one, believes Mourinho\u2019s sacking has liberated United. \u201cWe have got a coach who has different intentions and we are trying to do what we asks,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps it is easier to play this style of football and not the style of football he [Mourinho] asked. When our new coach came in he had a lot of confidence, a lot of determination, that was really helpful. We are trying to pay him back in kind and things are working out well at the moment.\u201d This, again, will chime sweetly for fans who grew, in the main, to detest Mourinho\u2019s dour approach. All managers require luck and the stars have aligned for Solskj\u00e6r with regard to the absences of PSG\u2019s Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Thomas Meunier through injury. \u201cAny team that is missing players like Neymar, Cavani, Meunier will miss them,\u201d says Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cBut it gives other players a chance. It makes it more unpredictable for us, who they will play. When you see that front three, you know how they will play so we are guessing a bit.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r has scouted the French champions. \u201cIt is difficult to compare games because when they play in the league, they know they are going to win it anyway so they approach it differently to the Champions League,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is always nice to see players live, you see different spaces, principles \u2013 you saw how lightning quick Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is. You try to do due diligence. \u201cIt has been fantastic to see their progress. I played against them for Molde in 1995 in the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. The difference in their challenge now is fantastic. They have got some of the world\u2019s best players, one of the biggest goalkeeper legends in Gianluigi Buffon, Thiago Silva has been one of the best centre-backs, they have one of the most exciting young players in Mbapp\u00e9, and the most expensive ever in Neymar. That tells you everything about their evolution.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r exudes supreme confidence in the depth of his resources, though, claiming that no one is guaranteed a place in his first XI. \u201cI have got a big strong squad,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid de Gea, for example, is a clear No 1 but Sergio Romero is a fantastic goalkeeper, played in a World Cup final, 96 caps for Argentina. \u201cThe depth in the squad is very good and we want to play our best football as often as possible.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r continues to draw the best from Martial, whose run from inside United\u2019s half to score in Saturday\u2019s 3-0 win at Fulham was reminiscent of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s goal in a 2-1 win at the same venue in 2007. \u201cHe is asking me to attack more. That is my job after all. To make the difference to be more decisive. Things are working out well for the other attackers and I hope we can continue to be as effective,\u201d said the 23-year-old Martial, who is listening to Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s demand to score more \u201cugly goals\u201d. \u201cHe has often said that to me and even previous managers have said that \u2013 that you have to work on this. If I do manage to do that, get beyond the defence, I think I will score more goals.\u201d Martial, like surely all United players, would be happy to have Solskj\u00e6r be made the permanent manager. \u201cWe hope we can continue but the final decision isn\u2019t with us,\u201d he said.

Officers are working around the clock to locate this suspect and bring him into custody.\u201d</p> <p>There were two stabbings in the capital on Saturday.

      "bodyText": "A man who was stabbed to death in the early hours of Sunday after a row in a shop in East Dulwich, south-east London, has been identified. The Metropolitan police said on Monday evening that while they were still awaiting formal identification, the force was confident the victim was Dennis Anderson, 39, from Lewisham, south-east London. The Met appealed for information about the killing, which was one of a string of violent incidents to take place in the capital at the weekend. Reports had suggested Anderson was attacked when an argument broke out after he refused to give a man cigarettes. On Monday, DI Domenica Catino from Scotland Yard\u2019s homicide and major crime command said: \u201cWe are aware of speculation around the motive for this attack and can now confirm that the suspect approached Mr Anderson in an off-licence shop before an altercation broke out and the suspect delivered a fatal attack. \u201cOur top priorities now are to support Mr Anderson\u2019s family and catch the person responsible for this horrible attack. Officers are working around the clock to locate this suspect and bring him into custody.\u201d There were two stabbings in the capital on Saturday. Last year, there were 128 homicides in London, the highest number in a calendar year this decade. Scotland Yard\u2019s murder investigation unit has lost 25% of its officers and staff over a decade. Earlier on Monday, it was announced that knife crime offenders in London will be tagged with tracking devices upon their release from prison in an attempt to reduce violence. Those who have served custodial sentences for knife-related crimes such as possession, robbery, wounding, grievous bodily harm and aggravated burglary will be subject to the tagging under a year-long pilot scheme. The programme, beginning on 18 February, will be used on up to 100 offenders deemed likely to reoffend in four London boroughs that have among the highest rates of knife crime \u2013 Lewisham, Lambeth, Croydon and Southwark. The tags will automatically check the movements of the offenders against the location of reported crimes, and share significant matches with the police. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cThe causes of violent crime are extremely complex and involve deep-seated problems \u2013 such as poverty, inequality, social alienation and a lack of opportunities for young people \u2013 that enforcement alone won\u2019t solve and have been made much worse by huge government cuts to the police and preventative services. \u201cThis innovative pilot will build on the good work of the City Hall-funded violent crime taskforce by helping offenders integrate back into society and reducing the risk of reoffending, as well as giving the police the information they need to thoroughly investigate reported crimes.\u201d Carina Heckroodt, the head of the London extremism, gangs and organised crime unit in the National Probation Service, said: \u201cThese tags will provide a constant physical reminder of an offender\u2019s licence conditions, encouraging them to comply with their restrictions and deterring them from further offending, and protecting victims.\u201d On Saturday evening, a 23-year-old man was left in a critical condition after he was stabbed in Neasden, north-west London.

The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said his opposite number had been shown to be \u201coff the Richter scale of incompetence\u201d after the demise of plans involving the startup Seaborne Freight. A report by Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog found the Department for Transport (DfT) \u201cspent approximately \u00a3800,000 on its external consultants Slaughter and May, Deloitte and Mott MacDonald\u201d. The National Audit Office said the consultancy Mott MacDonald identified \u201csignificant execution risks\u201d relating to the Seaborne bid. Deloitte could not make a formal assessment of Seaborne because it had only been incorporated in April 2017, auditors said. The emergence of the spending appears to contradict Grayling\u2019s statement in the House of Commons on Monday, when he said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t spent any money on this contract.\u201d After the DfT awarded a \u00a313.8m contract to Seaborne to operate freight ferries from Ramsgate to the Belgian port of Ostend in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it emerged the company had no ships and had seemingly borrowed the terms and conditions on its website from a food delivery business.

The chairwoman of the public accounts select committee, Meg Hillier, said the scrapping of the contract raised \u201cserious issues\u201d to be discussed at a meeting on Wednesday with DfT officials. \u201cThe Department for Transport waited until September 2018 to start thinking about the risks to freight transport across these important routes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be pressing the department for answers on how it awarded its three new ferry contracts, what it is doing to manage risks and exactly what it intends to do now it has axed the contract with Seaborne.\u201d Meanwhile, the company behind Eurotunnel launched a high court action against the DfT, accusing the government of a \u201csecretive and flawed procurement exercise\u201d for the backup ferry service in the event of a no-deal Brexit. At a hearing in London on Monday, Eurotunnel\u2019s barrister, Daniel Beard QC, said the procurement process for \u201cadditional capacity for transport of goods across the Channel\u201d had been \u201cundertaken without any public notice being issued\u201d. Ewan West, representing Grayling, told the judge the process was only for \u201cmaritime freight\u201d services and, therefore, Eurotunnel \u201ccould never have provided that capacity\u201d and \u201ccould not have complied\u201d with the terms of the contracts. The judge scheduled a four-day, expedited trial for 1 March, given the \u201cobvious\u201d urgency of the case and the \u201cvery important public interest matters\u201d involved.",

Just how hopeless does the transport secretary have to be for Theresa May to confess that she might just have the slightest doubt about his abilities? Whatever kompromat Grayling holds over her must be devastating.</p> <p>Grayling is a one-man disaster zone. A figure of such great incompetence is usually only found in cartoons. The only talent Grayling has ever displayed in any of his government jobs is for doing them badly. It\u2019s no longer just me who calls him Failing Grayling. Almost everyone does. Including the rest of the cabinet. His reputation now precedes him even in France, where he has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/chris-grayling-not-welcome-in-calais-says-ports-chairman\">banned from entering the port of Calais</a>.

      "bodyText": "Earlier in the day the prime minister had once again expressed her full confidence in Chris Grayling. Which left unanswered the question of why. Just how hopeless does the transport secretary have to be for Theresa May to confess that she might just have the slightest doubt about his abilities? Whatever kompromat Grayling holds over her must be devastating. Grayling is a one-man disaster zone. A figure of such great incompetence is usually only found in cartoons. The only talent Grayling has ever displayed in any of his government jobs is for doing them badly. It\u2019s no longer just me who calls him Failing Grayling. Almost everyone does. Including the rest of the cabinet. His reputation now precedes him even in France, where he has been banned from entering the port of Calais. They\u2019ve got enough troubles of their own en France, merci beaucoup. It\u2019s now also clear that not even Grayling has confidence in Grayling.

      "body": "<p>Angry MPs have demanded further action against antisemitism after Labour revealed it has investigated 673 alleged cases and expelled 12 party members since last April.</p> <p>The party revealed the figures in an email to MPs, and suggested no earlier figures could be compiled because there was \u201cno consistent and comprehensive system for recording and processing cases of antisemitism\u201d.</p> <p>However, the party\u2019s former general secretary Iain McNicol disputed that claim in a private meeting with Labour MPs on Monday night, saying such a system had been in place. MPs who met for the weekly parliamentary Labour party meeting suggested they would demand that the Labour leadership return to answer questions about the criteria for judging cases.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/18/jeremy-corbyn-labour-antisemitism-margaret-hodge\">Margaret Hodge</a> was among the MPs who questioned the statistics after the meeting, saying she alone had submitted more than 200 examples of \u201cvile antisemitism\u201d where she believed the evidence showed they had connections with Labour. \u201cThere has been a breakdown in trust,\u201d the veteran MP said.</p> <p>Releasing the disciplinary data for the first time, the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, said 96 members had been suspended and 211 had been issued with a notice of investigation. Another 146 had been given a preliminary warning and 220 cases did not have sufficient evidence to proceed.</p> <p>MPs will demand at next week\u2019s meeting that the party spell out why many members were deemed to deserve only a preliminary warning, and the criteria by which they were judged.</p> <p>The Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/01/labour-leadership-urged-to-adequately-tackle-antisemitism\">submitted a motion</a> last week calling for more transparency on antisemitism cases, said she hoped for more clarity on how officials had decided which cases should receive a \u201creminder of conduct\u201d, which leads to no further action.</p> <p>\u201cIt begs the question: what criteria is being used if that is how an investigation is resolved? There are still a lot of questions that need to be answered,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The data suggests that among the 307 cases where members were investigated or suspended, decisions have been made by Labour\u2019s governing national executive committee (NEC) in around a third of them, and more than 40 members left the party of their own volition.</p> <p>Forty-two members have been referred to Labour\u2019s highest disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee (NCC), the only panel with the power to expel members.</p> <p>Nineteen cases are currently outstanding from that committee. So far, the NCC has expelled 12 members and six have received other sanctions.

      "bodyText": "Angry MPs have demanded further action against antisemitism after Labour revealed it has investigated 673 alleged cases and expelled 12 party members since last April. The party revealed the figures in an email to MPs, and suggested no earlier figures could be compiled because there was \u201cno consistent and comprehensive system for recording and processing cases of antisemitism\u201d. However, the party\u2019s former general secretary Iain McNicol disputed that claim in a private meeting with Labour MPs on Monday night, saying such a system had been in place. MPs who met for the weekly parliamentary Labour party meeting suggested they would demand that the Labour leadership return to answer questions about the criteria for judging cases. Margaret Hodge was among the MPs who questioned the statistics after the meeting, saying she alone had submitted more than 200 examples of \u201cvile antisemitism\u201d where she believed the evidence showed they had connections with Labour. \u201cThere has been a breakdown in trust,\u201d the veteran MP said. Releasing the disciplinary data for the first time, the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, said 96 members had been suspended and 211 had been issued with a notice of investigation. Another 146 had been given a preliminary warning and 220 cases did not have sufficient evidence to proceed. MPs will demand at next week\u2019s meeting that the party spell out why many members were deemed to deserve only a preliminary warning, and the criteria by which they were judged. The Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, who submitted a motion last week calling for more transparency on antisemitism cases, said she hoped for more clarity on how officials had decided which cases should receive a \u201creminder of conduct\u201d, which leads to no further action. \u201cIt begs the question: what criteria is being used if that is how an investigation is resolved? There are still a lot of questions that need to be answered,\u201d she said. The data suggests that among the 307 cases where members were investigated or suspended, decisions have been made by Labour\u2019s governing national executive committee (NEC) in around a third of them, and more than 40 members left the party of their own volition. Forty-two members have been referred to Labour\u2019s highest disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee (NCC), the only panel with the power to expel members. Nineteen cases are currently outstanding from that committee. So far, the NCC has expelled 12 members and six have received other sanctions. Five have left the party of their own accord. Formby said the party had previously been of the view that disciplinary statistics should remain confidential because of how they could be \u201cmisinterpreted or misused for other purposes by the party\u2019s political rivals\u201d. However, she said that because of the \u201cimportance of rebuilding trust with Jewish communities\u201d she had pushed NEC officers to agree to the release of the data. The data also indicates a large number of complaints \u2013 more than 400 in total \u2013 about non-Labour members. A Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cThese figures relate to about 0.1% of our membership, but one antisemite in our party is one too many. We are committed to tackling antisemitism and rooting it out of our party once and for all.\u201d Formby said she rejected claims from some quarters that antisemitism allegations were a smear. \u201cI have seen hard evidence of it and that is why I have been so determined to do whatever is possible to eliminate it from the party,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also the reason why I made it a priority to implement robust procedures to deal with it whenever it is identified.\u201d MPs leaving the meeting on Monday night said they felt deflated. \u201cThe bigger issue in all this is a lack of solidarity for Jewish MPs and an expectation of needing to prove everything with the party, rather than support for victims of racism,\u201d one said. Formby said she had attempted to reopen conversations with Jewish community organisations to rebuild trust over the past few weeks. It is understood she had a private meeting with the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Marie van der Zyl. Formby suggested there were still some key disagreements upon which Jewish groups felt they could not engage. \u201cI very much hope this will change as I remain absolutely committed to engaging and working together with Jewish community organisations at all times,\u201d she said.",

Instead, the chancellor needs to start spending and would benefit the economy by taking an opportunity do so.",

      "bodyText": "A computer activist who successfully resisted attempts to extradite him to the US over alleged hacking has applied for the return of his confiscated computers, after the National Crime Agency confirmed he is still under investigation. Lauri Love, 34, requested several computers and the data on them be handed back. His equipment was taken when he was first arrested under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 by the NCA at his home in Suffolk in 2013. He has continued to protest his innocence and has not been charged. Love applied at Hendon magistrates court in north London for his possessions to be returned. Love\u2019s move to recover his computers follows a failed attempt last year to extradite him to the US to face prosecution for allegedly breaking into government agencies such as the Federal Reserve, the army, the US Department of Defense, Nasa and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013. In the extradition hearing, the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, and Mr Justice Ouseley said it would be \u201coppressive\u201d to send him for trial in US courts because Love has Asperger syndrome and other health difficulties. He might either have been rendered suicidal or medically unfit to enter a plea, the judges concluded. The high court also said: \u201cIt would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr Love in England for the offences alleged against him. Far from it. Much of Mr Love\u2019s argument was based on the contention that this is indeed where he should be prosecuted.\u201d One year on, Love has not been charged with any computer hacking offences. He denies wrongdoing. The district judge at Hendon, Margot Coleman, made an order that the hearing could be heard in public, but only limited details could be reported, such as the fact that the application had been made, what the application relates to and the outcome of the hearing. She did, however, seek confirmation from the counsel for the NCA and allow reporting of the fact its investigation of Love is continuing. His confiscated property was listed as a Fujitsu Siemens laptop, an Acer computer tower, a Compaq computer tower, a Samsung laptop and attachments, an SD card, a Western Digital hard drive and a hard drive fitted within a laptop. The judge reserved judgment to 19 February at Westminster magistrates court.",

      "bodyText": "Britain has signed a trade continuity agreement with Switzerland to avoid disruption for thousands of businesses post-Brexit, less than 50 days before the UK is due to leave the EU. The Department for International Trade said the agreement would maintain UK-Swiss trade under the preferential terms currently available to both countries through an EU free trade deal. It comes as ministers rush to ensure the continuity of about 40 free trade deals held by the EU covering more than 70 countries, which Britain currently has access to via EU membership but will lose after Brexit. Ministers have conceded in private meetings with business leaders that they will not be able to replace all of the deals before the Brexit deadline on 29 March, meaning a large proportion of UK exports could shift to World Trade Organization rules. This would mean higher border tariffs and extra costs for companies in Britain and abroad. Japan has sought to extract hefty concessions from Britain before Brexit, while talks with many nations have been delayed by the lack of clarity over Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. The trade between Britain and the countries and regions covered by the EU free trade agreements amounts to about 14% of all UK goods imports and exports each year, worth as much as \u00a3117bn in 2017. Signing the Swiss trade continuity deal will enable ministers to declare that progress is being made, but deals with major trading partners including Canada, South Korea and Japan remain to be signed. Britain has agreed mutual recognition trade deals with Australia and New Zealand, as well as trade continuity agreements with Switzerland, Chile, the Faroe Islands and the eastern and southern Africa trading bloc. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who signed the Swiss accord in Berne on Monday with a Swiss federal councillor, Guy Parmelin, said the deal was of \u201chuge economic importance\u201d to Britain and would benefit 15,000 UK exporters. \u201cNot only will this help to support jobs throughout the UK but it will also be a solid foundation for us to build an even stronger trading relationship with Switzerland as we leave the EU,\u201d Fox said. The deal simplifies trade and allows businesses in both countries to continue trading freely after Brexit without any additional tariffs, as is currently the case as part of EU membership. A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said: \u201cOur priority is to avoid disruption to our global trading relationships as we leave the European Union and we are seeking continuity for existing free trade agreements.\u201d",

The decade I spent teaching at Birkbeck taught me more about the spirit and purpose of education than three spent in more conventional universities. Lacking almost all the perquisites now seemingly essential to attract full-timers, without exception Birkbeck\u2019s mature part-timers made up for what they might have lacked in facile sophistication with hard work, a genuine desire to learn, and respect for knowledge. Benefactors can of course do as they wish, but \u201cMatthew principle\u201d (Matthew 25:29) donations to Cambridge, at a time when my old college and others really could use a fraction of the same money to far greater effect, simply offend me.<br><strong>David Unwin</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor in geography, Birkbeck, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Marthe de Ferrer should not be too surprised about Oxbridge graduates enriching their old universities. Most of the ministers, senior civil servants and national infrastructure commissioners who approved the destructive so-called \u201cOxford-Cambridge arc\u201d without any consultation graduated there.</p> <p>The arc plan would dump a million new homes and a 150km motorway on the countryside where we grow our food, yet parts of the UK that actually have housing, workers, public transport, brownfield land and a need for economic regeneration, as well as their own fine universities, are crying out for such investment. But, of course, Oxbridge colleges own vast tracts of land in the arc, now swollen to five whole counties, and could expect huge financial gain from building all over it.

The decade I spent teaching at Birkbeck taught me more about the spirit and purpose of education than three spent in more conventional universities. Lacking almost all the perquisites now seemingly essential to attract full-timers, without exception Birkbeck\u2019s mature part-timers made up for what they might have lacked in facile sophistication with hard work, a genuine desire to learn, and respect for knowledge. Benefactors can of course do as they wish, but \u201cMatthew principle\u201d (Matthew 25:29) donations to Cambridge, at a time when my old college and others really could use a fraction of the same money to far greater effect, simply offend me. David Unwin Emeritus professor in geography, Birkbeck, University of London \u2022 Marthe de Ferrer should not be too surprised about Oxbridge graduates enriching their old universities. Most of the ministers, senior civil servants and national infrastructure commissioners who approved the destructive so-called \u201cOxford-Cambridge arc\u201d without any consultation graduated there. The arc plan would dump a million new homes and a 150km motorway on the countryside where we grow our food, yet parts of the UK that actually have housing, workers, public transport, brownfield land and a need for economic regeneration, as well as their own fine universities, are crying out for such investment. But, of course, Oxbridge colleges own vast tracts of land in the arc, now swollen to five whole counties, and could expect huge financial gain from building all over it. Cui bono?

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s favourite TV show, Fox &amp; Friends, has a reputation for giving airtime to conspiracy theories that benefit the White House agenda. But host Pete Hegseth may now have managed to upset the famously germaphobic president \u2013 by revealing that he has not washed his hands in a decade. The admission came as Hegseth discussed eating day-old pizza that had not been refrigerated. He did not see any issue with eating the pizza, he said, then added that he didn\u2019t think he had washed his hands in 10 years. \u201cReally,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really wash my hands ever.\u201d Met with laughter, he explained: \u201cI inoculate myself. Germs are not a real thing. I can\u2019t see them, therefore they\u2019re not real.\u201d On Twitter on Monday, Hegseth gave mixed messages. He claimed he had been joking and paraphrased the president in blaming the media for being so \u201cself-righteous and angry\u201d. He also said he supported drinking from hosepipes and riding bikes without a helmet. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that regular hand washing \u201cis one of the best ways to remove germs, avoid getting sick, and prevent the spread of germs to others\u201d. Being well educated about hand washing \u201creduces the number of people who get sick with diarrhea by 23% to 40%\u201d, it says. Fox has form, however, when it comes to denying scientific fact just because it is not immediately observable. Analysis by the progressive watchdog Media Matters for America found that Fox News hosts tend to discuss climate change when the weather is particularly cold, seeking to cast doubt over accepted science regarding rising global temperatures. Hegseth, who served with the national guard in Iraq, was once reported to be Trump\u2019s favoured pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. That role would have made him responsible for the health and wellbeing of 20 million Americans.",

His profile has continued to rise during the Trump era, serving as a frequent critic of the president and his allies.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s generally seen as a centrist Democrat, though he has staked out more progressive positions on criminal justice reform, the war on drugs, and social issues.

I\u2019ve seen what can happen when we come together.\u201d Booker, who had appeared in Mason City earlier in the day, spoke to a crowd of about 100 as part of a roundtable discussion with local leaders. He touched on a range of issues, but devoted the most time to criminal justice reform \u2013 a signature issue for the New Jersey Democrat, who was a key champion of the First Step Act, which was signed into law by Donald Trump in a rare bipartisan win last year. Booker touted the overhaul as a success, but called for more steps to be taken to address mass incarceration and a system that has unfairly targeted low-income and minority Americans, framing over-incarceration as both a \u201ccancer on our soul\u201d and also a financial burden on taxpayers. Booker did not directly criticize Donald Trump during the Waterloo appearance \u2013 in fact, he didn\u2019t even mention the president\u2019s name \u2013 but criticized several of the administration\u2019s policies and offered alternatives on issues like jobs, wages, and healthcare, reiterating his support for a single-system healthcare system. \u201cThere\u2019s something almost immoral about being in the richest country on planet earth and people [don\u2019t have access] to lifesaving medication because they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re better than that as a country.\u201d The visit came just over a week after the New Jersey senator announced his 2020 bid. He had been widely expected to run, and joined a crowded field of Democrats vying to challenge Trump with a rousing campaign video shot in Newark \u2013 his hometown. \u201cI believe that we can build a country where no one is forgotten, no one is left behind,\u201d Booker said in the video. \u201cIt is not a matter of can we. It is a matter of do we have the collective will, the American will? I believe we do.\u201d Booker echoed that message as he began his first excursion to the key early voting state of Iowa as a presidential candidate, and sought to strike a strong rapport with both the audience and the local leaders on the roundtable. \u201cI came to Waterloo to run for president,\u201d Booker said. \u201cYou all have me feeling like I want to be a resident.\u201d Booker, 49, had been a star in the Democratic party even before he was elected to the Senate in 2012, making national headlines as the \u201csuperhero\u201d mayor of Newark. His profile has continued to rise during the Trump era, serving as a frequent critic of the president and his allies. He\u2019s generally seen as a centrist Democrat, though he has staked out more progressive positions on criminal justice reform, the war on drugs, and social issues. He has also championed legislation to protect the Muller investigation, which Trump has called a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s got the right values,\u201d said Sharon Silva, a resident of nearby Cedar Falls who was in the crowd at Hawkeye Community College. \u201cHe cares about the right things. He likes to solve problems.\u201d Booker has also been scrutinized for his ties to Wall Street and to the pharmaceutical industry. Critics have also raised questions about his authenticity. Still, he appeared to capture the audience in Waterloo, making a strong introduction to the voters who turned up on a frigid day to get their initial impression of the senator, whose whirlwind trip to Iowa also included stops in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. \u201cHe\u2019s right on target,\u201d said Lee Tolbert, a resident of Waterloo in attendance. Tolbert said he had been leaning toward Senator Kamala Harris, who recently announced her own candidacy with a powerful speech in California, but was so impressed with Booker that he now regards him as his top choice to face off against Trump. \u201cLooking at where he\u2019s come from along with his resume, he\u2019s a winner,\u201d Tolbert said. \u201cHe\u2019s one that should be in the final round. I don\u2019t see how anybody can take him out.\u201d",

At one point, Lumley made a gag about Claire Foy maybe winning for her role in the moon-landing flick, First Man, and having to make a \u201cgiant leap\u201d on to the stage. I was just willing someone to heckle SHAME THERE ISN\u2019T A GARDEN BRIDGE.

The vast majority of cannabis sold in the UK these days is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43196566\" title=\"\">superstrong skunk</a>, so called not just because it\u2019s very potent in what it does to your brain, but because it\u2019s also very smelly.</p> <p>I smell it pretty much every day, on the street on the way home from work. I tried to talk to a stoner about whether blazing at 11 on the smelly scale made it harder to do without alerting the feds, but I couldn\u2019t find one who had got out of bed by the time I had to file this. But in many UK cities, it is part of the 21st-century daily olfactory experience.</p> <p>Not, apparently, for everyone. Not, a little ironically, for Britain\u2019s most senior police officer, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick. \u201cMy colleagues think it is hilarious that I simply cannot smell \u2013 ever \u2013 the smell of cannabis,\u201d she told Lauren Laverne on Desert Island Discs. Is that even possible?</p> <p>Yes! \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible that there\u2019s one particular thing she can\u2019t smell,\u201d says Carl Philpott, a professor of rhinology and olfactology at Norwich Medical School, UEA. \u201cI guess it\u2019s also possible she has a poor sense of smell, and doesn\u2019t pick up other things either.\u201d</p> <p>Nope, that\u2019s not it. Dick also told Laverne, between her audio picks (hearing fine, apparently) that scent was very important to her, and her luxury item was soap. So, it\u2019s just the weed, then.</p> <p>Philpott explains that most things we smell are a mixture of molecules, and that we recognise patterns. \u201cEach cell is coded genetically to have one receptor on it for a particular molecule. Each of those receptors feeds into a different part of the structure above the nose, called the olfactory bulb, where you get pattern recognition. It may be she is missing the recognition for those patterns that would be around marijuana.\u201d</p> <p>Not being able to smell cannabis is not one he has come across before, though. The best known one is musk; pleasant smelling to some, urinous to other, while some people don\u2019t smell it at all. But it is certainly possible she may never have been able to smell it. Dick: you are hereby released without charge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The clue is in the name. The vast majority of cannabis sold in the UK these days is superstrong skunk, so called not just because it\u2019s very potent in what it does to your brain, but because it\u2019s also very smelly. I smell it pretty much every day, on the street on the way home from work. I tried to talk to a stoner about whether blazing at 11 on the smelly scale made it harder to do without alerting the feds, but I couldn\u2019t find one who had got out of bed by the time I had to file this. But in many UK cities, it is part of the 21st-century daily olfactory experience. Not, apparently, for everyone. Not, a little ironically, for Britain\u2019s most senior police officer, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick. \u201cMy colleagues think it is hilarious that I simply cannot smell \u2013 ever \u2013 the smell of cannabis,\u201d she told Lauren Laverne on Desert Island Discs. Is that even possible? Yes! \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible that there\u2019s one particular thing she can\u2019t smell,\u201d says Carl Philpott, a professor of rhinology and olfactology at Norwich Medical School, UEA. \u201cI guess it\u2019s also possible she has a poor sense of smell, and doesn\u2019t pick up other things either.\u201d Nope, that\u2019s not it. Dick also told Laverne, between her audio picks (hearing fine, apparently) that scent was very important to her, and her luxury item was soap. So, it\u2019s just the weed, then. Philpott explains that most things we smell are a mixture of molecules, and that we recognise patterns. \u201cEach cell is coded genetically to have one receptor on it for a particular molecule. Each of those receptors feeds into a different part of the structure above the nose, called the olfactory bulb, where you get pattern recognition. It may be she is missing the recognition for those patterns that would be around marijuana.\u201d Not being able to smell cannabis is not one he has come across before, though. The best known one is musk; pleasant smelling to some, urinous to other, while some people don\u2019t smell it at all. But it is certainly possible she may never have been able to smell it. Dick: you are hereby released without charge.",

Green\u2019s face graced the cover of several newspapers on Saturday under headlines pertaining to accusations, all of which he denies, that the chairman of Arcadia Group (with Topshop, Topman, Wallis, Evans, Burton, Miss Selfridges and Dorothy Perkins in its stable) had sexually harassed and racially and physically abused his staff. The allegations add to a string of controversies and claims ranging from tax avoidance to using sweatshops and underpaying staff, and \u2013 if you didn\u2019t know Green\u2019s history \u2013 the latest details would be as unbelievable as they are sickening. The Monaco-based billionaire is said to have directed racist remarks at a black employee, groped women working for him, and physically abused both female and male workers. To avoid personal inconvenience, he\u2019s alleged to have paid some employees large sums of money in exchange for their silence. You can famously put a price on everything. The black man\u2019s dreadlocks were said to have been mocked by Green, who is also said to have accused the employee of smoking cannabis and \u201cthrowing spears in the jungle\u201d. That victim reportedly accepted a payment of \u00a31m in hush money. On another occasion, Green is said to have kissed a woman\u2019s face, touched her inappropriately and commented on her weight. His lawyers dismissed the reports by claiming their paymaster\u2019s style is \u201cplayful\u201d and \u201cjovial in nature\u201d. Right. In an era when political correctness has supposedly gone mad, a world where #MeToo is reshaping swathes of industry, something has gone terribly wrong for men like Ashley and Green still to be flouncing around in their different ways, largely unchallenged. Green has a knighthood, something that is meant to distinguish him as a model citizen with impeccable values. Ashley is hailed by many as a retail visionary. Both are among the most powerful people in business. We\u2019ve scoffed and tutted at their disgraceful behaviour but that\u2019s just about all. It\u2019s time for us to realise the damage being inflicted upon British business\u2019s reputation by these fat cats. At the current slow rate of progress, British boardrooms will continue to be largely pale, male and stale for many years to come. Even Britain in 2019 can surely do better than this. \u2022 Josie Cox is a business expert who has worked at the Independent, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters",

Moving to New York to study under jazz pianist <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lennie-tristano-mn0000242966\">Lennie Tristano</a>, Ryman played hard bebop, influenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/charlie-parker\">Charlie Parker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/263796-Zoot-Sims\">Zoot Sims</a>, taking the museum job to support himself.

All three would become associated with minimal art in the early 1960s, though Ryman insisted he was not part of any movement.

Ryman was working out not just when to stop, but how to begin, and what it was that made a painting. I think he was asking not just what a painting was but when it was that his accretions of paint might become a painting, one thing leading to another like an improvised solo, and at what point to lift his brush from the canvas. It was all part of what has been called \u201cthe process of the process\u201d in Ryman\u2019s art.</p> <p>There is a sense of suddenness about Ryman\u2019s early work, a feeling of arrival. Sometimes these paintings were completed with a cursive signature or just his initials, and a date, which had the appearance of yet another form rather than a self-regarding authorial flourish. Ryman was taking painting apart to see how it worked, then reassembling it from degree zero. The support. The surface. The spread of one material over another. The limits. Whether to paint to an edge or to contain and constrict. What the boundaries are and where they lay. To paint to an edge or to overrun \u2013 like a cartoon character who keeps running till they realise they are already scrabbling in mid-air. He always came back from the brink. This is why his paintings are both so quiet and so exciting.</p> <p>What Ryman focused on throughout his career was as much painting\u2019s materiality as image-making, which for him appears to be a result of process and a series of considered actions. Material became a matter of the sheering and adhering of surfaces \u2013 lacquer or casein-based paints, oils and acrylics on wood or paper, canvas or metal. Gloss and matte-ness, thickness and thinness, evenness and churnedness. He worked his fields of white, walked their fences with his brush and his eye.</p> <p>Ryman worked with white, and the different kinds of whiteness different paints and pigments produced throughout his career. Lead, zinc, barium and titanium, chalky whites and hard industrial whites, silky whites and bone whites, kitchen whites and shroud whites, numinous whites and dead whites. Whites that seem to spread outward and emit light as we look and whites to fall into. The variety of their opacity, depth, brilliance and dullness all interested him. We apprehend them all differently, and differently again depending on the materials they are painted over and how they are applied, what their binders are and how much they are diluted all make a difference.</p> <p>Sometimes, looking at a Ryman is like looking at light coming in through a white window blind, its qualities changing through the day. He makes you focus, not least on your own looking. White marks squirm over rust-coloured metal and spreads softly like snow over a square. The square became as integral to his art as whiteness. He even considered the way a painting might be affixed to a wall as part of its make-up. My eye skates his surfaces, founders in them, get snagged on a row of staples and trips on a ridge of built-up pigment where the masking tape has been. These everyday details are integral to Ryman\u2019s art. You can never forget its materiality, the fact of its manufacture (Ryman did everything himself, and never had assistants). He once described the sensation he was after as a soft, quiet experience. \u201cIt has to look easy,\u201d he said, \u201cThat feeling like it just happened.\u201d Ryman also said that the real purpose of painting is to give pleasure. Which it did, and does.</p>",

To paint to an edge or to overrun \u2013 like a cartoon character who keeps running till they realise they are already scrabbling in mid-air. He always came back from the brink. This is why his paintings are both so quiet and so exciting. What Ryman focused on throughout his career was as much painting\u2019s materiality as image-making, which for him appears to be a result of process and a series of considered actions. Material became a matter of the sheering and adhering of surfaces \u2013 lacquer or casein-based paints, oils and acrylics on wood or paper, canvas or metal. Gloss and matte-ness, thickness and thinness, evenness and churnedness. He worked his fields of white, walked their fences with his brush and his eye. Ryman worked with white, and the different kinds of whiteness different paints and pigments produced throughout his career. Lead, zinc, barium and titanium, chalky whites and hard industrial whites, silky whites and bone whites, kitchen whites and shroud whites, numinous whites and dead whites. Whites that seem to spread outward and emit light as we look and whites to fall into. The variety of their opacity, depth, brilliance and dullness all interested him. We apprehend them all differently, and differently again depending on the materials they are painted over and how they are applied, what their binders are and how much they are diluted all make a difference. Sometimes, looking at a Ryman is like looking at light coming in through a white window blind, its qualities changing through the day. He makes you focus, not least on your own looking. White marks squirm over rust-coloured metal and spreads softly like snow over a square. The square became as integral to his art as whiteness. He even considered the way a painting might be affixed to a wall as part of its make-up. My eye skates his surfaces, founders in them, get snagged on a row of staples and trips on a ridge of built-up pigment where the masking tape has been. These everyday details are integral to Ryman\u2019s art. You can never forget its materiality, the fact of its manufacture (Ryman did everything himself, and never had assistants). He once described the sensation he was after as a soft, quiet experience. \u201cIt has to look easy,\u201d he said, \u201cThat feeling like it just happened.\u201d Ryman also said that the real purpose of painting is to give pleasure. Which it did, and does.",

      "bodyText": "Victorian planning minister Richard Wynne says removing flammable cladding from the most high-risk buildings in Melbourne is a \u201ccomplex problem which will take some time to fix properly.\u201d The Victorian Building Authority (VBA) has said it could take two years to remove and replace combustible aluminium polyethylene composite panels from high rise apartments and hotels around the city. The buildings were identified in an audit ordered following the fatal Grenfell Tower fire in London in June 2017. The speed of that fire, which killed 72 people, was attributed to aluminium composite cladding which allowed flames to race up the 120-storey building. Of the 2,000 buildings audited so far, 360 have been found to be high risk, 280 of moderate risk, and 140 of low risk. The Neo200 apartment building on Spencer Street, which caught fire last week, was classified to be a moderate risk. An earlier audit conducted in 2016, following a 2014 fire in the Lacrosse Building, an apartment block in Melbourne\u2019s Docklands, found that half of the 170 buildings that were surveyed were not compliant with Australian building regulations around the use of aluminium composite cladding. Last year those regulations were tightened in Victoria to ban the use of aluminium composite panels that contain more than 30% polyethylene. Victoria is pushing for a national ban on the import of such panels and received in-principle agreement at the national building minister\u2019s forum on Friday, subject to industry consultation. Wynne said the national ban was \u201cthe next logical step\u201d to protect against the use of combustible cladding. \u201cA national ban will ensure consistency around what products are coming over the border. The next step is to look at what\u2019s being manufactured and imported,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will take whatever action is appropriate to remove these dangerous products from the supply chain.\u201d A spokeswoman for the VBA said that 200 building notices had been issued as part of the cladding audit, in most cases calling for cladding to be removed, but that rectifying the issue \u201ccan be complicated.\u201d \u201cBuilding notices typically ask the owners to \u2018show cause\u2019 why all combustible cladding should not be removed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe owners respond by developing a plan to address the cladding and fire safety issues with expert advice. Potential scenarios include full replacement, partial replacement around key areas such as balconies and exits, or enhanced fire safety systems including sprinklers.\u201d Grenfell Tower did not have an internal sprinkler system. Owners are required to notify all tenants of a building notice and also include it in the section 32 statements that are supplied to prospective buyers. Laws introduced last year include a new funding three-way model that would allow owners\u2019 corporations to take out a commercial loan to replace cladding and then pay it back through their council rates in an effort to encourage owners to act more quickly, but so far that model has not been used. Tenants who live in buildings that are three or more storeys high and built after 1997 have been advised to contact their landlord, or the body corporate of their building, for information about whether their building has been audited. Fire safety advice, including a recommendation that barbecues not be placed alongside cladding on high-rise balconies, has been published in 10 languages on the VBA website.",

Shac Communications, a Queensland-based lobbying and PR firm, was wound up by the federal court late last year following action by the tax office, which was reportedly owed $129,277. The company\u2019s previous iteration, Shac Pty Ltd, had previously been placed into liquidation in April 2013, after changing its name to Coolabird. It was eventually deregistered in November 2013. Donation disclosure records show Shac Communications made a series of donations totalling $112,000 to the Queensland Liberal National Party in July, August and September 2013. Lobbyist registers show the firm has acted for Leighton Contractors, casino proponents ASF Group, and Sunland, the Gold Coast property developer that Stuart Robert spoke in favour of in parliament in 2012. The shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, has written to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) to urge it to investigate the collapse of Shac. Leigh asked Asic to investigate the donations made by the firm while it still owed creditors. \u201cHas the Australian Securities and Investments Commission looked at the financial records of either iteration of Shac Communications (or Coolabird), and in particular the prioritisation of payments to creditors (such as the tax office, suppliers, or employees) relative to other large payments made by the firm (including political donations)? If not, will it?,\u201d he asked. Leigh also asked Asic to investigate \u201cwhether large payments from Shac Communications (or Coolabird) in the lead up to either collapse may be in breach of directors\u2019 duties or insolvent trading provisions of the Corporations Act?\u201d He told Guardian Australia the donations should be returned by the Liberal party, asking why the party should \u201cget a donation before the firm pays its tax debts?\u201d. \u201cHow could any responsible owner make a six-figure political donation, then turn around and refuse to pay their tax bill?\u201d he said. The Gold Coast Bulletin has previously reported that donations were made to the Fadden Forum, an LNP fundraising vehicle.

      "bodyText": "An inquiry has recommended the government shelve plans to restrict access to lucrative research and development tax incentives over concerns it could stifle innovation and force companies offshore. The Coalition proposed clamping down on its R&amp;D tax incentive in last year\u2019s budget, proposing a suite of measures to save $2.4bn. The then treasurer Scott Morrison said the incentive payments \u2013 which account for one-third of all government funding for research and development \u2013 had been \u201ctaken for a ride by some and integrity needs to be restored\u201d. The government proposed capping cash refunds for research activities at $4m, introducing a new \u201cintensity test\u201d for larger companies to favour higher, more intensive R&amp;D investment, and significantly increasing compliance and enforcement measures. The changes prompted a significant backlash from businesses and research groups, which warned it would stifle innovation, add unnecessary complexity, force companies to move operations offshore, and cause general uncertainty in the sector. A Senate inquiry into the proposal on Monday recommended it be delayed. \u201cOn the weight of evidence presented, the committee considers that the bill should not proceed until there is further consideration of the R&amp;D tax incentive measures,\u201d the committee said in its report. The government\u2019s proposal was based on a 2016 review of the R&amp;D incentive, conducted by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, the former innovation and science Australia chairman Bill Ferris and the then Treasury head John Fraser. Companies with a turnover of less than $20m annually would have their cash refunds for the incentive capped at $4m, though clinical trials would be exempt from the new cap. These smaller companies would also receive a lower refundable tax offset rate, set at their corporate tax rate plus 13.5%. That was a significant change from the past arrangement, where smaller companies received a flat 43.5% refund on every dollar spent on R&amp;D. Bigger companies would face a new intensity test, meaning their tax offset depended on the amount they spent on R&amp;D compared to their total expenditure. The Senate inquiry heard evidence from a range of sectors fearing the change could jeopardise innovation and threaten businesses. The inquiry heard that companies that do both research and manufacturing in Australia would be disadvantaged by the new intensity test, because their total expenditure would be higher. Research Australia, the peak group for the sector, said the intensity test could simply prompt companies to move all non-R&amp;D operations offshore to reduce total expenditure. \u201cBy linking the R&amp;D [tax incentive] to the value of R&amp;D as a percentage of total expenditure, the proposed measure not only provides an incentive to increase R&amp;D, but an incentive to reduce other expenditure,\u201d the group said. \u201cOne obvious way to do this is to retain R&amp;D in Australia but move other expenditure, such as manufacturing, to other countries. It also acts as a disincentive to companies undertaking R&amp;D in Australia to increase manufacturing in Australia, and to bring manufacturing on shore.\u201d The committee said the $4m cap could \u201cbenefit from some finessing to ensure that R&amp;D entities that have already made investment commitments are not impeded unintentionally\u201d. Guardian Australia approached the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, for comment. The R&amp;D incentive crackdown is attached to an omnibus bill that also includes measures to stamp out tax avoidance. That included amendments to prevent companies from loading up debt artificially to shift profits and avoid tax. The inquiry recommended the government proceed on all other parts of the bill.",

      "bodyText": "A proposed high court challenge to a key immigration case could retrospectively affect every instance of onshore detention in the past 15 years if successful, the federal government has said. On Wednesday the high court will hear a request to challenge Al Kateb v Godwin, a controversial 2004 ruling about a stateless man who no country would take after Australia rejected his asylum claim, and which effectively enabled indefinite detention in Australia. The case is brought on behalf of Said Imasi, another stateless man who has been locked up for nine years with almost no prospect of deportation or release, his lawyers claim. The minister for home affairs and the immigration department will fight Imasi\u2019s case, and in published submissions have forcefully rejected the plaintiff\u2019s arguments and warned of drastic consequences to the current system which allows the indefinite detention of stateless people, asylum seekers and other non-citizens. \u201cIf Al-Kateb is overruled, that would alter \u2013 with retrospective effect \u2013 the understanding of the [Migration] Act upon which unlawful non-citizens have been detained since 2004,\u201d its submission said. It would also impact the role of the Ombudsman in reviewing cases of people detained for two years or more and making recommendations to address their long-term detention, which was legislated \u201con the basis of the correctness of Al-Kateb\u201d, the submission said. They warned the court to exercise restraint and not to overrule its previous decisions \u201clightly\u201d, and to be informed by a \u201cstrongly conservative cautionary principle\u201d. The government\u2019s submissions, published last week, were filed in response to those from the lawyers of Imasi. Imasi\u2019s responses to the government submissions were also published. Alison Battisson, representing Imasi, previously told Guardian Australia she hoped it would be the case which \u201cstarts the process to end arbitrary, ongoing detention for indeterminate periods of time in Australia\u201d. Imasi is held in Villawood, Sydney, and his lawyers, who include the former federal court judge Ron Merkel QC, have told the high court there was \u201cno real possibility, prospect or likelihood of the plaintiff being removed from Australia, at any time\u201d. The government disputed Imasi\u2019s stateless status, saying investigations into his identity were \u201congoing\u201d. Imasi has previously told Guardian Australia that he believes \u2013 but does not know \u2013 that he was born in the Canary Islands and was taken to the Western Sahara, which is a disputed territory, as a newborn baby. \u201cIt is true that the department has conducted extensive identity investigations over the last nine years, but that is not determinative of the prospects of the ongoing lines of inquiry,\u201d said the government\u2019s submission. It said Imasi had made \u201cmany different and inconsistent claims about his identity, date and place of birth, and relatives\u2019 whereabouts\u201d. \u201cIt cannot be assumed that it is beyond his power to provide further information concerning his identity.\u201d It said the department was \u201ctaking steps\u201d to find a third country to take Imasi, including as part of a diplomatic or humanitarian agreement. Imasi\u2019s lawyers disputed accusations against him, and responded that the government\u2019s suggestion was \u201cbelied by the past nine years\u2019 experience\u201d and it had made \u201cno material progress in finding a country\u201d to take him. \u201cThe claim that the plaintiff is not stateless \u2026 is unreal.\u201d A key argument in the submissions concerned the difference between court-ordered punitive detention, and executive-ordered administrative detention. The four-three majority ruling on Al Kateb included the finding that administrative detention, such as that required to process and carry out a deportation, could be ordered by the executive, for as long as was required to resolve it. Battisson said arbitrary indefinite detention, even if for administrative purposes, was in fact punitive. However, the government submitted that the distinguishing feature of punitive detention over administrative detention was that it was \u201cimposed as punishment for a breach of the law\u201d. Imasi\u2019s lawyers had also submitted that administrative detention was only legal for the purpose of deportation, and that if someone \u2013 like stateless Imasi \u2013 had no real prospect of being deported, that detention must end. However, the government said that to allow such an interpretation would require constant reassessment of someone\u2019s case once they were released to see if deportation was a viable option again. Imasi\u2019s lawyers dismissed that argument as one about convenience, and accused the government of seeking to expand the concept of detention to \u201csegregation-pending-possible-removal\u201d. The government had argued that detention \u2013 for the purpose of deportation \u2013 was allowed regardless of whether there was a real prospect of it in the reasonably foreseeable future. The high court will hear arguments on Wednesday.",

Over that period there is likely to be about $5,959bn of taxation raised by the federal government. So we are talking around 3% more tax.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Projected tax revenue\">  <iframe title=\"Projected tax revenue\" aria-describedby=\"Assumes 5.62% annual increase, ALP's extra $200bn average over 10 years\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4hT8y/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>3% is a significant amount, but rather less massive than a $200bn figure would have you think it is. We also should note that many of the taxes listed do not come into place for a number of years, and some are not \u201ctax rises\u201d but just a policy of keeping the status quo.</p> <h2><strong>Superannuation changes \u2013 $19bn</strong></h2> <p>The ALP proposes lowering the annual non-concessional contributions cap to $75,000 and the high income super contribution threshold to $200,000. It also proposes reversing the introduction of catch-up concessional contributions and the 2016-17 budget measure on changes to tax deductibility for personal contributions.</p> <p>It is hard to see this having much impact on economic growth. In the treasury\u2019s economy-wide modelling for <a href=\"https://static.treasury.gov.au/uploads/sites/1/2017/06/160503_Economy-wide-modelling.pdf\">the 2016-17 budget</a> changes to superannuation were listed as increasing labour force participation as changes may see people stay in the workforce longer.</p> <h2><strong>Changes to tax on discretionary trusts \u2013 $17bn</strong></h2> <p>Labor proposes a 30% tax rate on distributions from discretionary trusts.</p> <p>Trusts are used to minimise tax and are very much in need of reform. Ironically we can see this from Geoff Wilson, who has been campaigning against the ALP\u2019s proposed changes to franking credits. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/07/geoff-wilson-told-investors-labors-franking-credits-policy-easy-to-avoid\">told retirees</a> \u201call you\u2019ve got to do\u201d to avoid being hit by any changes \u201cis change from a company structure to a trust structure\u201d.</p> <p>The impact on economic growth would be negligible.</p> <h2><strong>Changes to franking credits \u2013 $55bn</strong></h2> <p>The ALP policy to stop tax refunds on franking credits to people who pay no tax will affect around 900,000 individuals, and the ALP accepts it would raise $55bn over 10 years.</p> <p>But again, what is the impact on the economic growth? By itself, barely anything. Yes, those affected might spend less \u2013 but self-funded retirees typically have a much higher amount of disposable income than other retiree households, and they spend a lot more on recreational activities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average proportion of weekly spending by household type\">  <iframe title=\"Average proportion of weekly spending by household type\" aria-describedby=\"\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PpuYE/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While pensioner households spend on average 4.97% of their income on holiday travel and accommodation, self-funded retirees spend on average 13.09%.</p> <h2><strong>Negative gearing and capital gains tax changes \u2013 $32b</strong><strong>n</strong></h2> <p>The ALP proposes abolishing negative gearing for houses other than new construction, although all current arrangements would be grandfathered.

      "bodyText": "When the prime minister started the year, a big line of his economic attack was the damage the ALP\u2019s extra $200bn worth of tax would do the economy. On 14 January he told ABC Breakfast: \u201cNow is not the time for Labor to go and dump $200 billion of higher taxes on the Australian economy. It\u2019s not a good plan.\u201d Heck, he even found room to mention it in a media release announcing $60m spending on Cairns Hospital. So what are these $200bn extra taxes, and just how much will they hit our economy? First off some context \u2013 the $200bn is over 10 years. Over that period there is likely to be about $5,959bn of taxation raised by the federal government. So we are talking around 3% more tax. 3% is a significant amount, but rather less massive than a $200bn figure would have you think it is. We also should note that many of the taxes listed do not come into place for a number of years, and some are not \u201ctax rises\u201d but just a policy of keeping the status quo. Superannuation changes \u2013 $19bn The ALP proposes lowering the annual non-concessional contributions cap to $75,000 and the high income super contribution threshold to $200,000. It also proposes reversing the introduction of catch-up concessional contributions and the 2016-17 budget measure on changes to tax deductibility for personal contributions. It is hard to see this having much impact on economic growth. In the treasury\u2019s economy-wide modelling for the 2016-17 budget changes to superannuation were listed as increasing labour force participation as changes may see people stay in the workforce longer. Changes to tax on discretionary trusts \u2013 $17bn Labor proposes a 30% tax rate on distributions from discretionary trusts. Trusts are used to minimise tax and are very much in need of reform. Ironically we can see this from Geoff Wilson, who has been campaigning against the ALP\u2019s proposed changes to franking credits. Wilson told retirees \u201call you\u2019ve got to do\u201d to avoid being hit by any changes \u201cis change from a company structure to a trust structure\u201d. The impact on economic growth would be negligible. Changes to franking credits \u2013 $55bn The ALP policy to stop tax refunds on franking credits to people who pay no tax will affect around 900,000 individuals, and the ALP accepts it would raise $55bn over 10 years. But again, what is the impact on the economic growth? By itself, barely anything. Yes, those affected might spend less \u2013 but self-funded retirees typically have a much higher amount of disposable income than other retiree households, and they spend a lot more on recreational activities. While pensioner households spend on average 4.97% of their income on holiday travel and accommodation, self-funded retirees spend on average 13.09%. Negative gearing and capital gains tax changes \u2013 $32bn The ALP proposes abolishing negative gearing for houses other than new construction, although all current arrangements would be grandfathered. They also propose cutting the capital gains tax concession introduced by John Howard in 1999 that made negative gearing very lucrative from 50% to 25%. This costing is based on the 2016 policy and will need to be recalibrated to take into effect new starting dates. One issue is that due to low interest rates, negative gearing has fallen (because interest payments on investment properties is the major cost used to negative gear): Should low interest rates be considered to continue this could lower the amount calculated to be saved. This highlights a couple of issues with government\u2019s $200bn extra taxes claim. Firstly the ALP\u2019s negative gearing policy is not a new tax but a removal of the ability to lower your tax liability. And while the government will attack the amount claimed to be saved, should the number be revised down, you can fully expect they will then claim there is a black hole in the ALP\u2019s figures. As for the impact on the economy, remember in the 1980s when negative gearing was removed for two years, rents only increased in Sydney and Perth where the issue was a lack of supply \u2013 something that is not the case now: Income tax changes \u2013 $70bn Labor proposes to repeal steps two and three of the government\u2019s tax cut plan, which increases tax thresholds from $37,000 to $41,000 and $90,000 to $120,000, increases the top rate from $180,000 to $200,000 and abolishes the 37% tax bracket. This is only set to commence from 2022-23, so calculating the impact on economic growth is dicey given the big difference between it and the ALP\u2019s tax cuts is that the ALP\u2019s is targeted towards those earning under $120,000, where the majority of stage 2 and 3 of the government\u2019s cuts go to those earning above that: That the ALP can keep $70bn worth of tax shows just how expensive the government\u2019s tax cut is \u2013 and reminds us that a tax cut is actually a cost to the government\u2019s budget, and unless the LNP has suddenly come to believe that balancing the budget is not required then at some point there will need to be spending cuts. Budget repair levy \u2013 $22bn Labor proposes putting back in place the extra 2% tax rate on top of the highest income tax bracket. However it is very unlikely to raise $22bn. Last year Chris Bowen suggested it would exit only \u201cuntil the budget is back in sustainable surplus which we would see as being in 2022-23 under our plans\u201d As a result the ALP suggests it will only raise around $6bn rather than $22bn. And what would the impact of these last two be on economic growth? Well, raising tax on income would slow growth \u2013 although in this case the $70bn extra income tax would not slow growth, but merely not speed it up because as the cuts are only due to come into place from 2022 onwards, no one would notice any increase should the ALP win office. But measuring growth and only considering tax is like judging a cricket team only on its batting and ignoring its bowling. The impact on the budget of total tax and spending changes and on what areas both apply is more important. A tax rise on income might slow growth, but an equivalent amount spent on infrastructure or on increasing Newstart could increase growth by the same amount. If all you are talking about is the tax, then you\u2019re only mentioning half of the story \u2013 and right now that is the only half the government wants you to hear. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

needs of the local Pacific Islander and M\u0101ori communities, and lawyers at the centre say they\u2019ve seen first-hand the pressure and stress that this places on vulnerable families, with the lack of access to university perpetuating this cycle of disadvantage.</p> <p>WestJustice lawyer Sarouche Razi says New Zealanders of colour are being affected the most by these restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an underclass that doesn\u2019t get access to safety nets like every other Australian does, and it disproportionately affects New Zealanders of colour,\u201d Razi says. \u201cWe can see how people, because of the system, are constantly slipping through the cracks and aren\u2019t supported by the government.\u201d</p> <p>Plans to force New Zealanders to pay international fees for university courses were scrapped by the government in late 2017, but having to pay for courses upfront has left many unable to go to university in Australia, and without a social safety net.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re basically saying to that person, \u2018your life prospects are in blue-collar work or as a tradie or security guard, and if you want to study at university you have to go back to New Zealand\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> <p>WestJustice school lawyer Semisi Kailahi says he is working with several families who have discovered that their children cannot access university support, and are unable to afford to pay the expensive fees upfront.</p> <p>\u201cWe have families that are uneducated and they want to break that cycle and have their child be the first in their family to go to university,\u201d Kailahi says. \u201cBut the lack of incentives is tough \u2013 the parents find out they won\u2019t have the government paying for them, while their neighbour might be able to.\u201d</p> <p>While he was happy with his final results, it was a bittersweet moment for Welelaw with the knowledge he probably would not be able to join his friends at university.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I am happy for them making it into the courses, but I do feel a bit of envy towards them,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Kailahi previously worked as a school lawyer at Welelaw\u2019s school in Tarneit, 25km west of the Melbourne CBD, where he said about 100 of the students from Pacific Islander backgrounds are unable to qualify for a Help loan.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite distressing,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Heavy burden</h2> <p>Even for the families that can afford to pay for the university fees upfront, this has placed a huge burden and financial stress on them.</p> <p>One young Pacific Islander is currently working two part-time jobs to help her parents pay for her civil engineering degree at a university in Sydney.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a massive expense and there\u2019s no flexibility around it whatsoever,\u201d the student\u2019s mother, Kiana*, says. \u201cBut we are making a life here.\u201d</p> <p>Liza Cox, the founder of a support group for New Zealanders in Australia, Oz Kiwis, says the inability to pursue further education gives many of the Pacific Islanders and New Zealanders of colour in Australia little hope for the future.</p>  <aside

</blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat means that before their life has started they\u2019ve already plummeted off the cliff,\u201d Cox says. \u201cNot having access to Help is one of the worst injustices ... those children are being punished by a decision made by their parents completely innocently.\u201d</p> <p>Others have been forced to make the difficult decision of moving back to New Zealand, away from established networks of friends and family in Australia, to go to university, Kailahi says.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to go back there and try to find some family to live with - they\u2019re going back to places they haven\u2019t been since they were toddlers,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working here and contributing to society \u2013 they\u2019re good people but they have to go start the whole thing again.\u201d</p> <p>Welelaw is now actively considering returning to Auckland to go to university, although the thought of this is \u201coverwhelming\u201d to him. Welelaw\u2019s mother, Anegu Tesfaye, is also being forced to consider this option.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me \u2013 I can\u2019t send him on his own,\u201d Tesfaye says. \u201cIt is not fair at all \u2013 where is the humanity? How can we treat others like this? It\u2019s very shameful.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah\u2019s* family has already been through this experience \u2013 the young student moved back to New Zealand to undertake a social work degree after being unable to afford a similar course in Australia, leaving her daughter behind in Sydney.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be much better if she could be here, but we don\u2019t have the financial side of things to help here,\u201d Sarah\u2019s mother says. \u201cHer not being here with her daughter is very hard.\u201d</p> <p>To qualify for permanent citizenship in Australia, New Zealanders need to have earned at least $53,900 each year for the last five years to qualify. Applications cost $3,600 for an individual and $1,800 for a dependant.</p> <p>For many families, including Welelaw\u2019s, this threshold is far too high.</p> <p>Welelaw says he wants to raise awareness of the struggles that many New Zealanders face in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThis issue is tucked away under the carpet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people hear about it they do get disheartened. They forget that there are kiwis living in Australia and they don\u2019t have certain benefits that Australians have.</p> <p>\u201cIt would just be everything if you could view us as Australian.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Not real names</em></p> <ul> <li><p>Denham Sadler is a Melbourne-based freelance journalist</p></li> </ul>",

WestJustice lawyer Sarouche Razi says New Zealanders of colour are being affected the most by these restrictions. \u201cThere\u2019s an underclass that doesn\u2019t get access to safety nets like every other Australian does, and it disproportionately affects New Zealanders of colour,\u201d Razi says. \u201cWe can see how people, because of the system, are constantly slipping through the cracks and aren\u2019t supported by the government.\u201d Plans to force New Zealanders to pay international fees for university courses were scrapped by the government in late 2017, but having to pay for courses upfront has left many unable to go to university in Australia, and without a social safety net. \u201cWe\u2019re basically saying to that person, \u2018your life prospects are in blue-collar work or as a tradie or security guard, and if you want to study at university you have to go back to New Zealand\u2019,\u201d he says. WestJustice school lawyer Semisi Kailahi says he is working with several families who have discovered that their children cannot access university support, and are unable to afford to pay the expensive fees upfront. \u201cWe have families that are uneducated and they want to break that cycle and have their child be the first in their family to go to university,\u201d Kailahi says. \u201cBut the lack of incentives is tough \u2013 the parents find out they won\u2019t have the government paying for them, while their neighbour might be able to.\u201d While he was happy with his final results, it was a bittersweet moment for Welelaw with the knowledge he probably would not be able to join his friends at university. \u201cOf course I am happy for them making it into the courses, but I do feel a bit of envy towards them,\u201d he says. Kailahi previously worked as a school lawyer at Welelaw\u2019s school in Tarneit, 25km west of the Melbourne CBD, where he said about 100 of the students from Pacific Islander backgrounds are unable to qualify for a Help loan. \u201cIt\u2019s quite distressing,\u201d he says. Heavy burden Even for the families that can afford to pay for the university fees upfront, this has placed a huge burden and financial stress on them. One young Pacific Islander is currently working two part-time jobs to help her parents pay for her civil engineering degree at a university in Sydney. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive expense and there\u2019s no flexibility around it whatsoever,\u201d the student\u2019s mother, Kiana*, says. \u201cBut we are making a life here.\u201d Liza Cox, the founder of a support group for New Zealanders in Australia, Oz Kiwis, says the inability to pursue further education gives many of the Pacific Islanders and New Zealanders of colour in Australia little hope for the future. \u201cThat means that before their life has started they\u2019ve already plummeted off the cliff,\u201d Cox says. \u201cNot having access to Help is one of the worst injustices ... those children are being punished by a decision made by their parents completely innocently.\u201d Others have been forced to make the difficult decision of moving back to New Zealand, away from established networks of friends and family in Australia, to go to university, Kailahi says. \u201cThey have to go back there and try to find some family to live with - they\u2019re going back to places they haven\u2019t been since they were toddlers,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working here and contributing to society \u2013 they\u2019re good people but they have to go start the whole thing again.\u201d Welelaw is now actively considering returning to Auckland to go to university, although the thought of this is \u201coverwhelming\u201d to him. Welelaw\u2019s mother, Anegu Tesfaye, is also being forced to consider this option. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me \u2013 I can\u2019t send him on his own,\u201d Tesfaye says. \u201cIt is not fair at all \u2013 where is the humanity? How can we treat others like this? It\u2019s very shameful.\u201d Sarah\u2019s* family has already been through this experience \u2013 the young student moved back to New Zealand to undertake a social work degree after being unable to afford a similar course in Australia, leaving her daughter behind in Sydney. \u201cIt would be much better if she could be here, but we don\u2019t have the financial side of things to help here,\u201d Sarah\u2019s mother says. \u201cHer not being here with her daughter is very hard.\u201d To qualify for permanent citizenship in Australia, New Zealanders need to have earned at least $53,900 each year for the last five years to qualify. Applications cost $3,600 for an individual and $1,800 for a dependant. For many families, including Welelaw\u2019s, this threshold is far too high. Welelaw says he wants to raise awareness of the struggles that many New Zealanders face in Australia. \u201cThis issue is tucked away under the carpet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people hear about it they do get disheartened. They forget that there are kiwis living in Australia and they don\u2019t have certain benefits that Australians have. \u201cIt would just be everything if you could view us as Australian.\u201d *Not real names Denham Sadler is a Melbourne-based freelance journalist",

With less than 50 days to Brexit, the spectre of a possibly chaotic withdrawal from Europe has put officials increasingly on edge. </p> <p>The government spokesman, Prodromos Prodromou, told the Guardian: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Britain tops our tourism market and if the economy slips into depression nobody knows the effect it will have on numbers coming to Cyprus. Then there are students, about a third of the total number currently abroad are in the UK. They are OK but it is far from sure what the future status of others will be. And in terms of trade most of our exports, starting with Halloumi, go to Britain.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog and for all your comments today, Andrew Sparrow will be back tomorrow, I believe. Here is a summary of the afternoon\u2019s main events: Amber Rudd has admitted that the rollout of universal credit has contributed to an increase in food bank use. The work and pensions secretary\u2019s concession reverses past ministerial claims denying such a link. Chris Grayling has rejected Labour demands for him to resign over the Seaborne Freight controversy, which saw a no-deal Brexit ferry contract awarded - before being cancelled - to a company with no ships. Senior Tories have warned against Labour\u2019s plans for a customs union after Theresa May suggested further talks with Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson and Liam Fox both spoke out against the prospect of such a compromise with Labour. The EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator with the UK has described the chances of a reversal of Brexit as non-existent. At a conference in Germany, Sabine Weyand, also described damage to the UK as self-inflicted and suggested Corbyn\u2019s proposals deserved serious consideration. Here is the Guardian\u2019s story on Amber Rudd admitting the link between food banks and universal credit: The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, has admitted that food bank use has increased due to the universal credit roll-out. Ministers have previously downplayed claims that universal credit is to blame and have spent years insisting austerity is not linked to a large increase in use of food banks. Rudd told MPs: We\u2019re committed to a strong safety net where people need it. It\u2019s absolutely clear there were challenges with the initial roll-out of universal credit and the main issue that led to an increase in food bank use could have been the fact that people had difficulties accessing their money early enough. We have made changes to accessing universal credit so people can have advances, so there is a legacy run on after two weeks of housing benefit, and we believe that will help with food bank use. Taking an urgent question in the Commons, Chris Grayling has just rejected calls for him to resign as Transport Secretary over the Seaborne Freight controversy. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, slammed Grayling\u2019s \u201cincompetence\u201d and said he should consider his position. In response, the Transport Secretary described the criticism as \u201chogwash\u201d and said \u201cnot a penny of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d went to Seaborne. He said they were aware that Seaborne did not have its own ferries but it was backed by an Irish shipping company, Arklow Shipping, which pulled out unexpectedly and suddenly. For its part, Arklow Shipping has said it never had a stake in the venture. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 defence spokesman Jamie Stone has joined in the criticism of the defence secretary\u2019s speech this morning, in particular Gavin Williamson\u2019s announcement that HMS Queen Elizabeth will be deployed to the Pacific region. Stone said: Gavin Williamson is heating up UK defence rhetoric, something which may well be seen as provocation by Beijing. This comes following years of hollowing-out of Britain\u2019s military capabilities, with the British Army now at the smallest it has been in decades. Do we really have the capacity at the moment to send this ship over to showboat? Rather than flaunting the HMS Queen Elizabeth in the Pacific, the Conservatives should instead be focusing on the pressing issues facing the British armed forces at the moment, including the \u00a315bn shortfall in the MoD\u2019s equipment plan over the next decade. As the countdown to March 29 looms, there is more evidence of governments in Europe fretting about the effects of Brexit. It may be the European Union\u2019s easternmost member state but Cyprus, as a former British colony \u2013 and locale for strategic military bases - has some of the strongest ties with the UK. With less than 50 days to Brexit, the spectre of a possibly chaotic withdrawal from Europe has put officials increasingly on edge. The government spokesman, Prodromos Prodromou, told the Guardian: Britain tops our tourism market and if the economy slips into depression nobody knows the effect it will have on numbers coming to Cyprus. Then there are students, about a third of the total number currently abroad are in the UK. They are OK but it is far from sure what the future status of others will be. And in terms of trade most of our exports, starting with Halloumi, go to Britain. Right now nothing is clear ... the British government doesn\u2019t seem to know what it wants. Of course Cyprus has also benefited from Brexit. Last month, the British ferry and shipping operator, P&amp;O, announced it was transferring registration of all its UK vessels to the Mediterranean island. The UK and Switzerland have signed a deal to maintain their current trading relationship after Brexit. The UK is seeking to replicate about 40 free trade agreements, covering more than 70 countries. In 2017, Liam Fox said they could all be signed by the time the UK leaves the EU on 29 March this year but only four continuity agreements have been inked, according to the BBC, namely with: Switzerland Chile The Faroe Islands Eastern and Southern Africa It says mutual recognition agreements, under which a product lawfully sold in one country can be sold in another, have also been signed with Australia and New Zealand. Senior Tories have warned Labour\u2019s plans for a customs union with the EU are a \u201cdangerous delusion\u201d, after Theresa May offered fresh Brexit talks with Jeremy Corbyn, reports the Press Association. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Labour\u2019s proposals were \u201cnot workable\u201d while Boris Johnson accused Corbyn of trying to trap the Government in a \u201ctoxic\u201d Brexit. The comments appeared to reflect concern among Conservative Brexiteers that the Prime Minister could concede too much ground to Labour in an attempt to win cross-party backing for a deal with Brussels ... Fox, in Bern for the signing of a trade agreement with Switzerland, said Labour claims they would be able to influence EU trade policy showed they did not understand how EU policy worked. \u201cOf course we always want to work with the opposition but the opposition has put forward some ideas that are not workable,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe idea that you can have a customs union with the EU and at the same time, as an outside country, have an effect on EU trade policy, is to not understand the EU treaties. \u201cIt is very clear from the European Union that non-EU members do not have a say in EU trade policy so to pretend that you could do so is a dangerous delusion.\u201d His intervention came after Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss refused to rule out resigning if May backed a customs union. \u201cI absolutely do not think that should be our policy,\u201d she told Sky News on Sunday. Johnson, who led the official Vote Leave campaign in the referendum, warned the prime minister against trying to do a deal with Labour to get her agreement through. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there is any mileage for the prime minister or the Government in trying to do a deal with Labour because they will just try to trap Theresa May,\u201d he said at a launch event at Westminster. Despite his deputy suggesting the UK could take more time (see previous post), the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said Theresa May has no plans to delay Brexit. Speaking at a conference in Germayn, the EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator with the UK, Sabine Weyand, has has had some tough words for the UK, according to Tweets from the Economist\u2019s Berlin bureau chief. Weyand described the chances of a reversal of Brexit as non-existent and the damage to the UK as self-inflicted. She also suggested Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposals deserved serious consideration. Theresa May has ruled out a customs union with the EU post Brexit, her spokesman said. Earlier, the prisons minister, Rory Stewart, said that despite disagreement over the customs union there was less dividing May and Jeremy Corbyn than some people may think. May will update MPs on her latest round of Brexit talks tomorrow, Downing Street has said. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, is meeting the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels tonight. Boris Johnson has insisted that the Irish backstop must be amended to give the UK a unilateral out within a specified time period. In response to suggestions sterling could fall by 20% after Brexit, the former foreign secretary said: \u201cThe pound will go where it will.\u201d The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, has attracted ridicule for his claim that Brexit could \u201cenhance UK\u2019s lethality\u201d. Chris Leslie, Labour MP and people\u2019s vote supporte.r said Europe was central to the UK\u2019s military posture and that economic damage post-Brexit would weaken military investment. May continues to have full confidence in the Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, despite the controversy over the Seaborne Freight contract, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman has said. MPs from across the Commons called for Grayling\u2019s resignation after the cancellation of a \u00a313.8m no-deal Brexit ferry contract awarded to Seaborne Freight, which had no ships. Theresa May continues to have full confidence in the Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, her official spokesman has said. The display of support came amid calls for Grayling\u2019s resignation from MPs across the Commons after a controversial no-deal Brexit ferry contract awarded to a firm with no ships was cancelled. The Transport Secretary\u2019s decision to award Seaborne Freight a contract worth \u00a313.8 million to run services between Ramsgate and Ostend had attracted widespread criticism. Gavin Williamson continues to attract flak for his claim that Brexit could \u201cenhance UK\u2019s lethality\u201d. The former shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, said: The idea that our membership of the European Union restricts us is the purest nonsense. You don\u2019t have to know much history to know why Europe is and will remain central to our military posture or that co-operation and peace in Europe is what allows us to invest in global strength. In fact the economic damage that Brexit threatens is what will most quickly weaken our forces. The Treasury\u2019s own forecast is that Brexit will leave us \u00a3100 billion worse off and the experience of recent years is that the Treasury is never slow to pick on defence when it is looking for cuts. In the economic mess that will follow Brexit, hopes of East of Suez could be the first to go. Simon Jenkins writes: The defence secretary\u2019s brain has gone absent without leave ...If history teaches us anything, it is that vanity defence procurements merely incite ministers to reckless interventions, afterwards bitterly regretted. Williamson\u2019s speech reads like the pompous rantings of a 1950s Tory on the make. It cannot conceivably have been cleared with colleagues, let alone the Treasury. It is best forgotten. It is far from the first time Williamson has blundered ... Theresa May is to update MPs on her latest round of Brexit talks tomorrow, Downing Street has said. At the regular lobby briefing, May\u2019s spokesman said the statement to the Commons, originally expected for Wednesday, would now be a day earlier. This will, the spokesman said, give MPs an extra day to draft amendments before the debate on a new amendable motion on Brexit in the Commons on Thursday. This is not, it should be stressed a meaningful vote on a new deal \u2013 there is currently no set date for this. The amendable motion is just another chance for MPs to suggest changes, such as an extension to article 50 or ruling out no deal. The only other Brexit diary date is 27 February, with Downing Street saying this would be the latest moment for another amendable motion, if no revised deal had been presented by then. On May\u2019s response on Sunday to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter setting out Labour\u2019s five conditions for backing a Brexit deal, her spokesman made it plain she had ruled out the main idea \u2013 the UK being part of a customs union. He said: We are absolutely clear on this: we\u2019re not considering Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s customs proposals; we\u2019re not considering any proposals to remain in the customs union. We must have our own, independent trade policy. Conservative MPs supportive of a second referendum have written to the prime minister to request an urgent meeting about postponing the UK\u2019s scheduled date of departing the EU, the Independent\u2019s political correspondent Tweets. The letter says: We are urging you and the government to take a breath, to take a minute and give us all time to consider whether this proposed deal, or however it is adjusted, is really in our best interests ...The fear of delay should not box us into a corner so that the country leaves with the worst possible outcome. We should take enough time to resolve this impasse. People\u2019s vote campaigners say that Theresa May\u2019s rejection of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit proposals proves the need for a second referendum. Labour MP David Lammy said: Theresa May\u2019s letter makes it clear there is no hope of her agreeing for the UK to stay in a permanent customs union or to guarantee alignment with the EU on rights and protections after Brexit, as Jeremy Corbyn had requested ...We have now entered the emergency zone of these negotiations, and the prime minister has swept Labour\u2019s only other option off the table. We have now got to begin campaigning for a people\u2019s vote. Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: It is astonishing that after more than 900 days since the Brexit vote and less than 50 days before we crash out of the EU, the PM and Corbyn appear to be starting serious discussions about delivering disastrous Brexit together. No amount of haggling over customs unions or workers\u2019 rights can disguise the fact that Brexit leaves us all worse off. It is time for Jeremy Corbyn to give up the letters and instead draw his attention to Labour Party policy and get behind the campaign for a people\u2019s vote. Gavin Williamson is facing some ridicule for his speech at the Royal United Services Institute this morning saying Brexit presents an opportunity for Britain to boost its global military standing: The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been publicly setting out his stall ahead of his meeting with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, in Brussels this evening: The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has blamed the government\u2019s Brexit strategy for the latest GDP figures showing a slowdown at the end of last year (read more on our business blog) and said they illustrate the need for no deal to be taken off the table. He said: The evidence is mounting that the combination of the government\u2019s shambolic handling of Brexit and nine years of austerity is causing real damage to our economy. Business investment has been falling for months now, as uncertainty and the fear of no deal cause immediate damage to confidence. Six consecutive months of decline for the manufacturing sector hasn\u2019t happened since 2009. The government must act now to take no deal off the table and Philip Hammond must use his spring statement to end the disastrous austerity policy which has done so much to damage the economy. Boris Johnson\u2019s vision of for a post-Brexit \u201cglobal Britain\u201d includes a multibillion-pound cut in the UK\u2019s overseas aid budget, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, writes. Current definitions of aid spending would be broadened to include peacekeeping, and the BBC\u2019s World Service would be expanded, as part of an effort to restore Britain\u2019s ability to project soft and hard power. The paper argues the UK should be freed to define its aid spending unconstrained by criteria set by external organisations, and its purpose expanded from poverty reduction to include \u201cthe nation\u2019s overall strategic goals\u201d. UK aid spending, set by law at 0.7% of gross national income, was \u00a313.4bn in 2016. The proposals are being fed into a Foreign Office review on UK soft power post-Brexit headed by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt. There have been repeated reports suggesting the DfID secretary, Penny Mordaunt, wants to dilute or abandon the 0.7% target. Here are some of the other politics stories making the news this morning: The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, will claim today that Brexit represents an opportunity for Britain to boost its global military standing in response to the threats posed by Russia and China. A no-deal Brexit would damage police powers to detain foreign suspects and leave British fugitives in Europe beyond the law, according to deputy assistant commissioner Richard Martin who is leading police preparations for such an event. The government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration system would cost employers more than \u00a31bn in administration costs over five years, harm the higher education sector by putting off EU students and risk a new Windrush scandal, according to a report by Global Future. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, must find an extra \u00a35bn in this year\u2019s Whitehall spending review to reverse planned cuts and meet his claim of ending austerity, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Meanwhile, the prisons minister, Rory Stewart, says Theresa May has rejected Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal for a customs union post-Brexit but suggested that the parties are closer together than some people think. He told BBC Breakfast: The prime minister remains very clear that she thinks that a very major economy like the United Kingdom needs to have the freedom to be able to make its own trade deals, so she\u2019s disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s suggestion that we enter a permanent customs union. What she is saying is that we have a lot if common ground, a lot more common ground perhaps than people have acknowledged, on things like environmental protections, workers\u2019 rights, making sure that we get investment into areas of the country which haven\u2019t done as well out of the last few years as other parts of the country. Good morning, this is Haroon Siddique sitting in for Andrew Sparrow again. I\u2019ll be attempting to keep you up to speed with the most significant politic developments of the day. Given the number of comments the blog attracts, if you want to get my attention, the best way is probably to Tweet me. Ahead of the Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay\u2019s meeting with the European chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels this evening, Boris Johnson has insisted that the Irish backstop must be amended to give the UK a unilateral out within a specified time period. The former foreign secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: The argument is now about how to get out of the backstop. And how to make sure that the UK isn\u2019t locked in that prison of the customs union. I think that you would need to have a time limit. Asked if changes to the backstop proposals could come in a separate codicil to the withdrawal agreement, Johnson said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be good enough.\u201d He added: It [the deal] would have to give the United Kingdom a UK-sized exit from the backstop. We would have to be able to get out by a certain time and we would have to be able to get out of our own volition. The most promising way forward is to do what is called the Malthouse compromise. EU officials have derided the Malthouse compromise, which would replace the backstop with a free trade agreement with as-yet-unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border, as unworkable and even \u201cbonkers\u201d. Johnson also accused Jeremy Corbyn of wanting \u201cto frustrate Brexit very largely by staying in a permanent customs union\u201d. said: \u201cThe pound will go where it will,\u201d when pressed on suggestions sterling could fall by 20%.",

The UK has more offshore wind capacity than anywhere in the world, with 37 projects made up of nearly 2,000 turbines. There is nearly 8GW of capacity today, 1.3GW of which was added in 2018. Another 5GW is already committed to. The UK has 44% of all European offshore wind power capacity.</p>\n    <p><b>What obstacles has wind power faced?<br></b>The first subsidies awarded to offshore windfarms promised developers a guaranteed price of up to \u00a3150 per megawatt hour, or roughly three times the wholesale cost of electricity. Such steep subsidies would not be sustainable but cost reductions in the industry have seen that figure drop to as low as \u00a357.50. The offshore wind industry has previously been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/29/wind-turbines-uk-firms-miss-out\">criticised for not using enough UK contractors and suppliers</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>What is the economic benefit to the UK?<br></b>The industry employs around 11,000 people. One of the side effects of offshore wind\u2019s growth has been an injection of money and jobs into coastal towns that in some cases have big pockets of economic deprivation. Ports have been upgraded and new maintenance facilities built, such as the one at Newhaven in East Sussex for the first windfarm in the English Channel. The different parts of turbines are made across the UK, from the Isle of Wight to Hull.</p>\n    <p><b>What does the future hold for offshore wind power in the UK?<br></b>The industry has a target of growing today\u2019s 8GW capacity to 30GW by 2030, which, if achieved, would see offshore wind power supplying more than a third of the UK\u2019s electricity. The government has put a \u00a3557m pot of funding aside for subsidies for renewables in the next few years, most of which is expected to be taken up by offshore windfarms. The industry is also hoping for export opportunities for UK firms, as new markets grow in the US and Asia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The size of the project takes the burgeoning offshore wind power sector to a new scale, on a par with conventional fossil fuel-fired power stations.</p> \n<p>Hornsea One will cover 407 sq km, five times the size of the nearby city of Hull.

The first two phases will use 7MW turbines, which are taller than London\u2019s Gherkin building. But the latter stages of the Hornsea development could use even more powerful, 10MW-plus turbines. Bigger turbines will capture more of the energy from the wind and should lower costs by reducing the number of foundations and amount of cabling firms need to put into the water. Henrik Poulsen, \u00d8rsted\u2019s chief executive, said he was in close dialogue with major manufacturers to use the new generation of turbines, some of which are expected to approach the height of the Shard in London, the tallest building in the EU. The UK has a great wind resource and shallow enough seabed to exploit it, and could even \u201cpower most of Europe if it [the UK] went to the extreme with offshore\u201d, he said. Offshore windfarms could help ministers fill the low carbon power gap created by Hitachi and Toshiba scrapping nuclear plants, the executive suggested. \u201cIf nuclear should play less of a role than expected, I believe offshore wind can step up,\u201d he said. New nuclear projects in Europe had been \u201cdramatically delayed and over budget\u201d, he added, in comparison to \u201cthe strong track record for delivering offshore [wind]\u201d. The UK and Germany installed 85% of new offshore wind power capacity in the EU last year, according to industry data. The average power rating of the turbines is getting bigger too, up 15% in 2018. The turbines for Hornsea One are built and shipped from Siemens Gamesa\u2019s factory in Hull, part of a web of UK-based suppliers that has sprung up around the growing sector. Around half of the project\u2019s transition pieces, the yellow part of the structure that connects the foundation to the tower, are made in Teesside. Many of the towers themselves are made by a firm in Campbeltown in the Scottish highlands. Altogether, about half of the components for the project are made in the UK. \u00d8rsted is not yet ready to bid for a share of a \u00a360m pot of further offshore windfarm subsidies, to be auctioned by the government this summer, but expects the price to reach even more competitive levels than those seen in 2017. Like other international energy companies, \u00d8rsted has put in place contingency planning in event of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 but the hope is that will not come to pass. \u201cWe want a Brexit deal that will facilitate an orderly transition out of the union,\u201d said Poulsen.",

The EU\u2019s chief negotiator insisted there was no question of Brussels giving in to Downing Street\u2019s demands on the Irish backstop. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for clarity and movement from the United Kingdom,\u201d Barnier told reporters after talks in Luxembourg with the country\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel. At a dinner with the EU official in Brussels later on Monday, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, was expected to push Theresa May\u2019s calls for a time-limit on the operation of the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with an \u201calternative arrangement\u201d. The prime minister argued last week in meetings with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, and his counterpart in the European council, Donald Tusk, that parliament\u2019s support for the Brady amendment two weeks ago showed that legally binding changes to the backstop would unlock support. Critics of May\u2019s deal claim that the backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland if there was no alternative, could trap the UK indefinitely in the EU\u2019s orbit. The former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, claimed on Monday that this would leave the UK as \u201ccolony\u201d. But Barnier suggested he would offer Barclay little succour at the two men\u2019s first meeting, which comes 46 days before the UK\u2019s expected withdrawal from the EU. \u201cTonight I will repeat the EU\u2019s positions. I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not more than a concept today. I will also evaluate the interest from the UK side for possible changes to the political declaration, which, let me remind you, fixes the outline quite precisely for the future separation.\u201d The withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration agreed by the British government and the EU was rejected in the Commons by a historic margin last month, leaving May with a mountain to climb if she is to get a deal through. Barnier said Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan to revive the talks by pivoting to support a customs union was \u201cinteresting\u201d, but that he was awaiting fresh ideas from London. Bettel, who described the UK as the \u201cdisunited kingdom\u201d, told reporters: \u201cToday the response of the Brexiteers is non, non, non et non. But they haven\u2019t actually proposed any alternatives.\u201d Barnier echoed that call, insisting that the clarity over the next steps \u201chas to come from London\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s in London where they have to find the ways and means to build a positive majority between the two negative majorities that exist today in the House of Commons,\u201d he said. The EU official said Brussels could offer only further explanation rather than renegotiation. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way to explain better, to have more ambition, to put into perspective the content of the accord, and the backstop\u201d, he said. \u201cWe stand ready to do this work on the substance of the political declaration, but for all the reasons confirmed by the president of the council \u2026 European commission and parliament, from the European side we consider that the work done on the withdrawal agreement on the organisation of the separation cannot be reopened.\u2019\u2019 Barnier said May had insisted last week that she was not seeking an extension to article 50 that would delay Brexit beyond 29 March. But he admitted that time was \u201cextremely short\u201d. Talking at a conference in Munich, the EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, suggested there was no chance of Brexit being reversed as there was no majority in parliament for a second referendum. She added that Corbyn\u2019s ideas deserved to be discussed and that the political declaration on the future had been left \u201cvague\u201d as the UK had yet to decided on relationship it was seeking.",

For the moment, however, the town\u2019s 3,500 racehorses have nowhere to race and on Sunday night the outbreak of equine influenza that has halted the sport in Britain since last Thursday suddenly came a lot closer to home.

As is the case with every other trainer in the town, all of Amy Murphy\u2019s horses are vaccinated against equine flu.

Wide-ranging concerns about the backstop will not be overcome by producing figures on one element of those concerns, even if those figures are credible, and I don\u2019t know if they are. \u201cThis is about a lot more than how many trucks you stop at Belfast port, it\u2019s about the constitutional and political integrity of the UK.\u201d The analysis is likely to widen the gulf between the DUP and business groups, which have lobbied in vain for the Brexit deal. Seamus Leheney, a policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, said checks on freight must be minimised to avoid increased costs and delays. \u201cThe backstop appears to offer the most seamless solution in the event of it ever being required.\u201d The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, reiterated concern about regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and Britain after meeting the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in Belfast last week. She said: \u201cThe draft withdrawal agreement was unacceptable because it would cut Northern Ireland off from the rest of the United Kingdom and create a democratic deficit in Belfast.\u201d Brexit talks are expected to go the brink, with any last-minute offer by Brussels on the Irish backstop expected to be put to MPs just days before the UK is due to leave on 29 March.",

Thirteen people on the Jamaican charter flight had come to the UK as children \u2013 nine of them were under the age of 10, 11 had indefinite leave to remain (ILR), and one person even had a British passport. Not only were most of the people on this flight \u201cmore British than foreign\u201d, they were also being punished twice (three times if you include immigration detention) for crimes they had already served sentences for.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/06/jamaican-detainees-last-minute-deportation-reprieve-home-office-flight\">Deportation flight lands in Jamaica after reprieve for some</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What the deportation cases starkly illustrate is that BME people, or indeed anyone who came here as a child, have every reason to fear that they could be deported at any time if their behaviour is deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d, against the \u201cpublic good\u201d or not meeting \u201cgood character\u201d requirements. Not only are these requirements vague in their definition (ranging from acts of terrorism to instances of \u201cnotoriety\u201d and \u201cother non-conducive activities\u201d), but we also know they are applied disproportionately against BME people because of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lammy-review-final-report\" title=\"\">well-documented racial biases</a> in the criminal justice system. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/10/think-you-are-british-not-if-home-office-says-you-are-not\" title=\"\">Recent last-minute reprieves</a> and appeal cases have highlighted that even factors such as settled immigration status, length of stay, or British family or children in Britain, do not guarantee citizenship rights if you have committed any kind of offence (minor or severe), or are accused of misleading the Home Office. Children as well as adults are all vulnerable to being labelled \u201cillegal\u201d \u2013 regardless of where they stand on the citizenship spectrum. The <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61\" title=\"\">1981 British Nationality Act</a> removed birthright citizenship but parliament expressly intended for children born or raised in the UK to still be considered British on the basis of \u201cclose connection to the UK\u201d. However, this citizenship right has been undermined by the extension of \u201cgood character requirements\u201d in 2006 to children registering their citizenship. The Runnymede Trust, through our work with the Project for Registration of Children as British Citizens (<a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09713482/officers\" title=\"\">PRCBC</a>), knows of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/18/mps-urged-to-scrap-child-citizenship-good-character-test\" title=\"\">more than 500 children</a> (either born or raised here since childhood) who have been denied citizenship because they have failed \u201cgood character\u201d requirements due to some contact with the criminal justice system in their childhood.</p> <p>Last year, the support group Highly Skilled Migrants raised the issue of at least 1,000 skilled workers \u2013 teachers, doctors, lawyers, scientists, engineers \u2013 who were also at risk of deportation, accused of \u201clying\u201d in their ILR applications because they had committed errors in their tax records or had discrepancies in their \u201cdeclared income\u201d. Ten members of this group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/06/at-least-1000-highly-skilled-migrants-wrongly-face-deportation-experts-reveal\" title=\"\">took the Home Office to court</a> for unfairly using a section of the Immigration Act designed to tackle terrorists \u2013 nine won their cases. </p> <p>Since the introduction of hostile environment policies in 2012, citizenship rights have been deliberately obscured, and deportation and removal targets have taken precedence over people\u2019s entitlement to be in Britain. Home secretaries, including Javid, have claimed that the overwhelming majority of deportations were of \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d, but the Windrush scandal, and the steady stream of reprieves from deportation flights, illustrate that this isn\u2019t the case.</p> <p>The government has continuously lowered the bar for deportations. The test of Britishness is no longer about length of stay in Britain, \u201cclose connection\u201d or even having a British family or children. It is now about what you can \u201cprove\u201d through stringent citizenship paperwork criteria and whether you\u2019re able to pass a test of \u201ccharacter\u201d that is highly racialised in the way it is applied.</p> <p>There is no doubt that we need wholesale reform of immigration and citizenship laws. A good place to start would be to reintroduce birthright citizenship and to remove the application of good character requirements to adults and children who are simply registering their citizenship. In the meantime, the government should pay attention to recommendations from Stephen Shaw, the former prisons and probation ombudsman in its own <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/728376/Shaw_report_2018_Final_web_accessible.pdf\" title=\"\">commissioned review on immigration detention and deportations</a>: \u201cI find the policy of removing individuals brought up here from infancy to be deeply troubling. For low-risk offenders, it seems entirely disproportionate to tear them away from their lives, families and friends in the UK, and send them to countries where they may not speak the language or have any ties. For those who have committed serious crimes, there is also a further question of whether it is right to send high-risk offenders to another country when their offending follows an upbringing in the UK.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Dr Zubaida Haque is deputy director at the Runnymede Trust, a race equality thinktank</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 15 February 2019.

      "bodyText": "Last week mass deportations resumed in Britain. It\u2019s less than a year since the Windrush scandal broke \u2013 and the review into the events leading up to it hasn\u2019t even reported back yet. This was a stark reminder that the government\u2019s \u201ccompliant environment\u201d policies have changed in name only: otherwise they remain as hostile as ever and continue to destroy the lives of black and ethnic minority people (BME) people \u2013 many of whom have lived in the UK since they were children. Before the deportation flight the home secretary, Sajid Javid, declared that many of the \u201cforeign national offenders\u201d on the flight had committed \u201cvery serious crimes\u201d \u2013 later the Home Office clarified that offences ranged from murder and rape to Class B drug convictions and dangerous driving. Thirteen people on the Jamaican charter flight had come to the UK as children \u2013 nine of them were under the age of 10, 11 had indefinite leave to remain (ILR), and one person even had a British passport. Not only were most of the people on this flight \u201cmore British than foreign\u201d, they were also being punished twice (three times if you include immigration detention) for crimes they had already served sentences for. What the deportation cases starkly illustrate is that BME people, or indeed anyone who came here as a child, have every reason to fear that they could be deported at any time if their behaviour is deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d, against the \u201cpublic good\u201d or not meeting \u201cgood character\u201d requirements. Not only are these requirements vague in their definition (ranging from acts of terrorism to instances of \u201cnotoriety\u201d and \u201cother non-conducive activities\u201d), but we also know they are applied disproportionately against BME people because of well-documented racial biases in the criminal justice system. Recent last-minute reprieves and appeal cases have highlighted that even factors such as settled immigration status, length of stay, or British family or children in Britain, do not guarantee citizenship rights if you have committed any kind of offence (minor or severe), or are accused of misleading the Home Office. Children as well as adults are all vulnerable to being labelled \u201cillegal\u201d \u2013 regardless of where they stand on the citizenship spectrum. The 1981 British Nationality Act removed birthright citizenship but parliament expressly intended for children born or raised in the UK to still be considered British on the basis of \u201cclose connection to the UK\u201d. However, this citizenship right has been undermined by the extension of \u201cgood character requirements\u201d in 2006 to children registering their citizenship. The Runnymede Trust, through our work with the Project for Registration of Children as British Citizens (PRCBC), knows of more than 500 children (either born or raised here since childhood) who have been denied citizenship because they have failed \u201cgood character\u201d requirements due to some contact with the criminal justice system in their childhood. Last year, the support group Highly Skilled Migrants raised the issue of at least 1,000 skilled workers \u2013 teachers, doctors, lawyers, scientists, engineers \u2013 who were also at risk of deportation, accused of \u201clying\u201d in their ILR applications because they had committed errors in their tax records or had discrepancies in their \u201cdeclared income\u201d. Ten members of this group took the Home Office to court for unfairly using a section of the Immigration Act designed to tackle terrorists \u2013 nine won their cases. Since the introduction of hostile environment policies in 2012, citizenship rights have been deliberately obscured, and deportation and removal targets have taken precedence over people\u2019s entitlement to be in Britain. Home secretaries, including Javid, have claimed that the overwhelming majority of deportations were of \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d, but the Windrush scandal, and the steady stream of reprieves from deportation flights, illustrate that this isn\u2019t the case. The government has continuously lowered the bar for deportations. The test of Britishness is no longer about length of stay in Britain, \u201cclose connection\u201d or even having a British family or children. It is now about what you can \u201cprove\u201d through stringent citizenship paperwork criteria and whether you\u2019re able to pass a test of \u201ccharacter\u201d that is highly racialised in the way it is applied. There is no doubt that we need wholesale reform of immigration and citizenship laws. A good place to start would be to reintroduce birthright citizenship and to remove the application of good character requirements to adults and children who are simply registering their citizenship. In the meantime, the government should pay attention to recommendations from Stephen Shaw, the former prisons and probation ombudsman in its own commissioned review on immigration detention and deportations: \u201cI find the policy of removing individuals brought up here from infancy to be deeply troubling. For low-risk offenders, it seems entirely disproportionate to tear them away from their lives, families and friends in the UK, and send them to countries where they may not speak the language or have any ties. For those who have committed serious crimes, there is also a further question of whether it is right to send high-risk offenders to another country when their offending follows an upbringing in the UK.\u201d \u2022 Dr Zubaida Haque is deputy director at the Runnymede Trust, a race equality thinktank \u2022 This article was corrected on 15 February 2019. It initially stated that most of the deportees had committed minor crimes. The Home Office supplied the list of their convictions and sentences. Offences ranged from very serious (murder) to minor (Class B drug, dangerous driving). One deportee\u2019s sentence had been for life, one for 13 years, two for 10 years, one eight years, one seven years, five six years, three five years, three four years, six three years and two one year",

Exiting the game fans were sifting rumours of the score, anywhere from 2-2 to Motherwell winning 5-2.

      "body": "<p>An Italian-Egyptian singer has become the latest target of Italy\u2019s rightwing populist government after he won the Sanremo song festival, an annual competition that draws millions of TV viewers and is used to choose the Italian candidate for the Eurovision song contest.</p> <p>Alessandro Mahmoud, who performs under the name Mahmood, secured a victory on Saturday night with votes from a jury made up of music experts and journalists, which together account for 60% of a contestants\u2019 score.</p> <p>The public vote, accounting for the other 40%, went to Ultimo, the pseudonym of a singer called Niccol\u00f2 Moriconi.</p> <p>\u201cMahmood \u2026mah\u2026the most beautiful Italian song? I would have chosen #Ultimo,\u201d tweeted Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League party. He later added that judging from the public\u2019s reaction to the victory, \u201c90% of people are perplexed\u201d.</p> <p>Salvini\u2019s fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, from the League\u2019s Five Star Movement coalition partners, denounced the \u201cabysmal distance between the people and the \u2018elites\u2019\u201d. Mahmood\u2019s victory represented the wishes of a minority jury mostly consisting \u201cof journalists and the radical chic\u201d rather than the \u201cmajority of voters at home\u201d, Di Maio wrote on Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cNext year, maybe the winner should only be chosen by televoting, given that it costs Italians 51 cents to make them count!\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Italian state broadcaster, Rai, televised the competition. Its president, Marcello Foa, a controversial figure who has expressed anti-immigration views, also called for the voting system to be changed. He said there had been \u201ca clear imbalance between the popular vote and a jury composed of a few dozen people\u201d and the voting system needed to be fixed \u201cso that the public feels represented.\u201d </p> <p>Foa was appointed president of Rai in September by a parliamentary committee, which oversees the broadcaster.

      "bodyText": "An Italian-Egyptian singer has become the latest target of Italy\u2019s rightwing populist government after he won the Sanremo song festival, an annual competition that draws millions of TV viewers and is used to choose the Italian candidate for the Eurovision song contest. Alessandro Mahmoud, who performs under the name Mahmood, secured a victory on Saturday night with votes from a jury made up of music experts and journalists, which together account for 60% of a contestants\u2019 score. The public vote, accounting for the other 40%, went to Ultimo, the pseudonym of a singer called Niccol\u00f2 Moriconi. \u201cMahmood \u2026mah\u2026the most beautiful Italian song? I would have chosen #Ultimo,\u201d tweeted Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League party. He later added that judging from the public\u2019s reaction to the victory, \u201c90% of people are perplexed\u201d. Salvini\u2019s fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, from the League\u2019s Five Star Movement coalition partners, denounced the \u201cabysmal distance between the people and the \u2018elites\u2019\u201d. Mahmood\u2019s victory represented the wishes of a minority jury mostly consisting \u201cof journalists and the radical chic\u201d rather than the \u201cmajority of voters at home\u201d, Di Maio wrote on Facebook. \u201cNext year, maybe the winner should only be chosen by televoting, given that it costs Italians 51 cents to make them count!\u201d he added. The Italian state broadcaster, Rai, televised the competition. Its president, Marcello Foa, a controversial figure who has expressed anti-immigration views, also called for the voting system to be changed. He said there had been \u201ca clear imbalance between the popular vote and a jury composed of a few dozen people\u201d and the voting system needed to be fixed \u201cso that the public feels represented.\u201d Foa was appointed president of Rai in September by a parliamentary committee, which oversees the broadcaster. He was put forward for the role by Salvini and Di Maio, despite strong opposition from the centre-left Democratic party and concerns from journalists\u2019 unions. The five-day festival, which this year attracted more than 10 million viewers, rarely passes without dispute. In January, singer-songwriter Claudio Baglioni\u2019s role as host came under threat after he described Salvini\u2019s rejection of 49 rescued migrants as \u201cfarcical\u201d. During a post-show discussion on Friday night, singer Francesco Renga said female singers have \u201cless harmonious voices\u201d than their male counterparts in response to a question about the few female contestants. Nevertheless, a high-profile political intervention is unusual. \u201cEvery year there is something but with the type of government we have now and the story of Salvini and immigration, there seems to be a pretext,\u201d said Federico Capitoni, a journalist and music critic for the daily newspaper La Repubblica. \u201cIt takes little to trigger propaganda, and when they want to, they will find a way to intervene.\u201d Mahmood was born in Milan to an Italian mother and Egyptian father.

He scored twice in a 2-2 draw against Atl\u00e9tico B at their Cerro del Espino training ground. He also found Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s captain Alberto Rodr\u00edguez Bar\u00f3 sinking teeth into his head, a look of bewilderment on Vinicius\u2019s face as he sat on the grass trying to grasp <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mundodeportivo/status/1036254539224162304\">what was going on</a>. A \u20ac46m signing from Flamengo \u2013 his fee could cover the whole of Segunda B for a year \u2013 three weeks later, he was given his first team debut in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/29/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">the 0-0 draw against Atl\u00e9tico</a> at the Bernab\u00e9u, the first footballer born since 2000 to play for Madrid. He had played four Spanish matches ever, and two of them were against his team\u2019s city rival.</p> \n<p>But if that seemed to be the start of something, it wasn\u2019t yet. There was pressure to put Vinicius in, but the player who had been bitten still needed \u201ccooking\u201d, Julen Lopetegui said. That derby day he played just two minutes and he only got 10 more in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/08/alaves-beautiful-madness-real-madrid-pressure-julen-lopetegui-la-liga-football\">the 1-0 defeat at Alav\u00e9s</a>. Lopetegui didn\u2019t get much longer; it would be \u201cmadness\u201d to sack him, Sergio Ramos said, but his position <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/22/real-madrid-julen-lopetegui-and-the-actions-of-a-condemned-man-football-la-liga\">was weak</a> and, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/29/luis-suarez-barcelona-real-madrid-floundering-again-clasico-football\">the 5-1 defeat at Barcelona</a>, suffered with Vinicius sitting in the stands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/29/real-madrid-sack-julen-lopetegui-antonio-conte-football\">he was sacked</a> \u2013 138 days after taking over.</p> \n<p>Lopetegui\u2019s replacement was Santi Solari, Vinicius\u2019s coach at Castilla. He was only temporary, Madrid said, hopeful they could get something better, but 100 days on he is still there. More importantly, so somehow are Real Madrid. Vinicius is there too and those two facts may not be unrelated. By the end of Solari\u2019s first game, he\u2019d already played more minutes than in Lopetegui\u2019s entire reign; by the time his third derby came, he had played 11 league games. He was starting his sixth match in a row in La Liga just as three days before he had started against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, ahead of Gareth Bale, Marco Asensio and Isco. The outstanding player in the country\u2019s biggest game, now it was time for the capital\u2019s biggest. A proper test for him and his team.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Outside the Metropolitano, Thibaut Courtois\u2019s plaque revealed what this means: the former Atl\u00e9tico and now-Real keeper\u2019s name was covered with mud, stickers and rubbish, beer cans, toy rats and the lid off a tin of M&amp;S shortbread, the stag\u2019s horns <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1094236391595216897\">symbolising unfaithfulness</a>.

He set off fast in the <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> and set off fast now, running at Atl\u00e9tico at every opportunity, never more so than when he forced his side\u2019s second goal, drawing Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez in and escaping him, until the desperate Uruguayan brought him down. The initial foul looked outside the area \u2013 although Gim\u00e9nez admitted \u201cmy genitals <em>then</em> touched his heel\u201d \u2013 but the penalty was given and Ramos scored it.</p> \n<p>Casemiro had scored the opener, Antoine Griezmann had equalised and now Ramos made it 2-1, his 22nd successful penalty of 24. When Vinicius was withdrawn, applauded by the handful of supporters high in the corner behind the glass screen and the big nets, few could understand it. But with Real under pressure his replacement settled a match marked by VAR in which two goals \u2013 one given (Griezmann) one not (Morata) \u2013 and two penalties, one given (Vinicius) one not (Morata) \u2013 were subject to revision, 67,752 people left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/09/atletico-madrid-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">in suspended animation</a>.

The <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> is three games away \u2013 still an obligation, but maybe an opportunity too. In a Freudian slip during a recent interview, Toni Kroos said Madrid were still in two competitions, but it looks more like three now. \u201cHay Liga\u201d has made a comeback \u2013 \u201cthere is league\u201d. AS even dusted off another old favourite, the <em>cag\u00f3metro</em>: the <em>crappingyourselfometer</em>. \u201cBarcelona are scared,\u201d its cover said, pushing it a bit. Six points is still quite a lead, and it\u2019s effectively seven because of head-to-head. It also grew this weekend: from five ahead over Atl\u00e9tico to six over Madrid. It\u2019s also one point better for Madrid than it was the day Solari took over. But it\u2019s natural that this threat feels more real. Not least because this latest shift has happened so quickly.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/11/milan-krzysztof-piatek-lucas-paqueta-cagliari-milk-farmers-seriea-football\">Milan's Piatek and Paquet\u00e1 milk it after Cagliari get blocked by farmers | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The turnaround was not immediate with Solari, who took over in October. Just six weeks ago, he suggested that draws should not be underestimated following a 2-2 with Villarreal and his point was proven when, two days later, Madrid were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/07/real-madrid-make-the-headlines-for-all-the-wrong-reasons-again-la-liga-football\">beaten by Real Sociedad</a>. At that moment, 10 points behind, it was over for them \u2013 and, it seemed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/07/real-madrid-make-the-headlines-for-all-the-wrong-reasons-again-la-liga-football\">for him</a>. They were no longer ninth but the gap to the top had widened and if results had improved compared to under Lopetegui, performances hadn\u2019t. \u201cTrust me, we played some good games before,\u201d Solari insisted this weekend but it was hard to remember a one. As Modric put it: \u201cwhat do you want us to say? That everything\u2019s fine?!\u201d Only Vinicius was a shaft of light in the gloom, a little enthusiasm and excitement.</p> \n<p>Since then, Madrid have won five league games in a row and scored 14, compared to 26 all season up until then. They\u2019ve won eight and lost one in 10 \u2013 a Cup second leg that didn\u2019t matter. This was supposed to be the hardest month, but it has brought a better Madrid. They scored two at Betis and against Sevilla, three against Alav\u00e9s, four at Espanyol. They scored three at Atl\u00e9tico, who had let in four home goals all season. Before that they drew in Barcelona. \u201cMadrid silenced the Camp Nou and the Metropolitano in four days,\u201d cheered AS\u2019s mad Madridista Tom\u00e1s Roncero. That means something \u2013 and not just that he still hasn\u2019t worked out where the volume button is on his remote. \u201cThey were better than us,\u201d Diego Simeone admitted on Saturday. The headlines agreed: \u201cMadrid are flying,\u201d said AS; \u201cMadrid reach altitude,\u201d said El Pa\u00eds. \u201cMadrid are back,\u201d was Marca\u2019s verdict. Just at the right time; just about the time they always are.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Physically, Madrid are in much better shape. Though intangible, mentally, they are too and it is tempting to see Vinicius as the beginning of that, Jorge Valdano describing him as the kid who opened the window and let the air in. Naturally enough for an 18-year-old, he can be erratic, but he has four goals and six assists in all competitions and is evolving fast \u2013 his decision-making is improving quickly and at the weekend there was a variety in his runs absent before. Even if there hadn\u2019t been, it would be worth it. \u201cHe gives us freshness and daring,\u201d Solari said weeks ago now, and that has proven contagious.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89d3fb6f9e972ebed4fdb0b35729ac14c1ab2d2e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89d3fb6f9e972ebed4fdb0b35729ac14c1ab2d2e/0_0_3109_2202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vinicius Junior is chased by Jose Gim\u00e9nez.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vinicius Junior is chased by Jose Gim\u00e9nez.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doyle/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Solari has given them that too. A man always prepared for management, an \u201cinexperienced\u201d coach <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3687525/santiago-solaris-experience-at-real-madrid-can-equip-him-well-for-pressure-and-unique-nature-of-madrid-job\">with ample experience</a>, he has astutely moved towards meritocracy and youth, a quicker more dynamic approach. Vinicius, Sergio Reguil\u00f3n, and Marcos Llorente have all had opportunities they didn\u2019t get before, while Lucas V\u00e1zquez is indisputable: \u201cHe has the qualities I admire in Spaniards: solidarity and bravery,\u201d Solari said, and he could have been talking about himself, the man who didn\u2019t fit the Gal\u00e1cticos policy but did fit their team. Meanwhile, some of those who might have considered their place guaranteed \u2013 Isco, Bale, Marcelo \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3769880/is-marcelo-approaching-the-end-at-real-madrid-as-solari-trusts-more-in-youth\">have found to the contrary</a>. Luka Modric, Ramos, Kroos and Karim Benzema have all taken a significant step forward too, as tends to happen at this time of year; Madrid\u2019s pre-season is over, just in time for Europe. The question now is whether it is in time for the league too.</p> \n<p>\u201cNothing is impossible,\u201d Solari said. Nor, he insisted, was this about him, or the kid he coached at Cerro del Espino in September, just across the road from the Argentinian restaurant where he and Simeone used to eat and talk football and eat. \u201cThe team is all of us, but above all it is the players: they\u2019re the ones who put their bodies out there every game, who give their commitment, their heart and their talent,\u201d he said on Saturday, the day that Madrid announced their return. \u201cThe credit falls upon them. They\u2019re 95% of it; the rest of us are just trying to help.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5c90d929-caf9-498e-9804-ce21b35a7b42\"

      "bodyText": "The first time Vinicius Junior played against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, they bit him; the third time, he bit back. If he didn\u2019t do it the second time, maybe that\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t given the chance. A lot has happened in five months \u2013 a lot has happened in five weeks in fact, things changing fast \u2013 and few embody that better than the Brazilian dashing past Barcelona on Wednesday night and Atl\u00e9tico on Saturday afternoon. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid; some of us could have children his age,\u201d his manager said, but he led Real Madrid to a 3-1 win, only their second in 15 domestic derbies. They became the first team to win at the Wanda Metropolitano this season. Became candidates once more. Back in early September, Vinicius played his second game in Spain, for Castilla, Real Madrid\u2019s B team, in the country\u2019s theoretically amateur, regionalised, 80-team Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. He scored twice in a 2-2 draw against Atl\u00e9tico B at their Cerro del Espino training ground. He also found Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s captain Alberto Rodr\u00edguez Bar\u00f3 sinking teeth into his head, a look of bewilderment on Vinicius\u2019s face as he sat on the grass trying to grasp what was going on. A \u20ac46m signing from Flamengo \u2013 his fee could cover the whole of Segunda B for a year \u2013 three weeks later, he was given his first team debut in the 0-0 draw against Atl\u00e9tico at the Bernab\u00e9u, the first footballer born since 2000 to play for Madrid. He had played four Spanish matches ever, and two of them were against his team\u2019s city rival. But if that seemed to be the start of something, it wasn\u2019t yet. There was pressure to put Vinicius in, but the player who had been bitten still needed \u201ccooking\u201d, Julen Lopetegui said. That derby day he played just two minutes and he only got 10 more in the 1-0 defeat at Alav\u00e9s. Lopetegui didn\u2019t get much longer; it would be \u201cmadness\u201d to sack him, Sergio Ramos said, but his position was weak and, after the 5-1 defeat at Barcelona, suffered with Vinicius sitting in the stands, he was sacked \u2013 138 days after taking over. Lopetegui\u2019s replacement was Santi Solari, Vinicius\u2019s coach at Castilla. He was only temporary, Madrid said, hopeful they could get something better, but 100 days on he is still there. More importantly, so somehow are Real Madrid. Vinicius is there too and those two facts may not be unrelated. By the end of Solari\u2019s first game, he\u2019d already played more minutes than in Lopetegui\u2019s entire reign; by the time his third derby came, he had played 11 league games. He was starting his sixth match in a row in La Liga just as three days before he had started against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, ahead of Gareth Bale, Marco Asensio and Isco. The outstanding player in the country\u2019s biggest game, now it was time for the capital\u2019s biggest. A proper test for him and his team. Outside the Metropolitano, Thibaut Courtois\u2019s plaque revealed what this means: the former Atl\u00e9tico and now-Real keeper\u2019s name was covered with mud, stickers and rubbish, beer cans, toy rats and the lid off a tin of M&amp;S shortbread, the stag\u2019s horns symbolising unfaithfulness. Inside, it was noisy, the place bouncing. When the teams were announced, the presence of five former Madrid players in the Atl\u00e9tico team didn\u2019t mitigate the abuse of Courtois; when he appeared, it rained rodents, cuddly rats flying his way. Tackles flew too. So did Vinicius, \u201cearning his doctorate\u201d, one report said. He set off fast in the cl\u00e1sico and set off fast now, running at Atl\u00e9tico at every opportunity, never more so than when he forced his side\u2019s second goal, drawing Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez in and escaping him, until the desperate Uruguayan brought him down. The initial foul looked outside the area \u2013 although Gim\u00e9nez admitted \u201cmy genitals then touched his heel\u201d \u2013 but the penalty was given and Ramos scored it. Casemiro had scored the opener, Antoine Griezmann had equalised and now Ramos made it 2-1, his 22nd successful penalty of 24. When Vinicius was withdrawn, applauded by the handful of supporters high in the corner behind the glass screen and the big nets, few could understand it. But with Real under pressure his replacement settled a match marked by VAR in which two goals \u2013 one given (Griezmann) one not (Morata) \u2013 and two penalties, one given (Vinicius) one not (Morata) \u2013 were subject to revision, 67,752 people left in suspended animation. Bale got his 100th Madrid goal to make it 3-1 and end the contest, celebrating with a \u201csleeve-cutter\u201d. For the uninitiated, that\u2019s a Spanish \u201cUp Yours\u201d, which suggests he is integrating after all, but which he executed considerably worse than the shot, which suggests he is not. Victory saw Madrid, ninth when Solari took over, climb above Atl\u00e9tico to second, and Barcelona\u2019s 0-0 draw at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday put them \u201conly\u201d six points behind. The cl\u00e1sico is three games away \u2013 still an obligation, but maybe an opportunity too. In a Freudian slip during a recent interview, Toni Kroos said Madrid were still in two competitions, but it looks more like three now. \u201cHay Liga\u201d has made a comeback \u2013 \u201cthere is league\u201d. AS even dusted off another old favourite, the cag\u00f3metro: the crappingyourselfometer. \u201cBarcelona are scared,\u201d its cover said, pushing it a bit. Six points is still quite a lead, and it\u2019s effectively seven because of head-to-head. It also grew this weekend: from five ahead over Atl\u00e9tico to six over Madrid. It\u2019s also one point better for Madrid than it was the day Solari took over. But it\u2019s natural that this threat feels more real. Not least because this latest shift has happened so quickly. The turnaround was not immediate with Solari, who took over in October. Just six weeks ago, he suggested that draws should not be underestimated following a 2-2 with Villarreal and his point was proven when, two days later, Madrid were beaten by Real Sociedad. At that moment, 10 points behind, it was over for them \u2013 and, it seemed, for him. They were no longer ninth but the gap to the top had widened and if results had improved compared to under Lopetegui, performances hadn\u2019t. \u201cTrust me, we played some good games before,\u201d Solari insisted this weekend but it was hard to remember a one. As Modric put it: \u201cwhat do you want us to say? That everything\u2019s fine?!\u201d Only Vinicius was a shaft of light in the gloom, a little enthusiasm and excitement. Since then, Madrid have won five league games in a row and scored 14, compared to 26 all season up until then. They\u2019ve won eight and lost one in 10 \u2013 a Cup second leg that didn\u2019t matter. This was supposed to be the hardest month, but it has brought a better Madrid. They scored two at Betis and against Sevilla, three against Alav\u00e9s, four at Espanyol. They scored three at Atl\u00e9tico, who had let in four home goals all season. Before that they drew in Barcelona. \u201cMadrid silenced the Camp Nou and the Metropolitano in four days,\u201d cheered AS\u2019s mad Madridista Tom\u00e1s Roncero. That means something \u2013 and not just that he still hasn\u2019t worked out where the volume button is on his remote. \u201cThey were better than us,\u201d Diego Simeone admitted on Saturday. The headlines agreed: \u201cMadrid are flying,\u201d said AS; \u201cMadrid reach altitude,\u201d said El Pa\u00eds. \u201cMadrid are back,\u201d was Marca\u2019s verdict. Just at the right time; just about the time they always are. Physically, Madrid are in much better shape. Though intangible, mentally, they are too and it is tempting to see Vinicius as the beginning of that, Jorge Valdano describing him as the kid who opened the window and let the air in. Naturally enough for an 18-year-old, he can be erratic, but he has four goals and six assists in all competitions and is evolving fast \u2013 his decision-making is improving quickly and at the weekend there was a variety in his runs absent before. Even if there hadn\u2019t been, it would be worth it. \u201cHe gives us freshness and daring,\u201d Solari said weeks ago now, and that has proven contagious. Solari has given them that too. A man always prepared for management, an \u201cinexperienced\u201d coach with ample experience, he has astutely moved towards meritocracy and youth, a quicker more dynamic approach. Vinicius, Sergio Reguil\u00f3n, and Marcos Llorente have all had opportunities they didn\u2019t get before, while Lucas V\u00e1zquez is indisputable: \u201cHe has the qualities I admire in Spaniards: solidarity and bravery,\u201d Solari said, and he could have been talking about himself, the man who didn\u2019t fit the Gal\u00e1cticos policy but did fit their team. Meanwhile, some of those who might have considered their place guaranteed \u2013 Isco, Bale, Marcelo \u2013 have found to the contrary. Luka Modric, Ramos, Kroos and Karim Benzema have all taken a significant step forward too, as tends to happen at this time of year; Madrid\u2019s pre-season is over, just in time for Europe. The question now is whether it is in time for the league too. \u201cNothing is impossible,\u201d Solari said. Nor, he insisted, was this about him, or the kid he coached at Cerro del Espino in September, just across the road from the Argentinian restaurant where he and Simeone used to eat and talk football and eat. \u201cThe team is all of us, but above all it is the players: they\u2019re the ones who put their bodies out there every game, who give their commitment, their heart and their talent,\u201d he said on Saturday, the day that Madrid announced their return. \u201cThe credit falls upon them. They\u2019re 95% of it; the rest of us are just trying to help.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Paul Scholes has been appointed the new manager of Oldham Athletic after signing a one-and-a-half-year deal. The former Manchester United player held a coaching roles at Old Trafford but this is his first permanent manager position. Scholes is a part-owner of Salford City, but will step down from his role as director of the National League club. Scholes will bring in the former Latics coach Mick Priest as his assistant with his first match in charge Tuesday evening\u2019s League Two encounter with Yeovil. Scholes revealed he had thought long and hard about embarking on a managerial career and was delighted to get started. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be any happier at the minute,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while. Obviously there\u2019s been talk of it when I finished my [playing] career. It wasn\u2019t something I was quite ready to do and there\u2019s obviously been three or four times over the last six years where it could have happened and I\u2019ve not been quite ready. But now I feel, I hope, the time is right to give it a go and hopefully we can be successful together. \u201cI want my team to be aggressive and focused on winning first and foremost. I know it\u2019s not going to happen every week, but I go into every game expecting to win. I go into every game expecting my team to entertain, I want to be entertained on the side and plenty of fans want to be entertained and I\u2019ll be thinking about scoring goals. \u201cI\u2019ve prepared for Yeovil, I\u2019ve seen them a few times. It\u2019s a funny league. Any team can beat anybody, we know that and Yeovil are on quite a bad run, while we had a great win on Saturday, so there\u2019s not much to change.\u201d Oldham\u2019s owner, Abdallah Lemsagam, added: \u201cPaul has won everything there is to win in football. He is a man who will bring a lot of footballing knowledge and his hunger to succeed in management will be there for everyone to see. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret how much he has wanted this job in the past and how much he loves this club, so I\u2019m very happy to bring him into our family at Oldham Athletic. Paul will have my backing 100% and hopefully we can work together to bring success back to this club.\u201d At United, Scholes was a reserve-team coach under Sir Alex Ferguson before he came out of retirement in January 2012 to resume his playing career. When retiring for good in May 2013, Scholes took coaching positions when David Moyes managed the club and briefly when Ryan Giggs was interim manager for four games at the close of the 2013-14 campaign, after the former was sacked. More recently Scholes has been working as a TV pundit.",

Gavin Williamson said he wanted the RAF to form a new \u201cconcept unit\u201d composed of hundreds of small flying craft, although some experts in the field questioned whether the technology described existed yet. The UK would \u201cdevelop swarm squadrons of network-enabled drones capable of confusing and overwhelming enemy air defences\u201d, Williamson said, and he promised to have them \u201cready to be deployed by the end of this year\u201d.

Downing Street played down another of Williamson\u2019s suggestions, that Britain\u2019s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, could be sent to the South China Sea as part of its maiden voyage to assert freedom of navigation rights in a region where China has expanded its territorial claims.

However, No 10 said precise details of the first deployment of the aircraft carrier in the region would be \u201cagreed by the prime minister in due course\u201d \u2013 rather than being decided by the defence secretary alone. Analysts said Williamson\u2019s attempt to talk up a hi-tech future for the armed forces implied billions in extra spending, and a bid for more money when the comprehensive spending review begins later this year. Prof Michael Clarke, a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said the armed forces would need an increase in spending from the existing 2.1% of GDP to around 2.5% \u201cjust to fill the holes, which would be an extra \u00a38bn or \u00a39bn a year\u201d.

must be one of the ultimate comfort reads. Originally published in 1988 it quickly became the best selling paperback in the world.  Have you read it? Do you have a comfort read - a book, series or author that you return to again and again?

A middle-aged mother, recently widowed, must learn to live a new life and shows a brave independence. Emotion is made to appear through writing of perfect clarity and simplicity.</p> <p>Towards the end I had a horrible certainty as to how it would finish and lay awake worrying.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1075197\">Dogbertd</a> has a different kind of worry about Tolstoy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hesitate to mention it, but I\u2019m almost finished War and Peace. I say hesitate, because people tend to look at you a bit funny when you say you\u2019re reading W&amp;P - my wife simply said \u201cOh my god\u201d as if I\u2019d taken leave of my senses. And I also hesitate because actually I\u2019m re-reading it. According to the date inside the cover (Penguin, 2 volumes, Tr. Edwards) I last read this in 1974, when I was clearly much too young to really appreciate it, since I remembered nothing of it except that I thought the philosophical bits rather dull.</p> <p>I can see now that waiting 44 years to come back to it was a serious mistake. I suppose I was put off by its length and \u201cclassic\u201d status, but I have to say it\u2019s a cracking good read, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone: I\u2019ve hugely enjoyed it.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cMy God, I\u2019m having a hoot,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100105930\">MachenBach</a>, who has been reading Markus Werner:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m on <em>Z\u00fcndel\u2019s Exit</em> which is (as you say of the other) terse and bitter, but also full of great lines and belly laughs (Hoffman did the translation). Like a funnier Bernhard. It\u2019s hitting the spot like you wouldn\u2019t believe.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Tombs Of Atuan, Ursula Le Guin has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3072847\">aldopaulista</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A bold sequel to A Wizard Of Earthsea - bold in that it\u2019s initially unclear that it bears any relationship to the first novel, other than being set on the same world (if you weren\u2019t aware of the sequel, you might not have recalled that Atuan is even mentioned in AWOE).</p> <p>It\u2019s a better book than its predecessor, I think, and asks some interesting questions about religion, power structures, and gender. A fine book and beautifully written. And although ostensibly YA, it\u2019s much more grown up than about 75% of the adult literature that I read...</p> </blockquote> <p>Only 75%?</p> <p>Like several others recently, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100531183\">SeriouslyLentil</a> has rediscoverd Ice by Anna Kavan, \u201cwhich I read decades ago and lost\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It really is astonishing, mixing post-nuclear apocalyptic disaster (new Ice Age) with feminism, often hallucinogen at times, dreamlike and sometimes stream of consciousness from an unreliable narrator searching for a strange, ephemeral girl and as ice closes in and the world turns to shit. Details are left vague and the three protagonists are nameless. The author spent most of her life addicted to heroin so there are obvious metaphors here. The writing is beautiful and I can only compare her descriptions of the freezing world as similar to Doris Lessing\u2019s The Making of the Representative for Planet 8.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bill Bryson\u2019s A Walk In The Woods has worked its magic on <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3345087\">sblejo</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Describing the frustrations of \u2018camping\u2019 on the Appalachian Trail with little or no equipment, walking for miles in hopes of encountering the next small town with motel and restaurant, and the revelations of walking with his friend Katz who is in no shape to take on such a trial. All true, very enlightening, not only about human nature but about the dismal \u2018care\u2019 the U.S. National Park System and associates \u2018lavish\u2019, so to speak on unforgettable, fabulous nature, out there for any of us to partake. Of course there are always the spoiled Ralph Lauren hiking outfit types, simply out for a night of camping and extreme drinking. Altogether an entertaining, wonderfully hilarious and thought-provoking comment on society, history, nature and ourselves.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12546532\">NicolaVintageReads </a>has discovered an unfortunate truth in a Raymond Chandler novel:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Racing through Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe novels which I\u2019ve never read before. Plots utterly confusing but what a great writer. I loved Marlowe\u2019s advice on giving up alcohol:</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a different world. You have to get used to a paler set of colours, a quieter lot of sounds, you have to allow for relapses. All the people you used to know well will get to be a little strange. You won\u2019t even like most of them and they won\u2019t like you too well.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Reality is overrated.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Avoid \u201cwan intensifiers\u201d.

Edwards) I last read this in 1974, when I was clearly much too young to really appreciate it, since I remembered nothing of it except that I thought the philosophical bits rather dull. I can see now that waiting 44 years to come back to it was a serious mistake. I suppose I was put off by its length and \u201cclassic\u201d status, but I have to say it\u2019s a cracking good read, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone: I\u2019ve hugely enjoyed it. \u201cMy God, I\u2019m having a hoot,\u201d says MachenBach, who has been reading Markus Werner: I\u2019m on Z\u00fcndel\u2019s Exit which is (as you say of the other) terse and bitter, but also full of great lines and belly laughs (Hoffman did the translation). Like a funnier Bernhard. It\u2019s hitting the spot like you wouldn\u2019t believe. The Tombs Of Atuan, Ursula Le Guin has impressed aldopaulista: A bold sequel to A Wizard Of Earthsea - bold in that it\u2019s initially unclear that it bears any relationship to the first novel, other than being set on the same world (if you weren\u2019t aware of the sequel, you might not have recalled that Atuan is even mentioned in AWOE). It\u2019s a better book than its predecessor, I think, and asks some interesting questions about religion, power structures, and gender. A fine book and beautifully written. And although ostensibly YA, it\u2019s much more grown up than about 75% of the adult literature that I read... Only 75%? Like several others recently, SeriouslyLentil has rediscoverd Ice by Anna Kavan, \u201cwhich I read decades ago and lost\u201d: It really is astonishing, mixing post-nuclear apocalyptic disaster (new Ice Age) with feminism, often hallucinogen at times, dreamlike and sometimes stream of consciousness from an unreliable narrator searching for a strange, ephemeral girl and as ice closes in and the world turns to shit. Details are left vague and the three protagonists are nameless. The author spent most of her life addicted to heroin so there are obvious metaphors here. The writing is beautiful and I can only compare her descriptions of the freezing world as similar to Doris Lessing\u2019s The Making of the Representative for Planet 8. Bill Bryson\u2019s A Walk In The Woods has worked its magic on sblejo: Describing the frustrations of \u2018camping\u2019 on the Appalachian Trail with little or no equipment, walking for miles in hopes of encountering the next small town with motel and restaurant, and the revelations of walking with his friend Katz who is in no shape to take on such a trial. All true, very enlightening, not only about human nature but about the dismal \u2018care\u2019 the U.S. National Park System and associates \u2018lavish\u2019, so to speak on unforgettable, fabulous nature, out there for any of us to partake. Of course there are always the spoiled Ralph Lauren hiking outfit types, simply out for a night of camping and extreme drinking. Altogether an entertaining, wonderfully hilarious and thought-provoking comment on society, history, nature and ourselves. Finally, NicolaVintageReads has discovered an unfortunate truth in a Raymond Chandler novel: Racing through Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe novels which I\u2019ve never read before. Plots utterly confusing but what a great writer. I loved Marlowe\u2019s advice on giving up alcohol: \u201cIt\u2019s a different world. You have to get used to a paler set of colours, a quieter lot of sounds, you have to allow for relapses. All the people you used to know well will get to be a little strange. You won\u2019t even like most of them and they won\u2019t like you too well.\u201d Reality is overrated. Interesting links about books and reading Avoid \u201cwan intensifiers\u201d. Random House copy chief Benjamin Dryer explains why in this \u201cbrilliant\u201d interview. A podcast that breaks down Harry Potter chapter by chapter has been a big hit. On a \u201cTolstoyan anarchist community\u201d in Essex \u2013 and Penelope Fitzgerald. Poet and critic Dan Chiasson has been allowed to continue his ongoing review of the US President. Just in case you missed that astonishing Dan Mallory story in the New Yorker. \u201cThe other main category of puddings \u2013 milk puddings \u2013 is the kind of thing that one would prefer to pass over in silence, but it must be mentioned, since these dishes are, unfortunately, characteristic of Britain.\u201d George Orwell\u2019s essay on food has finally been published.

      "body": "<p>Anna Paquin is supposed to be having a day off. She has been working for two weeks straight, with no break at the weekend, and she has six-year-old twins, a boy and a girl. \u201cSo I\u2019m a wee bit tired. But good, really good,\u201d she says. She is dipping into her free time to talk about her new TV series, Flack, because she is not only starring in it, but executive-producing it, too, and it is co-produced through her own company, Casm. She has spent five years trying to get it off the ground, in stops and starts, and they finished filming it just four days before we meet. Hence the tiredness? She nods. \u201cIt\u2019s not a name-only credit. I\u2019m a huge control freak. I\u2019m involved in every single aspect of every single decision.\u201d</p> <p>In person, Paquin is brisk, earnest and articulate, and careful with her words. She was born in Canada in 1982, but grew up in New Zealand, then moved to the US as a teenager for work. She has been in front of the camera since she was nine, when she was cast in Jane Campion\u2019s film The Piano. \u201cI entered this industry in a very backwards sort of way,\u201d she says. \u201cI did one job, won an Oscar, and then people said: \u2018Ooh, you have a career now.\u2019\u201d She points out, though, that there is a wealth of talented women in her age group, which means she will \u201cstill have to audition my arse off for stuff I really want\u201d, but it does mean that she can generally work on things that she wants to. \u201cI do have the luxury of being a little more choosy because of the circumstances of my career.\u201d</p> <p>In Flack, Paquin is Robyn, a hard-living, self-destructive type who works in the crisis-management area of public relations. The show is a lot of fun, and reminds me what good TV was like before shows developed grand cinematic ambitions. It\u2019s outrageous, a little bit camp and darkly comic in tone. \u201cOh, it goes places, and it keeps going places,\u201d Paquin says with a smile, admitting that it speaks to her sense of humour. In the first episode, Robyn has to cover up a philandering TV chef and a footballer\u2019s drug-fuelled gay tryst, all the while juggling her own issues, which seem to involve a lot of cocaine. \u201cSome people will be offended, other people will be laughing so hard they\u2019re going to snort coffee through their nose while they\u2019re watching it.\u201d That\u2019s a state of affairs that suits her. \u201cI want people to absolutely love it, or, possibly, be violently like: \u2018<em>How could you?\u2019</em>\u201d Would she take that as a compliment? \u201cOh, yeah. It means that we did it properly.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver Lansley, who wrote and created Flack, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/06/flack-anna-paquin-pop-tv-uktv-1202403706/\" title=\"\">told Deadline Hollywood</a> that with Robyn, he wanted to create a female character who could stand alongside \u201cdifficult men\u201d such as Tony Soprano, Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and Breaking Bad\u2019s Walter White. Paquin feels passionately that stories about \u201ccomplicated women\u201d should be told. \u201cI mean, take Dexter. Male protagonists get to quite literally be serial killers and the audience still loves them. Whereas traditionally, if female characters put one foot out of line, from the sort of patriarchal ideals of what a perfect woman is like, then you have to watch them being punished for it. And I really am enjoying the fact that I\u2019m part of a generation of women in film where we can just tell interesting, complicated stories about people who happen to be women.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25168ac5b9880900b5d9ea202d5fd1e0deb7b4b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25168ac5b9880900b5d9ea202d5fd1e0deb7b4b3/0_275_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paquin as Robyn in Flack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paquin as Robyn in Flack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UKTV/Des Willie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s changed? \u201cThe power balance has changed,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are more women in executive and behind-the-scenes roles who have just had enough of being told what we can and can\u2019t do. And women like myself going: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve been doing this for 27 years; I\u2019m not going to sit around and wait for those roles to show up. I\u2019m going to go out there, find it, create it and make it happen for myself.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is a reason, she suggests, that it takes more time for women to step into positions of power. \u201cOne has to work extra-hard as a woman in a very male-dominated industry. As an actress walking on to a film set, you\u2019re guilty until proven innocent. They assume you\u2019re going to be a pain in the arse, high-maintenance and difficult, and you usually spend the first couple of weeks having to work hard to prove that you\u2019re not going to be a problem because you\u2019re a woman. And I think we\u2019re all just collectively done with that.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her about her experiences of being an adolescent in a business like this, and she takes a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019d need a year to really get into the broad strokes of that one. Look, I\u2019ve had some really amazing experiences, and I\u2019ve had some absolutely horrific experiences. People treat people who have no power, sometimes, in ways that are completely unacceptable. But when you\u2019re a child and you don\u2019t know any different, and you don\u2019t want to get into trouble, you just keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p> <p>She is cautiously optimistic that, in these more open times, sets are being made safer, and women might be able to make it a better industry. \u201cWhen I see younger girls on set, or kids, that I once looked at thinking: \u2018Please, dear God, get out of the film industry,\u2019 I now think: \u2018Actually, we might be able to make this a safe environment for young people in positions of no power.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Paquin almost gave up acting in her late teens. She enrolled at Columbia University, planning to study French and English literature. Her mother is an English teacher, so she thought she might follow in her footsteps, or perhaps write. But theatre reignited her enthusiasm, and she went on to appear in a series of blockbusters, including a stint as Rogue in the X-Men film franchise. In 2008, she took her first TV role, as Sookie Stackhouse in the supernatural series True Blood, and it was a huge hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86c27fceda6d7fed33fe24f293fe8432e80b7875\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86c27fceda6d7fed33fe24f293fe8432e80b7875/0_312_1678_2096/801.jpg\" alt=\"With Holly Hunter in The Piano.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Holly Hunter in The Piano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, while promoting the show, she sat down with the talkshow host Larry King, who asked her a series of what she found to be intrusive questions about its sex scenes. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that the generation thing is an excuse \u2026 but I do legitimately think he is of a generation where certain kinds of entertainment didn\u2019t exist, probably, when he was growing up,\u201d she says. Would that line of questioning happen now, even five years later? \u201cI do think in general people are a little bit more careful about how they ask women questions about anything to do with sex, sexuality and provocative content. As they should be.\u201d</p> <p>She adds that he got more stick for asking her about being bisexual, and whether she was a \u201cformer bisexual\u201d because she had married Stephen Moyer, her True Blood co-star. \u201cHe got the shit kicked out of him by the LGBT community.\u201d Paquin, who came out as bisexual in 2010, says that misunderstandings are fairly common. \u201cPeople understand the version of the world they live in, and if it\u2019s outside their experience, then sometimes it frightens people, or they just don\u2019t get it. And that\u2019s fine.\u201d She has worked with LGBT advocacy charities for years, and her Twitter and Instagram feeds suggest she\u2019s more than happy to get into discussions with people who disagree with her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hit somebody over the head with something and go: \u2018You\u2019re stupid.\u2019 I want to explain things to people,\u201d she says.</p> <p>With Flack, there is a sense that Paquin is pulling back the curtain on showbiz. It is heightened, of course, but nevertheless it speaks of the uneasy relationship between the illusion of fame and the reality of it. \u201cWhen you have a job that involves being everything to everybody at all times, being a chameleon, what does that do to your sense of your real self? How do you maintain a grasp on reality when your job is constantly playing with reality?\u201d she asks. She\u2019s talking about her character, but I tell her that it sounds like a good question for an actor, too. \u201cYes,\u201d she laughs, quietly. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p> <p><em>Flack starts on Thursday 21 February at 10pm on W.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Anna Paquin is supposed to be having a day off. She has been working for two weeks straight, with no break at the weekend, and she has six-year-old twins, a boy and a girl. \u201cSo I\u2019m a wee bit tired. But good, really good,\u201d she says. She is dipping into her free time to talk about her new TV series, Flack, because she is not only starring in it, but executive-producing it, too, and it is co-produced through her own company, Casm. She has spent five years trying to get it off the ground, in stops and starts, and they finished filming it just four days before we meet. Hence the tiredness? She nods. \u201cIt\u2019s not a name-only credit. I\u2019m a huge control freak. I\u2019m involved in every single aspect of every single decision.\u201d In person, Paquin is brisk, earnest and articulate, and careful with her words. She was born in Canada in 1982, but grew up in New Zealand, then moved to the US as a teenager for work. She has been in front of the camera since she was nine, when she was cast in Jane Campion\u2019s film The Piano. \u201cI entered this industry in a very backwards sort of way,\u201d she says. \u201cI did one job, won an Oscar, and then people said: \u2018Ooh, you have a career now.\u2019\u201d She points out, though, that there is a wealth of talented women in her age group, which means she will \u201cstill have to audition my arse off for stuff I really want\u201d, but it does mean that she can generally work on things that she wants to. \u201cI do have the luxury of being a little more choosy because of the circumstances of my career.\u201d In Flack, Paquin is Robyn, a hard-living, self-destructive type who works in the crisis-management area of public relations. The show is a lot of fun, and reminds me what good TV was like before shows developed grand cinematic ambitions. It\u2019s outrageous, a little bit camp and darkly comic in tone. \u201cOh, it goes places, and it keeps going places,\u201d Paquin says with a smile, admitting that it speaks to her sense of humour. In the first episode, Robyn has to cover up a philandering TV chef and a footballer\u2019s drug-fuelled gay tryst, all the while juggling her own issues, which seem to involve a lot of cocaine. \u201cSome people will be offended, other people will be laughing so hard they\u2019re going to snort coffee through their nose while they\u2019re watching it.\u201d That\u2019s a state of affairs that suits her. \u201cI want people to absolutely love it, or, possibly, be violently like: \u2018How could you?\u2019\u201d Would she take that as a compliment? \u201cOh, yeah. It means that we did it properly.\u201d Oliver Lansley, who wrote and created Flack, told Deadline Hollywood that with Robyn, he wanted to create a female character who could stand alongside \u201cdifficult men\u201d such as Tony Soprano, Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and Breaking Bad\u2019s Walter White. Paquin feels passionately that stories about \u201ccomplicated women\u201d should be told. \u201cI mean, take Dexter. Male protagonists get to quite literally be serial killers and the audience still loves them. Whereas traditionally, if female characters put one foot out of line, from the sort of patriarchal ideals of what a perfect woman is like, then you have to watch them being punished for it. And I really am enjoying the fact that I\u2019m part of a generation of women in film where we can just tell interesting, complicated stories about people who happen to be women.\u201d What\u2019s changed? \u201cThe power balance has changed,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are more women in executive and behind-the-scenes roles who have just had enough of being told what we can and can\u2019t do. And women like myself going: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve been doing this for 27 years; I\u2019m not going to sit around and wait for those roles to show up. I\u2019m going to go out there, find it, create it and make it happen for myself.\u2019\u201d There is a reason, she suggests, that it takes more time for women to step into positions of power. \u201cOne has to work extra-hard as a woman in a very male-dominated industry. As an actress walking on to a film set, you\u2019re guilty until proven innocent. They assume you\u2019re going to be a pain in the arse, high-maintenance and difficult, and you usually spend the first couple of weeks having to work hard to prove that you\u2019re not going to be a problem because you\u2019re a woman. And I think we\u2019re all just collectively done with that.\u201d I ask her about her experiences of being an adolescent in a business like this, and she takes a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019d need a year to really get into the broad strokes of that one. Look, I\u2019ve had some really amazing experiences, and I\u2019ve had some absolutely horrific experiences. People treat people who have no power, sometimes, in ways that are completely unacceptable. But when you\u2019re a child and you don\u2019t know any different, and you don\u2019t want to get into trouble, you just keep your mouth shut.\u201d She is cautiously optimistic that, in these more open times, sets are being made safer, and women might be able to make it a better industry. \u201cWhen I see younger girls on set, or kids, that I once looked at thinking: \u2018Please, dear God, get out of the film industry,\u2019 I now think: \u2018Actually, we might be able to make this a safe environment for young people in positions of no power.\u2019\u201d Paquin almost gave up acting in her late teens. She enrolled at Columbia University, planning to study French and English literature. Her mother is an English teacher, so she thought she might follow in her footsteps, or perhaps write. But theatre reignited her enthusiasm, and she went on to appear in a series of blockbusters, including a stint as Rogue in the X-Men film franchise. In 2008, she took her first TV role, as Sookie Stackhouse in the supernatural series True Blood, and it was a huge hit. In 2014, while promoting the show, she sat down with the talkshow host Larry King, who asked her a series of what she found to be intrusive questions about its sex scenes. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that the generation thing is an excuse \u2026 but I do legitimately think he is of a generation where certain kinds of entertainment didn\u2019t exist, probably, when he was growing up,\u201d she says. Would that line of questioning happen now, even five years later? \u201cI do think in general people are a little bit more careful about how they ask women questions about anything to do with sex, sexuality and provocative content. As they should be.\u201d She adds that he got more stick for asking her about being bisexual, and whether she was a \u201cformer bisexual\u201d because she had married Stephen Moyer, her True Blood co-star. \u201cHe got the shit kicked out of him by the LGBT community.\u201d Paquin, who came out as bisexual in 2010, says that misunderstandings are fairly common. \u201cPeople understand the version of the world they live in, and if it\u2019s outside their experience, then sometimes it frightens people, or they just don\u2019t get it. And that\u2019s fine.\u201d She has worked with LGBT advocacy charities for years, and her Twitter and Instagram feeds suggest she\u2019s more than happy to get into discussions with people who disagree with her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hit somebody over the head with something and go: \u2018You\u2019re stupid.\u2019 I want to explain things to people,\u201d she says. With Flack, there is a sense that Paquin is pulling back the curtain on showbiz. It is heightened, of course, but nevertheless it speaks of the uneasy relationship between the illusion of fame and the reality of it. \u201cWhen you have a job that involves being everything to everybody at all times, being a chameleon, what does that do to your sense of your real self? How do you maintain a grasp on reality when your job is constantly playing with reality?\u201d she asks. She\u2019s talking about her character, but I tell her that it sounds like a good question for an actor, too. \u201cYes,\u201d she laughs, quietly. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d Flack starts on Thursday 21 February at 10pm on W.",

I\u2019ll never forget it as long as I live.

If you came from the provinces at that time, it was very intimidating to try and make it in London. In music, the path had been softened by the Beatles, but in film and theatre it was still very hard. Albert made it possible \u2013 along with his contemporaries, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-courtenay\">Tom Courtenay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/29/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Alan Bates</a>.</p> <p>But for me at least, he was the great shining light.

He was irresistible to beautiful women \u2013 which he loved. And he was mischievous. It\u2019s not a very politically-correct story, but I remember him telling me about the time the director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002045/\">Stanley Donen</a> introduced him to Audrey Hepburn. They were to star together in this Hollywood romance, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062407/\">Two For the Road</a>, and had dinner in a bistro in Chelsea. And Albert played it completely limp-wristed, lisping and gay. Audrey was absolutely horrified. When Albert excused himself at the end of the meal, she turned to Stanley and said: \u201cWhat are you doing? This has to be a great love affair!\u201d and he went: \u201cOh, he\u2019s just joking.\u201d Then Albert came back with that great big grin on his face and Audrey said: \u201cYou bastard!\u201d That was Albert.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22662cd27c79db45508f0503683b7be342cee7a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22662cd27c79db45508f0503683b7be342cee7a7/0_0_4093_3836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Authentic talent \u2026 Finney in Much Ado About Nothing at the National Theatre in 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"937\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Authentic talent \u2026 Finney in Much Ado About Nothing at the National Theatre in 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was also a very private man \u2013 he never courted the press.

He didn\u2019t always need to take the leading role \u2013 though, of course, you couldn\u2019t take your eyes off him. He was an authentic, great talent. That\u2019s important \u2013 and rare.</p> <p>I hope in some sense he passed a baton to me, with If\u2026 and then with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/15/artsfeatures\">O Lucky Man!</a>, just as Gary Oldman once told me it was seeing those films which made him want to be an actor. I feel very indebted and close to Albert still. I\u2019ll miss him very much. </p> <p><em>\u2022 As told to Catherine Shoard</em></p> <h2>Mike Figgis</h2> <p>It was day one on the shoot of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043362/\">The Browning Version</a> in 1994. Albert was sitting with the script, using a thick black marker pen to cross out sections of text. I asked him if he was making dialogue changes. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just crossing out all those directions that say, \u2018He looks up sadly\u2019, or \u2018He holds back the emotion.\u2019 I\u2019ll make those decisions myself when I do the scene.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b05b07fc4a627f4ebcea6b169238e95df183ed77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05b07fc4a627f4ebcea6b169238e95df183ed77/32_0_1882_1526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Finney with director Mike Figgis on set of The Browning Version, 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Decisions \u2026 Albert Finney with director Mike Figgis on set of The Browning Version, 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the film, Albert\u2019s character has to deal with a series of humiliations \u2013 we were filming one such scene. In my script (by the great writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/05/sir-ronald-harwood-q-and-a-interview\">Ronald Harwood</a>) it did suggest a tearful face. We\u2019d done a couple of takes and Albert\u2019s face was noticeably dry. I asked if we should perhaps do one with moisture. Albert was never rude or high-handed. He just opened his script and pointed out that 10 pages later comes the big scene where he finally breaks down. I apologised and we quickly moved on to the next scene.</p> <p>I met Albert when I was trying to raise money for my first film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096180/\">Stormy Monday</a>. He\u2019d always been my favourite British actor and I was in awe of him. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062792/\">Charlie Bubbles </a>and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088322/\">Under the Volcano</a> demonstrated his great acting skills as well as a sense that he was one of the most interesting artists on the British scene, not just an actor but a style-maker.</p> <p>We went for lunch somewhere trendy. I remember it was just a few days after the Chernobyl disaster. Michael Douglas was at a nearby table. Our food arrived, the talk was fascinating and I was in heaven. Albert leaned forward confidentially: \u201cDon\u2019t make it obvious but can you tell me if Michael Douglas is eating potatoes?\u201d I looked: his plate was minimal, just a steak and some greens. Albert nodded: \u201cI thought so. He still takes his clothes off in movies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c5cd3ca5969d2fd629786f93170e262dffd70214\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5cd3ca5969d2fd629786f93170e262dffd70214/0_0_1984_2864/693.jpg\" alt=\"Playing drunk \u2026 Finney with Jacqueline Bisset in 1984\u2019s Under the Volcano.\" width=\"693\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing drunk \u2026 Finney with Jacqueline Bisset in 1984\u2019s Under the Volcano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Conacite Uno</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we wrapped The Browning Version, Albert told me he\u2019d enjoyed the process and hoped we might do it again, but that he never watched his films or went to festivals. During the shoot, he\u2019d taken every member of the cast and crew out to dinner in groups of about five or six. At the wrap party, he gave everyone a bottle of wine \u2013 a fine wine, not some cheap plonk. Such a generous guy.</p> <p>The film was selected for competition at Cannes and the festival director, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0414201/\">Gilles Jacob</a>, buttonholed me on the Croisette, urging me to persuade Albert to attend, as he was a dead cert to win the best actor award. Albert was hard to track down as he\u2019d decided not to bother with an agent. Finally we spoke: \u201cTell Gilles Jacob I\u2019m having a baby,\u201d he said. Albert loved the gee-gees and one of his lady horses was foaling on a stud farm in Ireland. Jacob was not amused: \u201cZen he does not win ze prize.\u201d (I often ponder on the implied politics.)</p> <p>We remained friends after the film. I was prepping Leaving Las Vegas and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/01/nicolas-cage-if-i-dont-have-a-job-to-do-it-can-be-very-self-destructive\">Nic Cage was dead-set on doing the film drunk</a>. I asked Albert\u2019s advice over lunch, as I regard his performance in John Huston\u2019s Under the Volcano as definitive. \u201cTo play drunk, never overact,\u201d he said. \u201cA drunk puts a glass down with such care and delicacy, the movements become mannered, not exaggerated. If you want the sense of alcohol, keep a small glass of scotch on hand and before each take dip your finger in it and wet your lips.\u2019\u201d I passed the advice on to Nic verbatim. Some of it stuck.</p> <p>Albert was our finest actor, a man of discreet wisdom, compassion and incredible ability. His voice was as beautiful as his face \u2013 and his heart. He left a great legacy and his death is a great loss.</p>",

They were to star together in this Hollywood romance, Two For the Road, and had dinner in a bistro in Chelsea. And Albert played it completely limp-wristed, lisping and gay. Audrey was absolutely horrified. When Albert excused himself at the end of the meal, she turned to Stanley and said: \u201cWhat are you doing? This has to be a great love affair!\u201d and he went: \u201cOh, he\u2019s just joking.\u201d Then Albert came back with that great big grin on his face and Audrey said: \u201cYou bastard!\u201d That was Albert. He was also a very private man \u2013 he never courted the press. He wasn\u2019t egotistical: I remember going to see him at the National when he played Don Pedro in Much Ado About Nothing. He didn\u2019t always need to take the leading role \u2013 though, of course, you couldn\u2019t take your eyes off him. He was an authentic, great talent. That\u2019s important \u2013 and rare. I hope in some sense he passed a baton to me, with If\u2026 and then with O Lucky Man!, just as Gary Oldman once told me it was seeing those films which made him want to be an actor. I feel very indebted and close to Albert still. I\u2019ll miss him very much. \u2022 As told to Catherine Shoard Mike Figgis It was day one on the shoot of The Browning Version in 1994. Albert was sitting with the script, using a thick black marker pen to cross out sections of text. I asked him if he was making dialogue changes. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just crossing out all those directions that say, \u2018He looks up sadly\u2019, or \u2018He holds back the emotion.\u2019 I\u2019ll make those decisions myself when I do the scene.\u201d In the film, Albert\u2019s character has to deal with a series of humiliations \u2013 we were filming one such scene. In my script (by the great writer Ronald Harwood) it did suggest a tearful face. We\u2019d done a couple of takes and Albert\u2019s face was noticeably dry. I asked if we should perhaps do one with moisture. Albert was never rude or high-handed. He just opened his script and pointed out that 10 pages later comes the big scene where he finally breaks down. I apologised and we quickly moved on to the next scene. I met Albert when I was trying to raise money for my first film, Stormy Monday. He\u2019d always been my favourite British actor and I was in awe of him. Charlie Bubbles and Under the Volcano demonstrated his great acting skills as well as a sense that he was one of the most interesting artists on the British scene, not just an actor but a style-maker. We went for lunch somewhere trendy. I remember it was just a few days after the Chernobyl disaster. Michael Douglas was at a nearby table. Our food arrived, the talk was fascinating and I was in heaven. Albert leaned forward confidentially: \u201cDon\u2019t make it obvious but can you tell me if Michael Douglas is eating potatoes?\u201d I looked: his plate was minimal, just a steak and some greens. Albert nodded: \u201cI thought so. He still takes his clothes off in movies.\u201d When we wrapped The Browning Version, Albert told me he\u2019d enjoyed the process and hoped we might do it again, but that he never watched his films or went to festivals. During the shoot, he\u2019d taken every member of the cast and crew out to dinner in groups of about five or six. At the wrap party, he gave everyone a bottle of wine \u2013 a fine wine, not some cheap plonk. Such a generous guy. The film was selected for competition at Cannes and the festival director, Gilles Jacob, buttonholed me on the Croisette, urging me to persuade Albert to attend, as he was a dead cert to win the best actor award. Albert was hard to track down as he\u2019d decided not to bother with an agent. Finally we spoke: \u201cTell Gilles Jacob I\u2019m having a baby,\u201d he said. Albert loved the gee-gees and one of his lady horses was foaling on a stud farm in Ireland. Jacob was not amused: \u201cZen he does not win ze prize.\u201d (I often ponder on the implied politics.) We remained friends after the film. I was prepping Leaving Las Vegas and Nic Cage was dead-set on doing the film drunk. I asked Albert\u2019s advice over lunch, as I regard his performance in John Huston\u2019s Under the Volcano as definitive. \u201cTo play drunk, never overact,\u201d he said. \u201cA drunk puts a glass down with such care and delicacy, the movements become mannered, not exaggerated. If you want the sense of alcohol, keep a small glass of scotch on hand and before each take dip your finger in it and wet your lips.\u2019\u201d I passed the advice on to Nic verbatim. Some of it stuck. Albert was our finest actor, a man of discreet wisdom, compassion and incredible ability. His voice was as beautiful as his face \u2013 and his heart. He left a great legacy and his death is a great loss.",

During a five-minute hearing at Bournemouth town hall in Dorset, it emerged that Sala was formally identified by a fingerprint expert.

When the police informed her that plane was missing she repeatedly tried to call her father on his mobile. \u201cI was sat there ringing my dad, you know, as if it\u2019s not my dad.\u201d Before the flight, David Ibbotson messaged a friend to say he was \u201ca bit rusty\u201d with the instrument landing system on the plane. His wife insisted he was an experienced pilot and that the remark was a joke. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s like when you go on holiday, two or three weeks and you come back and you get in our car because you haven\u2019t driven for a few days, it\u2019s that. We\u2019ve all done it, I have, that was just Dave.\u201d Asked if he was allowed to carry passengers in the plane, she said: \u201cHe had a private licence so he was able to carry passengers. Other than that, with the investigation going on, I really can\u2019t say any more.\u201d She added: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his work; he was a gas engineer, but his passion for flying, that was Dave.\u201d",

At a hearing in London on Monday, Eurotunnel\u2019s barrister, Daniel Beard QC, said the procurement process for \u201cadditional capacity for transport of goods across the Channel\u201d had been \u201cundertaken without any public notice being issued\u201d. Ewan West, representing Grayling, told the judge the process was only for \u201cmaritime freight\u201d services and, therefore, Eurotunnel \u201ccould never have provided that capacity\u201d and \u201ccould not have complied\u201d with the terms of the contracts.

However, Ofcom concluded a sufficient range of views were being represented by the BBC and its content did not break broadcasting code rules requiring impartiality. The public broadcaster has been repeatedly criticised during and after the EU referendum by both sides, with Brexiters arguing the BBC\u2019s output is overwhelmingly negative about the consequences of leaving the EU. At the same time, a vocal contingent of remain supporters have lambasted the broadcaster\u2019s content for not warning enough about the consequences of leaving the EU, with the likes of Andrew Adonis, the Labour peer, calling it the \u201cBrexit Broadcasting Corporation\u201d. The complaint was submitted last year by a cross-party group of pro-Brexit peers and MPs, including Labour\u2019s Kate Hoey, the Conservative MP Philip Davies, the DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley and the former Ukip leader and peer Malcolm Pearson. They dismissed the BBC\u2019s initial defence of its output last summer, forcing Ofcom to take a second look. Ofcom said it found no grounds for further investigation but took the unusual decision to publish its reasoning in order to shed light on its decision-making process. The complaint was based on three surveys, carried out by the campaign group News-watch, which involved monitoring 75 hours of content broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 9 October 2017 and 29 March 2018. Ofcom said broadcasters were required to present the news with \u201cdue impartiality\u201d, meaning adequate or appropriate to the subject and nature of the programme. \u201cIt does not mean an equal division of time has to be given to every view, or that every argument and every facet of every argument has to be represented.\u201d The public debate has since moved \u201cinto a much more complex and nuanced discussion comprising many different viewpoints on the form that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU should take, and the potential implications on a range of different areas\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration system would cost employers more than \u00a31bn in administration costs over five years, harm the higher education sector by putting off EU students and risk a new Windrush scandal, according to an analysis of the plans. The report by Global Future, a thinktank that supports more open immigration, says the NHS would also face almost \u00a3120m a year in additional costs to recruit overseas staff under the system laid out in the immigration white paper. The long-delayed plan imposes the same \u00a330,000-a-year minimum salary threshold for EU citizens looking to work in the UK that already applies to those outside the bloc, as well as various visa fees and other charges. Using Home Office modelling for the number of people expected to apply for visas of different lengths, and a calculated average cost to employers of almost \u00a312,500 per EU national, the study comes to a five-year total of \u00a31.14bn, with \u00a3337m faced by the public sector. The study separately estimates the cost to the NHS by using figures for the likely number of EU workers needed under the service\u2019s long-term plan and fees and other charges they would incur. This would, it said, total \u00a3118m a year. It also says the \u00a330,000 threshold could eventually leave as many as 100,000 jobs social care and nursing jobs unfilled and cause difficulty in many other sectors. Students from the EU who decide to base themselves in the UK would incur visa and health surcharge costs of almost \u00a31,300 over a three-year degree, the thinktank says, making a total of \u00a380m a year across the sector as a whole. The report also says that in requiring people based in the UK under freedom of movement to suddenly prove their status, the scheme risks mirroring the Windrush scandal, in which UK nationals of Caribbean origin who had been in the UK for decades were denied rights or even deported because of a lack of documentation. This could happen again through a lack of awareness, Home Office errors and technicalities such as people having spent time out of the UK. Fergus Peace, a researcher at Global Future, who wrote the report, said the white paper \u201crepresents an unambiguous shift towards a more complex and burdensome immigration system that will damage our country\u2019s prospects\u201d. \u201cThe government presents ending free movement as the great prize at the centre of its Brexit strategy, but ultimately this white paper is a plan to close ourselves off from the world. That\u2019s not something to celebrate. It\u2019s a dreadful mistake.,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our updated news story on the UK growth figures (see here for rolling coverage) The British economy plunged into reverse in December, with a broad-based slump in economic output completing the weakest year for growth since 2012. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product contracted by 0.4% from the previous month, fuelled by a fall in spending on the high street over the key festive shopping period. With less than 50 days to go before Brexit, the figures showed all three drivers of growth in the British economy \u2013 services, production and construction \u2013 shrank during December. The decline in monthly output helped drag down quarter-on-quarter growth to a rate of 0.2% in the three months to the end of the year, slightly below the Bank of England\u2019s expectations and down from a rate of 0.6% in the third quarter. Economists tend to focus on the three-month figures, as monthly GDP snapshots can be prone to revision, but the scale of the decline in December is likely to be seen as a sign of the economy losing momentum as Brexit draws nearer. For 2018 as a whole, GDP growth slipped to its lowest since 2012, at 1.4%, down from 1.8% in 2017. Here\u2019s the full take: That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Our economics editor Larry Elliott sees more bumps ahead for the UK economy: In the meantime, the economy is going to struggle and growth could be even weaker in the first three months of 2019 than it was at the tail end of 2018 if consumers really go into their shells. A recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of negative output \u2013 will probably be avoided with the help of higher government spending but it could be a close run thing. Brexit is not the only factor holding back the economy. Global growth is slowing and there are some other EU countries, Germany and Italy for example, that did even worse in the second half of 2018. Pressure to avoid a no-deal Brexit will not be coming just from policy makers in the UK. More here: With British industry in recession, firms should have activated their Brexit contingency plans by now, argues Nicole Livesey, manufacturing partner at Pinsent Masons. She explains: Many will need to alter logistics and shipping routes, invest in warehousing of stock and adjust production schedules to protect their business. We may also see operations being relocated overseas as well as reduced worker headcount in the coming months. \u201cThe manufacturing sector has warned Government for some time that a sharp slowdown would take hold in the wake of Brexit. Given we are just 46 days away from 29th March businesses need to take action to safeguard against the impact of a no-deal.\u201d Here\u2019s a timely reminder that the eurozone is also slowing: The latest UK trade figures have brought little cheer. Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world has widened in the last quarter as it bought more goods - including cars - from the EU. Imports from EU countries increased by \u00a31.7bn in October-December, while exports increased by just \u00a30.04bn. The rise in imports was due mainly to a \u00a31.5bn increase in imports of machinery and transport equipment, of which \u00a31bn was cars. Here\u2019s the key points from the ONS: The total trade deficit (goods and services) widened \u00a30.9 billion to \u00a310.4 billion in the three months to December 2018, due mainly to a \u00a31.5 billion rise in goods imports. Rising imports of cars, material manufactures and chemicals were the main contributors to the rise in goods imports in the three months to December 2018; this was offset in part by falling imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) and fuels. The trade in goods deficit widened \u00a31.6 billion with EU countries and narrowed \u00a30.2 billion with non-EU countries in the three months to December 2018. Excluding erratic commodities, the total trade deficit widened \u00a33.8 billion to \u00a312.9 billion in the three months to December 2018. Removing the effect of inflation, the total trade deficit widened \u00a30.6 billion to \u00a37.1 billion in the three months to December 2018. The total trade deficit widened \u00a38.4 billion to \u00a332.3 billion between 2017 and 2018, due mainly to a \u00a37.2 billion increase in services imports. Sky News have broadcast an interview with Philip Hammond, in which the chancellor warns that the failure to agree a Brexit deal is hurting the economy. Asked about the slowdown in growth to just 0.2% in the last quarter, Hammond replies: It\u2019s a solid performance from the economy when you took at what\u2019s happening globally and in other competitor countries. But of course there is no doubt that our economy is being overshadowed by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process. The sooner we can resolve that the better, and the quicker we can get back to more robust growth in the future. Hammond (a former Remain supporter who now favours a softer Brexit) also admitted that he\u2019s expected an agreement to be signed by now. I\u2019m afraid this has gone on longer than we would have liked. We would have liked to have been able to bank this at the back end of last year, but I\u2019m confident that we will get it done, and that\u2019s the important thing that business needs to hear. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University says today\u2019s UK GDP figures are bad, and also worse than the Bank of England predicted in its Inflation Report last week (when it also estimated a one-in-four chance of a recession in 2019). He tells us: Indeed, the Bank\u2019s forecasts assumed annual growth of 1.36% as the most likely outcome for 2018 Q4. Today\u2019s ONS data readings suggest even lower annual growth at 1.3% for 2018 Q4 and a GDP contraction of 0.4% in December. Quite worryingly, the \u201ccarry over\u201d effects of the above readings indicate that the risk of recession has risen... Will politicians take (any) notice? UK trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, has blamed China\u2019s cooling economy for Britain\u2019s weak growth, rather than Brexit. Speaking in Bern this morning, Fox said: \u201cClearly there are those who believe that Brexit is the only economic factor applying to the UK economy. I think you\u2019ll find that the predicted slowdown in a number of European economies is not disconnected from the slowdown, for example, in China\u201d. He saw speaking after signing a trade continuity agreement to guarantee future trading terms between the UK and Switzerland after Brexit. Here\u2019s another neat chart from Rupert, putting the UK slowdown in context: UK service companies, builders and manufacturers all had a relatively tough 2018, with growth the weakest in at least five years. The ONS says: Headline annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth was 1.4% in 2018, the lowest it has been in six years. Meanwhile, the services sector had annual growth of 1.7%, the lowest since 2011 and the production sector had annual growth of 0.7%, the lowest since 2013. Construction annual growth was 0.6%, the lowest since 2012 When company bosses are nervous about the future, they stop buying new machinery and put off expanding into new premises. That makes business expenditure a good measure of the underlying health of the economy, as (used wisely) it should deliver faster growth and higher productivity. So the recent slide in business spending is a concern; these charts from economist Rupert Seggins shows the scale of the deterioration: Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, is also concerned, saying: \u201cIt is particularly worrying to see business investment contracting significantly again, as it will impact the UK\u2019s longer term productive capacity as well as productivity performance, and points at a low vote of confidence from business in the UK\u2019s future. The contraction in manufacturing, despite the relatively weak pound and while the UK economy is still enjoying the benefits of the EU trade framework is also a worry for what to come. \u201cAs on many other occasions, the economy was bolstered by households who continued to spend, albeit more reluctantly, and by a pick-up in government spending, which will not be sustainable in the long run. We need to see a recovery in business confidence and investment to get the UK economy moving again.\u201d You can see the UK GDP report online, here. While quarterly GDP data are volatile (and monthly even more so), the long-term picture of UK growth is clear: Economist Sam Tombs is hopeful that Britain will avoid a recession this year: Chancellor Philip Hammond has pointed out that the UK economy \u201ccontinues to grow\u201d, overlooking the fact it did quite the opposite in December. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the UK economy was buffeted by problems at home and overseas: There\u2019s little doubt Brexit uncertainty is responsible for the disappointing numbers, though concerns over global trade will also have played a part. Business investment \u2013 the most Brexit-sensitive element of GDP - dropped 3.7% Q4 against a year earlier, the biggest fall since early 2010. The UK isn\u2019t the only country that struggled to post strong growth in the last quarter of 2018. Italy\u2019s economy shrank by 0.2%, putting the eurozone\u2019s third-largest member into recession. France did better, expanding by 0.3% despite the disruption caused by the gilet jaune protests. The wider European Union grew by 0.3%, while the eurozone only managed 0.2%. Germany\u2019s GDP data is due on Thursday; it\u2019s expected to show growth of just 0.1%, following a small contraction in the summer. We\u2019re also waiting for US GDP, which has been delayed by the Federal shutdown. It\u2019s likely to show growth of around 0.6% for the quarter. Several economists are blaming uncertainty about Britain\u2019s exit from the EU for the sharp slowdown in UK growth in the last quarter, to just 0.2%. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, explains: \u201cThe UK economy lost its summer exuberance in the final months of 2018, and there are signs of further chill winds ahead. \u201cThe ongoing uncertainty around what happens after 29th March is the prime suspect behind sapped economic activity. There is currently a drag on growth as some businesses are forced to hold back on major investments and engage in cautionary stockpiling. \u201cThe first half of 2019 will bring further challenges for the UK economy. China\u2019s slowdown and weak growth in Europe are likely to bite at British exporters. At the same time, while consumers have shown resilience so far, many are becoming increasingly cautious with their wallets. \u201cThe clock is ticking, but if a Brexit deal can be agreed, things should start to look sunnier as pent-up demand is released and firms begin investing again.\u201d James Smith, economist at ING, is also disappointed by the drop in business investment: It was back to reality for the UK economy during the fourth quarter, according to the latest GDP figures. Growth slowed to just 0.2%, a stark contrast to the 0.6% reading seen during the third quarter when warmer weather gave the economy a temporary reprieve. But the most alarming feature of these numbers is that fact that business investment fell for the fourth quarter in a row, as Brexit uncertainty continued to bite. This is from Morten Lund, analyst at Nordea Markets: In another blow, today\u2019s GDP report shows that UK manufacturing has now contracted for six months in a row. That means it\u2019s in recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth) for the first time since the financial crisis. The ONS says: Production fell by 0.5% in the month of December 2018, also driven by manufacturing, which contracted by 0.7%. This is the sixth consecutive monthly fall for manufacturing, which last occurred between September 2008 and February 2009. Economist Andrew Sentance blames Brexit uncertainty for the slowdown: Here\u2019s a neat summary of the key points in the GDP report, via Bloomberg: Consumer spending growth stayed at 0.4% in the fourth quarter but business investment slumped 1.4%, the most since the start of 2016. Services, the largest part of economy, slowed to 0.4% growth. In December, all the main sectors of the economy shrank, with manufacturing falling for a sixth consecutive month, the longest run of declines since the financial crisis. The fall in overall GDP was the largest since March 2016. The trade deficit narrowed to \u00a312.1bn in value terms in December. Growth in 2018 slowed to 1.4% GDP rose 1.3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the weakest since the second quarter of 2012. The annual growth figures also paint a worrying picture. The UK economy only expanded by 1.4% in 2018, the weakest performance since 2012. UK carmakers and steel producers had a particularly bad quarter, says Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS: \u201cGDP slowed in the last three months of the year with the manufacturing of cars and steel products seeing steep falls and construction also declining. However, services continued to grow with the health sector, management consultants and IT all doing well. \u201cDeclines were seen across the economy in December, but single month data can be volatile meaning quarterly figures often give a better indication of the health of the economy. \u201cThe UK\u2019s trade deficit widened slightly in the last three months of the year, while business investment again declined, now for the fourth quarter in a row.\u201d Britain\u2019s services sector provided the bulk of the growth in the final three months of 2018. Services output expanded by 0.4% in October-December, while manufacturing output shrank by 0.9% in the quarter. And in December alone, services, manufacturing and construction ALL contracted, as this chart shows: In another blow, the UK economy actually shrank in December. The Office for National Statistics reports that GDP shrank by 0.4% in the final month of 2018. That\u2019s worse than expected -- economists had predicted that the economy might have flatlined during the month. This will intensify fears that Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from Brexit anxiety, the trade war between the US and China, and weakness in the eurozone (where Italy has fallen into recession) and beyond. Newsflash: The UK economy suffered a sharp slowdown in the last quarter of 2018, only expanding by 0.2%. That\u2019s down from 0.6% in the third quarter. More to follow... There\u2019s just time for a reminder of GDP\u2019s weaknesses, with this brilliant speech by Robert Kennedy more than 50 years ago: Resolution, the thinktank, has a grim statistic -- UK households are \u00a31,500 worse off, on average, today than was expected before the 2016 EU referendum. That\u2019s because growth has slowed, while the drop in the pound drove inflation up - eating into incomes. According to Resolution, the UK having experienced the sharpest income growth slowdown of any advanced economy. James Smith, Research Director at the Resolution Foundation, says: \u201cTwo and a half years since the UK voted to leave the European Union, the country\u2019s post-Brexit position remains far from clear. There has been much discussion about the impact of this uncertainty on businesses, but not enough about its effect on household incomes. \u201cThe UK\u2019s stark under-performance on income growth since 2016 \u2013 which has tailed off more than other advanced economies \u2013 has left UK households taking a \u00a31,500 hit to their living standards. \u201cAs we approach \u2018Brexit day\u2019 on 29 March, politicians in all parties needs to recognise how much is at stake for family living standards and that how the country goes forward, not just where it is heading, matters for household incomes in the here and now.\u201d Director Torsten Bell has tweeted about the report too: The pound is coming under a little pressure this morning, dipping by a third of a cent against the US dollar to $1.291. That suggests traders expect an underwhelming GDP report this morning - weak growth lowers the chances of an early interest rate rise. Brexit worries are also pushing sterling down, after Theresa May rejected the Labour Party\u2019s suggestion that the UK joins a permanent customs union with the EU. Today\u2019s growth report is expected show that businesses reined in their spending, as they nervously watch the Brexit negotiations play out. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management suspects consumers will be less perturbed (plus, any Brexit panic stockpiling will boost GDP): The UK is doing a data dump \u2013 production, trade and GDP numbers are all due. The economy may have slowed slightly in the fourth quarter. Overall consumers are resilient in the face of political nonsense, by taking the sensible approach of not caring. Companies are, however, inclined to delay investment. We already know that growth in 2018 was choppy -- bad wintery weather got the year off to a bad start, before a blissful summer (and some sparking football results) cheered spirits. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: After the strength seen in the middle of last year the UK economy softened somewhat heading into the final quarter. A lot of the strength seen in Q2 and Q3 was a consequence of a weak Q1 as a result of the so called \u201cBeast from the East\u201d which paralysed most of the country into March. The resultant rebound was as much to do with that as a Royal Wedding, a hot summer, and a decent summer of sport culminating in a decent Football World Cup run for England. How bad could the slowdown be? Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, fears the UK economy might only have expanded by 0.2% in the last quarter... Good morning. Gross Domestic Product isn\u2019t a perfect measure. And that\u2019s no wonder -- how can a single number sum up everything, good and bad, that happens in an economy? GDP can\u2019t distinguish between activity that\u2019s actively harmful, and that which makes our lives better. It struggles to cope with the internet, isn\u2019t great at measuring improvements in services, and can\u2019t cope with unpaid work at all. But despite these flaws, GDP is the \u2018go-to\u2019 measure for policymakers who want to know how their economy is faring. And today, Britain\u2019s economy is in the spotlight. GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2018, due at 9.30am, are expected to show a sharp slowdown. Economists predict that the economy only grew by around 0.3% in October-December, just half as fast as the 0.6% recorded during the heatwave of July-September. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, predicts that the economy may not have grown in December at all. \u201cPutting the pieces together, we are forecasting GDP to have remained unchanged in December, although it is possible that we see a very small gain,\u201d he said. \u201cThis results in a 0.3% rise [for the fourth quarter]. \u201cWe will look closely at business investment \u2013 the area which we consider to be the most affected by Brexit worries \u2013 and specifically to see if it recorded its fourth consecutive quarterly decline in the fourth quarter.\u201d Here\u2019s Angela Monaghan\u2019s preview: Such muted growth would reinforce concerns that the UK, and the wider global economy, is weakening. Brexit, the US-China trade wars, and political tensions in the eurozone will all be blamed. Today\u2019s report will show how manufacturing, services and construction all fared in the last quarter. The Office for National Statistics will also report new trade figures, giving a decent picture of the health of the economy as we prepare for Brexit.

The last 12 months have seen hip-hop continue a commercial domination of music that began in 2017 when Nielsen Soundscan figures from the US suggested eight of the 10 most listened to artists in the world were rappers. But you only had to look at the Grammy awards to realise that hip-hop artists have largely given up on the prospect of seeing themselves properly represented at the ceremony: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jayz\">Jay-Z</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> didn\u2019t bother to turn up to collect their award; Childish Gambino was absent; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kendrick-lamar\">Kendrick Lamar</a> and Drake both turned down an invitation to perform. It looked suspiciously as if some of the biggest stars in the world were boycotting what\u2019s supposed to be the biggest award ceremony in its field.</p> <p>The official line from the academy itself seems to have shifted from denial \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a race problem at all,\u201d offered Portnow, when even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\">Adele</a> wondered aloud why her album had beat Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with\">Lemonade</a> for the 2017 album of the year \u2013 to a kind of admission: \u201cWe continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world,\u201d said Ken Ehrlich, show\u2019s producer, when questioned about Drake, Lamar and Childish Gambino\u2019s refusal to perform. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t take home the big prize, the regard of the academy, and what the Grammys represent, continues to be less meaningful to the hip-hop community, which is sad.\u201d</p> <p>But what they plan to do about that problem remains a mystery. The artists involved might reasonably point out that the Grammys need them far more than they need the Grammys. As hip-hop\u2019s dominance steamrollers on, no-shows by its biggest stars serve to make the event look irrelevant and out-of-touch, which was precisely the point Drake was making. </p> <p>Not that anyone at home heard it. The immediate response to his criticisms from the Grammys was to shut him up, cutting his speech short without even affording him the swelling wrap-it-up music they used to gradually drown out Dua Lipa. It was a hasty attempt to spare their own blushes, one that they\u2019ll likely live to regret.</p>",

The official line from the academy itself seems to have shifted from denial \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a race problem at all,\u201d offered Portnow, when even Adele wondered aloud why her album had beat Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade for the 2017 album of the year \u2013 to a kind of admission: \u201cWe continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world,\u201d said Ken Ehrlich, show\u2019s producer, when questioned about Drake, Lamar and Childish Gambino\u2019s refusal to perform. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t take home the big prize, the regard of the academy, and what the Grammys represent, continues to be less meaningful to the hip-hop community, which is sad.\u201d But what they plan to do about that problem remains a mystery. The artists involved might reasonably point out that the Grammys need them far more than they need the Grammys. As hip-hop\u2019s dominance steamrollers on, no-shows by its biggest stars serve to make the event look irrelevant and out-of-touch, which was precisely the point Drake was making. Not that anyone at home heard it. The immediate response to his criticisms from the Grammys was to shut him up, cutting his speech short without even affording him the swelling wrap-it-up music they used to gradually drown out Dua Lipa. It was a hasty attempt to spare their own blushes, one that they\u2019ll likely live to regret.",

This is the Parliamentary committees on arms export controls (CAEC) in action: a body responsible for scrutinising government policy and holding it to account. Their current inquiry, into UK arms export policy in 2017, covers both the technicalities of policy \u2013 different types of arms export licences and how they are reported on, for example \u2013 and larger political questions, such as what happens in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Nowhere on the agenda is the issue of arms exports to the Saudi-led coalition or the war in Yemen. The country\u2019s conflict has killed more than 57,000 people since March 2015 and created a cholera epidemic as well as leading the country to the brink of an entirely preventable famine. The Saudi-led coalition is causing twice as many civilian casualties as all other forces fighting in Yemen \u2013 including the Houthis, who are also responsible for attacks on civilians and humanitarians. All parties are committing what are likely to be war crimes \u2013 and the UK is supplying weapons to one side. How is it that committees responsible for scrutinising government actions are not talking about Yemen? Inevitably, part of the answer lies in the backstory to this parliamentary reticence.

As an avid supporter of the Saudi-led coalition, vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Saudi Arabia, MP for an arms-producing constituency and recipient of an expenses-paid trip to the UAE, Jones would do well to remember the edict that people in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones when castigating others. Despite the best efforts of pro-control MPs such as Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Stephen Twigg to get the issue of arms exports to the Saudi-led coalition on the agenda, there is a deathly inertia as Conservative MPs quietly throw their weight behind the convenience of a Labour MP more keen on arms exports than the most arch of Tories.

Given that the UK\u2019s own rules state that it won\u2019t sell weapons to countries where there is a clear risk they might be used in serious violations of international humanitarian law, the slew of evidence from Yemeni and international activists about attacks on medical facilities and schoolchildren should have led to restrictions on weapons transfers to the coalition \u2013 not least because the UK government is clear that there is no military solution to the conflict.

May\u2019s spokesman set out the timetable for the latest Brexit updates. The prime minister will make a Commons statement on Tuesday, before MPs debate an amendable motion on Thursday, allowing them to try and shape the process. The statement had been expected for Wednesday, but the spokesman said it had been moved forward to give MPs an extra day to draft amendments. There would definitely not be a meaningful vote on a revised deal this week, the spokesman added, with May committed only to putting it to MPs \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Asked if May was looking at some sort of compromise with the opposition leader, Stewart told BBC Breakfast: \u201cYes. I think she feels, as I do, that there isn\u2019t actually as much dividing us from the Labour party as some people suggest.\u201d Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Boris Johnson, a leading Brexiter, said May should focus on renegotiating the Irish backstop issue rather than join Corbyn in what he called \u201ca complete U-turn\u201d. \u201cHe now wants to frustrate Brexit very largely by staying in a permanent customs union,\u201d the former foreign secretary said. Other elements of May\u2019s letter indicated she was hopeful of at least winning over some wavering Labour MPs when her plan is next voted on in the Commons, which is unlikely to be before the end of the month or later. In her response to Corbyn, May made a concession on environmental and workers\u2019 rights, discounting his idea of automatic alignment with EU standards but suggesting instead a Commons vote every time these change. Stewart said: \u201cWhat she is saying is that we have a lot of common ground, a lot more common ground perhaps than people have acknowledged, on things like environmental protections, workers\u2019 rights, making sure that we get investment into areas of the country which haven\u2019t done as well out of the last few years as other parts of the country.\u201d If May had hinted she could accept a customs union it would have risked splitting her party. Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, indicated she would resign if this happened. She told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI absolutely do not think that should be our policy.\u201d May\u2019s letter came amid a growing presumption that while she remained officially committed to putting a revised Brexit plan to MPs as soon as possible, in practice this was unlikely to happen before the end of February, if not later. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, said on Sunday that if no finalised deal were put to the Commons by 27 February, MPs would again be given another amendable motion to consider, allowing them to block a no-deal departure or make other interventions. Later on Monday, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, will go to Brussels to meet the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, after the PM\u2019s meetings in Brussels last week. In her letter to Corbyn, May argued that her own Brexit plan \u201cexplicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union\u201d in terms of avoiding tariffs, while allowing \u201cdevelopment of the UK\u2019s independent trade policy beyond our economic partnership with the EU\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals?\u201d With the deadline fast approaching, business leaders have called for swifter action. The head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the UK was \u201cin the emergency zone of Brexit now\u201d and the confusion would not only affect jobs and investment, but harm the UK as a long-term business destination.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s return letter to Jeremy Corbyn is full of some surprisingly warm words for the Labour leader and his offer of talks to come to a Brexit compromise. But the friendly tone masks two key things: an attempt to tease out Labour divisions on free movement and to publicly expose how little space there really is between Labour\u2019s Brexit tests and May\u2019s negotiated deal, meaning May has little appetite for any more radical changes. It is also clearly aimed not just at Corbyn and his MPs but at the rebels in May\u2019s own party. The letter offers an opportunity for fresh talks between the camps \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and engages on the substance of Labour\u2019s five demands set out in a letter to May last week. Downing Street will hope that a willingness to appear open to further discussions with Labour will be a shot across the bows of some Brexiters who fear the prime minister will soften her Brexit deal to win Labour votes. What the letter does not do is accept Labour\u2019s key term for voting through a Brexit deal: a commitment to seeking a permanent customs union. May challenges Corbyn as to why he believes the Labour policy of a permanent customs union, which would involve requesting a say over future trade deals from the EU, would be better than the terms she has negotiated. The prime minister says her deal \u201cexplicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union\u201d and pointedly asks the Labour leader: \u201cI am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals?\u201d May\u2019s letter also makes an uncomfortable challenge to Labour on free movement.

Yet the most striking point about the letter overall is not the differences between the two leaders but the similarities, perhaps an uncomfortable point for critics of both May and Corbyn. On security, Corbyn\u2019s final demand, May even suggests that she and Corbyn form a united front to push Brussels for more concessions to allow UK access to some intelligence tools that the EU has been reluctant to let Britain use without the oversight of the European court of justice. In the letter, too, comes confirmation that May is seeking to legislate to ban any rollback of workers\u2019 rights \u2013 the \u201cnon-regression lock\u201d demanded by many Labour MPs and trade unions \u2013 as well as a vote in parliament on whether to accept new European standards to keep pace with Europe.

      "body": "<p>For most of the season, Jadon Sancho has befuddled all comers in the Bundesliga, catching opponents on the hop much as his Borussia Dortmund team has done. As evening drew into Nord-Rhine Westphalia on Saturday, he was left scratching his head at the end of an extraordinary afternoon, the majority of which he had spent looking as if he was walking on water.</p> \n<p>The English teenager had been outstanding, again (albeit after a few fairly quiet weeks, by his now lofty standards), and Hoffenheim hadn\u2019t got near handling him. In the first half he sizzled down both flanks, scoring the opener from an absurd angle and seeing another shot palmed out by Oliver Baumann for Mario G\u00f6tze to follow in and net a second. Perhaps the moment which best underlined his majesty was when the visitors\u2019 Kerem Demirbay snapped, cleaning him out with a sliding lunge and earning a yellow card for the privilege, after Sancho ran a series of rings around Stefan Posch.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/11/milan-krzysztof-piatek-lucas-paqueta-cagliari-milk-farmers-seriea-football\">Milan's Piatek and Paquet\u00e1 milk it after Cagliari get blocked by farmers | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By the end of the game, it felt like all that happened on a different day. Dortmund had led 3-0 with a quarter of an hour to go (and Sancho was inches from making it 4-0 with a shot that came back off the post), which would have left Bayern Munich staring down a 10-point deficit before their evening kick-off against Schalke. Instead, three Hoffenheim goals in the space of 12 minutes \u2013 including a brace from substitute Ishak Belfoldil \u2013 carved out an improbable point for the visitors.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe it,\u201d Sancho gasped at full-time. He already has a reputation among German media for being friendly and polite. He wasn\u2019t being evasive. He just couldn\u2019t find the words. It was the third time in a week that Dortmund had let a winning position slip, after last Saturday\u2019s Bundesliga draw at Eintracht Frankfurt and Tuesday\u2019s DfB Pokal match with Werder Bremen, which eventually saw BVB exit on penalties.</p> \n<p>Excuses could be made for those other two games \u2013 Eintracht are a dangerous side, and key players were rested in the Pokal - but not for this one. For the first time this season, when Bayern wheeled out their psychological brickbats about the leaders feeling the heat (such as James Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s \u201cthe pressure is all on Dortmund\u201d after his team went on to close the gap to five points), it felt like their words were more than spitting in the wind.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For the more pessimistic Dortmund sympathisers, this brought back bad memories of the first half of last season and their struggles under Peter Bosz, specifically when they had led Schalke 4-0 after 25 minutes of November 2017\u2019s Revierderby, only to concede a draw in the dying seconds.</p> \n<p>Catching Dortmund should still be a tough task for Bayern, given that only two teams have overhauled a lead of five points or greater at this point in the season \u2013 two surprise title winners in Stuttgart in 2007 and Wolfsburg in 2009. Yet this comes with caveats. Firstly, that Bayern are the chaser this time, and try saying that out loud without wavering a little. Secondly, there is the perception \u2013 almost certainly unfairly, given that Bosz\u2019s and Lucien Favre\u2019s teams are like night and day \u2013 that Dortmund might still be soft.</p> \n<p>Clearly goalscoring is not a problem. They continue to lead the way in the Bundesliga (their 54 so far is seven more than Bayern) and they created opportunities almost at will in the first half, despite the absence of the totemic Marco Reus and Paco Alc\u00e1cer\u2019s mini-drought. The Spain striker has not scored since December, and his tears after a shootout miss against Werder suggested a level of frustration.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1094284424991174657\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We're running out of words to describe Jadon Sancho \ud83d\udd25<br><br>He just had one of the best games of his career against Hoffenheim...<br><br>He's taking the mickey now \ud83d\udc80 <a href=\"https://t.co/P2GJTEc14p\">pic.twitter.com/P2GJTEc14p</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1094284424991174657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 9, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The easy conclusions, though \u2013 that Dortmund either felt they were home and dry and knocked off early, or that they panicked after Hoffenheim got a foothold in the game \u2013 are not necessarily the correct ones. Dividing the match into before and after the 3-0 doesn\u2019t make sense. After half-time Hoffenheim had already \u201cbegun to put us under serious pressure\u201d, as Julian Weigl put it, \u201c[and that] we scored a third goal was vital\u201d. If that third Dortmund goal was footballing art, with its irresistible G\u00f6tze-Sancho-G\u00f6tze-Guerreiro flow, it was also anomalous during a second period in which they were clearly second best. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s ire with his team\u2019s display saw him make a double change at the interval, hooking two of his biggest players in Demirbay and Andrej Kramari\u0107, for Belfodil and Dennis Geiger. It kick-started their afternoon.</p> \n<p>Hoffenheim are not, though, the first team to inconvenience Dortmund this season and even if this result was a bolt from the blue, the uneven performance was not. Goalkeeper Roman B\u00fcrki has been one of the team\u2019s better players and he again saved them a few times in the second half, notably with stellar stops from Joelinton at 2-0 and Pavel Kader\u00e1bek at 3-0. Their defensive issues, which have never totally gone away, led to the goals and will interest Tottenham before Wednesday\u2019s Champions League clash.</p> \n<p>With Favre suffering from bronchitis \u2013 sporting director Michael Zorc stood in for him in Thursday\u2019s press conference \u2013 assistants Edin Terzi\u0107 and Manuel Stefes took charge on the touchline, with Terzic communicating with the boss via mic and earpiece. It did feel as if a little bit of leadership to negotiate the tough spells was missing in the second half, whether Favre on the touchline, the inspirational captain Reus has become on the field, or the banned Thomas Delaney\u2019s poise in midfield. \u201cWe have a very young team who are allowed to make mistakes,\u201d reasoned Terzi\u0107.</p> \n<p>Sancho ended up making one of them, giving away a free-kick that led to the equaliser on the edge of his own box with clumsy foul on Florian Grillitsch. The question is whether this will prove to be a useful lesson, or the weekend where it began to fall apart.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Bayern were never going to let their chance to capitalise pass, especially against a Schalke team that now haven\u2019t beaten them in 18 attempts. If 18-year-old Ahmed Kutucu briefly fired Domenico Tedesco\u2019s visitors level as they remembered legendary coach Rudi Assauer, it was Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s vision that really made the difference, as he has for Niko Kova\u010d\u2019s team ever since returning to the starting line-up. They have the chance to close the gap to two points, at least for a few days, at Augsburg on Friday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c126f47ca414f07da2d0d70d539417ba96e262f0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c126f47ca414f07da2d0d70d539417ba96e262f0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bayern Munich players celebrate winning against Schalke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bayern Munich players celebrate winning against Schalke.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dalder/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 By then, Augsburg might have themselves a new coach, with Manuel Baum under further pressure after Sunday\u2019s miserable 4-0 loss at Werder Bremen, who celebrated their 120th anniversary. Baum\u2019s newly-appointed assistant, Jens Lehmann, would certainly make an interesting caretaker.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Markus Weinzierl has been confirmed in his job as Stuttgart head coach by sporting

      "bodyText": "For most of the season, Jadon Sancho has befuddled all comers in the Bundesliga, catching opponents on the hop much as his Borussia Dortmund team has done. As evening drew into Nord-Rhine Westphalia on Saturday, he was left scratching his head at the end of an extraordinary afternoon, the majority of which he had spent looking as if he was walking on water. The English teenager had been outstanding, again (albeit after a few fairly quiet weeks, by his now lofty standards), and Hoffenheim hadn\u2019t got near handling him. In the first half he sizzled down both flanks, scoring the opener from an absurd angle and seeing another shot palmed out by Oliver Baumann for Mario G\u00f6tze to follow in and net a second. Perhaps the moment which best underlined his majesty was when the visitors\u2019 Kerem Demirbay snapped, cleaning him out with a sliding lunge and earning a yellow card for the privilege, after Sancho ran a series of rings around Stefan Posch. By the end of the game, it felt like all that happened on a different day. Dortmund had led 3-0 with a quarter of an hour to go (and Sancho was inches from making it 4-0 with a shot that came back off the post), which would have left Bayern Munich staring down a 10-point deficit before their evening kick-off against Schalke. Instead, three Hoffenheim goals in the space of 12 minutes \u2013 including a brace from substitute Ishak Belfoldil \u2013 carved out an improbable point for the visitors. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe it,\u201d Sancho gasped at full-time. He already has a reputation among German media for being friendly and polite. He wasn\u2019t being evasive. He just couldn\u2019t find the words. It was the third time in a week that Dortmund had let a winning position slip, after last Saturday\u2019s Bundesliga draw at Eintracht Frankfurt and Tuesday\u2019s DfB Pokal match with Werder Bremen, which eventually saw BVB exit on penalties. Excuses could be made for those other two games \u2013 Eintracht are a dangerous side, and key players were rested in the Pokal - but not for this one. For the first time this season, when Bayern wheeled out their psychological brickbats about the leaders feeling the heat (such as James Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s \u201cthe pressure is all on Dortmund\u201d after his team went on to close the gap to five points), it felt like their words were more than spitting in the wind. For the more pessimistic Dortmund sympathisers, this brought back bad memories of the first half of last season and their struggles under Peter Bosz, specifically when they had led Schalke 4-0 after 25 minutes of November 2017\u2019s Revierderby, only to concede a draw in the dying seconds. Catching Dortmund should still be a tough task for Bayern, given that only two teams have overhauled a lead of five points or greater at this point in the season \u2013 two surprise title winners in Stuttgart in 2007 and Wolfsburg in 2009. Yet this comes with caveats. Firstly, that Bayern are the chaser this time, and try saying that out loud without wavering a little. Secondly, there is the perception \u2013 almost certainly unfairly, given that Bosz\u2019s and Lucien Favre\u2019s teams are like night and day \u2013 that Dortmund might still be soft. Clearly goalscoring is not a problem. They continue to lead the way in the Bundesliga (their 54 so far is seven more than Bayern) and they created opportunities almost at will in the first half, despite the absence of the totemic Marco Reus and Paco Alc\u00e1cer\u2019s mini-drought. The Spain striker has not scored since December, and his tears after a shootout miss against Werder suggested a level of frustration. The easy conclusions, though \u2013 that Dortmund either felt they were home and dry and knocked off early, or that they panicked after Hoffenheim got a foothold in the game \u2013 are not necessarily the correct ones. Dividing the match into before and after the 3-0 doesn\u2019t make sense. After half-time Hoffenheim had already \u201cbegun to put us under serious pressure\u201d, as Julian Weigl put it, \u201c[and that] we scored a third goal was vital\u201d. If that third Dortmund goal was footballing art, with its irresistible G\u00f6tze-Sancho-G\u00f6tze-Guerreiro flow, it was also anomalous during a second period in which they were clearly second best. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s ire with his team\u2019s display saw him make a double change at the interval, hooking two of his biggest players in Demirbay and Andrej Kramari\u0107, for Belfodil and Dennis Geiger. It kick-started their afternoon. Hoffenheim are not, though, the first team to inconvenience Dortmund this season and even if this result was a bolt from the blue, the uneven performance was not. Goalkeeper Roman B\u00fcrki has been one of the team\u2019s better players and he again saved them a few times in the second half, notably with stellar stops from Joelinton at 2-0 and Pavel Kader\u00e1bek at 3-0. Their defensive issues, which have never totally gone away, led to the goals and will interest Tottenham before Wednesday\u2019s Champions League clash. With Favre suffering from bronchitis \u2013 sporting director Michael Zorc stood in for him in Thursday\u2019s press conference \u2013 assistants Edin Terzi\u0107 and Manuel Stefes took charge on the touchline, with Terzic communicating with the boss via mic and earpiece. It did feel as if a little bit of leadership to negotiate the tough spells was missing in the second half, whether Favre on the touchline, the inspirational captain Reus has become on the field, or the banned Thomas Delaney\u2019s poise in midfield. \u201cWe have a very young team who are allowed to make mistakes,\u201d reasoned Terzi\u0107. Sancho ended up making one of them, giving away a free-kick that led to the equaliser on the edge of his own box with clumsy foul on Florian Grillitsch. The question is whether this will prove to be a useful lesson, or the weekend where it began to fall apart. Talking points \u2022 Bayern were never going to let their chance to capitalise pass, especially against a Schalke team that now haven\u2019t beaten them in 18 attempts. If 18-year-old Ahmed Kutucu briefly fired Domenico Tedesco\u2019s visitors level as they remembered legendary coach Rudi Assauer, it was Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s vision that really made the difference, as he has for Niko Kova\u010d\u2019s team ever since returning to the starting line-up. They have the chance to close the gap to two points, at least for a few days, at Augsburg on Friday. \u2022 By then, Augsburg might have themselves a new coach, with Manuel Baum under further pressure after Sunday\u2019s miserable 4-0 loss at Werder Bremen, who celebrated their 120th anniversary. Baum\u2019s newly-appointed assistant, Jens Lehmann, would certainly make an interesting caretaker. \u2022 Markus Weinzierl has been confirmed in his job as Stuttgart head coach by sporting director Michael Reschke \u2013 despite their abject defeat at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf and amid what Kicker described as \u201cintensive talks\u201d on his future.",

There is lots to unpick in the novel \u2013 the alternative family dynamic, a discussion of gun control and the legacy of hate crime \u2013 but what lingers are the scenes in which the invaders use the television news as proof of how real the apocalypse is, and how righteous their cause. As one character points out, \u201cAll they had to do was make us watch cable news where it\u2019s bad news all the time \u2026 they tell us pseudo-Christian-biblical end of times vagaries knowing that any moment they can turn on the news and in our fried and frazzled brains something will very likely stick.\u201d Could there be anything more monstrous?",

Crouching in the start hut, she gripped and regripped the handles of her poles and slapped her skis on the snow as the pips sounded to launch her down the opening chute, accelerating from a standstill to 100kph in barely 10 seconds.</p> \n<p>She was the third starter, which meant that there were 34 more to come in Sunday\u2019s world championship downhill race at \u00c5re in Sweden. The next five came through the finish without matching the American\u2019s time. Then came Ilka Stuhec, the defending champion. The Slovenian clipped just under <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">half a second off Vonn\u2019s time, and </a>that would turn out to be good enough for the win. Ten racers later, Corinne Suter of Switzerland descended fast enough to push Vonn down to third. And that was where she stayed, with a place on the podium at the end of the very last race of one of the great sporting careers.</p> \n<p>Poor conditions meant that the course had been shortened, which would once have been a source of regret. In her younger days, the power in her 5ft 10in frame would have soaked up the lactic burn inflicted by the extra 600m. Joints since worn and damaged by season after season of top-class racing would not have creaked. Only a year ago she won the last of her 43 World Cup downhill victories on the full piste at \u00c5re, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/01/lindsey-vonn-retiring-world-championships\" title=\"\">but now it was different</a>. At the age of 34 it came as a relief to hear the commissaires\u2019 decision that \u2013 in the words of Bode Miller, analysing the race for Eurosport \u2013 took the teeth out of the course.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t ski the way I want to ski any more,\u201d Vonn told her former Olympic teammate afterwards. \u201cI can\u2019t train.

It looked bad. The paramedics were quickly on the scene with a blood-wagon and it was a relief when she eventually got to her feet, clipped her boots back into her bindings and floated down the remainder of the course at recreational speed. But it meant that she started Sunday\u2019s downhill with a popped rib, a bruised shoulder and a black eye. Despite the pain, competing against women as young, hungry and supple as she once was, she finished with a bronze medal.</p> \n<p>Those injuries would be the last entry in the catalogue of breaks, strains and bruises that run alongside the list of honours topped by her gold medal on Blackcomb mountain in Whistler, British Columbia, in the 2010 Winter Olympics and four overall World Cup titles.

There are no guarantees. The competitors are often injured and weather conditions play a much bigger part. Which is why a long and prolific career like that of Vonn \u2013 and of Ingemar Stenmark, the Swedish slalom specialist whose record of 86 World Cup wins she had hoped to surpass (she finished with 82), and with whom she shared an embrace at the end of Sunday\u2019s run \u2013 is such a marvel.</p> \n<p>Twenty four hours earlier, in rather different conditions, another important career ended in \u00c5re. Thick snow was falling as Aksel Lund Svindal plunged through the murk, the final section of the downhill piste illuminated by the floodlights normally used for nocturnal slaloms. At 36, the Norwegian was also saying goodbye to a career that included two Olympic golds, two World Cup overall titles, and three dozen individual World Cup wins in downhill, super-G and giant slalom.</p> \n<p>His teammate Kjetil Jansrud had already raced, and stood at the top of the timings. Having ploughed through the loose snow lying on top of the packed piste, Svindal cut the timing beam two hundreths of a second slower than his friend and rival. \u201cIt\u2019s somehow a little romantic, battling your friend for a medal,\u201d Jansrud said. Had they started side by side, he would have won by just a quarter of the length of one of his skis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b08608130f4328968a3af7bd4269a5e108d75e0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b08608130f4328968a3af7bd4269a5e108d75e0/0_155_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norway\u2019s Aksel Lund Svindal (left) and Kjetil Jansrud show off their medals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norway\u2019s Aksel Lund Svindal (left) and Kjetil Jansrud show off their medals.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional couple of weeks,\u201d Svindal said of the buildup. \u201cI was just ready to get it over.

But making the podium demonstrated that they retained their quality to the end.</p> \n<p>He might have been speaking for both of them when he said one more thing before he left the stage for the last time: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make it a life worth living.\u201d And to know, as some do not, when to move on.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 \u2018Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "bodyText": "All she wanted, Lindsey Vonn said, was to stay out of the fence, get to the finish and see the green one more time. She got her wish. At the bottom of the hill, she saw the scoreboard. She had covered the course in a fraction over 62 seconds. And it was indeed lit up in green. \u201cI just wanted to come down and be in the lead one last time, even if it didn\u2019t last,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not to crash. That was pretty important.\u201d She was, she added, more nervous than she had ever been in her life. Crouching in the start hut, she gripped and regripped the handles of her poles and slapped her skis on the snow as the pips sounded to launch her down the opening chute, accelerating from a standstill to 100kph in barely 10 seconds. She was the third starter, which meant that there were 34 more to come in Sunday\u2019s world championship downhill race at \u00c5re in Sweden. The next five came through the finish without matching the American\u2019s time. Then came Ilka Stuhec, the defending champion. The Slovenian clipped just under half a second off Vonn\u2019s time, and that would turn out to be good enough for the win. Ten racers later, Corinne Suter of Switzerland descended fast enough to push Vonn down to third. And that was where she stayed, with a place on the podium at the end of the very last race of one of the great sporting careers. Poor conditions meant that the course had been shortened, which would once have been a source of regret. In her younger days, the power in her 5ft 10in frame would have soaked up the lactic burn inflicted by the extra 600m. Joints since worn and damaged by season after season of top-class racing would not have creaked. Only a year ago she won the last of her 43 World Cup downhill victories on the full piste at \u00c5re, but now it was different. At the age of 34 it came as a relief to hear the commissaires\u2019 decision that \u2013 in the words of Bode Miller, analysing the race for Eurosport \u2013 took the teeth out of the course. \u201cI can\u2019t ski the way I want to ski any more,\u201d Vonn told her former Olympic teammate afterwards. \u201cI can\u2019t train. My knees just won\u2019t take it. I wanted to step aside while I can still walk.\u201d Racing in the women\u2019s super-G last Tuesday, she had run straight into a gate at high speed and flown across the piste before smashing into the barriers. It looked bad. The paramedics were quickly on the scene with a blood-wagon and it was a relief when she eventually got to her feet, clipped her boots back into her bindings and floated down the remainder of the course at recreational speed. But it meant that she started Sunday\u2019s downhill with a popped rib, a bruised shoulder and a black eye. Despite the pain, competing against women as young, hungry and supple as she once was, she finished with a bronze medal. Those injuries would be the last entry in the catalogue of breaks, strains and bruises that run alongside the list of honours topped by her gold medal on Blackcomb mountain in Whistler, British Columbia, in the 2010 Winter Olympics and four overall World Cup titles. Now there will be no more of the appointments with surgeons and physiotherapists that have eaten up lengthy passages of her life since she made her World Cup debut at the age of 16, more than half her lifetime ago. Ski racing is not like Formula One. There are no guarantees. The competitors are often injured and weather conditions play a much bigger part. Which is why a long and prolific career like that of Vonn \u2013 and of Ingemar Stenmark, the Swedish slalom specialist whose record of 86 World Cup wins she had hoped to surpass (she finished with 82), and with whom she shared an embrace at the end of Sunday\u2019s run \u2013 is such a marvel. Twenty four hours earlier, in rather different conditions, another important career ended in \u00c5re. Thick snow was falling as Aksel Lund Svindal plunged through the murk, the final section of the downhill piste illuminated by the floodlights normally used for nocturnal slaloms. At 36, the Norwegian was also saying goodbye to a career that included two Olympic golds, two World Cup overall titles, and three dozen individual World Cup wins in downhill, super-G and giant slalom. His teammate Kjetil Jansrud had already raced, and stood at the top of the timings. Having ploughed through the loose snow lying on top of the packed piste, Svindal cut the timing beam two hundreths of a second slower than his friend and rival. \u201cIt\u2019s somehow a little romantic, battling your friend for a medal,\u201d Jansrud said. Had they started side by side, he would have won by just a quarter of the length of one of his skis. \u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional couple of weeks,\u201d Svindal said of the buildup. \u201cI was just ready to get it over. Hammer one last time, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Like Vonn, he did not need the win in order to bow out in glory. Both of them have all the medals they could ever need. But making the podium demonstrated that they retained their quality to the end. He might have been speaking for both of them when he said one more thing before he left the stage for the last time: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make it a life worth living.\u201d And to know, as some do not, when to move on. \u2022 \u2018Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

The government told the energy regulator, Ofgem, to set the cap because ministers argued people on SVTs were being ripped off by big energy firms capitalising on consumer loyalty. The limit is not an absolute one but the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and for a standing charge. There is a separate cap for 4m homes on prepayment meters.</p>\n    <p><b>Does that mean energy bills will never go up?</b></p>\n    <p>No. It is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/23/energy-prices-tory-cap-miliband-freeze\">a freeze</a>, it is a movable cap. The energy cap has fallen twice since it was put in place because the wholesale price of electricity and gas, the biggest variable influencing prices, have fallen. But if energy market prices climb higher, the cap would move higher, too. Homes may also face higher bills if they use more energy because the cap applies to the price of each unit of energy - not the whole bill.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Is there any way to avoid the increase?</b></p>\n    <p>Yes. Homes can save hundreds of pounds a year by spending a few minutes on one of the many comparison sites, or sign up to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/02/energy-bills-will-these-sites-save-you-a-flipping-fortune\">auto-switching service</a>, and move to a cheaper tariff, either with your existing supplier or a rival one. Fixed tariffs, which are not covered by the cap, are almost always much cheaper than SVTs, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/22/third-dual-fuel-tariffs-break-government-price-cap\">there are exceptions</a>, so watch out. Several smaller suppliers also offer good customer service and variable tariffs that are well below the cap.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Could bills fall again?</b></p>\n    <p>Maybe. Energy market experts believe gas and electricity wholesale prices will remain low through 2020 because energy demand is lower than normal because of the Covid-19 crisis. But wholesale costs are not the only factor in setting the level of the cap. Ofgem, the regulator, includes the cost of using energy networks and paying for government policies, too. These costs are expected to keep rising.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOfgem\u2019s energy market price cap review set out that price cap levels would increase, driven by rising wholesale and other costs,\u201d an E.ON spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>The big six, which control three-quarters of the UK energy market, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/14/sse-bulb-energy-firms-low-prices-uk\">priced on average</a> \u00a34 below the initial cap of \u00a31,137, which started on 1 January.</p> \n<p>The expectation is that the other five companies will follow E.ON\u2019s lead.

      "bodyText": "Gavin Williamson\u2019s boast that Brexit could \u201cenhance the UK\u2019s lethality\u201d is the latest in a string of naive forays by the 42-year-old defence secretary. He may have intended it as a boost to Britain\u2019s global military standing but it is more likely to just confirm Williamson\u2019s reputation as the cabinet\u2019s Private Pike, the hapless youth in the sitcom Dad\u2019s Army. In his first 15 months in the job Williamson\u2019s antics have regularly invited the Captain Mainwaring response of \u201cStupid boy!\u201d In March, in the wake of the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, Williamson had a message for the chief suspects. \u201cFrankly, Russia should go away and should shut up,\u201d he said in remarks that were widely ridiculed in both Russia and the UK. Challenged by ITV about those comments, Williamson compounded the error by repeatedly refusing to answers questions about his informal use of language. Williamson stonewalled so blatantly that presenter Richard Madeley terminated the interview. In July, Williamson earned the dubious distinction of becoming the first minister to be heckled by his own phone at the dispatch box in the House of Commons. Discussing Syria appeared to prompt the Siri service on his iPhone. It chirped up with this interruption: \u201cI\u2019ve found something on the web for Syria\u2026\u201d Struggling with new technology has been something of a theme of Williamson\u2019s gaffe-prone time in office. His use of the photo-sharing site Instagram landed him in more trouble. In November Williamson was ticked off by the parliamentary authorities for breaching rules about photography in the Commons when he posted a picture of his boss Theresa May making a statement to MPs about Brexit. And the content of his prosaic Instagram posts, featuring dreary constituency shots, animals and even a tribute to the value of his new garden incinerator, have also been widely mocked. Beside an underwhelming picture of his 1981 Land Rover Defender, Williamson wrote that it epitomises everything that is so fantastic about #greatbritain. He had apparently forgotten that Land Rover has been owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors for more than a decade. Last summer, senior figures in the defence department were reported to be exasperated by some of Williamson\u2019s eccentric suggestions for stretching the defence budget.

Opinion To conservatives, socialism means getting something for doing nothing, which, says Robert Reich, pretty much describes the $21bn saved by the banks thanks to Republican tax cuts. Trump is offering socialism for the rich, and harsh capitalism for everyone else. Trump perfected the art of using bankruptcy to shield himself from the consequences of bad decisions \u2013 socialism for the rich at its worst. Now, all over America, executives who run their companies into the ground are getting gold-plated exit packages while their workers get pink slips. Sport Anthony Martial scored a terrific solo goal during Manchester United\u2019s 3-0 win at Fulham on Saturday, further proof of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s poor judgment at the club, where the young French forward barely got a look-in under Mourinho\u2019s regime. That\u2019s one of 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s Premier League action. The Alliance of American Football (AAF) has had an entertaining start to the NFL\u2019s off-season. But America\u2019s sporting landscape is strewn with the wreckage of failed football leagues, so will the AAF be any different, asks Tom Dart.

      "bodyText": "The British economy plunged into reverse in December, with a broad-based slump in economic output completing the weakest year for growth since 2012. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product contracted by 0.4% from the previous month, fuelled by a fall in spending on the high street over the key festive shopping period. With less than 50 days to go before Brexit, the figures showed all three drivers of growth in the British economy \u2013 services, production and construction \u2013 shrank during December. The decline in monthly output helped drag down quarter-on-quarter growth to a rate of 0.2% in the three months to the end of the year, slightly below the Bank of England\u2019s expectations and down from a rate of 0.6% in the third quarter. Economists tend to focus on the three-month figures, as monthly GDP snapshots can be prone to revision, but the scale of the decline in December is likely to be seen as a sign of the economy losing momentum as Brexit draws nearer. For 2018 as a whole, GDP growth slipped to its lowest since 2012, at 1.4%, down from 1.8% in 2017. Despite the broad-based slowdown, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said the latest figures showed that Britain\u2019s economy remained fundamentally strong. \u201cThe UK is currently enjoying the longest unbroken quarterly growth streak of any G7 nation,\u201d he said. However, the latest monthly figures revealed that manufacturing output tumbled into recession territory with the sixth consecutive month of falling output. This marked the longest negative run since September 2008 to February 2009, the depths of the financial crisis. Labour and the trade unions called on the government to take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table in order to instil more confidence in the manufacturing sector. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s failure to rule out a no-deal Brexit is harming confidence in the economy and holding back growth. \u201cWith our manufacturing sector in recession, the prime minister must act now to remove the threat of crashing out.\u201d Manufacturing of cars and steel products dropped. Exports suffered from weak global demand, while domestic activity was constrained by the political impasse over Brexit in Westminster. Britain has not been immune from faltering growth in the world economy over recent months, amid a slowdown in demand in China and as trade tensions escalate between Washington and Beijing. Growth in the eurozone has slumped, with Italy falling into a recession in the second half of last year while Germany also teeters on the brink. Car sales in China fell for the first time in almost 30 years, while new vehicle emissions tests introduced in the wake of the VW emissions scandal have disrupted factory output across Europe. The ONS data showed that net trade cut more than 0.1 percentage points from the UK\u2019s fourth-quarter growth, while the trade deficit \u2013 the gap between exports and imports \u2013 widened slightly in the final three months of the year. Despite the wider global slump, Britain however faces unique challenges from Brexit that are escalating just as the world economy falters. The latest ONS figures revealed that business investment fell for the fourth quarter in a row \u2013 in a first since the last recession in 2009 \u2013 as the lack of clarity over Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU led companies to pause their investment plans. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at the accountancy firm KPMG, said: \u201cIt is particularly worrying to see business investment contracting significantly again, as it will impact the UK\u2019s longer-term productive capacity as well as productivity performance, and points at a low vote of confidence from business in the UK\u2019s future.\u201d",

The chief executive, the director of football and several players had been gathered with a view to placing Guardiola at their centre. Chelsea had not even got round to sacking Antonio Conte when they gave Sarri the job of replacing him.</p> \n<p>But the biggest issue is that Guardiola never suffered a humiliation like this. There were occasional tactical problems, usually centred on playing too high a defensive line without the requisite level of pressing, but it was possible to see a solution. There was never such a meltdown, never such a series of limp, confused displays as Chelsea have produced away from home this year.</p> \n<p>Most troubling of all is the way that Jorginho, the one player who was signed to facilitate the transition to Sarri-ball, has become the biggest problem. Perhaps with other players around him he would be more effective as a <em>regista</em>. Perhaps, with more creativity elsewhere on the pitch, it would be less straightforward to shut him down. But there are basic defensive issues resulting directly from Jorginho\u2019s presence: the second, third and fourth goals on Sunday stemmed from a void at the top of the box, something highlighted by arguably the best defensive midfielder in the league over the past three seasons, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9,being on the pitch but not playing as a defensive midfielder.</p> \n<p>The doubtful experiment seems increasingly doomed.</p>",

Pep Guardiola spoke in defence of somebody he regards as a friend, talking of the difficulty of imposing a philosophy and of how he struggled in his first season. But the situation is not directly comparable. For one thing Guardiola arrived at City having already won six league titles and two Champions Leagues. He was a proven champion; Sarri has never won anything. There are reasons for that, given how he has had to fight his way up from the amateur leagues, but he nonetheless represents rather more of a risk. Each defeat generates far greater doubts than Guardiola\u2019s setbacks against Leicester and Everton in his first season at City did. For another, Guardiola came into a club that had been built for him. The chief executive, the director of football and several players had been gathered with a view to placing Guardiola at their centre. Chelsea had not even got round to sacking Antonio Conte when they gave Sarri the job of replacing him. But the biggest issue is that Guardiola never suffered a humiliation like this. There were occasional tactical problems, usually centred on playing too high a defensive line without the requisite level of pressing, but it was possible to see a solution. There was never such a meltdown, never such a series of limp, confused displays as Chelsea have produced away from home this year. Most troubling of all is the way that Jorginho, the one player who was signed to facilitate the transition to Sarri-ball, has become the biggest problem. Perhaps with other players around him he would be more effective as a regista. Perhaps, with more creativity elsewhere on the pitch, it would be less straightforward to shut him down. But there are basic defensive issues resulting directly from Jorginho\u2019s presence: the second, third and fourth goals on Sunday stemmed from a void at the top of the box, something highlighted by arguably the best defensive midfielder in the league over the past three seasons, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9,being on the pitch but not playing as a defensive midfielder. The doubtful experiment seems increasingly doomed.",

That enabled them to contact Irish trainers who had runners at Ayr that day, where McCain also had runners; those Irish horses were stopped from returning to their own stables and have since been kept in isolation.</p> <p>\u201cWe were able to act quickly in response to that information,\u201d Hillyer said. \u201cThe BHA didn\u2019t have that luxury. The horses had gone home. So it really is apples and pears.\u201d</p> <p>Racing has continued in Ireland, at Naas on Saturday and at Punchestown on Sunday, with increased biosecurity measures at each racecourse and a message to all trainers that they should be giving their charges a flu vaccination booster. Hillyer said her risk assessment of the situation could change, \u201cif we had evidence that we had increased numbers of cases very rapidly, or if we had horses that were very sick despite having been vaccinated recently\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a83ca45ee429206b670c83c27a6f93143565ac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a83ca45ee429206b670c83c27a6f93143565ac3/0_0_3414_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Runners and riders at Punchestown on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runners and riders at Punchestown on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, she insisted that the trainers so far affected could not be named. \u201cAbsolutely not. I want to encourage the trainers here to deal with matters in the same way these two yards I know of did. I liaised with their vets and have complete confidence in their vets.</p> <p>\u201cI really, really would like Irish trainers to understand that reporting and diagnosis is critical. If they have something that they think could be flu, looks like flu, might be flu, please treat it like flu. The key thing is to deal with it, take it seriously and then we can all get rid of it and move on.\u201d</p> <p>Anonymous testing is conducted by the Irish Equine Centre near Naas. In contrast to the situation in Britain, Irish racing has no rule requiring trainers to notify the regulator of any EI cases, though this is likely to come under review. The IHRB issued a new rule on Friday, that all runners must have had a flu vaccine within the previous eight weeks in order to be allowed to race.</p> <p>British-based runners are not presently allowed to compete in Ireland, as a result of the EI outbreak which has so far put 174 British stables on lockdown. However, Hillyer said that could change if the BHA\u2019s own assessment of the situation changed.</p> <p>The BHA is due to make an announcement on Monday night as to whether the sport can resume from Wednesday.</p>",

That enabled them to contact Irish trainers who had runners at Ayr that day, where McCain also had runners; those Irish horses were stopped from returning to their own stables and have since been kept in isolation. \u201cWe were able to act quickly in response to that information,\u201d Hillyer said. \u201cThe BHA didn\u2019t have that luxury. The horses had gone home. So it really is apples and pears.\u201d Racing has continued in Ireland, at Naas on Saturday and at Punchestown on Sunday, with increased biosecurity measures at each racecourse and a message to all trainers that they should be giving their charges a flu vaccination booster. Hillyer said her risk assessment of the situation could change, \u201cif we had evidence that we had increased numbers of cases very rapidly, or if we had horses that were very sick despite having been vaccinated recently\u201d. However, she insisted that the trainers so far affected could not be named. \u201cAbsolutely not. I want to encourage the trainers here to deal with matters in the same way these two yards I know of did. I liaised with their vets and have complete confidence in their vets. \u201cI really, really would like Irish trainers to understand that reporting and diagnosis is critical. If they have something that they think could be flu, looks like flu, might be flu, please treat it like flu. The key thing is to deal with it, take it seriously and then we can all get rid of it and move on.\u201d Anonymous testing is conducted by the Irish Equine Centre near Naas. In contrast to the situation in Britain, Irish racing has no rule requiring trainers to notify the regulator of any EI cases, though this is likely to come under review. The IHRB issued a new rule on Friday, that all runners must have had a flu vaccine within the previous eight weeks in order to be allowed to race. British-based runners are not presently allowed to compete in Ireland, as a result of the EI outbreak which has so far put 174 British stables on lockdown. However, Hillyer said that could change if the BHA\u2019s own assessment of the situation changed. The BHA is due to make an announcement on Monday night as to whether the sport can resume from Wednesday.",

It took a turn towards atypical shortly afterwards, as players lined up in the street to kick over milk churns and spill their contents into the road. This was not on the schedule. After speaking to the press, Maran was supposed to board the team bus with his players and head to the airport for a flight to Milan \u2013 where they would play the following evening. Instead, Cagliari found themselves blocked in by a group of disgruntled dairy producers, who had come to ask them to join in a solidarity strike.

By full-time, images of Piatek leaping on Paquet\u00e1\u2019s shoulders were being contrasted online with old ones of Andriy Shevchenko and Kak\u00e1. The moment captured on Sunday was actually one of mixed emotions. As he celebrated his first goal for the club, Paquet\u00e1 was raising an arm in memory of the 10 teenage footballers who died during a fire in a dormitory at Flamengo\u2019s training centre last week. \u201cFor me this is a very difficult moment,\u201d said Paquet\u00e1. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream to be playing for Milan and a dream to score but I lived for 10 years in that boarding house. It was my home.\u201d The happy memories he is making in a new home cannot erase the pain for the one left behind.",

The move came after officials in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, with a population of about 3,000 people, appealed for help. \u201cThere\u2019s never been such a mass invasion of polar bears,\u201d said Zhigansha Musin, the head of the local administration. \u201cThey have literally been chasing people.\u201d Alexander Minayev, the region\u2019s deputy head, added: \u201cPeople are scared, and afraid to leave their homes. Parents are unwilling to let their children go to school or nursery.\u201d A state of emergency has been declared in the region.

In <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/on-the-come-up.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">On the Come Up</a></strong> (Walker) 16-year-old Brianna longs to become a famous rapper but finds herself stymied by poverty, a troubled reputation at school and, after her song goes viral, media prejudice about who she really is. There is no second-book syndrome here. Unflinching, honest and brimming with humanity, Thomas writes with confidence and conviction about kids seldom seen in literature. In a book that is all about finding your voice and the power of words, Bri\u2019s frustrated, angry lyrics are pure magic.</p> <p>Another author following a feted debut is Muhammad Khan, whose excellent <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/i-am-thunder.html\" title=\"\">I Am Thunder</a></em> introduced him as an exhilarating new talent. <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/kick-the-moon-9781509874071.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Kick the Moon</a></strong><em> </em>(Macmillan) sees Ilyas Mian navigate the pressures of contemporary teenage life, from family and religion to toxic masculinity, racism and revenge porn. Gritty stuff, certainly, thick with moral dilemmas, but Khan\u2019s empathy and wry humour, accentuated by a deft use of slang, make this authentic and relatable.</p> <p>For younger teenagers, Holly Smale, author of the hugely popular <em>Geek Girl</em> series, is back with <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/valentines-happy-girl-lucky.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Valentines: Happy Girl Lucky</a></strong> (HarperCollins). The youngest of three Valentine sisters, Hope may be born into a famous dynasty of movie stars, but her life is something of a gilded cage. The title and jacket design may suggest a bubblegum beach read, but while Smale\u2019s warmth and comedy are very much in evidence, so are her smarts, as she casts a wise eye over modern culture and the pursuit of perfection, delivered with an uplifting feminist message.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bates is brilliant and brutal on misogyny, slut-shaming and female sexuality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Feminism is the driving force behind <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/burning-9781471170201.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Burning</a></strong> (Simon &amp; Schuster), the debut YA novel from Everyday Sexism founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-bates\" title=\"\">Laura Bates</a>. In modern-day Scotland, 15-year-old Anna uncovers devastating parallels between her own trial by social media and the experiences of a girl accused of witchcraft centuries earlier. Bates is brilliant and brutal on misogyny, slut-shaming and female sexuality. Essential reading for fans of Holly Bourne and Louise O\u2019Neill.</p> <p>The perceived glamour of US high-school life remains an irresistible lure to UK teenagers, and in her second crime novel, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/two-can-keep-a-secret-9780141375656.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Two Can Keep a Secret</a></strong> (Penguin), American author Karen McManus combines small-town intrigue with the current trend for twisty thrillers and unreliable narrators.

      "bodyText": "The Hate U Give made a YA superstar of Angie Thomas, but just how do you follow a bestselling debut that has already been made into a movie? In On the Come Up (Walker) 16-year-old Brianna longs to become a famous rapper but finds herself stymied by poverty, a troubled reputation at school and, after her song goes viral, media prejudice about who she really is. There is no second-book syndrome here. Unflinching, honest and brimming with humanity, Thomas writes with confidence and conviction about kids seldom seen in literature. In a book that is all about finding your voice and the power of words, Bri\u2019s frustrated, angry lyrics are pure magic. Another author following a feted debut is Muhammad Khan, whose excellent I Am Thunder introduced him as an exhilarating new talent. Kick the Moon (Macmillan) sees Ilyas Mian navigate the pressures of contemporary teenage life, from family and religion to toxic masculinity, racism and revenge porn. Gritty stuff, certainly, thick with moral dilemmas, but Khan\u2019s empathy and wry humour, accentuated by a deft use of slang, make this authentic and relatable. For younger teenagers, Holly Smale, author of the hugely popular Geek Girl series, is back with The Valentines: Happy Girl Lucky (HarperCollins). The youngest of three Valentine sisters, Hope may be born into a famous dynasty of movie stars, but her life is something of a gilded cage. The title and jacket design may suggest a bubblegum beach read, but while Smale\u2019s warmth and comedy are very much in evidence, so are her smarts, as she casts a wise eye over modern culture and the pursuit of perfection, delivered with an uplifting feminist message. Feminism is the driving force behind The Burning (Simon &amp; Schuster), the debut YA novel from Everyday Sexism founder Laura Bates. In modern-day Scotland, 15-year-old Anna uncovers devastating parallels between her own trial by social media and the experiences of a girl accused of witchcraft centuries earlier. Bates is brilliant and brutal on misogyny, slut-shaming and female sexuality. Essential reading for fans of Holly Bourne and Louise O\u2019Neill. The perceived glamour of US high-school life remains an irresistible lure to UK teenagers, and in her second crime novel, Two Can Keep a Secret (Penguin), American author Karen McManus combines small-town intrigue with the current trend for twisty thrillers and unreliable narrators. In a tale of unsolved murders and missing homecoming queens there are familiar tropes aplenty, but consummate plotting and complex relationships keep things fresh and unpredictable. Finally, Anthony McGowan\u2019s story of brothers Nicky and Kenny, which began in Brock, reaches a heart-rending but perfectly pitched conclusion in Lark (Barrington Stoke), when a trek across snowy moors turns deadly. Barrington Stoke specialises in accessible short novels, but this in no way compromises the quality or power of McGowan\u2019s words.

Surrounded by staff, she answered the phone: \u201c<em>Ah, bonjour!</em>\u201d</p> <p>First, she excitedly relayed the news that Bar Crenn, her 1930s Paris-inspired wine bar, had earned its first Michelin star. Then, her composure erupted into what can only be described as ecstasy. Jumping around sandwiched by staff members, she whooped and screamed.</p> <p>Her only audible words: \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p> <p>Her restaurant Atelier Crenn had been awarded not one, not two, but three Michelin stars.</p> <p>It was the first time a woman in America had ever been awarded the top classification by the prestigious French restaurant guide (she was also the first female in the US to get two stars in 2012). Not only did it confirm her status as one of the world\u2019s top chefs, but it also marked the smashing of America\u2019s boys\u2019 club cooking elite.</p> <p>Chef Nancy Silverton says Crenn\u2019s achievement broke the glass ceiling for everyone. \u201cIt means there are no limits, no roofs, no barriers. Dominique took a sledgehammer to the walls,\u201d she tells me. Eric Ripert, executive chef of three-star New York restaurant Le Bernardin, describes Crenn as a \u201cpioneer\u201d and a rule-breaker. \u201cIt\u2019s not many women worldwide who have that achievement,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a big deal for the US. It\u2019s not too many three-star Michelin in America to begin with.\u201d (There are 15 in total.)</p> <p>Today Crenn, 54, sat in her favourite corner of Bar Crenn, surrounded by sheepskin-style throws, tactile upholstery and stylishly scuffed up furniture. She is wearing a tweed flatcap and clutching a reusable coffee cup. It\u2019s a January weekday morning on a bright, sunny day in Cow Hollow, San Francisco, and behind the scenes, neighbouring Atelier Crenn is in full swing preparing for this evening\u2019s two sittings. In the kitchens, there\u2019s a huge stock pot on the go and freshly made breads cool on racks. There\u2019s a sense of buoyancy and focus and a distinct lack of shouting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"34febed5712d4de0a9ba6acbfa96f41b98b67f3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34febed5712d4de0a9ba6acbfa96f41b98b67f3c/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"The Geoduck Sea Urchin &amp; Stone Fruit served at Atelier Crenn, run by Dominique Crenn since 2011.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Geoduck Sea Urchin &amp; Stone Fruit served at Atelier Crenn, run by Dominique Crenn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Avila Gonzalez/San Francisco Chronicle/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She opened Atelier Crenn, her first restaurant, eight years ago. The grand tasting menu, which centres around seafood and costs a considerable $335 per person (not including wine pairing), is written as a poem.</p> <p>The signature dish is Brittany speciality the Kir Breton, but Crenn\u2019s take on it is a cider-filled white chocolate sphere finished with a little turret of cr\u00e8me de cassis. Her brioche comes as a glossy voluminous loaf with a slab of homemade butter decorated with flowers. The coconut mousse, herb sorbet and candied pineapple comes in an entirely edible dish and the caviar sparkles like tiny precious stones on beautiful ornate dishes.</p> <p>Crenn often appears in the eight-table dining room to chat with guests \u2013 much to the delight of giddy Yelp reviewers. But do not be mistaken, this is not a customer satisfaction survey. She never asks if they like the food. Rather, it\u2019s about creating a dialogue. \u201cI discover a little bit more of the world also through their voice and their eyes which is very interesting to me. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p>The restaurant walls are decorated with her father Allain\u2019s paintings \u2013 scenes from Brittany, where Crenn spent much of her childhood \u2013 and the poem that she wrote the day he died. The honesty emanating from the beautifully assembled room is striking; Crenn compares it to opening a drawer where \u201ceverything has a purpose\u201d.</p> <p>She shares more in this room than many people do to their closest friends and family. Does it ever make her feel vulnerable?</p> <p>\u201cWell I mean, yes, it is vulnerable. But I think one of the greatest traits of a human is being vulnerable because \u2026\u201d She starts again. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s a weakness, I think it\u2019s a strength because it allows you have authenticity, it allows you to tell people who you are. There\u2019s no lie, there is no hiding behind something. I\u2019m not in politics here. What you see is what you get,\u201d she says, unravelling the patterned scarf from around her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s nice. It allows you to grow as a person, which is great.\u201d</p> <p>But she has also had to be strong. Female chefs often have to work even harder than men to succeed in an industry already notorious for its relentless work ethic and unforgiving hours. Crenn was named \u201cbest female chef\u201d by World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants in 2016 (although she later criticised it for being gender specific, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s stupid. A chef is a chef\u201d) and last year the James Beard Foundation named Crenn \u201cbest chef: west\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier in her career, she came across a lot of men who believed they needed to act tough. But she fought this mentality by not caring what other people thought of her. \u201c\u2018If you\u2019re a woman, you should shut up and just cook.\u2019 I\u2019m like, seriously? You\u2019re telling me that? Guess what. I\u2019m going to keep speaking then.\u201d</p> <p>Women, she says, in many places are still being paid less than their male counterparts. She believes the problem goes back to education and that all children should be taught the same, regardless of gender. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a country run by men only. We\u2019re not going to be able to change things if that happens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b67eb1f39e0f8eda01838efe43bdcd9ffaf19992\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b67eb1f39e0f8eda01838efe43bdcd9ffaf19992/0_25_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The English Pea &amp; Mint being prepared at Atelier Crenn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The English Pea &amp; Mint being prepared at Atelier Crenn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Avila Gonzalez/San Francisco Chronicle/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The restaurant business has undergone a #MeToo reckoning with a number of high-profile chefs being accused of sexual harassment and abuse. Earlier in her career, Crenn was harassed by a colleague. When she reported it, she was told to either put up with it or leave. \u201cIt\u2019s almost in a way like I was a burden for them being a woman in the kitchen,\u201d she says. She decided to leave.</p> <p>In her own company she has a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach to sexual abuse and harassment, and encourages staff to come straight to her with any issue so it can be investigated. The policy seems to be working. Today her company has more women working for it than men. The staff force at Petit Crenn (her other, slightly cheaper, restaurant) is 80% female. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s the best kitchen.\u201d The gender divide at Atelier Crenn is 50/50.</p> <p>As a young chef she was often expected to do additional work for nothing to get ahead, but in her company she pays staff for all of their work. She also does not like tips. Guests are not banned from tipping, but she says she pays staff wages they can live on. </p> <p>Crenn did not formally study cooking, but her passion for food started at a very young age. Her parents, who adopted Crenn at 18 months, instilled her with a strong interest in food. Her mother Louise, who is still based in Brittany, taught her how to cook, she loved to help out on her uncle\u2019s farm and she accompanied her father (who was a politician and a painter) to Michelin-starred restaurants from a young age. \u201cThat was like going to a symphony,\u201d she says with a smile.</p> <p>Being adopted has had a positive impact on her approach to life, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to be open about the world and that you could be from anywhere.\u201d She recently retested her DNA and found she has roots around the world including in France, Germany, Italy, South Asia, North Africa and Finland. \u201cI\u2019m very nomadic and I think that comes from that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>After arriving in San Francisco with no formal training, she got a job at then renowned restaurant Stars, launching her career. She later worked at Intercontinental Hotel in Jakarta, where she was Indonesia\u2019s first female executive chef, Manhattan Country Club in Los Angeles and Luce in San Francisco.</p> <p>Her self-confidence, verbally at least, is unusual. It has the unbreakable assurance of a self-help book. \u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid about anything. I just knew that if I do things and I express myself, people hopefully will notice,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought that I would not succeed.\u201d</p> <p>While she loves France, and still votes there, it was in America that she found her voice through cooking. Has the election of Donald Trump changed her relationship with the country? \u201cOh, I love America. Americans are amazing. It\u2019s just the people that are getting into power are being very selfish and don\u2019t remember what they come from.\u201d Trump, she says, is a \u201cfollower\u201d.</p> <p>She has no time for anti-immigrant rhetoric and border walls \u2013 including in her dining room, asking guests to leave if they are disrespectful to staff, which has happened a couple of times. \u201cPeople have become very entitled. And because they think they come to a restaurant it\u2019s a place of service so we are \u2018at your service\u2019? No. You come here,\u201d she says, slowly, instructively, \u201cwe will serve you, but we are equal. It\u2019s like don\u2019t treat us like servants.\u201d</p> <p>There is still significant work left to do to tackle racial and gender equality, she says. \u201cDiversity is going to bring us to a better world. Right now we are in a place where we\u2019re suppressing diversity. We\u2019re allowing a certain race to be superior than the other. For me, this is not what America is about.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her three-star Michelin approval, you get the sense that Crenn is continually evolving, self-improving. As well as a memoir, due for release this year, and an ongoing documentary, Crenn (who also owns a farm in Sonoma county) is also opening a patisserie-cum-boulangerie in San Francisco that will be plastic-free and dairy-free.</p> <p>\u201cFood is politics,\u201d she says. Is that why she considers herself an activist? \u201cYes, of course,\u201d she answers immediately. \u201cWe have to continue the legacy of humanity. I want humans to evolve, I need to be a part of it, I need to give back, you know?\u201d</p>",

Being adopted has had a positive impact on her approach to life, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to be open about the world and that you could be from anywhere.\u201d She recently retested her DNA and found she has roots around the world including in France, Germany, Italy, South Asia, North Africa and Finland. \u201cI\u2019m very nomadic and I think that comes from that,\u201d she says. After arriving in San Francisco with no formal training, she got a job at then renowned restaurant Stars, launching her career. She later worked at Intercontinental Hotel in Jakarta, where she was Indonesia\u2019s first female executive chef, Manhattan Country Club in Los Angeles and Luce in San Francisco. Her self-confidence, verbally at least, is unusual. It has the unbreakable assurance of a self-help book. \u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid about anything. I just knew that if I do things and I express myself, people hopefully will notice,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought that I would not succeed.\u201d While she loves France, and still votes there, it was in America that she found her voice through cooking. Has the election of Donald Trump changed her relationship with the country? \u201cOh, I love America. Americans are amazing. It\u2019s just the people that are getting into power are being very selfish and don\u2019t remember what they come from.\u201d Trump, she says, is a \u201cfollower\u201d. She has no time for anti-immigrant rhetoric and border walls \u2013 including in her dining room, asking guests to leave if they are disrespectful to staff, which has happened a couple of times. \u201cPeople have become very entitled. And because they think they come to a restaurant it\u2019s a place of service so we are \u2018at your service\u2019? No. You come here,\u201d she says, slowly, instructively, \u201cwe will serve you, but we are equal. It\u2019s like don\u2019t treat us like servants.\u201d There is still significant work left to do to tackle racial and gender equality, she says. \u201cDiversity is going to bring us to a better world. Right now we are in a place where we\u2019re suppressing diversity. We\u2019re allowing a certain race to be superior than the other. For me, this is not what America is about.\u201d Despite her three-star Michelin approval, you get the sense that Crenn is continually evolving, self-improving. As well as a memoir, due for release this year, and an ongoing documentary, Crenn (who also owns a farm in Sonoma county) is also opening a patisserie-cum-boulangerie in San Francisco that will be plastic-free and dairy-free. \u201cFood is politics,\u201d she says. Is that why she considers herself an activist? \u201cYes, of course,\u201d she answers immediately. \u201cWe have to continue the legacy of humanity. I want humans to evolve, I need to be a part of it, I need to give back, you know?\u201d",

But it is socialism for the rich. Everyone else is treated to harsh capitalism.</p> <p>In the conservative mind, socialism means getting something for doing nothing. That pretty much describes the $21bn saved by the nation\u2019s largest banks last year thanks to Trump\u2019s tax cuts, some of which went into massive bonuses for bank executives. On the other hand, more than 4,000 lower-level bank employees got a big dose of harsh capitalism. They lost their jobs.</p> <p>Banks that are too big to fail \u2013 courtesy of the 2008 bank bailout \u2013 enjoy a hidden subsidy of some $83bn a year, because creditors facing less risk accept lower interest on deposits and loans. Last year, Wall Street\u2019s bonus pool was $31.4bn. Take away the hidden subsidy and the bonus pool disappears.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Under socialism for the rich, you can screw up big time and still reap big rewards</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump and his appointees at the Federal Reserve are easing bank requirements put in place after the bailout. They\u2019ll make sure the biggest banks remain too big to fail.</p> <p>Trump is promoting socialism for the rich and harsh capitalism for everyone else in other ways. GM has got more than $600m in federal contracts, plus $500m in tax breaks. Some of this has gone into the pockets of GM executives. Chairman and CEO Mary Barra raked in almost $22m in total compensation in 2017 alone.</p> <p>But GM employees are subject to harsh capitalism. GM is planning to lay off more than 14,000 workers and close three assembly plants and two component factories in North America by the end of 2019.</p> <p>When he was in business, Trump perfected the art of using bankruptcy to shield himself from the consequences of bad decisions \u2013 socialism for the rich at its worst \u2013 while leaving employees twisting in the wind.</p> <p>Now, all over America, executives who run their companies into the ground are getting gold-plated exit packages while their workers get pink slips.</p> <p>Sears is doling out $25m to the executives who stripped its remaining assets and drove it into bankruptcy, but has no money for the thousands of workers it laid off.</p> <p>As Pacific Gas and Electric hurtles toward bankruptcy, the person who was in charge when the deadly infernos roared through northern California last year (caused in part by PG&amp;E\u2019s faulty equipment) has departed with a cash severance package of $2.5m. The PG&amp;E executive in charge of gas operations when records were allegedly falsified left in 2017 with $6.9m.</p> <p>Under socialism for the rich, you can screw up big time and still reap big rewards. Equifax\u2019s Richard Smith retired in 2017 with an $18m pension in the wake of a security breach that exposed the personal information of 145 million consumers to hackers.</p> <p>Wells Fargo\u2019s Carrie Tolstedt departed with a $125m exit package after being in charge of the unit that opened more than 2 million unauthorized customer accounts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most Americans are subject to an increasingly harsh and arbitrary capitalism in which they\u2019re working harder but getting nowhere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Around 60% of America\u2019s wealth is now inherited. Many of today\u2019s super-rich have never done a day\u2019s work in their lives.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s response has been to cut the estate tax to apply only to estates valued at over $22m per couple. Mitch McConnell is now proposing that the estate tax be repealed altogether.</p> <p>What about the capitalist principles that people earn what they\u2019re worth in the market, and that economic gains should go to those who deserve them?</p> <p>America is on the cusp of the largest inter-generational wealth transfer in history. As rich boomers expire over the next three decades, an estimated $30tn will go to their children.</p> <p>Those children will be able to live off of the income these assets generate, and then leave the bulk of them to their own heirs, tax-free. (Capital gains taxes don\u2019t apply to the soaring values of stocks, bonds, mansions and other assets of wealthy people who die before they\u2019re sold.)</p> <p>After a few generations of this, almost all of the nation\u2019s wealth will be in the hands of a few thousand non-working families. To the conservative mind, the specter of socialism conjures up a society in which no one is held accountable, and no one has to work for what they receive. Yet that\u2019s exactly the society Trump and the Republicans are promoting for the rich.</p> <p>Meanwhile, most Americans are subject to an increasingly harsh and arbitrary capitalism in which they\u2019re working harder but getting nowhere, and have less security than ever.</p> <p>They need thicker safety nets and deserve a bigger piece of the economic pie.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country,\u201d Donald Trump declared in his State of the Union address. Someone should alert Trump that America is now a hotbed of socialism. But it is socialism for the rich. Everyone else is treated to harsh capitalism. In the conservative mind, socialism means getting something for doing nothing. That pretty much describes the $21bn saved by the nation\u2019s largest banks last year thanks to Trump\u2019s tax cuts, some of which went into massive bonuses for bank executives. On the other hand, more than 4,000 lower-level bank employees got a big dose of harsh capitalism. They lost their jobs. Banks that are too big to fail \u2013 courtesy of the 2008 bank bailout \u2013 enjoy a hidden subsidy of some $83bn a year, because creditors facing less risk accept lower interest on deposits and loans. Last year, Wall Street\u2019s bonus pool was $31.4bn. Take away the hidden subsidy and the bonus pool disappears. Trump and his appointees at the Federal Reserve are easing bank requirements put in place after the bailout. They\u2019ll make sure the biggest banks remain too big to fail. Trump is promoting socialism for the rich and harsh capitalism for everyone else in other ways. GM has got more than $600m in federal contracts, plus $500m in tax breaks. Some of this has gone into the pockets of GM executives. Chairman and CEO Mary Barra raked in almost $22m in total compensation in 2017 alone. But GM employees are subject to harsh capitalism. GM is planning to lay off more than 14,000 workers and close three assembly plants and two component factories in North America by the end of 2019. When he was in business, Trump perfected the art of using bankruptcy to shield himself from the consequences of bad decisions \u2013 socialism for the rich at its worst \u2013 while leaving employees twisting in the wind. Now, all over America, executives who run their companies into the ground are getting gold-plated exit packages while their workers get pink slips. Sears is doling out $25m to the executives who stripped its remaining assets and drove it into bankruptcy, but has no money for the thousands of workers it laid off. As Pacific Gas and Electric hurtles toward bankruptcy, the person who was in charge when the deadly infernos roared through northern California last year (caused in part by PG&amp;E\u2019s faulty equipment) has departed with a cash severance package of $2.5m. The PG&amp;E executive in charge of gas operations when records were allegedly falsified left in 2017 with $6.9m. Under socialism for the rich, you can screw up big time and still reap big rewards. Equifax\u2019s Richard Smith retired in 2017 with an $18m pension in the wake of a security breach that exposed the personal information of 145 million consumers to hackers. Wells Fargo\u2019s Carrie Tolstedt departed with a $125m exit package after being in charge of the unit that opened more than 2 million unauthorized customer accounts. Around 60% of America\u2019s wealth is now inherited. Many of today\u2019s super-rich have never done a day\u2019s work in their lives. Trump\u2019s response has been to cut the estate tax to apply only to estates valued at over $22m per couple. Mitch McConnell is now proposing that the estate tax be repealed altogether. What about the capitalist principles that people earn what they\u2019re worth in the market, and that economic gains should go to those who deserve them? America is on the cusp of the largest inter-generational wealth transfer in history. As rich boomers expire over the next three decades, an estimated $30tn will go to their children. Those children will be able to live off of the income these assets generate, and then leave the bulk of them to their own heirs, tax-free. (Capital gains taxes don\u2019t apply to the soaring values of stocks, bonds, mansions and other assets of wealthy people who die before they\u2019re sold.) After a few generations of this, almost all of the nation\u2019s wealth will be in the hands of a few thousand non-working families. To the conservative mind, the specter of socialism conjures up a society in which no one is held accountable, and no one has to work for what they receive. Yet that\u2019s exactly the society Trump and the Republicans are promoting for the rich. Meanwhile, most Americans are subject to an increasingly harsh and arbitrary capitalism in which they\u2019re working harder but getting nowhere, and have less security than ever. They need thicker safety nets and deserve a bigger piece of the economic pie. If you want to call this socialism, fine. I call it fair.

We\u2019ll have to wait to see the results of Cosgrave\u2019s research, but whether or not choreography could be used to shape the cities of the future, there are myriad ways in which cities have shaped dance: the mass of bodies thrumming through urban hubs has always been a motor and generator for movement. Recent performances of some early Trisha Brown works. Clockwise from top left: Roof Piece, performed above the High Line park in 2011 in New York City; Man Walking Down the Side of a Building at the Broad Art Center in UCLA in 2013; Walking on the Wall at the Barbican in London in 2011 Around the same time hip-hop was taking shape in the Bronx, just 10 miles south in Manhattan the postmodern choreographer Trisha Brown was dancing a graceful semaphore among the chimneys and water tanks of Soho\u2019s rooftops in Roof Piece (1971). In Man Walking Down the Side of a Building (1970) and Woman Walking Down a Ladder (1973), she had her dancers inhabit the vertical space of the high-rise city, horizontal bodies (in harnesses) descending down buildings. Brown turned the city\u2019s streets and walls into her studio, and passersby into spectators. More recently, New York\u2019s streets provided the stage and set for a film adaptation of Jerome Robbins\u2019 NY Export: Opus Jazz, his 1958 \u201cballet in sneakers\u201d. The work was made just a year after his original production of West Side Story and has the same cool jazz feel. Its restless urban youthfulness still felt fresh and relevant 60 years later as dancers converged in an empty Brooklyn swimming pool and duetted on the (pre-renovation) High Line at sunset. New York City Ballet performs NY Export: Opus Jazz in 2013. Robbins was assistant artistic director at New York City Ballet, where founder George Balanchine, a Russian emigre, developed a particularly American style of ballet, inspired by the vibrant skyscraper city itself: his dancers taller and thinner, their legs thrown higher, their pace faster, their lines sleeker, all fuelled by the energy and verve of the people and architecture around them. The German choreographer Pina Bausch\u2019s World Cities series was a group of 10 works that spanned from 1986 to her death in 2009, each made in, and inspired by, a different city around the world. The works give only tantalising impressions of the places they came from \u2013 each work is unmistakably Bauschian, a reminder that wherever we might go, we still take ourselves with us \u2013 but they are laced with particular flavours and her idiosyncratic observations. Clockwise from top: Palermo Palermo, Wiesenland and Der Fensterputzer Her vision of Sicily in Palermo Palermo is filled with litter, rubble and an obsession with meat; water is everywhere in Wiesenland, inspired by Budapest, city of spas and bathing. And sojourns in sunny Santiago (in the piece Como el Musguito), Lisbon (Masurca Fogo) and Istanbul (Nef\u00e9s) produced softer, warmer works than the hard and sometimes cruel Teutonic tanztheater she\u2019s known for. Rather than showing us their own impressions, some artists ask viewers to rethink their perspectives on familiar cities. The Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker\u2019s Slow Walk is a mindful flashmob that has taken place in Brussels and Paris (and will be in Bruges on 23 February), where participants walk for several hours at a pace of less than five metres per minute, giving time to pay attention to every movement of their bodies and their relationship with their surroundings. Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker\u2019s Slow Walk in Paris. The Austrian artist Willi Dorner\u2019s Bodies in Urban Spaces series takes a more absurdist approach, putting dancers in cities\u2019s forgotten nooks and crannies, piling them up in alcoves or squishing them into gaps between buildings, railings or lamp posts, bringing our attention to architectural shapes and voids and making us look again at things we pass every day. Dorner\u2019s interest is in how design, large and small, limits where and how we can move, something that also appears in the work of Patricia Noxolo, a lecturer in human geography, when she talks about place ballet, a concept originated by David Seamon to describe how the movements and trajectories of people moving in a public space \u2013 at a market, for example \u2013 unknowingly create a large-scale choreography. A performance of Willi Dorner\u2019s Bodies in Urban Spaces in south London in 2009 Noxolo also uses the term to refer to our individual movement signatures: how our surroundings mould the ways we move our bodies and embed physical habits, our own \u201cplace ballets\u201d. Growing up in a concrete maisonette in Birmingham\u2019s Lee Bank, her movement repertoire was forged by navigating narrow walkways, leaning over balconies, running down stairs and pounding hard pavements. There is no doubt the design of cities influences how we move, from high-concept choreography to the literally pedestrian. Now it seems, in the light of Cosgrave\u2019s research, that choreographers could be able to help create cities, too.

He completed his education in the US, and, after further travels, went on to be a visiting writer at the the University of Iowa. He returned to Sierra Leone but was later among the writers forced into exile for criticising the one-party government. These days, he spends time in both the US and Sierra Leone. \u201cI believe my poems have always been linked by three common themes,\u201d he writes: \u201cthe awakening of my identity; the pain of exile and a basic concern for those whose humanity is sometimes threatened by others.\u201d</p> <p>The Colour of Stones comes from Cheney-Coker\u2019s recently revised collection, The Road to Jamaica. In an author\u2019s note, he recounts the following story: a small publisher in the US had been interested in bringing out the book, but the young writer had hesitated. \u201cDeeply aware of my dual identity, I felt the poems, as a whole, were immature, too <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9opold_S%C3%A9dar_Senghor\">Senghorian</a>; but without his splendid beauty. Two of the poems were absorbed into Concerto for an Exile, after which I tore up the rest of the volume.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-seven years later, an old college girlfriend sent Cheney-Coker a copy of the collection he\u2019d forgotten once giving her. She\u2019d written, \u201cI think you might enjoy reading these poems after all these years.\u201d Pleased but still cautious, he put the poems away for another four years. Finally, eight of the 20 poems, much revised, became the first part of the 2015 edition of The Road to Jamaica. Part Two contains more recent work, under the title Elegy for the Afro-Saxon, including The Colour of Stones.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/afro-saxon\">Afro-Saxon</a>\u201d denotes a person of African descent with English or Anglo-American affiliations. Perhaps Sierra Leonean culture is particularly diverse and open to such complexity? Among the many ethnic groups, the Krio are the descendants of the freed US slaves after whom Freetown was named, and they continue to reflect western cultural influences. </p> <p>There are references to Muslims and Christians in the poem, to \u201ccolonials and benefactors\u201d, to the \u201cbeloved old grannies\u201d and the \u201cyoung, philistine ploughmen who are / reckless with adzes\u201d.

Despite over 60 candidates, it is likely to be a choice between President Muhammadu Buhari, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>President Muhammadu Buhari (APC candidate)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Buhari's 2015 victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party was built on three promises: to rid Nigeria of endemic corruption, fix the economy and tackle security threats.</p>\n    <p>The government says it is making progress in the fight against Boko Haram, but it is now in its tenth year, and the economy entered and climbed out of recession under Buhari. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/11/nigeria-election-mr-honesty-muhammadu-buhari-tainted-by-failure-to-tackle-corruption\">Opponents say his government is failing to tackle corruption</a>, while Amnesty International say the army has been responsible for human rights abuses.</p>\n    <p>After spending five months in Britain in 2017 receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups said he was unfit for office, but Buhari, 76, says he is strong enough to serve.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Atiku Abubakar (PDP candidate)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Atiku, 72, has been caught up in corruption allegations since serving as vice president from 1999-2007. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.&nbsp; </p>\n    <p>He has promised business-friendly policies to double the economy to $900bn by 2025. He wants to privatise parts of the state oil company, and create a $25bn fund to support private sector investment.</p>\n    <p>Atiku's opponents have claimed he would exploit those pro-business policies to enrich himself and those around him.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>A divided country</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nigeria is deeply divided between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south. There are more than 200 distinct ethnic groups. This has led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement, with the presidency alternating between north and south every eight years.</p>\n    <p>It isn't just religion or ethnicity causing fractures. Half of Nigeria\u2019s registered voters are aged 18-35. Many say their ageing leaders are out of touch, and supported a \"Not Too Young to Run\" campaign to encourage younger people seeking office.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Election concerns</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>2015 was the only time Nigeria had a peaceful power handover since civilian government took over in 1999. Even then there was evidence of vote buying, voter intimidation, and other forms of corruption. International observers fear election interference and rigging this time around.</p>\n    <p>Last month, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Path to victory</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The candidate with the most votes is declared winner, as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states and the capital.

Evans, however, is stubbornly holding out against the tide. Founded in 1921, it\u2019s the UK\u2019s largest high-street cycling retailer with more than 1,000 employees and 250 qualified mechanics. It stocks over 40,000 products and has more than 50 stores. It\u2019s safe to say that what Evans doesn\u2019t know about bikes isn\u2019t worth knowing. So if you are in the market for a bike, it\u2019s not a daft place to start your search. One model that may catch your eye is the all-new Arkose. It\u2019s made by Pinnacle, which is Evans\u2019s inhouse brand. This means it won\u2019t appeal to badge snobs, but canny riders can get themselves on a quality machine at remarkable prices. There are seven bikes in the range, divided between dirt and road, and rising in price from the \u00a3825 D1 to the flagship \u00a31,400 X. What really makes the Arkose frame stand out from the crowd is its unparalleled versatility. You can fit either single or double chainrings, electronic or cable gears, disc brakes and larger wheels to suit your needs. Internal dynamo light routing and mudguard mounts are all standard.

Evans, however, is stubbornly holding out against the tide. Founded in 1921, it\u2019s the UK\u2019s largest high-street cycling retailer with more than 1,000 employees and 250 qualified mechanics. It stocks over 40,000 products and has more than 50 stores. It\u2019s safe to say that what Evans doesn\u2019t know about bikes isn\u2019t worth knowing. So if you are in the market for a bike, it\u2019s not a daft place to start your search. One model that may catch your eye is the all-new Arkose. It\u2019s made by Pinnacle, which is Evans\u2019s inhouse brand. This means it won\u2019t appeal to badge snobs, but canny riders can get themselves on a quality machine at remarkable prices. There are seven bikes in the range, divided between dirt and road, and rising in price from the \u00a3825 D1 to the flagship \u00a31,400 X. What really makes the Arkose frame stand out from the crowd is its unparalleled versatility. You can fit either single or double chainrings, electronic or cable gears, disc brakes and larger wheels to suit your needs. Internal dynamo light routing and mudguard mounts are all standard. Time for a visit! Cool kit Waterproof and rack-mounted, this posh bike bag from Samsonite means you\u2019ll arrive in style.

Aid spending on countries with substantial military or space programmes should be ended.</p> <p>It argues: \u201cThe greatest alleviator of poverty in the world has been western capitalism backed by western foreign direct investment.\u201d</p> <p>DfID insisted on Sunday the government remained fully committed to the existing statutory target on aid spending. Yet Conservative political sources have recently questioned whether the definition could be changed.</p> <p>The authors of the report claim Britain\u2019s defence capability has shrunk so far as to threaten the UK transatlantic relationship, which they call the most powerful alliance in modern history. \u201cIt is staggering that the UK should be so wilfully blind to this danger,\u201d the authors say.</p> <p>The report suggests Britain\u2019s three overarching foreign policy themes should be freedom for trade, freedom from oppression and freedom of thought and expression. DfID\u2019s goals should be aligned to meet these three objectives.</p> <p>Claiming that the battle for the 21st century is between open and closed societies, the report also suggests:</p> <ul> <li><p>The introduction of a foreign agents act, listing the public relations agencies, reputation management firms, lobbyists, and others who work as agents for foreign states or who lobby on their behalf. Both the US and Australia have introduced similar acts: the US in the 1930s and Australia in 2017.</p></li> <li><p>A counter-propaganda bill to introduce laws to ensure a health warning on broadcasters and other media that are paid-for propagandists, especially those funded by authoritarian states and which do not have an independent editorial line.</p></li> <li><p>Giving Ofcom greater powers. RT and Sputnik should not be banned, but fines could be strengthened and Ofcom could investigate broadcasters more quickly.</p></li> <li><p>A more aggressive and assertive use of financial and legal powers, including unexplained wealth orders and the Magnitsky Amendment to make the UK a less welcoming environment for criminals and corrupt politicians.</p></li> </ul> <p>Andrew Mitchell, a former Conservative international development secretary, said: \u201cBoris is a bit like a medieval pirate whose eyes have alighted on this plump Spanish galleon loaded with bullion and he wants to board it and plunder it.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 11 February 2019 to make clear that Global Britain: A Blueprint for the 21st Century was not a Conservative party report.</p></li> </ul>",

Aid spending on countries with substantial military or space programmes should be ended. It argues: \u201cThe greatest alleviator of poverty in the world has been western capitalism backed by western foreign direct investment.\u201d DfID insisted on Sunday the government remained fully committed to the existing statutory target on aid spending. Yet Conservative political sources have recently questioned whether the definition could be changed. The authors of the report claim Britain\u2019s defence capability has shrunk so far as to threaten the UK transatlantic relationship, which they call the most powerful alliance in modern history. \u201cIt is staggering that the UK should be so wilfully blind to this danger,\u201d the authors say. The report suggests Britain\u2019s three overarching foreign policy themes should be freedom for trade, freedom from oppression and freedom of thought and expression. DfID\u2019s goals should be aligned to meet these three objectives. Claiming that the battle for the 21st century is between open and closed societies, the report also suggests: The introduction of a foreign agents act, listing the public relations agencies, reputation management firms, lobbyists, and others who work as agents for foreign states or who lobby on their behalf. Both the US and Australia have introduced similar acts: the US in the 1930s and Australia in 2017. A counter-propaganda bill to introduce laws to ensure a health warning on broadcasters and other media that are paid-for propagandists, especially those funded by authoritarian states and which do not have an independent editorial line. Giving Ofcom greater powers. RT and Sputnik should not be banned, but fines could be strengthened and Ofcom could investigate broadcasters more quickly. A more aggressive and assertive use of financial and legal powers, including unexplained wealth orders and the Magnitsky Amendment to make the UK a less welcoming environment for criminals and corrupt politicians. Andrew Mitchell, a former Conservative international development secretary, said: \u201cBoris is a bit like a medieval pirate whose eyes have alighted on this plump Spanish galleon loaded with bullion and he wants to board it and plunder it.\u201d This article was amended on 11 February 2019 to make clear that Global Britain: A Blueprint for the 21st Century was not a Conservative party report.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has shifted its stance on the medical transfer bill, seeking agreement for three principles that might scuttle the proposal once it returns to the parliament, and allow Scott Morrison to claim a significant political victory. At the end of a meeting of the shadow cabinet, the left and right factions, and the caucus, the ALP signalled it wanted to rework the proposal it supported in the parliament last December to increase the discretion of the home affairs minister to refuse medical transfers for asylum seekers, to make the timeframes for decision making less restrictive, and to ensure the procedures only applied to the cohort currently on Manus Island and Nauru. The backflip, which had been telegraphed by Bill Shorten since the middle of last week, followed a substantial rhetorical bombardment \u2013 including misrepresentations about the detail of the legislation \u2013 by the Morrison government in an effort to avoid losing the first substantive vote in the House of Representatives since 1929. With Labor locked in contested internal deliberations \u2013 with some MPs fearing the consequences of a prolonged, toxic debate on border protection, and others a progressive backlash to any about face by the opposition \u2013 Scott Morrison used an appearance at the National Press Club on Monday to ratchet up the political pressure. The prime minister declared the opposition needed to scuttle the medical transfer bill if it was serious about protecting Australia\u2019s borders. Despite having flagged his own independent medical review panel just last week to vet medical transfers of asylum seekers from offshore detention in an effort to scuttle the crossbench proposal, and presided over the rapid removal of vulnerable children in response to internal pressure from government moderates, Morrison declared on Monday that as prime minister: \u201cI\u2019m not going to find some middle ground\u201d. Morrison said when it came to preventing deaths at sea, \u201cyou can\u2019t split the difference\u201d. The bill was \u201cunnecessary, it is superfluous, it adds nothing to border protection \u2013 it only takes away\u201d. The Labor caucus met for close to two hours on Monday night, but after a day of meetings, and restiveness in the left caucus meeting, there wasn\u2019t huge contention at the final deliberation. Two leftwing frontbenchers, Pat Conroy and Andrew Giles, asked detailed questions about the implications of the proposed shift, including about adjustments to the timeframe for determinations, but accepted the logic of the amendments. A caucus subcommittee will look at the final wording of any deal with the crossbench. Labor has already made contact with key independents in an effort to ensure the legislation passes the parliament, and does not founder courtesy of Monday\u2019s reposition. The crossbench is due to meet in Canberra on Tuesday morning, and wants to see detailed language from Labor before deciding which way to go. For procedural reasons, the legislation has to be dealt with on Tuesday, likely in the afternoon, after question time. The changes proposed originally by independent Kerryn Phelps, and amended by the South Australian senator Tim Storer, with Labor\u2019s backing last year, would have given doctors more say over the medical transfers of people in offshore detention. The crossbench move followed escalating concern about the wellbeing of people in detention, particularly children, and a major mobilisation by the medical profession concerned about rising incidences of mental illness, self harm, and suicide. The bill as currently drafted does contain discretion for the home affairs minister to reject a medical transfer if he or she doesn\u2019t agree with the recommendation of health professionals; or reject it on security grounds. The security veto was limited in scope, but absolute. If the minister rebuffed a transfer because he or she disagreed with the advice, that could be over ridden by an independent medical review panel. Labor\u2019s new principles would broaden the grounds on which the minister could prevent a medical transfer to include additional criteria like a criminal record, addressing claims from Morison that Labor was prepared to let murderers and rapists into the country; and also ensure the enhanced procedures only applied to people currently in offshore detention, not to new arrivals. While key figures have an open mind, it was unclear on Monday night whether the crossbench will play ball with Labor\u2019s revised position. Storer said he would consider Labor\u2019s principles, \u201cbut would be disappointed if the amendments do not pass the House in their current form\u201d. Fearing a Labor backdown last week, Phelps warned the opposition against \u201ccaving in\u201d to Morrison\u2019s \u201cscare tactics and deliberate misinformation\u201d. If Labor and the crossbench don\u2019t come to terms on the proposed revisions, and Morrison avoids a defeat on the floor of the parliament when the sittings resume on Tuesday, the government will chalk that up as a significant win.",

It was less about plans and more about why Ireland are near-invincible when defending a lead in the second half but struggle when chasing.

It is a tactic used by New Zealand and in rugby league, and gave <em>Les Bleus </em>little opportunity to counterattack. England had 63% of possession in the opening half but made almost as many tackles as France. Jonny May scored a hat-trick while covering 10 metres with the ball in hand in the first half.

Winger Jess Breach, a sevens specialist, caught the eye with two smart tries but it was the pack that provided the platform. Sarah Hunter, playing her 110th Test, was a major influence along with Poppy Cleall, who moved to the back row to help cover for the injured Marlie Packer.

Now, here is my account of a brief from the home affairs department that was leaked selectively to some news outlets last week. That leak is now the subject of a police investigation.<br></p> <p>The government has now released a redacted version of the home affairs brief. The first thing to note is it is not a classified brief (as at least one outlet suggested). It\u2019s status is \u201cprotected, sensitive, legal\u201d.<br></p> <p>News reports of this brief suggested that security agencies had warned the floodgates would be opened on border protection if the parliament ultimately passes the medical transfer legislation. Well, sort of. There are a lot of contentions in the advice, and some of them are hedged.<br></p> <p>Officials argue <strong>the current ministerial discretion in the bill to reject people cleared for medical transfer on security grounds isn\u2019t wide enough.</strong><br></p> <p>Consistent with the culture of the home affairs department, the briefers also <strong>clearly object to doctors being decision-makers. </strong>The officials say a lot of doctors don\u2019t like offshore detention, ipso facto: \u201cMany doctors in Australia and their professional associations have called for an end to regional processing and it is expected that their recommendations under these amendments would be forthcoming in a short period.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is expected that within four weeks of Royal Assent, should the bill pass the House of Representatives, that most of the 1,000 individuals would be in contact with \u2018treating doctors\u2019 willing to recommend their transfer to Australia for at least medical assessment if not treatment. The fact that treatment is available in PNG, Taiwan or Nauru would not restrict the recommendations by treating doctors to transfer. The individual would not be required to accept treatment in their regional processing country or another location that is not Australia\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cSome doctors have publically [sic] asserted that all transferees should be removed from Nauru and PNG for mental health reasons. Provided those doctors are appropriately registered or licensed and have \u2018assessed\u2019 transferees either remotely or in person, it will be open to him or her to form the opinion that any or all of the transferees are \u2018relevant transitory persons\u2019 and give the secretary notice of this, triggering the provisions in the amendments.\u201d<br></p> <p>A contention, unless I\u2019m not mistaken. Doctors. Gotta watch them. Always up to something.<br></p> <p>Moving on, the briefers note something the government hasn\u2019t exactly highlighted. \u201cOn transfer to Australia, <strong>the individuals would be detained under the Migration Act 1958 (Migration Act) and placed in held detention </strong>or in community detention by way of a residence determination\u201d.<br></p> <p>So this isn\u2019t quite \u201ctwo doctors say you can come to Australia, and freedom beckons\u201d, as a number of government frontbenchers have suggested during the past few hyperbolic days.

We have a clear commitment to reduce emissions to 26% by 2030. So that is our response. We are taking action on climate change.

I acknowledge it\u2019s a factor. Of course it is. Australians do. The vast majority of Australians. But the issue is how you achieve it. We believe you need sensible, achievable targets to address climate change, and we have them and we\u2019re achieving them. </p> <p>What we disagree with is having reckless target that is shut down your economy and take people\u2019s jobs, which is what Labor propose. </p> <p>Their target requires an emissions reduction roughly three times what we still have to achieve by 2030.

When you and Senator Reynolds visited Townsville, they rang the insurance brokers there, but then rang the mortgage brokers. Can you tell the mortgage brokers of Australia the sense that you give them about their future and they\u2019re deeply concerned about the capacity to serve their clients, which they\u2019ll do?</p> <p> Can you clarify today and I know that Treasurer Frydenberg will look at the $2.7bn received in that, so if you could talk to the mortgage brokers of Australia.</p> </blockquote> <p>Morrison:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The mortgage brokers understand, with at cautious way we\u2019ve responded to the report, that we understand the important role that they play in the community. And I\u2019ve already said that. </p> <p>Yes, the royal commission has recommended some changes that will need to be absorbed over time and they can be absorbed if they\u2019re done in consultation. </p> <p>But I want to see as many mortgage brokers in this country, five years from now, in fact, more than there are today. I don\u2019t want to see this sector wither on the vine and be strangled by regulation that would throw them out of business, but more importantly, would deny choice and competition in the banking system. </p> <p>If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learnt from this process is that we need more competition. We need more options. We need more choices. Not fewer. And that\u2019s what I am concerned about and treasurer and I are concerned about in terms of how we would go forward on that one recommendation. </p> <p>So they have my pledge that I get how important they are to Australia and Australian families and Australians who want to buy a home and we will work closely with them to ensure that we deal with the things that we need to deal with and many of those mortgage brokers have told us that there are things that they need to deal with, and that\u2019s fine. </p> <p>But we\u2019ll do it in a partnership way which makes the sector stronger, not weaker.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T02:50:09.156Z\">at 2.50am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c60ddc6e4b00ef6acc6b79f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T02:28:56.516Z\">2.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Prime minister, can I come back to the theme of today\u2019s speech - security?

Do you accept that you need to be factual in how you respond to issues and what you say about things? And if the answer to that question is yes - then why are so many of your frontbenchers misrepresenting the basic facts that are in the medical transfers bill?</p> <p> How does that behaviour within five minutes of an election, we can all see it \u2013 how does that rebuild public trust in institutions?</p> </blockquote> <p>Morrison:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t agree, with great respect, with your assessment, in terms of the conduct of my colleagues. </p> <p>What I and my colleagues have been doing \u2013 in fact, that\u2019s why I declassified the Home Affairs advice so people could read it for themselves. </p> <p>It\u2019s out there. You can read it for yourself. The warning is very clear. </p> <p>I think that\u2019s very consistent with the type of behaviour that you\u2019re asking from me, to ensure that there\u2019s a very clear ... I mean, how many times \u2013 you have have been around the town a long time, Katharine, how many times have you seen a prime minister declassify that type of advice and show it to the country. </p> <p>It\u2019s a shame that it took Bill five days to respond to that. And as<strong> Mathias Cormann </strong>reminded me this morning, when Labor voted for this bill in the Senate last year, they didn\u2019t even get a security brief onning this. </p> <p>You see, my great ... disappointment, and it\u2019s not a strong enough word. What I and other ministers have gone through to restore Australia\u2019s borders ... I lived through those horrible years when the bodies were piling up and I vowed to myself when I came to government when Tony was prime minister that we were never, ever going to allow this to happen again. </p> <p>And what is happening in our Australian parliament right now, it may be entirely well motivated. I\u2019m not making any judgements about people\u2019s motivations here. In fact, quite the opposite. </p> <p>But what I am doing is \u2013 they do not know what they\u2019re playing with. They have no idea of the consequences of what they are playing with. And they will unleash a world of woe again. How do I know? I\u2019ve seen it before. And I never, ever want to see it again. </p> <p>So, I\u2019m not going to step back from calling it as tough and as straight as I can. If Bill Shorten allows that bill to pass in any way, shape or form, that\u2019s the test. That\u2019s the only test going on the parliament this week. It\u2019s not who wins or loses a vote.

That\u2019s how it works. And everyone should face responsibility for their actions and be accountable for what they\u2019ve done and matters have been referred off for those, cases to Asic and the others to take forward, and they\u2019ll be pursued and they\u2019ll end up in court, I have no doubt, and then courts will decide. But what I do believe is that all of them have to be accountable for their actions. </p> <p>So, what can I do about that? You know, I don\u2019t run the courts. But I can introduce a piece of legislation called the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which, for the first time in this country, made senior bank executives accountable, directly and personally, for the decision that is they make, whether they\u2019re criminal or not, whether they have a negative impact in a serious way against Australians and small and family businesses all around the country, and that legislation enables Apra to run them out of town so they can\u2019t go and work in another bank and do the same thing again. </p> <p>I can set up the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which Kelly did when she was in the portfolio previous to this one, and I can make sure that they can take cases going back ten years now, over the same course that the royal commission was looking at so they can get access to their justice too. </p> <p>And that\u2019s happening now as we speak. So there are a lot of actions I can take to ensure people face accountability and face justice and we\u2019re taking those actions. I\u2019ve got to say, one of the things I was most pleased to be involved with, with Kelly when she was minister for financial services was getting <strong>Dan Cronin</strong> on board. We\u2019d already acted on that before that. We did think that Asic needed to pony up a lot more on this, and you know, go to the line \u2013 take these things to court, and Dan Cronin is a very good litigator and I\u2019m sure will be doing an excellent job. </p> <p>So yes, I want to see people face consequences for their actions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T02:55:50.365Z\">at 2.55am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c60dc1be4b042feedcbb50e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T02:21:47.063Z\">2.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You generously listed all of the measures that you\u2019ve been acting on.

But they wouldn\u2019t expect a government to just sight unseen all of the recommendations.</p> <p>I never understood them doing that. And now they find themselves boxed in. We have the Productivity Commission report on mortgage brokers which basically says \u2013 if you start turning that industry on its head, you just hand the power back to the banks. </p> <p>Now, I don\u2019t see how that achieve our objective, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been extremely cautious on that point, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not surprised that mortgage brokers are very angry with the Labor party. </p> <p>I mean, these are tens of thousands of small and family businesses that help mums and dads get a good deal on their mortgage and so they don\u2019t have to just face the banks themselves. It\u2019s pretty important service. We want to make sure that Australians can still have access to that service. Now, what Bill Shorten is going to do, who knows.

It adds nothing to border protection and therefore, its passage in any form takes us backwards.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need this bill to ensure that Australia has control of its borders.

We smashed Kyoto 1. </p> <p>Kyoto 2 we will smash as well and as I said to you, 2030, our target of 26%, we will meet in a canter and I\u2019ll be announcing further upgrades and details of our policy between here and the next election which will determine that result as well. </p> <p>So what we do in the Liberal party is we say what we\u2019re going to do and what we\u2019re going to achieve. </p> <p>We said we\u2019re going to create one million jobs. We\u2019ll have an economic plan to do that through lower taxes and supporting family businesses and infrastructure and doing all that. </p> <p>And we did it.

Picking up on Chris\u2019s question before \u2013 how can you promise voters, hand on heart, here today, that the announcements that you are making and in the upcoming budget, are things that will actually be implemented should your government be re-elected?</p> </blockquote> <p>Morrison:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, we dealt with that last year. The party room made a historical decision regarding the support of prime ministers who are re-elected. So that\u2019s for the history books. That\u2019s already on the record. But let me tell you a story. </p> <p>I think there\u2019s a great myth that is going around about what happened in 2013. The Labor party had quite a few prime ministers, that\u2019s true \u2013 and they weren\u2019t very good! We\u2019ve had three good ones, I would argue! </p> <p>What happened in 2013 was that the Labor party were thrown out because they were a very bad government. </p> <p>They had manifestly stuffed it on so many points, it was embarrassing. Now, people can rightly say that we\u2019ve had three prime ministers \u2013 that is true. What they cannot say is that we\u2019ve mismanaged the finances. They cannot say that we\u2019ve mismanaged the budget or the economy. </p> <p>They cannot say that we\u2019ve mishandled the borders or failed to invest in the defence forces or secure our position in the Pacific and the broader Indo-Pacific region. </p> <p>They can\u2019t say we haven\u2019t worked with state and territories to bring about record funding for schools and hospitals and they cannot say, as Greg Hunt will remind you on every occasion, that we have got record listings of pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceuticals benefits scheme. </p> <p>And why? Because we know how to run a budget and have a great economy. The great myth of the 2013 election was that Labor was thrown out only because they had too many prime ministers. </p> <p>They were thrown out because they were a joke in government and they will be again. And let me tell you why \u2013 they have learned nothing. Absolutely nothing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T02:29:54.367Z\">at 2.29am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c60d94fe4b00ef6acc6b786\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T02:10:42.110Z\">2.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This week, Labor intends to move a motion seeking a majority of 76 votes to force a recall of the parliament in March. Just dealing with some of [commissioner Kenneth] Hayne\u2019s recommendations [into the banking industry]. Pivotal to that is the vote of <strong>Bob Katter,</strong> who is open to it \u2013 not ruling it out. If he were to support that motion, would that cancel that deal you did with him last year to give him $234m in water infrastructure for his electorate so long as he voted with the minority government?</p> </blockquote> <p>Morrison:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, there\u2019s a lot in that question, Phil! But let me tell you about some things which are facts. What is a fact is that there are 40 recommendations that require legislation. </p> <p>What is a fact is that we currently have bills already sitting in the Senate and in the House which can be actioned, right now, this week. </p> <p>In fact, I remember when I introduced the banking executive accountability regime into the parliament and when I brought the bank levy into the parliament \u2013 you know who tried to slow it down? The Labor party. </p> <p>The Labor party tried to slow it down. So this is what it is. You cannot go and put together what is at least 40 pieces of legislation, or thereabouts, scramble it together in a couple of weeks, throw it into a feverish sitting of the Australian parliament just before the election and then be surprised at the result that you think that you might get on the other side. I would call that type of financial legislation \u2013 reckless. The fact that <strong>Bill Shorten</strong>, as a former financial services minister and an assistant treasurer, doesn\u2019t understand the complexity of these measures, the consultation that has to be undertaken \u2013 the exposure drafts that need to be made available. </p> <p>The unintended consequences to be identified through that process, says that this guy doesn\u2019t get it. He doesn\u2019t understand how to legislate financial services reform. </p> <p>Now, there\u2019s a good reason \u2013 he\u2019s never done it! They didn\u2019t do it when they were in government last time. They had Storm Financial, they had all of those. Nothing. Zip, zero! </p> <p>Our government has been reforming the financial services sector since the day we were elected. The financial systems inquiry started the process rolling under the Murray Review and that\u2019s continued to this day, and the treasurer has led, I think, a very comprehensive response to the royal commission in just days. We\u2019re still waiting, aren\u2019t we, Josh? I mean, they have had more time to consider their response than the government has, and we\u2019re still waiting. Still waiting. Labor doesn\u2019t know how to reform the financial sector because they never have and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s involved.</p> <p>The Law Council has made the same point today. We will deal with this in the prudent, measured and responsible way we always do. That\u2019s why Australians can trust us when it comes to managing our economy because we don\u2019t go and beat it with a baseball bat senselessly, without thinking through the consequences \u2013 which is what Labor wants to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the substantive point and Phil\u2019s question, if Bob Katter votes against the Government on this, does it extinguish the water funding meal?</p> </blockquote> <p>Morrison:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Too many \u201cifs\u201d in the question so I don\u2019t intend to entertain it.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T02:27:50.030Z\">at 2.27am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c60d911e4b042feedcbb501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T02:08:45.372Z\">2.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Question:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Liberal party has voted no confidence in its own leadership twice now.

What will be happening is what happens throughout a lot of Australia in terms of medivacing these people after having done consultations, either by the phone, or by tele-health,\u201d he told Sky News. </p> <p>Two doctors, independent doctors, will make a decision, in agreement, that a particular individual does need to come to a situation where the facilities are better, are more appropriate for their management and for their ability to survive.</p> <p>That will then go to the minister. If the minister says he doesn\u2019t agree with the medical decision, which he has done regularly over the years, it will then go to a 10-person individual committee, many of whom will have been selected by the minister himself.</p> <p>If that independent committee then decides that this patient should be transferred, should be medivaced, the minister still has complete control over that individual.</p> <p>They will be accompanied by armed guards, they will probably end up in a detention centre in Australia, they will be accompanied by armed guards to the hospital, to their appointments. He has complete control over that. And he has complete control, when that medical treatment has finished, of sending those patients back to offshore detention.</p> <p>... I think what Dr Phelps suggests should happen, that if people are felt to be unwell by the local doctors then they should seek the help of another doctor. If both doctors suggest the patient is ill enough to be transferred, then we go through that process.</p> <p>The minister has control over that process.</p> <p>... Will 1,000 people come? That is what has been said. I mean, to me, if 1,000 people do come over the next three weeks, it would suggest that they are all absolutely critically ill and need to be evacuated.</p> <p>I honestly don\u2019t feel that is the case, and I think the talk about 1,000 people being here in two and a half minutes is pure politics.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"346f1ad5988be10548780e6f9293b63575da8944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/346f1ad5988be10548780e6f9293b63575da8944/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors and future doctors are in Parliament House to lobby government and opposition members on the need for the medivac legislation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors and future doctors are in Parliament House to lobby government and opposition members on the need for the medivac legislation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T00:37:15.389Z\">at 12.37am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c60b8dbe4b00ef6acc6b6c8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katharine-murphy\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-10T23:53:49.708Z\">11.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What exactly is this bill?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Given all the misinformation flying around about the crossbench medical transfer bill, it\u2019s worthwhile taking the time to spell out what it does. </p> <p>The bill (changes initially proposed by <strong>Kerryn Phelps</strong> and amended by <strong>Tim Storer</strong>, Labor and others have been added to a piece of government legislation in the Senate) sets out new procedures governing medical transfers from offshore detention.</p> <p>The government has been trying to create an impression that two doctors decide, entirely on their own volition, who comes to Australia and who doesn\u2019t. To put it bluntly, that\u2019s complete bollocks.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s correct to say that the bill envisages giving two or more treating doctors the capacity to recommend a transfer of an ill person to Australia for treatment.<br></p> <p>If you read the legislation, this is what happens next:<br></p> <p>Within 24 hours of being notified that a person should be transferred, \u201cthe minister must approve, <strong>or refuse to approve</strong>, the person\u2019s transfer to Australia\u201d.<br></p> <p>The minister must approve the transfer unless the minister \u201c<strong>reasonably believes that it is not necessary to remove the person from a regional processing country</strong> for appropriate medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment; or \u201c<strong>the minister reasonably believes that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security </strong>within the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that act\u201d.</p> <p>So there are two grounds of ministerial refusal: one general and one specific.<br></p> <p>If the minister <strong>refuses the transfer</strong> on the grounds that it is not medically necessary, <strong>the issue then goes to an Independent Health Advice Panel</strong>.<br></p> <p>That panel conducts another clinical assessment. Back to the legislation to explain what happens next:</p> <p>\u201cIf the panel recommends that the person\u2019s transfer be approved, the minister must approve the person\u2019s transfer to Australia <strong>unless the minister reasonably believes that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security </strong>within the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d.</p> <p>Now, who is on this panel? The legislation says the commonwealth\u2019s chief medical officer, the surgeon general of Australian Border Force, the chief medical officer of the Home Affairs department, and not less than six other members, including people nominated by the AMA, the college of psychiatrists, the college of physicians and one specialist in paediatric health.<br></p> <p><strong>So, to summarise:</strong><br></p> <p>* Doctors can recommend medical transfers.<br></p> <p>* The minister can then refuse a transfer on two grounds, one general (I don\u2019t agree) and one specific (security grounds).<br></p> <p>* If the refusal falls in the \u2018I don\u2019t agree\u2019 category, then it goes to a medical panel comprised of the CMO, the surgeon general of border force and other specialists.<br></p> <p>* If the panel says the transfer should proceed on medical grounds, then that overrides the minister, except if there is a negative security assessment on the individual.<br></p> <p>You\u2019re welcome.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-11T00:09:52.619Z\">at 12.09am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c60b701e4b00ef6acc6b6c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-10T23:50:18.188Z\">11.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking to Sky News, Dr <strong>Paul Bauert </strong>explained the doctors concerns:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The longer these people are there, the worse they are getting.

This is about whether people who we have responsibility for, who we\u2019re to look after, if they\u2019re sick and need medical care, whether they should get access to that? Our view is yes.</p> <p>I think that the Australian people understand that and their answer to that is yes as well. And what the government has done on this legislation, frankly, is not tell the truth. Because the legislation, yes, says that two doctors may make a recommendation, but that\u2019s subject to ministerial approval.</p> <p>The minister can then refer it to a panel which includes people who the minister himself, Mr Dutton, has appointed to that point. And they will make a final determination, except for, of course, the minister also has discretion on national security grounds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yesterday, <strong>Shayne Neumann</strong> gave comment on the bill, saying this in a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labor has always had two clear objectives \u2013 making sure sick people can get medical care, and making sure the minister has final discretion over medical transfers. </p> <p>Labor has great respect for our national security agencies and we\u2019ve always worked cooperatively with them. While the Liberals leak national security information, we listen to it. </p> <p>The Liberals have sunk to a new low by threatening to let the boats start again. They are walking, talking billboards for the people smugglers and they should be ashamed of themselves. </p> <p>Labor will never let the people smugglers back into business.</p> </blockquote> <p>So is there a compromise?</p> <p>Albanese:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have said that and we\u2019re prepared to compromise across the parliament. This should not be a partisan issue. But this is a government that doesn\u2019t look for outcomes but looks for arguments. That\u2019s one of the reasons why it is in the state that it is. It doesn\u2019t look for solutions. It has responsibility and it knows full well that almost 1,000 people have already been transferred to Australia. And the provisions in which they need medical assistance so what this is attempting to do ...</p> <p>There\u2019s an argument that the ministerial discretion is there because it\u2019s the minister who appoints the panel that will make the determination and the minister still has, under this legislation that\u2019s proposed, discretion over national security grounds. So if we need to tweak the legislation, then by all means, we should be able to do that in order to get an outcome. But I think that what Dr Phelps, in discussions that I had with her last year was very clear about, was that she was about outcomes.<strong> So if we need to tweak the legislation, by all means, let\u2019s have those discussions.\u201d</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-10T21:17:55.564Z\">at 9.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c608d2fe4b04a6f567dcd1d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-10T20:58:25.809Z\">8.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Happy New (Parliament) Year!</p> <p>I hope everyone has had a lovely break and is ready to get back into what is going to be an excruciatingly punishing year in Australian politics.

A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and all the other Guardian brains trust members who drag me and my fingers through the day. My brain gets left somewhere in the debris somewhere along the way, but they keep it motoring along. And of course, to you, for keeping us company through this marathon first day back. We really do appreciate it. Go log off and hang with your families, we\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning, but if you must, check back for the analysis and the stories in between. As always, and more than ever this year, take care of you. Scott Morrison and Marise Payne will hold a press conference at 8.45 tonight to talk about Hakeem al-Araibi. So those changes Labor wanted are endorsed, but a caucus sub-committee will look at the final wording of any deal with the crossbench. One of the sticking points \u2013 the change from 24 hours (for a minister to sign off on or reject a transfer request) to \u2018as soon as practically able\u2019 \u2013 there are some who still want a figure put on it. While we wait to learn a little bit more from the Labor caucus briefing, this has come through the twits: So now the question is \u2013 will the crossbenchers agree to the changes Labor wants to make? Because if one of them balks, it is all over. From what is coming out of the meeting, it looks as though the caucus has decided to sign off on the principles Murph spoke about earlier \u2013 but it looks like there were concerns expressed Caucus is out. This also happened today (I missed it in the insanity): Luke Henriques-Gomes was in the federal court where the AWU raids case began: Michaelia Cash\u2019s former media adviser has admitted in court that he leaked details of a federal police raid on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union but declined to say who tipped him off. A high-profile federal court trial has begun to determine the legality of Australian federal police raids on the union\u2019s Melbourne and Sydney headquarters in October 2017. On Monday, the court heard that letters and communications sent by Cash, a senator and former employment minister in the Coalition government, and her office illustrate a \u201ckeen political interest\u201d in the AWU before its offices were raided by police. The raids, which were part of an investigation by the Registered Organisations Commission, drew scrutiny because tipped-off TV crews and journalists arrived at the offices before police. Cash\u2019s former media adviser, David De Garis, told the court on Monday he learned police were set to raid the union\u2019s offices about midday on 24 October. Asked who told him about the upcoming raids, De Garis replied: \u201cI respectfully decline to answer that question on the grounds it may incriminate me.\u201d Meanwhile, the Labor caucus meeting still hasn\u2019t got to the medical evacuation bill. Wayne Hay is the senior correspondent for Al Jazeera: Just on Christopher Pyne\u2019s tweet, a quick search shows that, well, this did go on in the 43rd parliament. As the Conversation reported at the time: The decision last month by Opposition Leader Tony Abbott to severely restrict the practice of \u201cpairing\u201d votes in Parliament is another demonstration of the fractious and polarised state of federal politics since the 2010 election. ...In the current 43rd parliament, the government has rejected only one out of 27 requests by the Opposition for pairs, while the Opposition has rejected 60 out 185 Government requests.\u201d There was also that time Tony Abbott backed out of an agreement to pair the Speaker in 2011, despite originally agreeing to the move. Christopher Pyne has responded to Labor\u2019s announcement pairs will be cancelled when absolute majority vote is occurring: Labor is still in caucus. We\u2019ll let you know what is happening, as soon as we know. Mike Bowers was at the Last Post ceremony and caught the leaders in a somewhat candid moment. Just a reminder that Labor\u2019s position there is not yet set \u2013 it still has to be signed off on by caucus, which won\u2019t meet until 6pm. Labor has been locked in talks all day to reach a position on this impasse. The talks are ongoing. At the moment three principles have been resolved. The first is broadening the scope of ministerial discretion to ensure that people who have committed serious crimes can be rejected if they are recommended for medical transfer. The second is relaxing the timeframes specified in the current bill. Some timeframes for decision making are within 24 hours. The third is ensuring these arrangements only apply to the current cohort, not to any new boat arrivals. As I said, meetings are ongoing, and it\u2019s unclear whether key crossbenchers would cop any or all of this, assuming the caucus does. Applications for citizenship \u201chave not been processed efficiently by the Department of Home Affairs\u201d, according to a scathing auditor general report, released on Monday. The report found the department is missing its old target of making 80% of decisions within 80 days, with just 15% meeting that deadline in 2017-18. Instead, the department has abolished the target and not announced a replacement. The auditor general noted there was \u201ca long delay before substantive processing of the applications received from 20 April 2017\u201d when the government announced reforms to tighten the rules for gaining Australian citizenship and this \u201cnegatively impacted processing times\u201d. Those reforms were blocked by the Senate. Over the past four years applications lodged increased by 25% to 240,000, decisions decreased by 47% to 100,000 and cases awaiting decisions soared by 771% to 245,000. Home affairs also failed to check the quality of the decisions taken to approve or refuse Australian citizenship in 2017\u201318, despite committing to check 2% of decisions. The department responded rejecting the claim applications were not processed efficiently and refusing to prioritise speed over \u201cnational security and community safety\u201d. The auditor general responded that time blowouts were in fact caused by \u201clong delays ... evident between applications being lodged and decisions being taken on whether or not to confer citizenship, along with significant periods of inactivity\u201d. The department rejected the auditor general\u2019s recommendation that it publish statistics on the time taken to decide citizenship applications, warning this would \u201cnot be meaningful\u201d because individual cases vary. For those wondering, beyond Labor supporting the amended medical evacuation bill in the Senate, this is what the party decided on at the conference late last year: 339. Labor recognises that successive Coalition Governments have failed to negotiate viable and timely regional resettlement arrangements, which has left refugees and asylum seekers including children languishing in indefinite detention. Labor believes that whilst these arrangements are negotiated, the Australian Government is not absolved of its obligation to provide appropriate health, security, and welfare services to asylum seekers. Labor will: Work to negotiate on, and agree to, regional resettlement arrangements and resettle eligible refugees as a priority; Continue to support the United States Refugee Resettlement Agreement and accept New Zealand\u2019s generous offer to resettle refugees by negotiating an agreement on similar terms as the United States Agreement; and Ensure appropriate health, security, and welfare services for asylum seekers; and Improve the medical transfer process, establish an Independent Health Advice Panel to provide medical advice and maintain ministerial discretion in all decision making Earlier today I stepped you through what the medical transfers legislation says rather than relying on the high velocity political bollocks of the past week or so. Now, here is my account of a brief from the home affairs department that was leaked selectively to some news outlets last week. That leak is now the subject of a police investigation. The government has now released a redacted version of the home affairs brief. The first thing to note is it is not a classified brief (as at least one outlet suggested). It\u2019s status is \u201cprotected, sensitive, legal\u201d. News reports of this brief suggested that security agencies had warned the floodgates would be opened on border protection if the parliament ultimately passes the medical transfer legislation. Well, sort of. There are a lot of contentions in the advice, and some of them are hedged. Officials argue the current ministerial discretion in the bill to reject people cleared for medical transfer on security grounds isn\u2019t wide enough. Consistent with the culture of the home affairs department, the briefers also clearly object to doctors being decision-makers. The officials say a lot of doctors don\u2019t like offshore detention, ipso facto: \u201cMany doctors in Australia and their professional associations have called for an end to regional processing and it is expected that their recommendations under these amendments would be forthcoming in a short period.\u201d \u201cIt is expected that within four weeks of Royal Assent, should the bill pass the House of Representatives, that most of the 1,000 individuals would be in contact with \u2018treating doctors\u2019 willing to recommend their transfer to Australia for at least medical assessment if not treatment. The fact that treatment is available in PNG, Taiwan or Nauru would not restrict the recommendations by treating doctors to transfer. The individual would not be required to accept treatment in their regional processing country or another location that is not Australia\u201d. \u201cSome doctors have publically [sic] asserted that all transferees should be removed from Nauru and PNG for mental health reasons. Provided those doctors are appropriately registered or licensed and have \u2018assessed\u2019 transferees either remotely or in person, it will be open to him or her to form the opinion that any or all of the transferees are \u2018relevant transitory persons\u2019 and give the secretary notice of this, triggering the provisions in the amendments.\u201d A contention, unless I\u2019m not mistaken. Doctors. Gotta watch them. Always up to something. Moving on, the briefers note something the government hasn\u2019t exactly highlighted. \u201cOn transfer to Australia, the individuals would be detained under the Migration Act 1958 (Migration Act) and placed in held detention or in community detention by way of a residence determination\u201d. So this isn\u2019t quite \u201ctwo doctors say you can come to Australia, and freedom beckons\u201d, as a number of government frontbenchers have suggested during the past few hyperbolic days. It\u2019s come to Australia (maybe, if you meet the criteria) and get detained again. Despite the brief confirming medical transferees would continue to be detained, this is framed by the authors as a problem. \u201cPlacing up to 1,000 people in held detention will put pressure on the detention network and with risk assessments, some, but not all, may be suitable for community detention. Those not suitable for community detention would be placed in held detention, likely necessitating the stand-up of the Christmas Island facility and removing our hot contingency fall back for Operation Sovereign Borders.\u201d The briefers worry word will get back to the people smugglers. \u201cThis path to Australia will likely reach people smugglers in a short period and they could rightly advise their clients that if they were sent at a future time to a regional processing location, they would only need to stay long enough to seek the recommendations of \u2018treating doctors\u2019 for transfer to Australia.\u201d \u201cWe expect that this may encourage those prospective clients of people smugglers who, to date, have not decided to travel due to the dissuasion of returns, turnbacks and regional processing. This bill removes the third pillar \u2013 regional processing.\u201d Sounds bad, but several paragraphs later, the advice becomes more hedged. After noting the softening in Australia will feed in to marketing by people smugglers, the story becomes more complicated. \u201cAlthough people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in Potential Illegal Immigrant (PII) intent \u2014 not smuggler marketing.\u201d \u201cPIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a Western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention. \u201cHowever, PIIs will probably remain sceptical of smuggler marketing and await proof that such a pathway is viable, or that an actual change of policy has occurred, before committing to ventures\u201d. We are waiting to find out (with everyone else) where Labor lands on the medical evacuation bill, so bear with us. Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten are attending the Last Post ceremony at the Australian War Memorial, a tradition before the start of the parliamentary year. Tomorrow morning, they will both attend a church service before heading into parliament, another tradition. Then the bear pit officially reopens. This is a little awkward (as reported by Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy): The prominent economist and Reserve Bank board member Ian Harper has warned the Morrison government against pursuing its controversial \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation, declaring \u201coverreach\u201d in Australia\u2019s energy sector would likely be harmful. Harper, who was appointed by the Coalition to review Australia\u2019s competition policy and serve on the central bank board, has used a submission to a parliamentary inquiry to warn the Morrison government against pursuing special sanctions for the energy sector. Harper\u2019s competition policy inquiry recommended changes to the misuse of market power provisions in Australian trade practices law, but did not recommend a divestiture power because it was considered unnecessary and undesirable. The prominent economist and dean of the Melbourne Business School says in his submission to the inquiry that divestiture powers \u2013 which are being proposed in the so-called \u201cbig stick\u201d package \u2013 were avoided in his review because \u201cthey are unpredictable in their impact and may even be counterproductive if the segregated entities prove to be commercially unviable, potentially leaving the market less competitive after forced divestiture than it was beforehand\u201d. Tim Storer also says he would vote (in the Senate) to extend the sitting calendar, to include a sitting in March. The government seem pretty confident of having headed that prospect off in the House though, and not necessarily because of Bob Katter. So someone on the crossbench is blinking. Tim Storer is having a chat to David Speers on Sky about the potential of Labor walking away from the medical evacuation bill. He \u201curges\u201d the Labor party not to u-turn, and says it is an \u201cappropriate\u201d amendment. But he says he would look at any compromise. David Leyonhjelm is walking away from the federal parliament for a shot at the NSW parliament. He has launched a farewell tour (from his release): The first libertarian elected to the Australian parliament, Senator David Leyonhjelm, will speak for the last time in the chamber this week, ahead of his New South Wales election tilt. The Liberal Democrats senator, who was elected in 2013 and re-elected in 2016, will give his valedictory speech on Wednesday from 5pm. In it, he will offer some insight into the important role he played as a crossbencher, while lamenting the lack of principles of other political parties. \u2018In my first speech, I promised to the Australian people that I would never vote for a reduction in liberty or an increase in taxes, and I am proud to say I have held true to that promise,\u2019 Senator Leyonhjelm said. \u2018Of course, out of the nine crossbench Senators elected in 2013, I am the only one that has remained and survived the turbulent times,\u2019 he said. \u2018And since I was elected, my party, the Liberal Democrats, has increased its representation fourfold: from just me, to one in WA and two in Victoria \u2014 not including our representatives at the council level. \u2018Our saying that libertarians are plotting to take over the world and leave everyone alone is coming along swimmingly. \u2018While this might be my federal farewell tour, I am not quitting politics \u2014 at least, that\u2019s not the plan. Red tape and the nanny state remain the two issues I am passionate about, and I can make more of a difference to these state-based problems if I am elected in NSW on March 23.\u2019 Senator Leyonhjelm will return to Canberra this week for the sitting week and a Senate committee hearing into his free speech bills, along with next week for a final grilling of public servants in Additional Estimates. A Senate inquiry into the Coalition\u2019s planned crackdown on the R&amp;D tax incentive has recommended the policy be shelved over concerns it could stifle innovation. Then treasurer Scott Morrison announced he would tighten access to the R&amp;D tax incentive in last year\u2019s budget, saying the government would no longer be signing \u201cblank cheques\u201d to business. It\u2019s a big deal. The payments account for one-third of all government spending on science and innovation. A new \u201cintensity test\u2019 would be introduced for larger companies to favour higher, more intensive R&amp;D investment, and compliance and enforcement measures would be ramped up significantly. The measure would save the government $2.4bn. But a Senate inquiry has heard evidence from a range of businesses and research groups that the policy would threaten innovation and create uncertainty. The inquiry on Monday recommended that: \u201cOn the weight of evidence presented, the committee considers that the bill should not proceed until there is further consideration of the R&amp;D tax incentive measures.\u201d The R&amp;D incentive crackdown is attached to an omnibus bill that also includes measures to stamp out tax avoidance. That included amendments to prevent companies from loading up debt artificially to shift profits and avoid tax. The inquiry recommended the government proceed on all other parts of the bill. I know he has a few fans here, so here you go: Reading through that question and answer section of the Scott Morrison press club address, there was a lot going on, including this: We can\u2019t just focus on terrorism and allow our women to be abused. Could have done without the \u201cour\u201d there, I think. I\u2019m told that the full shadow ministry is due to meet to discuss the medical evacuation bill nowish. The Labor shadow cabinet is going to meet to talk about what to do with the information from the security briefing on the medical evacuation bill. And of course, individual factional caucuses will meet as well. We won\u2019t have an answer on where Labor lands on this, until later tonight. Death-to-dixers get democratised. Or that\u2019s what I\u2019m taking from Tim Storer\u2019s decision to crowdsource his questions to the government for Senate question time from his South Australian constituents. From Storer: When I first entered parliament, I spoke about the need for politicians to do better to bring the people into the parliamentary process. In the internet age, there is no reason for voters to only have their say on polling day. That is why, going forward, I\u2019ll be asking the South Australian people to choose the topic on which I will ask the government questions during Senate question time. Voting is now open on my website to select the topic I will ask the government a question on this Thursday 14 February. So far, 800 people have participated in the poll, which has been a fantastic response. Voting closes on Wednesday at 5pm ACDT. I will select future topic options based on feedback from the South Australian community on the issues that are of most pressing concern to them. I will also be adding a \u2018free text\u2019 box for future polls, so voters can suggest additional topics that are not listed. It\u2019s time to modernise our democracy and give the people we represent more say in what we politicians do in Canberra. Bill Shorten\u2019s office has confirmed he will be meeting with the family of Hakeem al-Araibi on Wednesday. From the release: Labor reiterates our call on Thailand to release Hakeem al-Araibi and return him to his family in Australia. We remain deeply concerned by Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s ongoing detention in Thailand and the continuing threat of his extradition to Bahrain. Senator Wong has raised Hakeem\u2019s case directly with the ambassador of Thailand and called for his release and return to Australia. Labor also urges the prime minister of Thailand to exercise executive discretion in this case \u2013 a discretion that both Thailand\u2019s office of the attorney general and the prosecutor have confirmed is allowed under Thailand\u2019s Extradition Act. Thailand is a good friend of Australia\u2019s. We are confident the Thai people and Government understand the concern so many Australians have for the welfare of a person to whom we have offered sanctuary, and permanent residency. We wish to thank all those showing their support for Hakeem, including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, other governments, Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s local community in Melbourne and in particular Mr Craig Foster, the Football Federation of Australia, and the broader football community. How Mike Bowers saw the speech: As the prime minister hammers home his message about national security, the Guardian has revealed that 17 Australian residents are believed to be under house arrest, in prison or detained in China\u2019s secretive \u201cre-education\u201d centres in Xinjiang. The 17 cases \u2013 15 Australian permanent residents and two on spouse visas \u2013 have been collected by Nurgul Sawut, an advocate for Uighurs in Australia through interviews with their family members. Sawut says the Australian Uighur community feel \u201clet down\u201d by the Australian government, which they believe is sitting on its hands, despite many of the 17 having lived in Australia for years and having children or spouses who are Australian citizens. \u201cThe language [Dfat] is using is very dire. The Australian government is basically saying we can\u2019t do anything right now,\u201d said Sawut. \u201cThey say, \u2018we are talking to our Chinese counterparts\u2019. What does that mean exactly? When I met Dfat in December, I said, \u2018that\u2019s not a good enough answer for us. As an Australian embassy you need to do more to locate these people, to tell us if they\u2019re alive or dead\u2019.\u201d Penny Wong, Labor\u2019s spokeswoman on foreign affairs, said her party was \u201cparticularly concerned\u201d by reports of Uighurs who were Australian residents being detained. She said: \u201cEngagement with China is very important to Australia but, as with any other country, it never means we abandon our values, or our sovereignty.\u201d While you all percolate on that last hour and a bit, Linda Burney, the first Aboriginal woman elected to the House of Representatives, will have her portrait unveiled on Wednesday. It\u2019s to hang in Parliament House. From the release: Created by award-winning artist Jude Rae, the portrait was commissioned by the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) for Parliament\u2019s Historic Memorials Collection. The Historic Memorials Collection, Australia\u2019s longest-running art commissioning program, was founded by prime minister Andrew Fisher in 1911, on the recommendation of artist Tom Roberts. Since then, it has commissioned portraits of the head of state, governors-general, prime ministers, speakers and presidents. On occasion, as is the case with Ms Burney, the committee will commission a one-off portrait of senators and members whose election represents a significant milestone in the history of the Australian parliament. That was the last question. Question: You\u2019ve recently been to Townsville and Tasmania to comfort and support Australians suffering from wildfires and unprecedented inundation and flooding. Now, insurance actuaries are constantly revising risk assessment and are now factoring in climate change as an exacerbating factor in the higher frequencies of extreme weather events. Do you acknowledge that climate change is now the major factor in more frequent extreme weather events, and if you do, doesn\u2019t that mean that Australia\u2019s national disaster response needs a greater national coordination than what you\u2019ve been able to announce under the national security umbrella that you\u2019ve canvassed today? Morrison: I don\u2019t know if I agree with your reasoning. We have a clear commitment to reduce emissions to 26% by 2030. So that is our response. We are taking action on climate change. We do have a response in place to address the very real threats of climate change that you\u2019ve articulated. That\u2019s part of our government\u2019s plan to do exactly that and right now, in the middle of the fires in Tasmania and the floods in Queensland, they\u2019re not just fires in Tasmania. As we know, in Victoria and Western Australia and other parts of the country \u2013 this is happening at a time when we\u2019ve met the commitments that we have already set forward this time. So the actions that we\u2019ve taken to address climate change have been taken and we are meeting the commitments we\u2019ve made up until right now when these very even vents that you speak of are occurring. So my answer to that is \u2013 we will continue to take action, just as we I acknowledge it\u2019s a factor \u2013 just as we have. I acknowledge it\u2019s a factor. Of course it is. Australians do. The vast majority of Australians. But the issue is how you achieve it. We believe you need sensible, achievable targets to address climate change, and we have them and we\u2019re achieving them. What we disagree with is having reckless target that is shut down your economy and take people\u2019s jobs, which is what Labor propose. Their target requires an emissions reduction roughly three times what we still have to achieve by 2030. Now, if you think that the aluminium smelter is still going to be open under Labor\u2019s plan, you\u2019re kidding yourself. It won\u2019t be. So you have real targets that is you meet with a plan to meet them. That\u2019s our policy on climate change. Or you have reckless targets that shut down the economy and cost Australians their jobs and their livelihoods. That\u2019s Labor\u2019s plan. And it brings me back to the same point I\u2019ve been making all day \u2013 under my government, Australia will be stronger. Under Bill Shorten\u2019s Labor government, Australia will be weaker. Question: A lot of Australians are asking when it comes to border security why can\u2019t they [our policy] be both safe and humane why does it have to be a choice between one or the other? Morrison: We are being safe and we are being humane, I don\u2019t agree with that assessment. The Australian government will run the borders, and our government, that is how we will always be under our government. Over 7,000 women, and children, have come under our official women at risk program, because we have secured the borders. That wasn\u2019t happening before we came to government in 2013, not in those numbers. One of the first things I did as immigration minister and has been followed on by Peter and from David \u2013 making sure people who really need the help can get it. That\u2019s what we have been delivering. The reason we have put in our transparency and assurance process is to demonstrate to Australians the medical care is provided. It is provided. I know there will be some who will come in not know what the circumstances are, there will be advocates making claims and they will do all those sorts of things but there is a reason ministers make these decisions and governments make them, because we understand our border responsibilities, I don\u2019t respect those with more narrow responsibilities in the area I respect them absolutely and the motivations, our responsibilities are broader than that, and under my government, we will run the borders. Question: There\u2019s been a fair bit of speculation about exactly what date the election will be. Do you rule out 25 May? Morrison: Have you got your pen ready? Are you ready? I was almost tempted to tell you the other day when Michael and I were going out to swear in the assistant minister. I was going to text you and say \u2013 I\u2019m on my way to Yarralumla. I thought it was funnier than that, actually! Gosh, cheer up! The election will be after the budget. Question: Hakeem al-Araibi is in a Thai prison. We can blame Bahrain or Thailand for not taking them. How much responsibility can we take and what responsibilities have you taken to ensure that no other Australians end up in that situation? Morrison: I\u2019m not at liberty to go to the last part of the question because of what it relates to. But what I can tell you \u2013 the only thing I\u2019m concerned about right now is getting him home. I want to get Hakeem al-Araibi home. I know that Marise Payne has been working with her consulate and others from Dfat. And our Australians of the year, the number of people, the international sports community, others, have been making this case. But they\u2019ve been making it respectfully, been making it carefully and I will continue to do that as well. It\u2019s not my job to get upset \u2013 it\u2019s my job to get him home and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards and we will keep doing that. But I would ask Australians, who I know desperately want to see him come home, that we have to manage this carefully. We have to be patient. It\u2019s not a straight up and down issue. I know it looks like one. Most issues do. But you know, to solve them requires a lot more patience and a lot more diligence, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re applying to this. He\u2019s getting a lot of great consular support from friends and I thank all of those who have been providing that support. But we will continue to work this issue with our partners. We will continue to engage with the Thai government, as we\u2019ve been doing constantly, as well as we have with the governor of Bahrain. And it is within the executive authority of the Thai prime minister to enable him to be returned and we will continue to work towards that end. Question: Thank you for making that to the mortgage brokers of Australia. When you and Senator Reynolds visited Townsville, they rang the insurance brokers there, but then rang the mortgage brokers. Can you tell the mortgage brokers of Australia the sense that you give them about their future and they\u2019re deeply concerned about the capacity to serve their clients, which they\u2019ll do? Can you clarify today and I know that Treasurer Frydenberg will look at the $2.7bn received in that, so if you could talk to the mortgage brokers of Australia. Morrison: The mortgage brokers understand, with at cautious way we\u2019ve responded to the report, that we understand the important role that they play in the community. And I\u2019ve already said that. Yes, the royal commission has recommended some changes that will need to be absorbed over time and they can be absorbed if they\u2019re done in consultation. But I want to see as many mortgage brokers in this country, five years from now, in fact, more than there are today. I don\u2019t want to see this sector wither on the vine and be strangled by regulation that would throw them out of business, but more importantly, would deny choice and competition in the banking system. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learnt from this process is that we need more competition. We need more options. We need more choices. Not fewer. And that\u2019s what I am concerned about and treasurer and I are concerned about in terms of how we would go forward on that one recommendation. So they have my pledge that I get how important they are to Australia and Australian families and Australians who want to buy a home and we will work closely with them to ensure that we deal with the things that we need to deal with and many of those mortgage brokers have told us that there are things that they need to deal with, and that\u2019s fine. But we\u2019ll do it in a partnership way which makes the sector stronger, not weaker. Question: Prime minister, can I come back to the theme of today\u2019s speech - security? You did cover a lot of different threats facing Australia. Some of these threats have changed over the years. The threat of Isis, the threat of cyber security and the threat of big power rivalry as well. Can I go to big priorities here? What is the biggest threat facing Australia today? Morrison: It\u2019s not as simple as that, David. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve outlined all of them. I mean, governments can\u2019t just pick one. We can\u2019t just focus on terrorism and allow our women to be abused. We can\u2019t just focus on that and allow our region to become unstable. You know, governments have to deal with multiple challenges all the time and you need to understand what they are and you need to plan to deal with all of them, and that\u2019s what my plan does today. I think they\u2019re all critical and right now, what am I spending most of my time on today? Outside of this room? The north Queensland floods and working with our team up there. Next week, it may be something completely different. A couple of weeks back, I was up there in the Pacific making sure that we were working through our step-up program. So prime ministers have to work across all of these things all the time and that\u2019s what my commitment is, because as I said, that\u2019s what I understand is my responsibility to the Australian people, to keep them safe and secure. Question: You\u2019ve mentioned in your speech today, a number of serious threats to nation states and you also dealt on the subject of trust, where there\u2019s one dimension of trust that I want to put to you directly. To be direct, a lot of Australian voters think that politicians tell lies. They stand at podiums like the one you\u2019re standing at and they tell lies. Do you accept any responsibility, as prime minister, for the state of the discourse? Do you accept that you need to be factual in how you respond to issues and what you say about things? And if the answer to that question is yes - then why are so many of your frontbenchers misrepresenting the basic facts that are in the medical transfers bill? How does that behaviour within five minutes of an election, we can all see it \u2013 how does that rebuild public trust in institutions? Morrison: I don\u2019t agree, with great respect, with your assessment, in terms of the conduct of my colleagues. What I and my colleagues have been doing \u2013 in fact, that\u2019s why I declassified the Home Affairs advice so people could read it for themselves. It\u2019s out there. You can read it for yourself. The warning is very clear. I think that\u2019s very consistent with the type of behaviour that you\u2019re asking from me, to ensure that there\u2019s a very clear ... I mean, how many times \u2013 you have have been around the town a long time, Katharine, how many times have you seen a prime minister declassify that type of advice and show it to the country. It\u2019s a shame that it took Bill five days to respond to that. And as Mathias Cormann reminded me this morning, when Labor voted for this bill in the Senate last year, they didn\u2019t even get a security brief onning this. You see, my great ... disappointment, and it\u2019s not a strong enough word. What I and other ministers have gone through to restore Australia\u2019s borders ... I lived through those horrible years when the bodies were piling up and I vowed to myself when I came to government when Tony was prime minister that we were never, ever going to allow this to happen again. And what is happening in our Australian parliament right now, it may be entirely well motivated. I\u2019m not making any judgements about people\u2019s motivations here. In fact, quite the opposite. But what I am doing is \u2013 they do not know what they\u2019re playing with. They have no idea of the consequences of what they are playing with. And they will unleash a world of woe again. How do I know? I\u2019ve seen it before. And I never, ever want to see it again. So, I\u2019m not going to step back from calling it as tough and as straight as I can. If Bill Shorten allows that bill to pass in any way, shape or form, that\u2019s the test. That\u2019s the only test going on the parliament this week. It\u2019s not who wins or loses a vote. The only test is \u2013 will Bill Shorten cave in and undermine our border protection by passing this bill in my form? And if he does, Australians have only been able to confirm what they already know about him. Question: Now that all of the evidence is in, could you want to see anybody from the banking and financial services sector go to jail? Morrison: Well, in this country, it\u2019s courts that are going to determine that, Mark. That\u2019s how it works. And everyone should face responsibility for their actions and be accountable for what they\u2019ve done and matters have been referred off for those, cases to Asic and the others to take forward, and they\u2019ll be pursued and they\u2019ll end up in court, I have no doubt, and then courts will decide. But what I do believe is that all of them have to be accountable for their actions. So, what can I do about that? You know, I don\u2019t run the courts. But I can introduce a piece of legislation called the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which, for the first time in this country, made senior bank executives accountable, directly and personally, for the decision that is they make, whether they\u2019re criminal or not, whether they have a negative impact in a serious way against Australians and small and family businesses all around the country, and that legislation enables Apra to run them out of town so they can\u2019t go and work in another bank and do the same thing again. I can set up the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which Kelly did when she was in the portfolio previous to this one, and I can make sure that they can take cases going back ten years now, over the same course that the royal commission was looking at so they can get access to their justice too. And that\u2019s happening now as we speak. So there are a lot of actions I can take to ensure people face accountability and face justice and we\u2019re taking those actions. I\u2019ve got to say, one of the things I was most pleased to be involved with, with Kelly when she was minister for financial services was getting Dan Cronin on board. We\u2019d already acted on that before that. We did think that Asic needed to pony up a lot more on this, and you know, go to the line \u2013 take these things to court, and Dan Cronin is a very good litigator and I\u2019m sure will be doing an excellent job. So yes, I want to see people face consequences for their actions. Question: You generously listed all of the measures that you\u2019ve been acting on. You called it your plan. You missed one important thing \u2013 a few days ago, presumably a foreign actor was snooping in the parliamentary computers, perhaps looking at your emails or Bill Shorten\u2019s emails. Can you tell us what specific measures you have asked for ahead of the federal election to ensure that whatever it is that he this found in the day or so that they were snooping in your computer, in Bill Shorten\u2019s computer, that it is not used for foreign interference in our democracy, which is also an important subject for security? Morrison: Sure. Thank you, Andrew. What I can tell you is that the government is taking all necessary actions to ensure the security of all of these assets. I wouldn\u2019t be disclosing what those actions are here, because frankly, that\u2019s disclosure and a discussion that only takes place at the national security committee. So that would not be appropriate for me to set that out here. This is the focus of an ongoing assessment and we will be responding directly to those assessments with the security agencies and taking them up on their recommendations. Question: Could I ask you about a factual matter? You and your ministers repeatedly say and you said again today, that Labor did nothing on financial reform, and yet, Labor did pass FOFO legislation, which the Coalition sought to unravel. Can you say what it is there, but it doesn\u2019t seem to square with what happened. Morrison: I must have found their performance underwhelming, and I still find their performance very underwhelming and I still find it underwhelming, but what I want to do now is look at what they\u2019re going to do to mortgage brokers. I was puzzled by Labor\u2019s response to the royal commission when they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll agree to all of the recommendations before we\u2019ve seen them.\u201d Reminds me of Bill Shorten\u2019s famous interview with David Speers agreeing with everything that Julia Gillard said before she said it or heard it. I think that that was unwise for the Labor party to do. I think, I commend the royal commission for the outstanding work that they do. But they wouldn\u2019t expect a government to just sight unseen all of the recommendations. I never understood them doing that. And now they find themselves boxed in. We have the Productivity Commission report on mortgage brokers which basically says \u2013 if you start turning that industry on its head, you just hand the power back to the banks. Now, I don\u2019t see how that achieve our objective, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been extremely cautious on that point, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not surprised that mortgage brokers are very angry with the Labor party. I mean, these are tens of thousands of small and family businesses that help mums and dads get a good deal on their mortgage and so they don\u2019t have to just face the banks themselves. It\u2019s pretty important service. We want to make sure that Australians can still have access to that service. Now, what Bill Shorten is going to do, who knows. He still hasn\u2019t responded to the royal commission report. (Labor has said it agrees, in-principle, with all the banking royal commission recommendations) Question: If I could just take you back to national security and border protection. You said in your speech that you had no plans to change something that worked. I think you said, \u201cnot one jot\u201d. At the moment, it seems that Labor is recalibrating its position on the refugee medivac bill. Are you actually prepared to consider amendments to refugee transfers, giving the minister the discretion and the power, complete discretion and control over this process? Will you hold the line in your opposition to any amendments, I guess particularly given the advice is that the passage of this bill also risks recommencing the people smuggling trade? Morrison: Let me start by saying this - the minister today has those powers and responsibilities. It already exists. I don\u2019t need to give them those powers. They already have them. This bill is unnecessary. It\u2019s superfluous. It adds nothing to border protection and therefore, its passage in any form takes us backwards. You don\u2019t need this bill to ensure that Australia has control of its borders. We already do. See, this is the problem with Bill Shorten on national security or borders or anything else. He thinks it\u2019s something you trade on. He says \u2013 oh, let\u2019s find the middle ground. No, no, I\u2019m going to stand on the right ground. You want to join me on the right ground, you\u2019re welcome. But I\u2019m not going to find a middle ground. You can split the difference on 1,200 deaths. You can\u2019t split the difference on 50,000. What, we\u2019ll settle on 25,000? No. On national security, on border protection, these things are absolutes \u2013 and Labor never gets this. They think that there\u2019s some sort of a slide rule that applies to this, that there\u2019s a continuum and you just pick your point to balance left and right. And we saw Anthony Albanese out there this morning. He seems to have a different position to Bill Shorten this morning. A very different position. So I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going. But what I do know is this \u2013 I don\u2019t trade on national security but Bill Shorten clearly is indicating that that\u2019s what he\u2019d do, and I don\u2019t think that makes Australia stronger, I think it makes Australia weaker under Bill Shorten. Question: Just to follow up on your answer just then. I guess one thing that voters could say is that what we\u2019ve seen in the recent months is a lot of contradictions within the Liberal party on climate change and on energy policy. So to follow up on Sheradyn\u2019s question \u2013 how can you give voters an assurance that you\u2019ll have a settled policy on energy in the next term of parliament, given the divisions within the Liberal party? Morrison: Well, we\u2019ve already announced quite a bit of policy in that area and there will be more policy announced between now and the next election. But what is the test of whether a policy is working? The goal you set for it. The goal we set with our emissions reduction policy was that. We would meet Kyoto 1. We\u2019ll meet Kyoto 2. We smashed Kyoto 1. Kyoto 2 we will smash as well and as I said to you, 2030, our target of 26%, we will meet in a canter and I\u2019ll be announcing further upgrades and details of our policy between here and the next election which will determine that result as well. So what we do in the Liberal party is we say what we\u2019re going to do and what we\u2019re going to achieve. We said we\u2019re going to create one million jobs. We\u2019ll have an economic plan to do that through lower taxes and supporting family businesses and infrastructure and doing all that. And we did it. We said we were going to turn back boats, establish regional processing and make it work properly and restore temporary protection visas and stop the boats and end the deaths, and we did all that. So, we do what we say we\u2019re going to do and we get the results we say we\u2019re going to get. Now, the same is true on climate. We said we would beat Kyoto 1 and 2. We said through the Emissions Reduction Fund, we would achieve that. And I\u2019m telling you, our policies will hit the targets going forward. And we\u2019ll do it because we know it is the right thing to do and we have a plan to get there. The reason I announced our economic plan two weeks ago and the security plan today is to make it clear that I\u2019m not just asking Australians to vote for us on our record \u2013 as strong as it is \u2013 I\u2019m asking Australians to vote for us because we\u2019ve got the plan to take us forward and to keep us going. We have a future plan and it\u2019s a passionate plan. I can tell you, I\u2019m pumped-as on this plan because I know it\u2019s going to make Australia stronger, not weaker. Question: You gave some statistics there, but one of the things that they gave was the number of prime ministers that there has been since the Coalition came to government. Picking up on Chris\u2019s question before \u2013 how can you promise voters, hand on heart, here today, that the announcements that you are making and in the upcoming budget, are things that will actually be implemented should your government be re-elected? Morrison: Well, we dealt with that last year. The party room made a historical decision regarding the support of prime ministers who are re-elected. So that\u2019s for the history books. That\u2019s already on the record. But let me tell you a story. I think there\u2019s a great myth that is going around about what happened in 2013. The Labor party had quite a few prime ministers, that\u2019s true \u2013 and they weren\u2019t very good! We\u2019ve had three good ones, I would argue! What happened in 2013 was that the Labor party were thrown out because they were a very bad government. They had manifestly stuffed it on so many points, it was embarrassing. Now, people can rightly say that we\u2019ve had three prime ministers \u2013 that is true. What they cannot say is that we\u2019ve mismanaged the finances. They cannot say that we\u2019ve mismanaged the budget or the economy. They cannot say that we\u2019ve mishandled the borders or failed to invest in the defence forces or secure our position in the Pacific and the broader Indo-Pacific region. They can\u2019t say we haven\u2019t worked with state and territories to bring about record funding for schools and hospitals and they cannot say, as Greg Hunt will remind you on every occasion, that we have got record listings of pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceuticals benefits scheme. And why? Because we know how to run a budget and have a great economy. The great myth of the 2013 election was that Labor was thrown out only because they had too many prime ministers. They were thrown out because they were a joke in government and they will be again. And let me tell you why \u2013 they have learned nothing. Absolutely nothing. Question: This week, Labor intends to move a motion seeking a majority of 76 votes to force a recall of the parliament in March. Just dealing with some of [commissioner Kenneth] Hayne\u2019s recommendations [into the banking industry]. Pivotal to that is the vote of Bob Katter, who is open to it \u2013 not ruling it out. If he were to support that motion, would that cancel that deal you did with him last year to give him $234m in water infrastructure for his electorate so long as he voted with the minority government? Morrison: Well, there\u2019s a lot in that question, Phil! But let me tell you about some things which are facts. What is a fact is that there are 40 recommendations that require legislation. What is a fact is that we currently have bills already sitting in the Senate and in the House which can be actioned, right now, this week. In fact, I remember when I introduced the banking executive accountability regime into the parliament and when I brought the bank levy into the parliament \u2013 you know who tried to slow it down? The Labor party. The Labor party tried to slow it down. So this is what it is. You cannot go and put together what is at least 40 pieces of legislation, or thereabouts, scramble it together in a couple of weeks, throw it into a feverish sitting of the Australian parliament just before the election and then be surprised at the result that you think that you might get on the other side. I would call that type of financial legislation \u2013 reckless. The fact that Bill Shorten, as a former financial services minister and an assistant treasurer, doesn\u2019t understand the complexity of these measures, the consultation that has to be undertaken \u2013 the exposure drafts that need to be made available. The unintended consequences to be identified through that process, says that this guy doesn\u2019t get it. He doesn\u2019t understand how to legislate financial services reform. Now, there\u2019s a good reason \u2013 he\u2019s never done it! They didn\u2019t do it when they were in government last time. They had Storm Financial, they had all of those. Nothing. Zip, zero! Our government has been reforming the financial services sector since the day we were elected. The financial systems inquiry started the process rolling under the Murray Review and that\u2019s continued to this day, and the treasurer has led, I think, a very comprehensive response to the royal commission in just days. We\u2019re still waiting, aren\u2019t we, Josh? I mean, they have had more time to consider their response than the government has, and we\u2019re still waiting. Still waiting. Labor doesn\u2019t know how to reform the financial sector because they never have and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s involved. The Law Council has made the same point today. We will deal with this in the prudent, measured and responsible way we always do. That\u2019s why Australians can trust us when it comes to managing our economy because we don\u2019t go and beat it with a baseball bat senselessly, without thinking through the consequences \u2013 which is what Labor wants to do. Question: On the substantive point and Phil\u2019s question, if Bob Katter votes against the Government on this, does it extinguish the water funding meal? Morrison: Too many \u201cifs\u201d in the question so I don\u2019t intend to entertain it. Question: The Liberal party has voted no confidence in its own leadership twice now. Why should the Australian people show confidence in this government in May? Morrison: Over one million jobs with 1.25m jobs to come. Restoring the nation\u2019s finances, which has taken 5.5 years to do. Restoring our borders, rebuilding our defence forces. Keeping Australians safe. A track record of performance, but more importantly, a plan to make sure that we continue to create the strong Australia that Australians want to live in for the next decade. Make no mistake \u2013 the election is about the Australia you want to live in for the next decade. Do you want to live in a stronger Australia under my government? Or do you want to live in a weaker Australia under Bill Shorten and Labor?\u201d Question: Can you explain why the medical transfer from offshore detention of 419 people, under your government, has not rebooted the people-smuggling trade since May last year, whereas the proposed Phelps amendments would? Morrison: Gladly. We haven\u2019t changed the policy. These transfers have occurred quietly, under the existing policy. And they\u2019ve been done by the government, not by anyone else. They\u2019ve been done by our decisions. The government remains in control of our borders and the people smugglers know it, so long as this government is running the show. The problem with the bill is, it takes control from the government, the elected government, which has to take into account all the considerations that impact on the nation\u2019s interests and doesn\u2019t subcontract it out to others who don\u2019t have those same interests or responsibilities.\u201d The government has fought transfers in the court, where they are currently arguing the federal court may not have the authority to overrule its decisions. The bill does not take control of the borders out of the government\u2019s hands. For the people out the back DOCTORS WILL NOT BE DECIDING BORDER SECURITY Scott Morrison finishes his speech: So in conclusion \u2013 national security is all about making the right decisions. Because, as a government and as a prime minister, you make them every single day. You make these decisions \u2013 this is how I make them ... Based on your values. What you believe. Your instincts, your experience and when required \u2013 courage. Our government has demonstrated that we have the mettle to make the right calls on our nation\u2019s security. Repairing our borders, investing in our defence forces. Deporting violent criminals, taking on domestic violence to protect the women and children of this country. Disrupting terrorist attacks. We have led, we haven\u2019t followed. We have taken decisions rather than put them off to another day. And we have embraced tough calls rather than seeking to buy weak compromises for the purpose of politics. This is our form. Not just of our government, but as Michael McCormack knows, the deputy prime minister, the form of Liberal-National coalition governments going back 70 years. It\u2019s why we\u2019re trusted. The plan I have announced today is built on a strong record that sets out plainly what a re-elected Morrison Liberal-National government will continue to do to keep Australians safe and secure. You may notice there he had to give Michael McCormack\u2019s title. That wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with National party polling showing McCormack has zero name recognition would it? Good news for northern Queensland shires: There is a national disaster unfolding in northern Queensland. We announced that assistance on Friday and today I\u2019m announcing that my act will provide an immediate non-gratia payment of $1m to each of the affected shires. That is just something to get on and do the enormous amount of work that they need to support their communities. They raised it with me this morning. It\u2019s announced by this afternoon. This payment will be for them to use on priorities they deem most urgent \u2013 whether that be rate relief for impacted properties, infrastructure, or the disposal of cattle which have perished, which has been coordinated and also assisted by the ADF. Our disaster assistance funding to north Queensland in response to this flood is already over $100m in addition to the massive support provided by the ADF. So I want those farmers to know, up there in north Queensland \u2013 we will stand with you all the way through this disaster, but we will be standing with you on the other side as you rebuild the great prosperity that we know is there for you in the future. We will be there to rebuild with you. Scott Morrison: Across my time as immigration minister, and on Peter\u2019s watch and now on David\u2019s watch, we have cancelled the visas of the equivalent of the jail population of South Australia, Tasmania and Northern Territory combined. We have cancelled the visas of 4,150 dangerous criminals \u2013 sent them packing. In six years, Labor cancelled 643 visitors\u2019 visas. Labor were soft. We cancelled over 800 last year alone. That included 13 murderers, 34 rapists and sex offenders, 53 for domestic violence and 100 child sex offenders, punted by our government. Specifically, we\u2019ve cancelled the visas of more than 300 child sex offenders and stopped hundreds more at the border. And we have introduced an approach to strip criminals of the illegally obtained wealth, no matter which jurisdiction they operate in, which strikes at the heart of organised crime. And I particularly acknowledge Michael Keenan for his work when he was minister for those issues. We\u2019re giving the law enforcement agencies the tools to read encrypted messages that violent criminals and child sex offenders are using to evade detection, and we had to fight for it in the parliament to make sure that we got it. We\u2019re seeking to legislate that police have the appropriate powers to disrupt potential security and criminal threats at airports. Our government is taking an uncompromising approach to fighting the menace of drugs. Last financial year, the AFP and Australian Border Force seized more than 17 tonnes of drugs and precursors at the border. The AFP assisted its international counterparts to seize more than 28 tonnes of drugs and precursors offshore. All of these efforts are protecting lives being destroyed by drugs in our communities. The scourge of ice is one that I know affects communities right across Australia. Not least the families and children of ice addicts. The government has invested $450m to help these communities fight the impacts of ice, including funding for more than 220 local drug action teams. Our joined-up strategy includes international cooperation to stop drugs at the source, with enhanced intelligence sharing, as well as better controls on precursive chemicals and law enforcement. In total, more than $720m over four years to help communities reduce the impact of drug and alcohol misuse. Forgive me for listing such a long list of actions, but there\u2019s a long list there in terms of what we\u2019ve been doing. Michaelia Cash\u2019s former adviser David De Garis has been in the stand for most of the morning, but he has also been asked to leave the courtroom twice while arguments are put about which evidence should be considered by the court. Lawyers for the Registered Organisations Commission objected to the court considering evidence about De Garis\u2019 decision to tip off the media about the police raids on the AWU\u2019s Melbourne and Sydney offices in October 2017. Frank Parry QC told the court \u201capparent leak\u201d of the raids to the media in was irrelevant to the ROC\u2019s decision to investigate the donations, because the decision to launch the probe was made in August. It would lead to a \u201cfixation\u201d on the events of 23-24 October \u2013 when Cash denied her staff had told the media and then dramatically changed her answer during Senate estimates \u2013 despite the fact the leak was \u201cof marginal relevance (to the case)\u201d. Herman Borenstein QC, representing the AWU, said the evidence \u2013 initially an email from De Garis \u2013 could \u201ccast light\u201d on the ROC\u2019s decision by showing there was considerable interest within Cash\u2019s office about the investigation. \u201cIt shows that the senator\u2019s office is keen to take political advantage of the existence of the investigation and what happens afterwards and that this is known to the (Roc),\u201d he said. Justice Mordecai Bromberg said he would admit the evidence before later deciding whether to consider it as part of his ruling. On that pair news, this story from Jane Norman at the ABC from earlier today is worth a read Things are getting real \u2013 the opposition has just put the government on notice that any vote which requires an absolute majority, of 76, Labor will cancel pairs. Continued: For the past five and a half years, our government has taken these responsibilities extremely seriously. Dealing with the world as it is \u2013 uncertain, often dangerous, uncompromising, and at its worst \u2013 simply evil. Every day, we have been taking action to build a stronger and even more resilient Australia to deal with whatever comes our way. That\u2019s why, today, I\u2019m releasing our forward plan to keep Australians safe and secure in the future. Our plan to keep Australians safe and secure. The plan builds on our achievements and addresses the plans that we face. Plans must always be updated to show that. Regional tensions between the world\u2019s powers. Heightened global instability. Headwinds that we face, as Josh Frydenberg knows as treasurer. The economy as Mathias Cormann knows. Foreign interference. Radical terrorism. People smuggling. Natural disasters. Organised crime. Money laundering. Biosecurity hazards. Cyber security. The evil ice trade. Violence against women, as I\u2019ve mentioned. Online predators and scammers who seek to rip off older Australians \u2013 cyber bullying, elder abuse. Our plan to keep Australians safe and secure, to address these threats, is straightforward. Keep our economy strong to provide the surest foundation for our security. Defend Australia with $200bn over the next decade. Continue to protect our borders with proven policies that work and not changing them. Keeping Australians safe from terrorism by disrupting and denying those terrorists the [chance] to undertake attacks in Australia. To combat violence against women and counter the culture of disrespect towards women that can lead to that violence. Protect our children online and in the real world. Going after sexual predators and countering bullying behaviour. Secure our region and our sovereignty by prioritising cooperation with our Indo-Pacific neighbours and family, as Marise Payne does on a daily basis. To protect Australians from organised criminals by ensuring that we give police and security services the resources and technology and the powers they need. To fight that menace of drugs, and especially ice, with coordinated law enforcement and anti-gangs initiatives. And to protect our communities in times of natural disaster by continuing to invest more in preparedness and capability, so we can respond quickly in helping Australians get back on our feet as we are doing, even as we speak right now with the disasters that face us. Scott Morrison: ... The point I want to make is that keeping Australians safe and secure is not just about discussing the great geopolitical tensions of our time. It\u2019s much more personal than that. It\u2019s much more meaningful than that. It affects your every day. It extends to our communities, our families, women, children, individual Australians. That\u2019s how I see my national security and safety responsibilities to the Australian people. For the past five and a half years, our government has taken these responsibilities extremely seriously. Dealing with the world as it is \u2013 uncertain, often dangerous, uncompromising, and at its worst \u2013 simply evil. Every day, we have been taking action to build a stronger and even more resilient Australia to deal with whatever comes our way. There is another plan brochure. This one has a helicopter on its front, which cuts down on the awkward moments waving a brochure with your own face on it can bring. The prime minister has begun his speech. That feeling when you first hear Ariana Grande\u2019s new album Here you go: Peter Dutton is speaking to Sky ahead of the prime minister\u2019s speech. It is going as you would expect. Scott Morrison is about to address the National Press Club. If at first you don\u2019t succeed ... Try, try again Chris Bowen: We want to see sick people dealt with appropriately and getting the best in care and attention possible. We\u2019ve also said that we want a ministerial discretion to be the final arbiter on this \u2013 hence we have supported the bill in the Senate. I don\u2019t think ... as I said, I haven\u2019t seen the AMA statement, but I doubt they\u2019re criticising us for that. I think that they would be supportive of that. And the leader of the opposition is getting briefings today and if there\u2019s further discussions to be had with other crossbench colleagues across the parliament in terms of ensuring the two objectives are met, then he\u2019ll have those. But our position has been consistent. The government\u2019s gone to the lengths of leaking out classified documents or briefings to try politicise it. And that\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll vote for the right policy balance which will be done in the Senate and if there\u2019s further discussions to be had, the leader of the opposition will have them. ... Well, the Coalition \u2013 well, it\u2019s fear. That\u2019s it. They\u2019ve got one shot there \u2013 scare and fear. Now, we know that. We know that\u2019s what they\u2019ll say, and you\u2019re right, it is what they\u2019ll say. And Bill Shorten has made it very clear \u2013 a Shorten Labor government will not see the people smuggling trade restarted. We will not. That means that we will have to make some decisions, that some people, including Labor voters, don\u2019t agree with, like we\u2019ve done on turning back the boats. We\u2019ll stick with the policies and we recognise that they\u2019re controversial in some parts, but we think that they\u2019re \u2026 an appropriate approach to border protection, but we\u2019ll also act humanely. As Anthony Albanese said this morning, it\u2019s not always a choice on that. You can have strong policies on the border but you can act with decency. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing with the medivac bill. Peter Dutton can hold all of the press conferences he likes and we can see all of the leaking of classified information. Unprecedented to see classified information like that leaked on the front page of the newspaper. We\u2019ll just make the case of good policy and we\u2019ll let the people decide. Also worth revisiting this Chris Bowen has finished his press conference. He again calls on the government to add an extra sitting fortnight to deal with elements of the banking royal commission, and calls for Tim Wilson to stand down as committee chair over all those many, many, blurred and overstepped lines. He doesn\u2019t shed any light on where Labor is going on the medivac bill. Not surprising really, because the security briefing is going on, as we speak, and then the caucus has to make a decision at its meeting tonight (about 6pm, I believe). The federal court is today hearing a Australian Workers Union (AWU) challenge against the Registered Organisations Commission. The case was prompted by the leaking of federal police raids on the union by a then-media adviser to Senator Michaelia Cash, who is expected to front court on Friday. Outside court on Monday morning, the AWU national secretary, Daniel Walton, said: We commenced this case because we believe the minister, Michaelia Cash, misused her position by instigating an investigation into the AWU. That initiation led to the raids on our offices some 15 months ago. The journey we\u2019ve been thorough led us to this point where we finally get the chance to get the minister, plus her former members of staff \u2013 to ask them questions, in terms of: what did they know, when did they know it and who did they speak to? When the full case is run, we\u2019re confident that the judge will see that this has been a massive overstep and a misuse of political resources. Cash denies any wrongdoing, saying she is happy to assist the court and that the AWU must still answer questions about donations which were made to GetUp while Bill Shorten was the union\u2019s boss. Cash\u2019s former media adviser, David De Garis, is the hearing\u2019s first witness. On the government\u2019s (repeated) claim that the bill will result in \u201calmost all\u201d (about 1,000 at the moment) asylum seekers and refugees being transferred to Australia, and the bill puts border security \u201cinto the hands of doctors\u201d, Dr Paul Bauert tells it straight: The borders won\u2019t be in the hands of medical professionals. What will be happening is what happens throughout a lot of Australia in terms of medivacing these people after having done consultations, either by the phone, or by tele-health,\u201d he told Sky News. Two doctors, independent doctors, will make a decision, in agreement, that a particular individual does need to come to a situation where the facilities are better, are more appropriate for their management and for their ability to survive. That will then go to the minister. If the minister says he doesn\u2019t agree with the medical decision, which he has done regularly over the years, it will then go to a 10-person individual committee, many of whom will have been selected by the minister himself. If that independent committee then decides that this patient should be transferred, should be medivaced, the minister still has complete control over that individual. They will be accompanied by armed guards, they will probably end up in a detention centre in Australia, they will be accompanied by armed guards to the hospital, to their appointments. He has complete control over that. And he has complete control, when that medical treatment has finished, of sending those patients back to offshore detention. ... I think what Dr Phelps suggests should happen, that if people are felt to be unwell by the local doctors then they should seek the help of another doctor. If both doctors suggest the patient is ill enough to be transferred, then we go through that process. The minister has control over that process. ... Will 1,000 people come? That is what has been said. I mean, to me, if 1,000 people do come over the next three weeks, it would suggest that they are all absolutely critically ill and need to be evacuated. I honestly don\u2019t feel that is the case, and I think the talk about 1,000 people being here in two and a half minutes is pure politics. Given all the misinformation flying around about the crossbench medical transfer bill, it\u2019s worthwhile taking the time to spell out what it does. The bill (changes initially proposed by Kerryn Phelps and amended by Tim Storer, Labor and others have been added to a piece of government legislation in the Senate) sets out new procedures governing medical transfers from offshore detention. The government has been trying to create an impression that two doctors decide, entirely on their own volition, who comes to Australia and who doesn\u2019t. To put it bluntly, that\u2019s complete bollocks. It\u2019s correct to say that the bill envisages giving two or more treating doctors the capacity to recommend a transfer of an ill person to Australia for treatment. If you read the legislation, this is what happens next: Within 24 hours of being notified that a person should be transferred, \u201cthe minister must approve, or refuse to approve, the person\u2019s transfer to Australia\u201d. The minister must approve the transfer unless the minister \u201creasonably believes that it is not necessary to remove the person from a regional processing country for appropriate medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment; or \u201cthe minister reasonably believes that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security within the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that act\u201d. So there are two grounds of ministerial refusal: one general and one specific. If the minister refuses the transfer on the grounds that it is not medically necessary, the issue then goes to an Independent Health Advice Panel. That panel conducts another clinical assessment. Back to the legislation to explain what happens next: \u201cIf the panel recommends that the person\u2019s transfer be approved, the minister must approve the person\u2019s transfer to Australia unless the minister reasonably believes that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security within the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d. Now, who is on this panel? The legislation says the commonwealth\u2019s chief medical officer, the surgeon general of Australian Border Force, the chief medical officer of the Home Affairs department, and not less than six other members, including people nominated by the AMA, the college of psychiatrists, the college of physicians and one specialist in paediatric health. So, to summarise: * Doctors can recommend medical transfers. * The minister can then refuse a transfer on two grounds, one general (I don\u2019t agree) and one specific (security grounds). * If the refusal falls in the \u2018I don\u2019t agree\u2019 category, then it goes to a medical panel comprised of the CMO, the surgeon general of border force and other specialists. * If the panel says the transfer should proceed on medical grounds, then that overrides the minister, except if there is a negative security assessment on the individual. You\u2019re welcome. Speaking to Sky News, Dr Paul Bauert explained the doctors concerns: The longer these people are there, the worse they are getting. We know that the main, the main reason for the impairment of mental health, as Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist from Auschwitz described very well in his book, Man\u2019s search for meaning, the main problem these people have is the lack of meaning, the lack of any end to what is going on. A lack of certainty. And this more than anything causes severe mental health damage. Even those that finally knew they were about to be condemned to the gas chamber, at least found some sense of relief in knowing what was happening. \u201cSo, all of these people without any idea of what is going to happen to them, what their future is, will be suffering on a daily basis. And we have seen from some of the television shows, and the media that have followed them, once they have been released, that all of them end up with severe, significant mental health problems which will take a long, long time to settle, with most having post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cI am concerned, all the doctors are concerned, that the longer this politicking goes on, the longer these people are left in this critical situation, the worse their health is becoming.\u201d It is worth revisiting this interview Kathrine Murphy did with Paul Bauert late last year: Paediatrician Paul Bauert has spent days roaming the corridors of Parliament House trying to get politicians to focus on what\u2019s happening on Nauru. There\u2019s a recurrent observation from the political class that chills him. In an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s Politics Live podcast, he says: \u201cIt almost brings me to tears when one of the politicians, or one of the politician\u2019s minders ask me \u2026 \u2018Do you think it will take a death before things change?\u2019 \u201cI cannot, for the life of me, understand where that thinking comes from, truly: \u2018Do you think it will take a death?\u2019\u201d This is happening in Adelaide today: Dr Paul Bauert on those who need urgent treatment: We know that 24 of them are in a hospital facility at the moment, with two of them comatose. And the fact that 4,500 thousand doctors have spent their weekend signing a letter and sending it in, shows the frustration of the medical profession with the politicking that has been going on with this issue for far too long. Lives are at stake. The politicking must stop. There is an opportunity with Dr Phelps\u2019s approach to this issue for the politicking to stop and that we get a clear, well organised system where these unwell patients, critically unwell patients, receive the treatment that they deserve. Doctors are back in Canberra. Why? Because the medivac legislation is in danger of falling to politics. Dr Paul Bauert, of the AMA federal executive, is a paediatrician who has led a lot of the fight on behalf of the medical community. He answers the question of why a paediatrician is so involved \u2013 because some of those on Manus Island were children when he first started treating them, and they\u2019re still there. GetUp has funded a television advertising campaign, featuring doctors and others, to run this week in a bid to get the politicians who were in support of the bill to hold their ground \u2013 which means it is aimed squarely at Labor and Cathy McGowan. The other crossbenchers have already locked in their support. Scott Morrison: The spirit of cooperation reaches right back to the first world war, but this program brings a new depth to that partnership through a multi-decade program to build and sustain these submarines in Australia. It is more than a contract. This is a project that will not only keep Australians safe, but it will deliver Australian jobs. It will build Australian skills. It will \u2026 require Australian steel, and it will mean a stronger Royal Australian Navy. Our government is committed to maximising Australian industry content in the future submarine program. This was a conscious decision of our government. Beyond construction, the program will provide Australia with an independent, sovereign capability to sustain our fleet, including the upskilling of Navy and industry workforces. We will see long-term strategic cooperation, not only in defence industry, as I know Minister Ciobo will be excited about, but across other sectors, creating even more jobs through more high tech, high-paying jobs. Hundreds of Australians are already employed on the future submarines program, and thousands more will be through the supply chain during the construction phase. The prime minister is in Canberra signing the $50bn \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with France to build our new submarines. On that speech to be made by Scott Morrison, it\u2019s all about national security, both domestically and abroad. It ends with this: In conclusion, national security is all about making the right decisions. Because, as a government and as a prime minister, you have to make them every day. You make these decisions on the basis of your values, instincts, experience and, when required, courage. Our government has demonstrated we have the mettle to make the right calls on our nation\u2019s security: Repairing our borders Investing in our defence forces Deporting violent criminals Taking on domestic violence Disrupting terrorist attacks Restoring powers and resources to our police, security and intelligence agencies We have led, not followed. We have taken decisions rather than put them off to another day. We have embraced tough calls rather than seeking to buy weak compromises for cheap political cover or opportunism. This is our form. It is why we can be trusted. The plan I have announced today is built on our strong record and sets out plainly what a re-elected Morrison Liberal National government will continue to do to keep Australians safe and secure. And, for those asking, Scott Morrison will address the National Press Club at 12.30. Chris Bowen will be speaking at 11.10. A key part of the medivac bill that is being deliberately muddied is that any asylum seekers or refugee (and, let\u2019s remember, the majority have been independently found to be refugees) being brought here for medical treatment will be wandering around the community. They won\u2019t be. They\u2019ll remain in detention. They\u2019ll be in detention in Australia, being treated in detention. The government has also attempted to lie and say Bob Brown and Richard Di Natale could be the two doctors signing off on any medical evacuations. Also not true, because Di Natale isn\u2019t even registered. Christopher Pyne and David Coleman spent their Sunday interviews saying the bill would result in almost all of the 1,000 or so people in our care on Manus Island and Nauru would come to Australia under the changes. But they refused to say whether that meant all those people were sick enough to need treatment. Because you can\u2019t have it both ways. If it is true that nearly all the asylum seekers and refugees will come to Australia for medical treatment under these changes, it means they are all sick enough to warrant doctors, and an independent health panel (if an evacuation is challenged by the minister) deciding they need to be treated in Australia. Which means they are not receiving the treatment they need on Manus Island or Nauru. If they aren\u2019t sick, ill, or suffering from extreme mental health distress, then they won\u2019t be evacuated for Australia. You can\u2019t have it both ways. And just on that, Chris Bowen will be up shortly, to talk banking royal commission and extra sitting weeks. Labor is still pushing for an extra sitting fortnight in March and the government is still very, very against it. This, as is everything in this minority parliament, is a numbers game. Bob Katter is the key vote. Every other crossbencher is on board, so if Katter votes yes, then we are coming back in March. If it comes to that \u2013 the government is working very hard to say it doesn\u2019t need to come back, and that it will not rush legislation for the banking royal commission. On Sunday, Christopher Pyne told Insiders there were over 40 pieces of legislation which would be needed to address the 76 recommendations and admitted that that was not going to happen before the May election. The AWU raids case is in the federal court today. Michaelia Cash, despite attempts to fight it, has been subpoenaed to give evidence. The AWU is attempting to have the raids, and anything they found, declared unlawful. And opening the \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about, that was never a thing (while shuffling away the thing)\u201d box, this is also something that happened: The government has backed away from two explicit commitments to establish a register to help stamp out multi-national tax avoidance \u2013 by claiming there was never a commitment in the first place. Announced by Kelly O\u2019Dwyer in the lead-up to the 2016 federal election, the register was to bring Australia in line with G20 commitments on transparency, by publicly listing the identities of who ultimately owned shell companies and benefitted from them, including for tax purposes. In April 2016, O\u2019Dwyer, then assistant treasurer, said \u201cwe agree there needs to be a registry of beneficial ownership in our country\u201d, as the government was attempting to hose down local voter outrage over multinational tax avoidance. Since then, progress on the register has stalled. You can read more on that, here I hope all of you are taking some of 105-year-old Doris\u2019s attitude into your Monday: Paul Fletcher was just asked about Pyne\u2019s comments \u2013 he says you just do the best you can with the situation you are in. Opening up the \u201coh wow, they really did that\u201d box, Christopher Pyne had a chat to David Wroe from the Sydney Morning Herald, where he decided to give his opinion on the leadership spill (you know, that thing that happened last year, and we are never to speak of again, because it is soooooo 2018): \u201cI felt that the constant social media, shouty segment of the press, that keeps everybody on edge in this building all the time \u2013 and might actually not reflect at all the way the public think \u2013 had won, and that sensible people had bowed to that irrational pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought that this is the Australian polity of the future. This is what we\u2019ve now got. And it\u2019s different to what I think is good for the country.\u201d Michael Kroger thought Tim Wilson was \u201coutstanding\u201d on Sky just now. So still not great at reading a room, despite stepping down from the Victorian Liberals\u2019 executive top spot, then. Everything is totally fine and normal. Oh and the use of the coat of arms on a \u2018private\u2019 website? Also fine and normal (side note, Tim Wilson delivers talking points like he just downloaded a toastmasters power speech class directly into his brain) Tim Wilson is speaking to Sky. On the criticisms over how he has used his committee chair position for political gain. His first response: \u201cBring it on\u201d. That should play well. The government has also announced a policy to aid those escaping domestic and family violence. From the prime minister\u2019s release: Hundreds more women and children escaping domestic and family violence will have a safe place to sleep with a $78m investment by the Morrison government. This investment includes a $60m grants program for eligible organisations to provide new or expanded emergency accommodation facilities for those escaping domestic and family violence. This program will build up to 450 safe places and assist up to 6,500 people per year. The grant program will be structured to encourage contributions from other levels of government, and from private and philanthropic sources. A further $18m will be invested in the Keeping Women Safe in their Homes program, which has assisted over 5,200 women since 2015-16, providing security upgrades and safety planning so women and children can remain in their own homes, if it is safe to do so. Prime minister Scott Morrison said this investment was a key commitment to the Fourth Action Plan 2019-2022, the final plan under the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children 2010-2022.\u201d It\u2019s also Newspoll day \u2013 and things are still not looking up for the government. Yes, Scott Morrison is still preferred prime minister, but that measure is sort of bupkis as a political pointer. Prime ministers tend to be more popular than opposition leaders, because a) they have better name recognition and b) the job of an opposition leader is to, well oppose the government. That tends to see them come across as negative in the 15-second TV grabs. The latest Newspoll has Labor leading the government 53 to 47 on the two-party-preferred measure. That\u2019s not great, if you are the Coalition. What does that mean? Mostly, that Scott Morrison is going to be even more Scott Morrison. The most Scott Morrison ever. He\u2019s starting with his National Press Club address. The politics around the medivac bill has gone a little bananas in the last couple of days. First Scott Morrison called it \u201cstupid\u201d, then a security briefing prepared for Home Affairs was leaked, and somewhere in the middle of that, Bill Shorten\u2019s language changed, with \u201cmiddle ground\u201d starting to make an appearance. Where Labor lands on this should be decided today. Scott Morrison and the Coalition though are only ramping up the political attacks \u2013 and speaking to Radio National this morning, Anthony Albanese was asked if Labor would \u201chold fast on this\u201d. What we\u2019ve got to do here is take a bit of a step back from the government\u2019s rather hysterical rhetoric and think about what this bill is about and why Kerryn Phelps has brought it forward. This is about whether people who we have responsibility for, who we\u2019re to look after, if they\u2019re sick and need medical care, whether they should get access to that? Our view is yes. I think that the Australian people understand that and their answer to that is yes as well. And what the government has done on this legislation, frankly, is not tell the truth. Because the legislation, yes, says that two doctors may make a recommendation, but that\u2019s subject to ministerial approval. The minister can then refer it to a panel which includes people who the minister himself, Mr Dutton, has appointed to that point. And they will make a final determination, except for, of course, the minister also has discretion on national security grounds. Yesterday, Shayne Neumann gave comment on the bill, saying this in a statement: Labor has always had two clear objectives \u2013 making sure sick people can get medical care, and making sure the minister has final discretion over medical transfers. Labor has great respect for our national security agencies and we\u2019ve always worked cooperatively with them. While the Liberals leak national security information, we listen to it. The Liberals have sunk to a new low by threatening to let the boats start again. They are walking, talking billboards for the people smugglers and they should be ashamed of themselves. Labor will never let the people smugglers back into business. So is there a compromise? Albanese: We have said that and we\u2019re prepared to compromise across the parliament. This should not be a partisan issue. But this is a government that doesn\u2019t look for outcomes but looks for arguments. That\u2019s one of the reasons why it is in the state that it is. It doesn\u2019t look for solutions. It has responsibility and it knows full well that almost 1,000 people have already been transferred to Australia. And the provisions in which they need medical assistance so what this is attempting to do ... There\u2019s an argument that the ministerial discretion is there because it\u2019s the minister who appoints the panel that will make the determination and the minister still has, under this legislation that\u2019s proposed, discretion over national security grounds. So if we need to tweak the legislation, then by all means, we should be able to do that in order to get an outcome. But I think that what Dr Phelps, in discussions that I had with her last year was very clear about, was that she was about outcomes. So if we need to tweak the legislation, by all means, let\u2019s have those discussions.\u201d Happy New (Parliament) Year! I hope everyone has had a lovely break and is ready to get back into what is going to be an excruciatingly punishing year in Australian politics. Elections tend to do that. There is no parliament today \u2013 that starts back tomorrow \u2013 but with Scott Morrison due to give his National Press Club address, Newspoll, asylum seeker decisions and just general, well, politics, we thought we\u2019d get in early and run a blog for the day. Bill Shorten is due to meet with Mike Pezzullo, the secretary of the home affairs department, the chief of defence and the chief of Operation Sovereign Borders (yes, there is such a title) to get the security lowdown on the asylum seeker and refugee medical evacuation bill. We have heard the government wanted to put some staffers in there, which ruffled some feathers on the Labor side, because it is not as though things have been particularly airtight around these matters lately. After that, the Labor caucus will meet. That usually happens on a Tuesday, but a special meeting will be held today, as the party comes to its final decision on the amended legislation. All of this though, is moot if Cathy McGowan has changed her mind about supporting the bill. We\u2019ll bring you all of those developments and more as the day goes on. Mike Bowers is on deck, as is Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and the rest of the Guardian Australia brains trust. You can find us on Twitter, or, when we have time, in the comments. I am on coffee number three. There is not enough coffee in the world for this year. I can already feel it. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<h2>1) Sarri state of Chelsea spells trouble for manager</h2> \n<p>Maurizio Sarri is heading into the shark-infested waters that did for Luiz Felipe Scolari and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, who were sacked midway through their first seasons in charge of Chelsea. They were removed by Roman Abramovich once his team\u2019s place in the following season\u2019s Champions League was endangered and this weekend ended with Manchester United in fourth spot. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/16/tottenham-sack-andre-villas-boas\" title=\"\">Villas-Boas lost his job</a> on 4 March 2012 while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/09/chelsea-luiz-felipe-scolari-sacked-football-premier-league\" title=\"\">Scolari departed</a> on 9 February 2009. At least Sarri has now lasted longer than the Brazilian, but \u2018Sarriball\u2019 has lately looked as poor a fit for Chelsea as his laissez-faire attitude and Villas-Boas\u2019s overly methodical stratagems. Sarri\u2019s displacement of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 to play everything through Jorginho and the cold shoulders given to youngsters such as Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek may end up being his deepest Chelsea legacies. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/10/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City 6-0 Chelsea</a><br>\u2022 </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/10/maurizio-sarri-concern-chelsea-manchester-city-future\">Sarri admits concern over Chelsea but sidesteps query on future</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f83c1b5b-00fd-449f-8b68-f04dfd8ad8db\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c1383Ay_Wj4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>2) Electric Martial shows Mourinho was wrong to doubt</h2> \n<p>Just a reminder for any remaining Jos\u00e9 Mourinho loyalists: your man never had much time for Anthony Martial. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/23/jose-mourinho-says-martial-shaw-rashford-lingard-lack-maturity-manchester-united\" title=\"\">former Manchester United manager fell out</a> with the forward last summer and often gave the impression he wanted him out of Old Trafford. It was a ridiculous position for Mourinho to take with one of the best youngsters in Europe and it looks even sillier now. The Frenchman is a player transformed under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and United must be relieved not to have let Mourinho turn the 22-year\u2011old into another Mohamed Salah or Kevin De Bruyne. Martial was outstanding at Fulham, creating Paul Pogba\u2019s opener and scoring a sensational solo goal, and he will be determined to make another strong impression against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday. \u201cHe is electric,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want him running at you.\u201d <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/09/fulham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Fulham 0-3 Manchester United</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) Signs of Liverpool\u2019s verve return with Alexander-Arnold</h2> \n<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s first appearance in almost a month was a bonus for Liverpool as they returned not only to winning ways but to the high-octane football that has underpinned their title challenge. Bournemouth were obliging opponents as they suffered a ninth straight away defeat in all competitions, but even the lifelong Liverpool fan was struck by the convincing reaction from everyone at Anfield. \u201cIt was one of the best performances from us this season,\u201d Alexander-Arnold said. \u201cWe hardly put a foot wrong. They never had too many chances and we created a lot. We kept the ball well and the fans helped us. I said to Hendo [Jordan Henderson] that I had never seen a 3pm game at Anfield on Saturday like that before. The scarves, the flags, the banners: it was something new for me and hopefully the support will continue.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/09/liverpool-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth</a></em></p> \n<h2>4) Pochettino dismayed by Dortmund\u2019s 24-hour advantage</h2> \n<p>After Son Heung-min scored to clinch Tottenham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/10/tottenham-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">energy-sapping win over Leicester</a>, Mauricio Pochettino hoofed the ball \u2013 Peter Kay-style \u2013 into the stands. The relief was palpable but the manager was in the mood to vent after the game. He raged about Michael Oliver\u2019s decision to book Son for a dive at 0-0 but a more lengthy monologue took in why the game had been played on Sunday rather than Saturday \u2013 with an eye on Wednesday\u2019s Champions League last-16 first leg against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. Dortmund faced Hoffenheim on Saturday and, as Pochettino pointed out, it is a disadvantage to have 24 hours less to prepare. He was disappointed and upset. What made the scheduling more difficult to take was that Spurs, for once, had enjoyed a midweek with no match commitments. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/10/tottenham-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham 3-1 Leicester</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec415144-8a01-4474-89ef-b2c4da369a72\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Manchester City (86 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>24 Apr </b>Man Utd (a)<br><b>28 Apr&nbsp;</b>Burnley (a)<br><b>4 May&nbsp;</b>Leicester (h)<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Brighton (a)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Liverpool (85 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>21 Apr&nbsp;</b>Cardiff (a)&nbsp;<br><b>26 Apr&nbsp;</b>Huddersfield (h)<br><b>5 May&nbsp;</b>Newcastle (a)&nbsp;<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Wolves (h)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) De Bruyne getting back to his best, and so are City</h2> \n<p>The strength of Manchester City\u2019s hand was shown by a team sheet in which Leroy San\u00e9 and David Silva were on the substitutes\u2019 bench.

An appeals committee could be convened this week by the Football Association when the club will outline their arguments as to why Zaha, who has served a one-match suspension for the red card and was excellent on Saturday, should not be punished further. Burnley\u2019s Ashley Barnes escaped punishment for a far more aggressive reaction to an official\u2019s decision in the period since, and Hodgson said: \u201cThe case was not cut and dried. Yes, he did wrong and he shouldn\u2019t have applauded the referee, but he accepts that. He\u2019s apologised and we believe [the original ban] is sufficient punishment.\u201d The likelihood is that, if the punishment is upheld, Zaha will miss the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Doncaster on Sunday. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/09/crystal-palace-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace 1-1 West Ham</a></em></p> \n<h2>10) Saints face hard road but Fulham offer important respite</h2> \n<p>The anger emanating from Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl was all the more understandable given what lies ahead. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/06/ralph-hasenhuttl-southampton-premier-league-rb-leipzig\" title=\"\">glow surrounding Southampton</a> has quickly diminished after two wins in 10 matches since Christmas. When the squad return from a five-day training camp in Tenerife on Friday they will continue preparation for testing run of games, with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs to play in three of their next four matches. The other, at home to Fulham, feels like a huge game if the Saints are to scarper clear of the relegation zone they find themselves back in. Southampton have scored in their past seven matches but they are too predictable in attack, especially without the injured Danny Ings. \u201cWe have a big potential but we still have to put it into

      "bodyText": "1) Sarri state of Chelsea spells trouble for manager Maurizio Sarri is heading into the shark-infested waters that did for Luiz Felipe Scolari and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, who were sacked midway through their first seasons in charge of Chelsea. They were removed by Roman Abramovich once his team\u2019s place in the following season\u2019s Champions League was endangered and this weekend ended with Manchester United in fourth spot. Villas-Boas lost his job on 4 March 2012 while Scolari departed on 9 February 2009. At least Sarri has now lasted longer than the Brazilian, but \u2018Sarriball\u2019 has lately looked as poor a fit for Chelsea as his laissez-faire attitude and Villas-Boas\u2019s overly methodical stratagems. Sarri\u2019s displacement of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 to play everything through Jorginho and the cold shoulders given to youngsters such as Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek may end up being his deepest Chelsea legacies. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 6-0 Chelsea \u2022 Sarri admits concern over Chelsea but sidesteps query on future 2) Electric Martial shows Mourinho was wrong to doubt Just a reminder for any remaining Jos\u00e9 Mourinho loyalists: your man never had much time for Anthony Martial. The former Manchester United manager fell out with the forward last summer and often gave the impression he wanted him out of Old Trafford. It was a ridiculous position for Mourinho to take with one of the best youngsters in Europe and it looks even sillier now. The Frenchman is a player transformed under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and United must be relieved not to have let Mourinho turn the 22-year\u2011old into another Mohamed Salah or Kevin De Bruyne. Martial was outstanding at Fulham, creating Paul Pogba\u2019s opener and scoring a sensational solo goal, and he will be determined to make another strong impression against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday. \u201cHe is electric,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want him running at you.\u201d Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Fulham 0-3 Manchester United 3) Signs of Liverpool\u2019s verve return with Alexander-Arnold Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s first appearance in almost a month was a bonus for Liverpool as they returned not only to winning ways but to the high-octane football that has underpinned their title challenge. Bournemouth were obliging opponents as they suffered a ninth straight away defeat in all competitions, but even the lifelong Liverpool fan was struck by the convincing reaction from everyone at Anfield. \u201cIt was one of the best performances from us this season,\u201d Alexander-Arnold said. \u201cWe hardly put a foot wrong. They never had too many chances and we created a lot. We kept the ball well and the fans helped us. I said to Hendo [Jordan Henderson] that I had never seen a 3pm game at Anfield on Saturday like that before. The scarves, the flags, the banners: it was something new for me and hopefully the support will continue.\u201d Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth 4) Pochettino dismayed by Dortmund\u2019s 24-hour advantage After Son Heung-min scored to clinch Tottenham\u2019s energy-sapping win over Leicester, Mauricio Pochettino hoofed the ball \u2013 Peter Kay-style \u2013 into the stands. The relief was palpable but the manager was in the mood to vent after the game. He raged about Michael Oliver\u2019s decision to book Son for a dive at 0-0 but a more lengthy monologue took in why the game had been played on Sunday rather than Saturday \u2013 with an eye on Wednesday\u2019s Champions League last-16 first leg against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. Dortmund faced Hoffenheim on Saturday and, as Pochettino pointed out, it is a disadvantage to have 24 hours less to prepare. He was disappointed and upset. What made the scheduling more difficult to take was that Spurs, for once, had enjoyed a midweek with no match commitments. David Hytner \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 3-1 Leicester 5) De Bruyne getting back to his best, and so are City The strength of Manchester City\u2019s hand was shown by a team sheet in which Leroy San\u00e9 and David Silva were on the substitutes\u2019 bench. And Liverpool supporters ought to be concerned that Kevin De Bruyne is still to recover his best form. The goals are yet to come \u2013 he has scored once in the Premier League this season \u2013 but slowly his influence is rising, even if the passing was a little awry at times against Chelsea. With Bernardo Silva an executive-class worker bee, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan having one of his better days for City and Fernandinho as quietly effective as ever, Chelsea\u2019s ragged midfield came apart at the seams as the bullets were supplied for Sergio Ag\u00fcero to become City\u2019s highest scorer in league matches. Goal difference may yet prove decisive in the title race and City have located the scoring rate of last season. JB 6) Mee time for England? The defences and goalkeepers made the difference as the fine margins of the Premier League were exposed at the Amex. Brighton ensured their own downfall with Lewis Dunk\u2019s slip and Mat Ryan\u2019s misjudgments, which were further shown up by the resolute and focused nature of the Burnley defence. Since Tom Heaton has returned in goal the back five look more secure, with James Tarkowski and Ben Mee the heroes in front of their captain on Saturday. Gareth Southgate has already given Tarkowski his chance at international level but it may be time his partner was called up. Mee is not the tallest, the quickest or the most cultured but he has offered consistency for years at Burnley in the Premier League. He produces the sort of performances that rarely get recognised but his team\u2019s success shows he must be doing something right. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Brighton 1-3 Burnley 7) Iwobi ticks all the boxes for Emery With the help of some bad goalkeeping by Huddersfield\u2019s Ben Hamer, Alex Iwobi scored his third league goal of the season on Saturday \u2013 the same tally as Mesut \u00d6zil, and with less game time. But Unai Emery evidently believes the 22-year-old Iwobi has plenty of scope for improving, an opinion he does not appear to have about the German. \u201cHe\u2019s young, he has big commitment and very good condition physically,\u201d said Emery of Iwobi. \u201cHe needs to improve tactically maybe and, above all, he needs to be more calm with the ball in the attacking third, to find better assists and the possibility to score with calmness, [to know when] the best option is to shoot or dribble. He missed other chances but this match, starting with his attitude, was a very big performance.\u201d Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Huddersfield 1-2 Arsenal 8) Watford\u2019s jukebox jury offer Silva harsh verdict \u201cWatford prepared the music?\u201d asked Marco Silva, with eyebrows raised. They say time is usually a great healer but the memories of their former manager\u2019s acrimonious departure last year clearly still rankles with Watford fans, who were asked to request tribute songs for Silva to be played before Saturday\u2019s win over Everton. Al Wilson\u2019s The Snake and Since U Been Gone by Kelly Clarkson were among those chosen as the hosts created a hostile reception for the Portuguese on his return to Vicarage Road. It had the desired effect as Andre Gray\u2019s winner condemned Silva\u2019s side to defeat despite their striking the crossbar on two occasions. \u201cIt was lack of confidence in some moments,\u201d Silva said. \u201cBut if we put the ball in the net we can achieve the results and the confidence will change in the team.\u201d Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Watford 1-0 Everton 9) Zaha has been punished enough, says Hodgson Roy Hodgson believes Crystal Palace have a very good case as they appeal against the additional one-match ban, and \u00a310,000 fine, imposed on Wilfried Zaha for sarcastically applauding the referee after his dismissal at Southampton. An appeals committee could be convened this week by the Football Association when the club will outline their arguments as to why Zaha, who has served a one-match suspension for the red card and was excellent on Saturday, should not be punished further. Burnley\u2019s Ashley Barnes escaped punishment for a far more aggressive reaction to an official\u2019s decision in the period since, and Hodgson said: \u201cThe case was not cut and dried. Yes, he did wrong and he shouldn\u2019t have applauded the referee, but he accepts that. He\u2019s apologised and we believe [the original ban] is sufficient punishment.\u201d The likelihood is that, if the punishment is upheld, Zaha will miss the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Doncaster on Sunday. Dominic Fifield \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 1-1 West Ham 10) Saints face hard road but Fulham offer important respite The anger emanating from Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl was all the more understandable given what lies ahead. The glow surrounding Southampton has quickly diminished after two wins in 10 matches since Christmas. When the squad return from a five-day training camp in Tenerife on Friday they will continue preparation for testing run of games, with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs to play in three of their next four matches. The other, at home to Fulham, feels like a huge game if the Saints are to scarper clear of the relegation zone they find themselves back in. Southampton have scored in their past seven matches but they are too predictable in attack, especially without the injured Danny Ings. \u201cWe have a big potential but we still have to put it into excellence,\u201d said the captain, Pierre\u2011Emile H\u00f8jbjerg.

      "body": "<p>A landmark trial of prominent Bourke cotton farmers accused of illegal pumping from the Barwon-Darling when the river was low is set to become a test of the robustness of New South Wales\u2019s water laws.</p> <p>Michael Elliott SC foreshadowed in the NSW Land and Environment Court today that the defendants, Peter and Jane Harris, would challenge every aspect of the state\u2019s water laws they are accused of breaching, including the accuracy of the government\u2019s water gauges and administrative procedures followed.</p> <p>The Harrises are charged with breaching an approval associated with their water licence for Beemery farm, a large property on the banks of the Barwon River.</p> <p>The water licence they held entitled them to pump water from the Barwon River for irrigation using up to four pumps. But an associated approval said they could pump only when the flows in the Barwon-Darling system, as measured at the Bourke weir, exceeded 4,894 megalitres a day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/16/damning-murray-darling-report-says-nsw-well-behind-on-water-sharing-plans\">Damning Murray-Darling report says NSW 'well behind' on water-sharing plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the river flow fell below that flow rate they were to cease pumping. In 2017 the ABC\u2019s Four Corners program alleged that some cotton farmers along the Barwon-Darling were illegally pumping water during low flow events and pumping during embargoes which are designed to protect environmental flows as they pass down the river.</p> <p>The Harrises were named in the program as having taken water during low flow events, in breach of the state\u2019s water laws.</p> <p>Each offence comes with a $247,500 maximum penalty.</p> <p>Outlining his case, counsel for the prosecution, Scott Aspinall, said the Harrises had three 664mm pumps operating. Each was capable of pumping between 100 and 140 megalitres a day from the Barwon \u2013 the equivalent of 50 to 60 Olympic swimming pools of water each.</p> <p>Between 22 June and 30 June 2016 \u2013 when the offences are said to have occurred \u2013 Aspinall said there were records showing that the Harrises were pumping water despite the flows at the Bourke gauge having fallen to as low as 2,500 megalitres.</p> <p>Over the eight-day period covered by the charges, the river flow was, at best, 3,800 megalitres a day, which was more than 1,000 megalitres below the minimum flow to allow pumping, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe charge is that approximately 1.8 gigalitres was taken in contravention of the condition of the approval,\u201d Aspinall said.</p> <p>The Four Corners report has led to intense scrutiny of the NSW government\u2019s poor record of enforcement of its water laws, particularly against big irrigators.

      "bodyText": "A landmark trial of prominent Bourke cotton farmers accused of illegal pumping from the Barwon-Darling when the river was low is set to become a test of the robustness of New South Wales\u2019s water laws. Michael Elliott SC foreshadowed in the NSW Land and Environment Court today that the defendants, Peter and Jane Harris, would challenge every aspect of the state\u2019s water laws they are accused of breaching, including the accuracy of the government\u2019s water gauges and administrative procedures followed. The Harrises are charged with breaching an approval associated with their water licence for Beemery farm, a large property on the banks of the Barwon River. The water licence they held entitled them to pump water from the Barwon River for irrigation using up to four pumps. But an associated approval said they could pump only when the flows in the Barwon-Darling system, as measured at the Bourke weir, exceeded 4,894 megalitres a day. If the river flow fell below that flow rate they were to cease pumping. In 2017 the ABC\u2019s Four Corners program alleged that some cotton farmers along the Barwon-Darling were illegally pumping water during low flow events and pumping during embargoes which are designed to protect environmental flows as they pass down the river. The Harrises were named in the program as having taken water during low flow events, in breach of the state\u2019s water laws. Each offence comes with a $247,500 maximum penalty. Outlining his case, counsel for the prosecution, Scott Aspinall, said the Harrises had three 664mm pumps operating. Each was capable of pumping between 100 and 140 megalitres a day from the Barwon \u2013 the equivalent of 50 to 60 Olympic swimming pools of water each. Between 22 June and 30 June 2016 \u2013 when the offences are said to have occurred \u2013 Aspinall said there were records showing that the Harrises were pumping water despite the flows at the Bourke gauge having fallen to as low as 2,500 megalitres. Over the eight-day period covered by the charges, the river flow was, at best, 3,800 megalitres a day, which was more than 1,000 megalitres below the minimum flow to allow pumping, he said. \u201cThe charge is that approximately 1.8 gigalitres was taken in contravention of the condition of the approval,\u201d Aspinall said. The Four Corners report has led to intense scrutiny of the NSW government\u2019s poor record of enforcement of its water laws, particularly against big irrigators. After a scathing independent inquiry by Ken Matthews, who recommended some matters be referred to the corruption watchdog, the government created a new independent regulatory body, the Natural Resources Regulator, to enforce the laws. In March 2018 WaterNSW finally launched two prosecutions for breaches that occurred during 2016. Anthony Barlow, from Mungindi, pleaded guilty just before Christmas and is awaiting sentencing. The Harrises, however, chose to fight their charges. In the first day of the hearing, Elliott, for the Harrises, foreshadowed calling an expert witness, Dr Daniel Martins, to challenge the accuracy of the flows at the Bourke gauge. This measurement is central to the charges. There are also likely to be questions about why the gauge was moved and whether its location 6km upstream from the weir affects its readings. There is also likely to be a challenge over the way the government converted the old water licences granted under the 1912 Water Act into the new modern licences which were created in 2012, under the Barwon-Darling Water sharing plan. In evidence on the first day, WaterNSW\u2019s expert hydrologist, Glen McDermott, said that under the official standards used to measure water flow, gauges had to be within +/-10% accuracy and that the Bourke gauge was rated as +/-5%. He said it did not particularly matter where the gauge was located in the weir pool, provided it was calibrated correctly because the flow rate in the entire weir pool would be the same. The hearing continues on Tuesday.",

The following day, the foreign ministry said Turkey\u2019s statement was an \u201cabsurd lie\u201d. In the 25-second video, a pale-faced Heyit, sitting in front of a grey wall, said he is being investigated for \u201callegedly violating national laws\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m now in good health and have never been abused,\u201d he said, according to the subtitled video. The video is Heyit\u2019s first public appearance in almost two years. The musician, known throughout the Turkic-language world for his poetry and performances of traditional Uighur music, is believed to have been arrested in April 2017, according to former colleagues. Heyit\u2019s son was reportedly able to visit him, but friends said they have not heard from him since he was detained. The video is also a rare rebuttal from China. It is uncommon for Beijing to respond directly to specific cases of individuals believed to be detained in Xinjiang. Elise Anderson, a PhD candidate at Indiana University focusing on Uighur music, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThis situation doesn\u2019t undermine efforts so much as it shows that outcry can force China to respond. \u201cWe should see it as remarkable that they have circulated this video when \u2026 they have been deafeningly silent about the whereabouts of so many of the disappeared.\u201d In a country where televised forced confessions are not uncommon, the video raises more questions than it answers. Heyit\u2019s statement that he is under investigation contradicts other reports that he has been sentenced to prison. It also indicates Heyit has been detained for more than a year without being formally charged. Speaking on Monday, Hua Chunying, the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, said Heyit was under investigation for endangering state security. He was one of the first of a string of Uighur musicians and cultural figures to have been detained in Xinjiang. The folk singer, while employed by a government entertainment troupe, was known for veering into politics with songs such as Stubborn Guest, a thinly veiled reference to Chinese control of Xinjiang. In another song called Query of the Conscience, he sings: \u201cWhen my conscience asks what I live for, I will answer: for my people, my homeland.\u201d",

While its remit is global, European cinema obviously features heavily. On the menu at time of writing: Greek film-maker Babis Makridis\u2019s vicious, Sundance-acclaimed black comedy Pity; Wim Wenders\u2019 early existential thriller The Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick; and the little-seen Ingmar Bergman chamber piece Crisis. A subscription is \u00a37.99 a month; in the Rentals section, non-subscribers can access more than 150 pay-per-view films \u2013 from Jean-Luc Godard to Portuguese post-modernist Miguel Gomes \u2013 for \u00a33.49 a go. BFI Player You\u2019d expect a strong selection of classic and world cinema from the British Film Institute, and its attractively designed streaming service delivers \u2013 retaining the diverse, academic-but-accessible programming spirit of its cinema venues and DVD collection. It is obviously the go-to platform for British cinema history, showcasing its extensive archive \u2013 including shorts, newsreels and assorted curios \u2013 for free. Elsewhere, the film selection is rich on canon titles: the Italian Classics section includes works by Fellini, Pasolini, Antonioni, Rossellini et al, while Euro auteurs such as \u00c9ric Rohmer and Rainer Werner Fassbinder have their own dedicated collections. A running strand, selected and introduced by the Observer\u2019s Mark Kermode, covers classics like Carl Theodor Dreyer\u2019s Ordet and modern beauties such as Andrey Zvyagintsev\u2019s Elena. Subscriptions are \u00a34.99 a month. Curzon Home Cinema As befits the UK\u2019s leading arthouse cinema chain, Curzon Artificial Eye\u2019s home streaming service is a classy affair, balancing a smallish back catalogue with a range of current cinema releases simultaneously available to view at home \u2013 a godsend to discerning film-goers who live outside metropolitan areas. French director Catherine Corsini\u2019s heart-walloping melodrama An Impossible Love and Lars von Trier\u2019s polarising The House That Jack Built are currently on that menu for \u00a310 and \u00a312, respectively. The library of older releases is indexed by actor, director, genre and country: France, for example, brings up an old-new Agn\u00e8s Varda double-feature of Cl\u00e9o From 5 to 7 and Faces Places \u2013 the former just \u00a33 to rent.

      "bodyText": "Michaelia Cash\u2019s former media adviser has admitted in court that he leaked details of a federal police raid on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union but declined to say who tipped him off. A high-profile federal court trial has begun to determine the legality of Australian federal police raids on the union\u2019s Melbourne and Sydney headquarters in October 2017. On Monday, the court heard that letters and communications sent by Cash, a senator and former employment minister in the Coalition government, and her office illustrate a \u201ckeen political interest\u201d in the AWU before its offices were raided by police. The raids, which were part of an investigation by the Registered Organisations Commission, drew scrutiny because tipped-off TV crews and journalists arrived at the offices before police. Cash\u2019s former media adviser, David De Garis, told the court on Monday he learned police were set to raid the union\u2019s offices about midday on 24 October. Asked who told him about the upcoming raids, De Garis replied: \u201cI respectfully decline to answer that question on the grounds it may incriminate me.\u201d The AWU claims the the investigation was illegal because it was politically motivated, allegedly instigated by Cash to hurt the union and the Labor leader, Bill Shorten. Cash sent two letters of referral to the commission in relation to the AWU in the months before the investigation was launched, the trial was told. \u201cThe underlying theme is there was a keen political interest on the part of the senator in the subject matter of the investigation,\u201d the AWU\u2019s lawyer Herman Borenstein QC told the trial on Monday. \u201cIt is demonstrated in the beginning by the letters and demonstrated again in October 2017 by communications ... and the media exploitation.\u201d The commission\u2019s legal counsel Frank Parry QC argued the media leaks about the raids, which came three days after the investigation was launched, were not relevant in determining the trial. He said the key issue was determining whether the investigation itself, launched by the commission executive director, Chris Enright, was deemed to be politically motivated. \u201cWhat goes on in the minister\u2019s office is a matter for the minister,\u201d Parry said. \u201cWhatever views the minister might have had about political advantage ... take the matter nowhere as far as the Registered Organisation Commission is concerned.\u201d De Garis, who quit Cash\u2019s office over the media leaks, began his testimony on Monday, detailing his work with journalists and ROC media representatives. Cash, who is now Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education, was expected to testify on Friday, with federal parliament sitting from Tuesday to Thursday. \u201cMichaelia Cash, after months of ducking and weaving, will herself give evidence,\u201d AWU\u2019s other lawyer Josh Bornstein said outside court. \u201cThere will be nowhere to hide for Michaelia Cash. There will be no whiteboards in the federal court.\u201d The raids were part of an investigation into a $100,000 donation from the union to activist group GetUp! in 2006. Cash denies any wrongdoing, saying she is happy to assist the court and that the AWU must still answer questions about the donations, which were made to GetUp while Shorten was the union\u2019s boss. The other witnesses to be called are the ROC\u2019s then-acting media adviser Mark Lee, Cash\u2019s former chief of staff Ben Davies and Enright. The federal police confirmed last month it would not lay charges against De Garis because there were \u201cno prospects of a conviction\u201d.",

His home \u2013 a single 10ft x 10ftroom \u2013 was right over the wall from the 10th hole of the members-only Bombay Presidency Golf Club, which sprawls across 100 acres of land: prime real estate in a city where the average population density is 31,700 people per sq km.</p> <p>When Mane was just 14, he dropped out of school to become a caddie on the other side of the wall. But it wasn\u2019t until three years later, when he was 17, that he took his first swing, when a club member handed him a 7 iron and told him to have a go. The 150-yard shot changed his life, he says: he realised golf was his shot at fame and glory, the chance of a better life.</p> <p>There was only one problem: the club didn\u2019t allow caddies to play on the course, insisting it would detract from its \u201cexclusivity\u201d.

Even if you don\u2019t have the money, we find a way.\u201d</p> <p>He got in touch with Mane, Mehboobani and four fellow slum golfers and invited them to Paris to represent India. The European teams playing in the tournament collectively pitched in to pay for the Indian team\u2019s flights, visas and hotel.</p> <p>The tournament took place in September 2018, and of the 10 national teams the Indians came in fifth.

When we stood fifth, the organisers surprised us with tickets to the Ryder Cup, where we got to see Tiger Woods play. That blew us away.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Mumbai, life goes on. Mane turned pro in 2010 and now teaches on the course, while most of his friends still caddie there, waking every morning at 5.30 to attend the lottery draw used to pick the day\u2019s caddies. On a good day they stand to earn 1,000 rupees (\u00a311), tips included.</p> <p>They dream of going pro like Mane, and indeed many professional players on the Indian circuit are former caddies from poor backgrounds. But professional tournaments are expensive to enter, often 50,000 rupees (\u00a3550) or more, and while a fortunate few manage to find corporate sponsors, the others must rely on private support from generous club members.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3716073aafe5f87a7106939ef62fd6085f3f0394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3716073aafe5f87a7106939ef62fd6085f3f0394/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Many of the slum golfers are also caddies, and dream of turning pro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many of the slum golfers are also caddies, and dream of turning pro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ritesh Uttamchandani</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Training, too, is expensive and time-consuming. \u201cYou need to hit at least 1,000 balls a day as part of your training to go pro,\u201d says Mehboobani.

The tournament took place in September 2018, and of the 10 national teams the Indians came in fifth. Even more than the result, they enjoyed the experience as a glimpse of a life removed from their everyday realities in Mumbai. \u201cWhat I loved best about Paris is that we felt free. The streets were clean, the traffic was orderly, we could play golf on the streets without a care,\u201d Mehboobani says. \u201cWe could even have a beer out in the open. When we stood fifth, the organisers surprised us with tickets to the Ryder Cup, where we got to see Tiger Woods play. That blew us away.\u201d Back in Mumbai, life goes on. Mane turned pro in 2010 and now teaches on the course, while most of his friends still caddie there, waking every morning at 5.30 to attend the lottery draw used to pick the day\u2019s caddies. On a good day they stand to earn 1,000 rupees (\u00a311), tips included. They dream of going pro like Mane, and indeed many professional players on the Indian circuit are former caddies from poor backgrounds. But professional tournaments are expensive to enter, often 50,000 rupees (\u00a3550) or more, and while a fortunate few manage to find corporate sponsors, the others must rely on private support from generous club members. Training, too, is expensive and time-consuming. \u201cYou need to hit at least 1,000 balls a day as part of your training to go pro,\u201d says Mehboobani. He says it is a luxury most cannot afford. Until then, they play slum golf. Mehboobani is the current undisputed champion. \u201cMy dream is to turn pro and win an international tournament,\u201d he says. \u201cThousands of caddies have come and gone over the decades. No one remembers them. No one knows who they were. I want to win a cup for my club and I want my name up there.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

Now it\u2019s feared up to 500,000 cattle, mostly from severely drought-stressed herds, have been killed in widespread flood waters. The full extent of the losses won\u2019t be known for weeks; some properties remain underwater and the flood waters are moving south. But the agricultural industry\u2019s peak body says the situation has already become \u201ca massive humanitarian crisis\u201d, affecting an area twice the size of Victoria. After a prolonged drought, some rural parts of Queensland received three years\u2019 worth of average rainfall in a week. At Eddington station near Julia Creek in western Queensland, Rachael Anderson says she lost about 2,000 cattle, roughly half the station\u2019s herd. Farmers know recovering from such stock losses will put them under severe financial stress. \u201cI can provide for my family right now,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut in six months\u2019 time or when the bank comes for their repayment, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, none of us know what we are going to do. \u201cWe can\u2019t get loans because we\u2019ve got nothing to borrow against, none of us have got anything left. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it will finish some people up, but others will be rebuilding.\u201d Parts of Eddington station have been badly eroded from the vast amount of flood water that washed through, and there are now dead cattle in the creek, which they had been using for water to brush their teeth and wash clothes. She said a rotting stench had set in, but farmers still don\u2019t know what to do with the livestock. \u201cThere are feral pigs that will come and eat that, there are feral cats that will come and eat that, and there will probably be a plague of them after this.\u201d The chief executive officer of AgForce, the peak body for the Queensland cattle industry, Michael Guerin, said farmers could take decades to recover. \u201cThere is no doubt that this is a disaster of unprecedented proportion,\u201d Guerin said. \u201cThe speed and intensity of the unfolding tragedy makes it hard to believe that it\u2019s just a week since farmers\u2019 elation at receiving the first decent rains in five years turned to horror at the devastating and unprecedented flood that quickly followed. \u201cThe latest reports confirm our earliest fears (that) this is a massive humanitarian crisis ... and is steadily expanding southwards.\u201d The group has sent emergency fodder to more than 150,000 head of cattle that have no other access to feed. Guerin said the full extent of livestock losses would not be known until the water fully recedes, but some estimates put losses up to 500,000 out of 10.5m head of cattle in Queensland. \u201cI implore governments of all levels, as well as other agencies involved in this mammoth undertaking, to put aside red tape, bureaucratic wrangling and patch protection, and understand the desperate situation of so many producers. \u201cThe loss of hundreds of thousands of cattle after five, six, seven years of drought is a debilitating blow not just to individual farmers, many of whom have lost literally everything, but to rural communities. \u201cSome farmers have lost everything, literally everything, except an ever-growing debt, and our first priority is to make sure that they are OK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thank governments and the Australian community for the support they have shown so far, but we need to ensure that farmers and the communities they keep alive are supported for the long haul.

      "bodyText": "Activists and residents fighting against a proposed coalmine in central New South Wales are hoping last week\u2019s historic judgment in the Rocky Hill case will sway the state\u2019s Independent Planning Commission to reject the project. The NSW land and environment court ruled last week Gloucester Resources\u2019 Rocky Hill coalmine in the state\u2019s Hunter Valley should not go ahead, in part because of its social impact on the town of Gloucester and because a new coalmine was not compatible with Australia\u2019s commitments under the Paris agreement. The planning commission has been considering plans by the South Korean company Kepco for an open-cut mine in the Bylong Valley, north-east of Mudgee. Late last year, the NSW department of environment and planning recommended the development be approved subject to strict conditions and referred it to the commission, which is due to make its decision soon. The proposed mine has been debated by farmers, environmentalists and residents, who have voiced concerns about the social impact, the greenhouse gas emissions from a new coal development, and also whether rejecting the mine could hurt employment in the region. The Rocky Hill decision was a \u201cfantastic shot in the arm for us\u201d, said Phill Kennedy, a farmer who lives in the Bylong Valley. \u201cThe Rocky Hill proposal was minuscule compared to Bylong, which is five times the size in terms of the emissions.\u201d Lawyers who acted in the Rocky Hill case for community group Groundswell Gloucester said the Bylong Valley development had similarities to their case. In his judgment, Chief Judge Brian Preston said a new open cut coalmine in the Gloucester Valley \u201cwould be in the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d. David Morris, the chief executive of NSW Environmental Defenders Office, which acted on behalf of Groundswell Gloucester, said there were a number of proposed mines being assessed in the state that \u201cshould now logically follow the approach outlined by Chief Judge Preston\u201d. \u201cThe one to my mind that is the closest comparison to the Gloucester project is the Bylong Valley mine,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is another scenic valley, it\u2019s another greenfield coal project. There\u2019s a whole raft of aspects of this decision in Rocky Hill which would seem broadly applicable to the project proposed in the Bylong Valley.\u201d Morris said other proposals where the case could prove relevant were Whitehaven\u2019s Vickery extension project, Peabody\u2019s Wambo joint venture and the Hume coal project. Gloucester Resources has 28 days to decide if it will appeal the court\u2019s decision. The NSW Minerals Council has rejected the suggestion the case will have widespread ramifications. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a close look at the judgment, including what appears to be a range of different reasons for the outcome,\u201d said Stephen Galilee, the council\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t believe this is in any way a \u2018landmark case\u2019, given the department of planning had already recommended against the approval of the project.\u201d But George Woods, the NSW coordinator of the anti-mining action group Lock the Gate Alliance, said communities would be looking to the Independent Planning Commission for \u201cleadership and direction\u201d in the wake of the court\u2019s decision. \u201cBylong is the very next decision the commission will make about a new mine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019d hope is this judgment would prompt the commission to seek advice that would put the emissions from Bylong in the context of a carbon budget consistent with meeting the Paris agreement.\u201d Brendan Sydes, the chief executive of Environmental Justice Australia, said the Rocky Hill case was \u201cdramatically different in the sense that every argument that has been successfully put forward by mining companies in the past has been completely considered, discredited and rejected\u201d. He said that included considering the impact of emissions from coal that was exported and burned elsewhere, as well as the argument that if coal was not dug up and burned from one mine, it would simply happen somewhere else. \u201cWe now have this anomalous situation that the most up-to-date and thoroughgoing analysis of the impact of new coalmines by an Australian court has adopted reasoning in a manner that\u2019s inconsistent with the reasoning that has been adopted to support the approval of the Adani mine,\u201d Sydes said.

You might read this novel as a Hampstead version of <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>: an elegy for a more intimate, less frenzied London, where people had time to pay attention to their feelings. As Lydia reflects: \u201cOur bourgeois sensibility. All our sadness and our subtlety, our complicated arrangements. Our privilege of subtlety and irony is at an end.

Does that sound insane?\u201d There\u2019s a lovely stillness to Hadley\u2019s writing, like an old house with many rooms. You might read this novel as a Hampstead version of The Cherry Orchard: an elegy for a more intimate, less frenzied London, where people had time to pay attention to their feelings. As Lydia reflects: \u201cOur bourgeois sensibility. All our sadness and our subtlety, our complicated arrangements. Our privilege of subtlety and irony is at an end. What\u2019s in that Polish poem Alex quotes? Something about how the barbarians don\u2019t object to irony. They just grind it up and use it as their salt.\u201d \u2022 Late in the Day by Tessa Hadley is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a316.99).

That included income from Russian sources.</p> <p>Records indicate that between 2006 and 2013, Navka and Zhulin paid only $1,168 in federal taxes to the US on a combined income \u2013 spanning wages, business profits, rental property revenue and gains from property sales \u2013 of $3.4m. While some of the income was taxed in Russia instead, they also reduced their US bills with tax credits and generous write-offs legally<strong> </strong>available to landlords.</p> <p>In July 2009, Navka and Zhulin announced that they had separated. In 2010, Zhulin <a href=\"https://life.ru/t/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/39253\">confirmed the split</a>. Their divorce took place that July at Moscow\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_courts/20110601/252811526.html\">Khamovnichesky district court</a>.</p> <p>Yet tax records appear to suggest they continued to file US tax returns as a married couple for several more years.

      "bodyText": "Questions have been raised about the US tax affairs of the wife of Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, after records suggested she may have failed to declare her true income to US regulators and not disclosed foreign bank accounts. Tatiana Navka, a former Olympic ice dancing champion, also appears to have wrongly claimed a potentially beneficial US tax status, according to an investigation by the Guardian. Court papers suggest she separately built up tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid property taxes on a house she told US authorities she had already sold. Navka lived and trained in the US for more than a decade. In 2015, having returned to Russia, she married Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s longtime press secretary and the Kremlin\u2019s deputy chief of staff. On Wednesday the investigative unit Dossier Center, together with the Guardian, revealed that Navka had accumulated a property portfolio worth at least $10m (\u00a37.7m). Navka declined to answer specific questions from the Guardian about her US tax affairs. She said: \u201cIn your previous newspaper article you didn\u2019t use my answers and commentary, which I sent. Apparently, your newspaper doesn\u2019t strive for objectivity. Consequently I don\u2019t see the point of further answering your questions. \u201cYour assertions contain a whole series of untrue and inaccurate details. Moreover, there is much personal information, publication of which is prosecutable under Russian, US and UK law.\u201d Navka moved to the US in the 1990s with her then husband and coach Alexander Zhulin. The couple based themselves in New Jersey and bought several properties there and in neighbouring New York. In 2004, they purchased a loft apartment in Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cTrump Parc\u201d complex beside Central Park in Manhattan. The following year, they bought a two-bedroom apartment in The Milan, a luxury block on Second Avenue. Navka, 43, was a permanent US resident from at least 2006 until September 2015, when she notified the Department of Homeland Security she had left for Moscow. During this period she was still obliged to file annual tax returns in the US and to declare her global earnings. That included income from Russian sources. Records indicate that between 2006 and 2013, Navka and Zhulin paid only $1,168 in federal taxes to the US on a combined income \u2013 spanning wages, business profits, rental property revenue and gains from property sales \u2013 of $3.4m. While some of the income was taxed in Russia instead, they also reduced their US bills with tax credits and generous write-offs legally available to landlords. In July 2009, Navka and Zhulin announced that they had separated. In 2010, Zhulin confirmed the split. Their divorce took place that July at Moscow\u2019s Khamovnichesky district court. Yet tax records appear to suggest they continued to file US tax returns as a married couple for several more years. Married couples in the US may pool their allowances and benefit from some tax breaks that are unavailable to single people. The pair appear to have continued filing tax returns as if they were married until at least 2013, and appeared to make use of child tax credits and tax-free allowances for rental properties at the higher rates offered to married couples. It is not clear whether or not they would have owed more tax if they had filed as single. Bill Parish, an Oregon-based investment adviser who has worked as a tax consultant to US government investigators, said married taxpayers are treated very differently than single filers. \u201cThere is huge amounts of law based around that,\u201d said Parish. \u201cMillions of ordinary taxpayers who get divorced have to go through the pain of untangling their finances to resume filing as single.\u201d Navka and Zhulin also declared to the IRS in 2009 that they had sold a house they owned in New Jersey that year for $1.2m. The stated price was lower than the $1.35m they had paid for the home three years earlier, allowing the couple to declare a loss. Yet records from local authorities suggest that the couple did not actually sell the property, and continued to own it until it was finally repossessed by their bank on 4 January this year. Court filings in the repossession case said that by then, Navka and Zhulin owed more than $128,000 for a decade\u2019s unpaid property taxes, in addition to a $1.3m mortgage, and $120,000 in utility bills, insurance premiums and other charges. Navka appears to have grown increasingly worried about her US tax situation. In February 2016, she hired a Russian-speaking accountant based in New York, Ilya Bykov, to review her tax status and to sell her Manhattan flat. Bykov\u2019s clients include Aras Agalarov, the Azeri-Russian property tycoon who hosted Donald Trump during his 2013 visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe contest. Navka and Peskov have hired a US architect, Bob Zampolin, to design a riverside palace on Agalarov\u2019s exclusive Moscow estate. According to documents seen by the Guardian, Bykov and his firm Protax Services agreed to help sell Navka\u2019s New York condominium. He gave a likely valuation of $2.3m.

Bykov urged her to accept a quick offer and warned authorities might \u201cseize the property\u201d as part of a claim against her for back taxes, documents show. He also said her apparent failure to declare foreign bank accounts on time could be a \u201cserious violation\u201d. This may have been a reference to three Swiss bank accounts that documents show Navka opened in February 2014. The accounts were with the Zurich branch of the Banque Internationale \u00e0 Luxembourg and in dollars, euros and roubles.

      "body": "<p>Work is one of the biggest sources of stress in our lives, second only to health problems, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/14/three-in-four-britons-felt-overwhelmed-by-stress-survey-reveals\" title=\"\">survey for the Mental Health Foundation</a> last year. What work and productivity coaches call \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/language_corner/overwhelming-overwhelm-whelm-grammar-noun-verb.php\" title=\"\">overwhelm</a>\u201d is widespread, as notifications, conversations, distractions and interruptions all get in the way of actually getting stuff done. And not getting stuff done because you are overwhelmed is sure only to make matters worse.</p> <p>One response favoured by productivity gurus is microscheduling \u2013 creating a deliberate and detailed roster of work, broken down not by weeks and days but hours or even minutes. This goes far beyond most people\u2019s idea of being organised: compulsively writing to-do lists (and, usually, instantly losing track of them). How does anyone stick to such a finely detailed plan? And does it make work \u2013 and life \u2013 any easier?</p> <p>Elaine Lui is the fast-talking founder of the celebrity news site <a href=\"https://www.laineygossip.com/\" title=\"\">Laineygossip</a>. She wakes up every day between 4.30am and 5.30am, but will, if she needs to, stay up all night to finish a book or, say, cover the Golden Globes. Normal days for her are broken up into mostly 10- to 15-minute chunks. The smallest slot is three minutes, to go to the toilet; the longest, her weekly 90-minute email session.</p> <p>It started in 2013, when Lui was asked to be the co-host of CTV\u2019s talkshow The Social, which she describes as Canada\u2019s answer to Loose Women. She was already working on a book, writing or editing upwards of 3,000 words a day for her website, contributing to another CTV show and recording two weekly podcasts. Despite being a natural overachiever whose parents drummed the importance of structure into her from an early age, she realised she would have to raise her game if she was to fit in a daily live show on top of everything else. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to really drill down into very precise slots of time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lui admits that she does have downtime \u2013 at the weekends, when she makes the most of her ability to nap on demand. But, from Monday to Friday, her intense schedule leaves little time for basic human stuff such as saying hello to a colleague by the coffee machine or running late. \u201cIf someone gets to a 10am meeting at 10.02, I\u2019m not very patient,\u201d she says. It also makes the idea of having children unfathomable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"756470dfafeb152827fe5cfce46c4f2257457788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/756470dfafeb152827fe5cfce46c4f2257457788/854_0_3712_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casey Neistat, YouTube blogger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casey Neistat\u2019s YouTube video about how he manages his day has been seen 2.6m times</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RJ Sangosti/Denver Post via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another example of the limitations of microscheduling comes from Hussein Kesvani, a London-based editor and writer. Last year, faced with a seemingly insurmountable workload, he tried to follow the YouTuber Casey Neistat\u2019s brand of extreme hyperactivity. Neistat has \u201cWork harder\u201d written in big neon letters on the wall in his studio and tattooed on his left wrist, \u201cjust in case I forget\u201d; his left arm also displays another tattoo, saying \u201cDo more\u201d.

From a 5am start, Neistat\u2019s schedule goes: one hour of email; three hours of exercise (which he says makes up for the little sleep he gets); 10 hours of work; three hours for family (to, say, \u201cput the baby to bed\u201d); another three hours for work; and, from 1am, four hours of sleep.

      "bodyText": "Work is one of the biggest sources of stress in our lives, second only to health problems, according to a survey for the Mental Health Foundation last year. What work and productivity coaches call \u201coverwhelm\u201d is widespread, as notifications, conversations, distractions and interruptions all get in the way of actually getting stuff done. And not getting stuff done because you are overwhelmed is sure only to make matters worse. One response favoured by productivity gurus is microscheduling \u2013 creating a deliberate and detailed roster of work, broken down not by weeks and days but hours or even minutes. This goes far beyond most people\u2019s idea of being organised: compulsively writing to-do lists (and, usually, instantly losing track of them). How does anyone stick to such a finely detailed plan? And does it make work \u2013 and life \u2013 any easier? Elaine Lui is the fast-talking founder of the celebrity news site Laineygossip. She wakes up every day between 4.30am and 5.30am, but will, if she needs to, stay up all night to finish a book or, say, cover the Golden Globes. Normal days for her are broken up into mostly 10- to 15-minute chunks. The smallest slot is three minutes, to go to the toilet; the longest, her weekly 90-minute email session. It started in 2013, when Lui was asked to be the co-host of CTV\u2019s talkshow The Social, which she describes as Canada\u2019s answer to Loose Women. She was already working on a book, writing or editing upwards of 3,000 words a day for her website, contributing to another CTV show and recording two weekly podcasts. Despite being a natural overachiever whose parents drummed the importance of structure into her from an early age, she realised she would have to raise her game if she was to fit in a daily live show on top of everything else. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to really drill down into very precise slots of time,\u201d she says. Lui admits that she does have downtime \u2013 at the weekends, when she makes the most of her ability to nap on demand. But, from Monday to Friday, her intense schedule leaves little time for basic human stuff such as saying hello to a colleague by the coffee machine or running late. \u201cIf someone gets to a 10am meeting at 10.02, I\u2019m not very patient,\u201d she says. It also makes the idea of having children unfathomable. Another example of the limitations of microscheduling comes from Hussein Kesvani, a London-based editor and writer. Last year, faced with a seemingly insurmountable workload, he tried to follow the YouTuber Casey Neistat\u2019s brand of extreme hyperactivity. Neistat has \u201cWork harder\u201d written in big neon letters on the wall in his studio and tattooed on his left wrist, \u201cjust in case I forget\u201d; his left arm also displays another tattoo, saying \u201cDo more\u201d. In 2015, he detailed his daily routine in a video that has since racked up 2.6m views. From a 5am start, Neistat\u2019s schedule goes: one hour of email; three hours of exercise (which he says makes up for the little sleep he gets); 10 hours of work; three hours for family (to, say, \u201cput the baby to bed\u201d); another three hours for work; and, from 1am, four hours of sleep. Free time, he says, is the enemy of progress, which is why he has eliminated it entirely from his life. Judging from this, Neistat seems to have also eliminated commuting, shopping, cooking, cleaning, school runs and all the other tasks that interrupt most people\u2019s working lives. And that, in part, is where Kesvani\u2019s attempt to live like Neistat ran aground. Although he could make the rigid schedule work in theory \u2013 \u201cI could plan out everything out; I knew when everything was coming,\u201d he says \u2013 the events he couldn\u2019t control (such as a late train, or not getting a seat when he was supposed to be working) would derail his entire day. Having to reschedule, even as the work piled up, nearly destroyed him. He ended up in therapy, where he finally asked himself why he had taken on so much work in the first place.

She has called the plan \u201ca complete outrage\u201d and accused Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS trust of \u201cclosing it by stealth\u201d by shutting it temporarily from time to time as part of a deliberate attempt to drive down the number of women using it. But Martin Barkley, the trust\u2019s chief executive, insists that the fact that only three or four births a week happen at the Friarwood means it is right to review its existence. The Halcyon birth centre in Smethwick is also being shut. Births have also been \u201ctemporarily\u201d suspended at Shropshire\u2019s three birth centres, at Bridgnorth, Oswestry and Ludlow, since last year. Again, there are questions over whether any will reopen.",

Car manufacturers tend to invest in cycles of roughly seven years, meaning companies that started production of new models more than three years ago face imminent decisions on where to invest next. Investment decisions in plants such as Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port and Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Castle Bromwich are particularly finely balanced because the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU is still unclear, according to car experts. The global car industry is bracing for a period of near unprecedented upheaval in the coming years, as the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles picks up pace. In the shorter term, the political backlash against diesel following emissions cheating scandals and weaker demand in China have also put many manufacturers on the back foot.

PSA, the French group which also owns Peugeot and Citroen, will make a decision on whether to produce its next generation at Ellesmere Port after Brexit, although the UK faces stiff competition from other European factories for the work.

But what\u2019s going on inside our heads when we fall in love?</p> <p>The American anthropologist Helen Fisher describes the obsessive attachment we experience in love as \u201csomeone camping out in your head\u201d.</p> <p>In a groundbreaking experiment, Fisher and colleagues at Stony Brook University in New York state put 37 people who were madly in love into an MRI scanner. Their work showed that romantic love causes a surge of activity in brain areas that are rich in dopamine, the brain\u2019s feelgood chemical. These included the caudate nucleus, part of the reward system, and an ancient brain area called the ventral tegmental area, or VTA. \u201c[The VTA] is part of the reptilian core of the brain, associated with wanting, motivation, focus and craving,\u201d Fisher said in a 2014 talk on the subject. Similar brain areas light up during the rush of euphoria after taking cocaine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ea82cf62b97842c1620af83efc380785ea3661b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ea82cf62b97842c1620af83efc380785ea3661b/0_133_5018_3011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MRI scan of human brain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MRI scans of the brains of those in love found surges of activity of dopamine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daisy-Daisy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the early stages of love, the emotional excitement (or some might say stress) raises the body\u2019s cortisol levels, causing a racing heart, butterflies in our stomach and inconveniently sweaty palms. Other chemicals in play are oxytocin, which deepens feelings of attachment, and vasopressin, which has been linked to trust, empathy and sexual monogamy.</p> <h2><strong>So it\u2019s a total eclipse of the head, not the heart?</strong></h2> <p>Actually \u2026 in a case of science imitating poetry, the heart has been found to influence the way we experience emotion.</p> <p>Our brain and heart are known to be in close communication. When faced with a threat or when we spot the object of our affection in a crowded room, our heart races. But recently, scientists have turned the tables and shown that feedback from our heart to our brain also influences what we are feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfc1fa00ff1369222d1db347811cfc2dd800cfcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfc1fa00ff1369222d1db347811cfc2dd800cfcf/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman makes a heart shape with her hands during a partial eclipse of the sun\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What the heart is doing can influence how strongly our brain processes emotion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Borja Suarez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One study, led by <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/103603/publications\">Prof Sarah Garfinkel</a> of the University of Sussex, showed that cardiovascular arousal \u2013 the bit of the heart\u2019s cycle when it is working hardest \u2013 can intensify feelings of fear and anxiety. In this study, people were asked to identify scary or neutral images while their heartbeats were tracked. Garfinkel found they reacted quicker to the scary images when their heart was contracting and pumping blood, compared with when it was relaxing. Her work suggests that electrical signals from blood vessels around the heart feed back into brain areas involved in emotional processing, influencing how strongly we think we\u2019re feeling something.</p> <p>Finally, in what must be a contender for one of the most romantic (or mushy) scientific insights to date, couples have been shown to have a tendency to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167876012006290\">synchronise heartbeats and breathing</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Why is it a crazy little thing?</strong></h2> <p>Love is merely a madness, Shakespeare wrote. But it is only recently that scientists have offered an explanation for why being in love might inspire unusual behaviour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/love1/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Box 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/love1/embed.html\">Box 1</a> </figure>  <p>Donatella Marazziti, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pisa, approached this question after carrying out research showing that people with obsessive compulsive disorder have, on average, lower levels of the brain chemical serotonin in their blood. She wondered whether a similar imbalance could underlie romantic infatuation.</p> <p>She recruited people with OCD, healthy controls and 20 people who had embarked on a romantic relationship within the previous six months (it was also specified that they should not have had sexual intercourse and that at least four hours a day were spent thinking of the partner). Both the OCD group and the volunteers who were in love had significantly lower levels of serotonin, and the authors concluded \u201cthat being in love literally induces a state which is not normal\u201d. When the \u201cin love\u201d group were followed up six months later, most of their serotonin levels had returned to normal.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-scans-reveal-why-love-makes-us-stupid-243476\">separate study</a> found that people in love have much lower activity in their frontal cortex \u2013 an area of the brain crucial to reason and judgment \u2013 when they thought of their loved one. Scientists have speculated an evolutionary reason for this which could be termed the \u201cbeer goggles\u201d theory: the suspension of reason makes coupling, and hence procreation, far more likely.</p> <h2><strong>So <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qdz-dqc7A4\">all in love is fair</a> \u2013 regardless of sexual orientation?</strong></h2> <p>Sexual orientation has several components, including behaviour, identity, attraction and arousal.</p> <p>Many scientific studies have been based on who people say they are attracted to, and surveys typically find that same-sex attraction accounts for fewer than 5% of the population, and this figure has remained relatively stable over time. But people\u2019s behaviour and the labels they use to describe their sexual identity appear to be influenced to a greater degree by social and cultural factors.</p> <p>For instance, in the UK there has been a sharp rise in the proportion of women reporting having had a sexual experience with another woman, from 1.8% in 1991 to 7.9% in 2013, according to the <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/themed/natsal\">National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles</a>, which is carried out each decade.</p> <p>As with any scientific investigation, the way questions are framed also makes a difference to the answer. So studies that ask people to pick between two or three categories would miss any more <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1529100616637618\">subtle gradations</a>. As Kinsey wrote in 1948: \u201cThe living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects. The sooner we learn this concerning human sexual behaviour, the sooner we shall reach a sound understanding of the realities of sex.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"413bb809c3ae68906bd197d65c25b62f82e0790d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/413bb809c3ae68906bd197d65c25b62f82e0790d/0_0_5160_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lesbian couple at beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women are considerably more likely than men to rate themselves on a continuum of sexuality,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Edwards/Getty Images/Caiaimage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is growing support for the idea of a continuum, in particular for women who are considerably more likely than men to rate themselves as intermediate categories such as \u201cmostly heterosexual\u201d (10% v 4%), when given those options.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2011/jan/love-its-all-same-brain\">a 2011 study</a> found no differences between brain systems regulating romantic love in homosexuals and heterosexuals.</p> <h2><strong>Is there a gay gene?</strong></h2> <p>It has been known for decades that sexual orientation is partly heritable in men, based on studies of identical and fraternal twins. In the 1990s, a specific region of the X chromosome was linked to male homosexuality and more recent two specific genes have been found to be more common in gay men.</p> <p>However, the genetic factors that have been identified so far only play a small part in determining sexuality \u2013 not all men who have these genes are gay. Research on the genetic basis of female sexuality lags behind, which some have attributed to it being more difficult to study. Others might conclude that there has simply been less effort to understand this topic.</p> <p>There are other biological factors at play as well. One of the most robust findings in sexual-orientation research is the fraternal-birth-order effect: gay men tend to have a greater number of older brothers compared with straight men. This is a biological influence rather than a social one and is a big effect, increasing the odds of a man being gay by roughly a third. In women, there is evidence that pre-natal hormone exposure can make a difference to sexual orientation.</p> <h2><strong>Let\u2019s get chemical: do humans give off pheromones?</strong></h2> <p>Pheromones are chemical signals that are used to communicate and alter the behaviour of others. The first pheromone discovered, in the 1950s, was a substance called bombykol that female silkworms emit to attract males. Ever since then, the search has been on \u2013 not least by perfume manufacturers \u2013 to find a human equivalent. There have been some tentative claims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2a291165d39d9a98e6e6abf8046e62f932f846c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2a291165d39d9a98e6e6abf8046e62f932f846c/0_0_3248_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gloucester Old Spot boar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pheromone present in male pigs, androstenone, has also been found in the human armpit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Pepler/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For instance, a known pig pheromone, androstenone, has been found in the human armpit. When female pigs on heat get a whiff of the substance, which is found in boars\u2019 saliva, they adopt the mating stance. However, there is not yet any convincing evidence for real-life \u201cLynx effect\u201d chemicals in men and women.

      "bodyText": "What do you get when you fall in love? We crave romantic love like nothing else, we\u2019ll make unimaginable sacrifices for it and it can take us from a state of ecstasy to deepest despair. But what\u2019s going on inside our heads when we fall in love? The American anthropologist Helen Fisher describes the obsessive attachment we experience in love as \u201csomeone camping out in your head\u201d. In a groundbreaking experiment, Fisher and colleagues at Stony Brook University in New York state put 37 people who were madly in love into an MRI scanner. Their work showed that romantic love causes a surge of activity in brain areas that are rich in dopamine, the brain\u2019s feelgood chemical. These included the caudate nucleus, part of the reward system, and an ancient brain area called the ventral tegmental area, or VTA. \u201c[The VTA] is part of the reptilian core of the brain, associated with wanting, motivation, focus and craving,\u201d Fisher said in a 2014 talk on the subject. Similar brain areas light up during the rush of euphoria after taking cocaine. During the early stages of love, the emotional excitement (or some might say stress) raises the body\u2019s cortisol levels, causing a racing heart, butterflies in our stomach and inconveniently sweaty palms. Other chemicals in play are oxytocin, which deepens feelings of attachment, and vasopressin, which has been linked to trust, empathy and sexual monogamy. So it\u2019s a total eclipse of the head, not the heart? Actually \u2026 in a case of science imitating poetry, the heart has been found to influence the way we experience emotion. Our brain and heart are known to be in close communication. When faced with a threat or when we spot the object of our affection in a crowded room, our heart races. But recently, scientists have turned the tables and shown that feedback from our heart to our brain also influences what we are feeling. One study, led by Prof Sarah Garfinkel of the University of Sussex, showed that cardiovascular arousal \u2013 the bit of the heart\u2019s cycle when it is working hardest \u2013 can intensify feelings of fear and anxiety. In this study, people were asked to identify scary or neutral images while their heartbeats were tracked. Garfinkel found they reacted quicker to the scary images when their heart was contracting and pumping blood, compared with when it was relaxing. Her work suggests that electrical signals from blood vessels around the heart feed back into brain areas involved in emotional processing, influencing how strongly we think we\u2019re feeling something. Finally, in what must be a contender for one of the most romantic (or mushy) scientific insights to date, couples have been shown to have a tendency to synchronise heartbeats and breathing. Why is it a crazy little thing? Love is merely a madness, Shakespeare wrote. But it is only recently that scientists have offered an explanation for why being in love might inspire unusual behaviour. Donatella Marazziti, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pisa, approached this question after carrying out research showing that people with obsessive compulsive disorder have, on average, lower levels of the brain chemical serotonin in their blood. She wondered whether a similar imbalance could underlie romantic infatuation. She recruited people with OCD, healthy controls and 20 people who had embarked on a romantic relationship within the previous six months (it was also specified that they should not have had sexual intercourse and that at least four hours a day were spent thinking of the partner). Both the OCD group and the volunteers who were in love had significantly lower levels of serotonin, and the authors concluded \u201cthat being in love literally induces a state which is not normal\u201d. When the \u201cin love\u201d group were followed up six months later, most of their serotonin levels had returned to normal. A separate study found that people in love have much lower activity in their frontal cortex \u2013 an area of the brain crucial to reason and judgment \u2013 when they thought of their loved one. Scientists have speculated an evolutionary reason for this which could be termed the \u201cbeer goggles\u201d theory: the suspension of reason makes coupling, and hence procreation, far more likely. So all in love is fair \u2013 regardless of sexual orientation? Sexual orientation has several components, including behaviour, identity, attraction and arousal. Many scientific studies have been based on who people say they are attracted to, and surveys typically find that same-sex attraction accounts for fewer than 5% of the population, and this figure has remained relatively stable over time. But people\u2019s behaviour and the labels they use to describe their sexual identity appear to be influenced to a greater degree by social and cultural factors. For instance, in the UK there has been a sharp rise in the proportion of women reporting having had a sexual experience with another woman, from 1.8% in 1991 to 7.9% in 2013, according to the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, which is carried out each decade. As with any scientific investigation, the way questions are framed also makes a difference to the answer. So studies that ask people to pick between two or three categories would miss any more subtle gradations. As Kinsey wrote in 1948: \u201cThe living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects. The sooner we learn this concerning human sexual behaviour, the sooner we shall reach a sound understanding of the realities of sex.\u201d There is growing support for the idea of a continuum, in particular for women who are considerably more likely than men to rate themselves as intermediate categories such as \u201cmostly heterosexual\u201d (10% v 4%), when given those options. It\u2019s worth noting that a 2011 study found no differences between brain systems regulating romantic love in homosexuals and heterosexuals. Is there a gay gene? It has been known for decades that sexual orientation is partly heritable in men, based on studies of identical and fraternal twins. In the 1990s, a specific region of the X chromosome was linked to male homosexuality and more recent two specific genes have been found to be more common in gay men. However, the genetic factors that have been identified so far only play a small part in determining sexuality \u2013 not all men who have these genes are gay. Research on the genetic basis of female sexuality lags behind, which some have attributed to it being more difficult to study. Others might conclude that there has simply been less effort to understand this topic. There are other biological factors at play as well. One of the most robust findings in sexual-orientation research is the fraternal-birth-order effect: gay men tend to have a greater number of older brothers compared with straight men. This is a biological influence rather than a social one and is a big effect, increasing the odds of a man being gay by roughly a third. In women, there is evidence that pre-natal hormone exposure can make a difference to sexual orientation. Let\u2019s get chemical: do humans give off pheromones? Pheromones are chemical signals that are used to communicate and alter the behaviour of others. The first pheromone discovered, in the 1950s, was a substance called bombykol that female silkworms emit to attract males. Ever since then, the search has been on \u2013 not least by perfume manufacturers \u2013 to find a human equivalent. There have been some tentative claims. For instance, a known pig pheromone, androstenone, has been found in the human armpit. When female pigs on heat get a whiff of the substance, which is found in boars\u2019 saliva, they adopt the mating stance. However, there is not yet any convincing evidence for real-life \u201cLynx effect\u201d chemicals in men and women. The strongest contender to date for a human pheromone is a chemical secreted from glands in the nipples of breastfeeding mothers. When wafted under any sleeping baby\u2019s nose, the child responds with sucking and rooting behaviour. Your cheating heart \u2013 how uncommon is it? Cheating is widely disapproved of, but is not that uncommon. According to the University of Chicago\u2019s General Social Survey, men are on average more likely than women to be unfaithful \u2013 20% of men and 13% of women reported that they\u2019ve had sex with someone else while married. However, the figures shifted across age ranges, with women in the youngest age range (18-29) being marginally more likely (11% v 10%) to have cheated, with the widest gender gap in the 80+ range where 24% of men and just 6% of women said they had been unfaithful. Recently scientists have shown that some people may be genetically predisposed to being unfaithful. One study of nearly 7,400 Finnish twins and their siblings found a significant link between the vasopressin gene and infidelity in women. Another study, by scientists at the Kinsey Institute, in Indiana, showed that certain variants of the gene for the dopamine receptor were more likely to be unfaithful and also more likely to be repeatedly unfaithful.

      "bodyText": "On Monday evening, Michel Barnier will sit down to dinner in Brussels with his third Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. The British cabinet minister will come fresh from meetings with the alternative arrangements working group, a group of Tory MPs from across the party who believe there is something to the idea of the Malthouse compromise, a resurrection of the idea that technology could solve the Irish border issue. UK officials are playing down expectations. The thought of it has EU officials tearing their hair out. \u201cAfter two years, we have come full circle,\u201d said one EU diplomat. It had been a two-year hunt for this \u201cunicorn\u201d, said a second. In the immediate post-referendum confusion in the summer of 2016, Ireland\u2019s then prime minister, Enda Kenny, spoke of a \u201cvirtual border\u201d and \u201cways of dealing with modern technology in terms of checking trade\u201d. Technical work began in Dublin on automatic licence plate recognition systems and trusted trader schemes. London was on the same wavelength. \u201cIt will cost us a lot of work on technology to maintain border control on goods but without having border posts, but that\u2019s what we intend to do,\u201d the then Brexit secretary, David Davis, told MPs. But by February 2017, Kenny was exasperated by the lack of ideas from Downing Street, and alarmed by his first sighting of Irish studies on the feasibility of such a fix. Cameras for licence plate recognition would be a target for dissident groups, leading to the need for policing, and thus extra targets. To fight smuggling, which would be encouraged by the waiving of checks for small traders, customs officers would need to be present. \u201cThe administrative and fiscal burden on the traders involved cannot be underestimated,\u201d Ireland\u2019s Office of the Revenue Commissioners said. \u201cLet me be absolutely clear on one point,\u201d Kenny told a thinktank in Dublin. It was a \u201cvital national interest\u201d to avoid not only the border of the past but also a \u201cnew one in the future\u201d. \u201cThis is a political matter, not a legal or technical matter,\u201d he said. Irish officials were told to suspend their work. When the Brexit negotiations finally started in earnest in June 2017, after Theresa May\u2019s disastrous general election result, the EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, and the prime minister\u2019s chief Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, danced around the issue, mapping out where joint membership of the single market was vital to north-south cooperation. It was a steep learning curve. When May subsequently confirmed that Northern Ireland would require specific solutions for its unique circumstances, Brussels was encouraged that a realistic approach was emerging. An August 2017 paper from the UK pushed the case for keeping Northern Ireland in the single electricity market for starters \u2013 \u201cto keep the lights on\u201d \u2013 and nodded at the need for regulatory equivalence for agri-food measures to avoid checks on animals and plants. The basis of the single market aspect of the Irish backstop was already there. A political fix, not a technical one.

It\u2019s the oldest live venue on the island \u2013 celebrating its 65th year in 2019 \u2013 so it really was the forerunner of the club scene in Ibiza. \u2022 Only open in summer, lasdalias.es Beach town In the past, the port of Santa Eul\u00e0ria des Riu was regarded as a locals-only town, but in recent years some really great restaurants, bars, shops and hotels have popped up \u2013 and are about to be joined by a stylish 162-room W Hotel . The town is the gateway to some great beaches, villages and restaurants in the north. Cala Pada is a lovely little beach a few minutes\u2019 cycle out of town that\u2019s empty in the spring. My favourite club For a straight-up club tip I would recommend DC10, in the fields behind the airport. It\u2019s famous for the Circoloco techno party every Monday which feature huge DJ lineups, as does Paradise every Wednesday brought by UK DJ/producer Jamie Jones. There are no VIP tables \u2013 this place is for clubbers, where music rules supreme and nobody goes home until the last record has been played. \u2022 Entrance \u20ac35-\u20ac50, Carretera las salinas, km 1, Sant Josep de sa Talaia, dc10-ibiza.ibiza-clubs.net Back street boogie Tucked away behind the main taxi rank in Ibiza Town, Malanga Caf\u00e9 is a great alternative to the big club vibe and is open all year round. A favourite among locals, you\u2019ll find a lot of the Ibiza resident DJs dropping by to play a real cross-section of music throughout the week. The place only holds around 100 people which makes for a great atmosphere when it goes off. Admission is usually free and the bar prices are also reasonable \u2013 \u20ac2-3 for a ca\u00f1a (small beer). It\u2019s open until dawn, which makes for an interesting walk of shame home. \u2022 Carrer Carles V, 11, local 15, on Facebook Street art Urban In Ibiza is an exciting event organised by Paul \u201cDizzi\u201d Saunders, a former London promoter, in September. Each year it goes from strength to strength, with young artists showcasing their work alongside internationally established names. The event involves a lot of street/contemporary art on canvas combined with live painting and workshops featuring artists including Inkie, K-Guy, Jim Starr, Ben Allen, RYCA and Scott Gray. It takes place at venues such at Atzaro Agroturismo and HEART, and there are always great DJs and live music alongside the art. \u2022 urban-inibiza.squarespace.com Getting there The only direct winter flight from the UK is with British Airways from London City, but Vueling and Iberia fly via Palma, Madrid or Barcelona. Airlines including easyJet, Ryanair and Jet2 start flying direct to Ibiza in spring or early summer from various UK airports. When to go Ibiza is blissfully crowd-free in winter and beautiful in spring, when temperatures start to rise (highs of 22C in May). The clubbing season runs from late May to October. Prices Ibiza isn\u2019t cheap but avoid tourist haunts and you can eat at a taverna for around \u20ac15. Entry to top clubs can cost \u20ac60, with drinks from around \u20ac12.

The PM argued that her own Brexit plan \u201cexplicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union\u201d in terms of avoiding tariffs, while allowing \u201cdevelopment of the UK\u2019s independent trade policy beyond our economic partnership with the EU\u201d. She accepted a customs union could potentially have delivered her a Commons majority but at the serious risk of splitting her party. The letter comes amid a growing presumption that while May remains officially committed to putting a revised Brexit plan to MPs as soon as possible, in practice this is unlikely to happen before the end of February. Business leaders have called for quicker action, with the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, saying the UK is \u201cin the emergency zone of Brexit now\u201d and the confusion will not just affect jobs and investment, but harm the UK as a long-term business destination.</p> <p>The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, will say in a speech today that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/11/brexit-uk-military-defence-gavin-williamson\"> Brexit represents an opportunity for Britain to boost its global military standing </a>in response to the threats posed by Russia and China.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Business warns of cliff edge as exit date approaches Theresa May has effectively ruled out Labour\u2019s proposal for a Brexit compromise, stressing her objection to staying inside a customs union. \u201cI am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals?\u201d she wrote to Jeremy Corbyn. The PM argued that her own Brexit plan \u201cexplicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union\u201d in terms of avoiding tariffs, while allowing \u201cdevelopment of the UK\u2019s independent trade policy beyond our economic partnership with the EU\u201d. She accepted a customs union could potentially have delivered her a Commons majority but at the serious risk of splitting her party. The letter comes amid a growing presumption that while May remains officially committed to putting a revised Brexit plan to MPs as soon as possible, in practice this is unlikely to happen before the end of February. Business leaders have called for quicker action, with the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, saying the UK is \u201cin the emergency zone of Brexit now\u201d and the confusion will not just affect jobs and investment, but harm the UK as a long-term business destination. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, will say in a speech today that Brexit represents an opportunity for Britain to boost its global military standing in response to the threats posed by Russia and China. He will argue that a post-Brexit UK should redefine its role as a global power prepared to intervene against countries that \u201cflout international law\u201d, backed up by new military technologies and capabilities. Meanwhile, a new report by the Global Future thinktank that supports more open immigration has warned that Brexit could cost employers more than \u00a31bn in administration costs over five years. It warns the NHS could face \u00a3120m a year in additional costs to recruit overseas staff. It comes amid warnings of Brexit damaging police powers to detain foreign suspects and leave British fugitives in Europe beyond the law. \u201cCriminals are entrepreneurs of crime \u2026 if there is a gap to exploit I\u2019m sure some of them probably would,\u201d says assistant commissioner Richard Martin, who is leading national police preparations to cope with with the loss of key crime-fighting measures if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. * * * Baftas and Grammys \u2013 It\u2019s been a big night in the entertainment world with both ceremonies taking place within hours of each other. The Favourite almost reigned supreme, taking best actress (Olivia Colman), best British film, best production design, best supporting actress, best original screenplay and best costume design. Rachel Weisz also won best supporting actress. But the top award of the night, best picture, went to Roma, whose director, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, also won best director. Rami Malek won best actor for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. You can read about all the winners and losers here; and check out the best images from the red carpet and from the awards themselves. Across the Atlantic the Grammy awards were dominated by live performances by female artists. The host, Alicia Keys, opened the show by asking: \u201cCan I get some of my sisters in here tonight?\u201d as Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez joined her on stage. English singer and songwriter Dua Lipa won best new artist and Cardi B became the first solo woman to win best rap album for Invasion of Privacy. Childish Gambino\u2019s This Is America marks the first time a rap song has won for song of the year and record of the year. The night\u2019s biggest prize, album of the year, went to country artist Kacey Musgraves for Golden Hour. You can see all the winners here and catch all the best pictures from the night here. * * * Knife crime \u2013 London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, will today announce a pilot scheme where offenders will be tagged with tracking devices on release. The scheme, beginning on 18 February, will be used on up to 100 offenders deemed likely to reoffend in four London boroughs that have among the highest rates of knife crime \u2013 Lewisham, Lambeth, Croydon and Southwark. The tags will automatically check the movements of the offenders against the location of reported crimes and share significant matches with police. * * * \u2018The fighting was intense\u2019 \u2013 Fresh details have emerged about the attempted coup against the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in eastern Syria. Witnesses claim that foreign members of Isis lost a two-day battle with his bodyguards before being rounded up and executed. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, a witness said the clash took place in September in al Keshma, near the village of Baghouz, three months earlier than originally reported. * * * TV licences \u2013 Labour has urged the government to keep licences free for over-75s. The party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has told the PM that scrapping the benefit would represent a \u201chuge financial blow\u201d to millions of pensioners and breach a Conservative general election manifesto pledge. His intervention comes as a BBC consultation on whether to carry on with the scheme after government funding ends in 2020 is due to close on Tuesday. * * * \u2018Obligation chocolate\u2019 \u2013 Japanese women are pushing back against a tradition of giving male colleagues sweets on Valentine\u2019s Day. Giri choco literally means obligation chocolates. But now women are changing course, with growing evidence that giving chocolate to avoid causing offence has become intolerable for many. A recent survey found that instead around 60% of women will buy chocolates as a personal treat on 14 February. Bon app\u00e9tit.

Eddie Jones wasted no time lighting a fuse under England\u2019s potential Six Nations grand-slam decider against Wales on Saturday week after crushing France, while Warren Gatland says his Wales side\u2019s unconvincing win over Italy could pile expectations on England. England\u2019s women appear certainties for a grand slam after only two games following a ruthless display by their forwards and some sharp finishing by their backs in a destruction of Six Nations champions France. Mark Wood took a Test-best five for 41 to put England in control of the third Test against West Indies.

This new four-parter sees Penny Lancaster, Made in Chelsea\u2019s Jamie Laing, Goggleboxer Sandi Bogle, comic Marcus Brigstocke and presenter Katie Piper join the 120,000 volunteer officers helping to police our streets amid police cuts and rising crime.

This new four-parter sees Penny Lancaster, Made in Chelsea\u2019s Jamie Laing, Goggleboxer Sandi Bogle, comic Marcus Brigstocke and presenter Katie Piper join the 120,000 volunteer officers helping to police our streets amid police cuts and rising crime. Inevitably a taxing first shift tests the resolve of more than one of them. Gwilym Mumford MasterChef 9pm, BBC One Series 15 arrives and the recipe is the same as ever, but this year\u2019s chefs are a sparky bunch.

Hannah Verdier A Very British History: Romany Gypsies 9pm, BBC Four Writer Damian Le Bas, who is of Gypsy heritage, provides a 20th-century history of the community in the first of a series on UK minority groups. Aided by his nan, he recalls how, in the 60s, Gypsies swapped carts and campfires for a less transient life \u2013 one that was subject to a great deal of prejudice. GM The Walking Dead 9pm, Fox November\u2019s mid-season finale left us with a litany of lingering questions, not least how baddies the Whisperers tolerate the pong of going incognito by wearing the manky skin of the deceased. As the show returns, the groups band together to confront this new threat, while Negan remains on the lam. Luke Holland The Making of Me 10pm, Channel 4 At a time when any demystifying of transgender experience is to be welcomed, this straightforward doc follows transitioning adults over a three-year period. As well as practical considerations such as hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery and voice training, it deals with the impact on long-term partners.

      "body": "<h2>Dr Shahid Aziz</h2> <p><em>Consultant </em><em>cardiologist, North Bristol NHS </em><em>trust, Bristol</em></p> <p>I have always found sleep to be a physiological necessity for my mind and body to recover \u2013 a good sleep has a significantly positive impact on my sense of wellbeing the next day. When I started as a junior doctor, I accepted that working nights and being on call was part of the training culture. What I did not envisage was that I\u2019d still be having interrupted sleep 25 years later. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6625f0f813a96d5eaabb399c29b6b91675e7a271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6625f0f813a96d5eaabb399c29b6b91675e7a271/1249_454_1364_1705/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Shahid Aziz\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Shahid Aziz</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My job as an interventional cardiologist means that I am often called into the hospital from home after midnight to deal with patients having heart attacks. Often I\u2019m on call after a full day of routine work. Busy nights on call can take their toll on our physical and emotional wellbeing, and sleep recovery can take several days. I had a particularly challenging night recently when I was called in three times to deal with heart attacks and cardiac arrests. I felt too fatigued to go in for a routine day the next morning.</p> <p>One of the challenges we face as doctors is to recognise when we should or shouldn\u2019t be working. To make high-quality decisions for patient care, including for procedure-led specialities, you have to maintain a sharp focus. As a consultant, I also have to provide leadership to staff around me and communicate well with patients and their families.</p> <p><strong>Routine:</strong> To help me sleep, I like to exercise. I go to spinning classes, the gym and do road cycling a few times a week. I have the <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\" title=\"\">Calm meditation app</a> on my phone, which I use at night for a few minutes. This really helps me as I do stretching exercises. I write in my journal every night \u2013 it can be anything from random thoughts to reflections of gratitude. I avoid screens before bedtime and read 10-20 pages every night. Usually I fall asleep quickly but sometimes I use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/04/cosmic-orgasm-rise-of-conscious-breathing\" title=\"\">4-7-8 breathing exercises</a> to help me.</p> <h2>Harpz Kaur</h2> <p><em>Breakfast </em><em>show presenter on BBC Asian Network</em></p> <p>I\u2019m definitely a bad sleeper and found it very difficult to overcome once I was given the breakfast slot. I decided to join yoga classes to help me unwind and relax. I train at the gym regularly so that I know I will be tired enough by the end of the day to naturally want to sleep. </p> <p><strong>Routine:</strong> Changing the ambience of my home has been important. To make it a more relaxed atmosphere, I have calm/relaxation music playing through my speakers and light candles around the room. These little things make big differences. And I also make sure I am not doing too much throughout the day. I\u2019ve learned to put myself first and bear in mind that health literally is wealth.</p> <h2>Toyah Willcox</h2> <p><em>Singer and actor</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6f22e31e9a8cfe310734d02b7c7b8d66bbed0089\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f22e31e9a8cfe310734d02b7c7b8d66bbed0089/0_206_2433_2643/921.jpg\" alt=\"Toyah Willcox\" width=\"921\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toyah Willcox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have always had disrupted, broken sleep. Over a year, I could count on my fingers the times I have slept through the night. I don\u2019t think my insomnia is fixable: I think it\u2019s in my DNA. I cannot emphasise enough how important exercise is. I have to do at least a three-mile fast walk a day, usually in the afternoon. Movement is incredibly important in helping my body use up my energy. When I\u2019m disciplined enough, detoxing of stimulants and exercising is also a conscious part of my day. </p> <p><strong>Routine:</strong> I take books on learning to bed \u2013 music theory, colour theory \u2013 and usually my brain thinks, \u201cUm, I think I\u2019d rather turn off,\u201d than learn something. But my natural pattern is to sleep from 11pm-1am, then I\u2019m awake till 7am and I only get into deep sleep at around 7-10am. Instead of lying there praying to go to sleep all night, I get up and work. At 4am you do feel a bit jet-lagged and brain-dead, but it\u2019s a very practical time to go through my emails, pay the bills, get rid of the mundane tasks. And there\u2019s times in the summer when I\u2019m awake as the sun is rising and I think this is the best, this is absolutely wonderful. Of course, if you have a 9-5 job this is a real problem, but as a singer, it can work well for me.</p> <h2>Sarah Wood</h2> <p><em>Air traffic controller, Nats</em></p> <p>At my operational unit, the shift pattern is two early mornings, two late afternoons and two nights, followed by four days off. This requires you to swing your body clock forwards and back by 12 hours at least twice a week, so there is always going to be an effect on your sleep. I\u2019m an expert napper and don\u2019t find it odd to be sleeping at any time of the day or night. </p> <p>The key to coping with such varied shift work is to embrace the inevitable changes to your lifestyle \u2013 don\u2019t fight it. I try to be kind to myself and plan my life activities around what sleep I can expect the next night. A lot of people struggle with staying asleep for long enough after a night shift to feel refreshed.</p> <p><strong>Routine:</strong> My tip would be that you should prepare for sleep the moment you leave work. I wear sunglasses on the way home (as long as it\u2019s safe to do so) and ask my husband to leave all the curtains closed. I would recommend going through all the little things you would normally do. For example, if you like a hot drink before bed or to read a book, then do so, and wear your most comfortable pyjamas and some warm socks \u2013 comfort really is king.</p> <h2>Martha Kearney</h2> <p><em>Presenter, BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aed0d53d1bb75f84b10222a7380a8a01627e3125\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aed0d53d1bb75f84b10222a7380a8a01627e3125/0_494_7225_4335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Kearney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha Kearney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everybody asks me about my sleep pattern, so my friend Ben had a T-shirt printed for me. One side reads: \u201cActually I don\u2019t mind getting up at 3.30am.\u201d The other side says: \u201cThank you for asking.\u201d</p> <p>But luckily I am a lark. I used to find working on Newsnight really exhausting \u2013 live on air at 10.30pm, then a few drinks afterwards with the producers in the Green Room. It was often hard to get to sleep afterwards. A low point came one night after work when I found myself watching Big Brother live \u2013 the contestants were all asleep. I definitely get less sleep as I get older.</p> <p>Working on the Today show has had an effect too \u2013 it is very odd going to bed at 8pm, especially on New Year\u2019s Eve. Getting to sleep on the first night in a run of shifts is tricky.</p> <p><strong>Routine:</strong> I use an eye mask to block out the light, spray the pillow with lavender and put the radio on a timer. I also set three alarm clocks for 3.15am, after one morning when I overslept\u2026</p> <h2>Jack Trigger</h2> <p><em>Sailor</em></p> <p>Sleep is so unbelievably important in offshore sailing, probably the most important thing, in fact. Plenty of studies have shown what sleep deprivation does to you. When you apply that to solo offshore sailing, it becomes even more relevant. There is such a fine line in this sport between sleeping too little and underperforming or making errors as a result, and sleeping too much and compromising your performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4ea9267ffa6f1370bdd5196e55821017c6b142ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ea9267ffa6f1370bdd5196e55821017c6b142ac/9_254_2646_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Trigger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Trigger</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If I don\u2019t get enough sleep on a race, the consequences are huge. Physically, it can make you more susceptible to things such as sea sickness. But more than that, there\u2019s a point where everything compounds and your body just says \u201cno\u201d. But it\u2019s amazing what the body can do. My philosophy on sleep is to listen to your body. It\u2019s all about cognitive function. When I\u2019m sleep deprived, I stop making good decisions. I also have type 1 diabetes. Obviously that can be very difficult with offshore sailing, but it\u2019s supposed to be challenging and it certainly isn\u2019t impossible. I enjoy proving that it can be done.</p> <p><strong>Routine:</strong> How much sleep I get at sea will depend on the length and nature of the race. If I compete in a race over 24 hours, I won\u2019t sleep at all. For a three-day race, I\u2019ll sleep a little but not much. For races over three days, I\u2019ll try to get some sleep from the beginning so that I don\u2019t overexert myself too early on. Generally, I\u2019ll sleep 20-40 minutes every 2-3 hours. The longest I\u2019ll sleep at any one time will be 40 minutes and, if you take a race like the <a href=\"https://www.routedurhum.com/en\" title=\"\">Route du Rhum,</a> which I\u2019ve just finished, that was over 18 days. The longest I\u2019ve stayed awake during a race is probably about 62 hours.</p> <h2>Alice Robb</h2> <p><em>Author of Why We Dream</em></p> <p>When I was 22, I went through a period of pretty debilitating insomnia. I was sleeping only a few hours a night and I was basically miserable all the time. I got through that, thankfully, but I never took sleep for granted again. In 2011, I happened to find a book by lucid dream pioneer Stephen LaBerge, and I used his techniques to induce lucid dreams (dreams where you are aware within the dream that you are dreaming). I found that experience mind-boggling, and wanted to learn more about what\u2019s going on in the brain during lucid dreams as well as regular dreams.</p> <p>I started keeping a dream journal, and the entries quickly got longer and more detailed. Training myself to recall more of my dreams has improved my relationship with sleep. It\u2019s helped me appreciate that sleep isn\u2019t some dead zone \u2013 we\u2019re still thinking, fantasising, feeling. I went from being anxious about going to sleep to being excited to find out what I\u2019d dream.</p> <p><strong>Routine:</strong> We dream every time we have a REM cycle \u2013 four or five times a night \u2013 even if we forget most of them. Devoting a minute or two a day to thinking about dreams, or a pre-bed thought for your intention to remember them, can improve your dream recall. But the easiest way is to keep a dream journal and write in it first thing in the morning \u2013 before making coffee, before looking at your phone, before getting out of bed. Any bodily motion or engagement with the physical environment can jolt you out of your internal world and erase your memories from the night.</p> <h2>Shauna Coxsey</h2> <p><strong> </strong><em>Professional rock climber</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63f6a3e67787645eab5302466dd5ed354ae89e69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63f6a3e67787645eab5302466dd5ed354ae89e69/0_43_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shauna Coxsey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shauna Coxsey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Onil \u00a9IFSC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I love sleep. I value it a lot and I am very careful to ensure I get enough. I think most people are guilty of underestimating the power of sleep. But as an athlete, sleep becomes even more important. We need sleep to recover, to recharge, to train harder, to get better at our sport. It\u2019s easy to view sleep as a necessity rather than value it as something that contributes to your wellbeing. I think a lot of people have an unhealthy relationship with sleep; in a world that seems to be getting busier and busier, we often seem to be resenting the fact that it\u2019s necessary.</p> <p><strong>Routine:</strong> I generally go to bed pretty early and rarely struggle to get to sleep. I don\u2019t use my phone in bed \u2013 I think that is the best tip I could give anyone. Having a good sleep routine leading into a competition really helps. I know I\u2019m going in off a good bank of sleep, so if I have a bad sleep the night before, then that\u2019s OK. I see little point in getting stressed about not being able to sleep. I also know that I can perform well after a bad night\u2019s sleep because I\u2019ve done it before. </p> <h2>Rebecca Spaven</h2> <p><em>Baker, Brick House Bakery, </em><em>London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69c11eaa906a963cb50cd1de83fa9e3f627f9989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69c11eaa906a963cb50cd1de83fa9e3f627f9989/0_66_1024_702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Spaven\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Spavin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I do a bake shift, I\u2019m in from 3am to 10.30am.

      "bodyText": "Dr Shahid Aziz Consultant cardiologist, North Bristol NHS trust, Bristol I have always found sleep to be a physiological necessity for my mind and body to recover \u2013 a good sleep has a significantly positive impact on my sense of wellbeing the next day. When I started as a junior doctor, I accepted that working nights and being on call was part of the training culture. What I did not envisage was that I\u2019d still be having interrupted sleep 25 years later. My job as an interventional cardiologist means that I am often called into the hospital from home after midnight to deal with patients having heart attacks. Often I\u2019m on call after a full day of routine work. Busy nights on call can take their toll on our physical and emotional wellbeing, and sleep recovery can take several days. I had a particularly challenging night recently when I was called in three times to deal with heart attacks and cardiac arrests. I felt too fatigued to go in for a routine day the next morning. One of the challenges we face as doctors is to recognise when we should or shouldn\u2019t be working. To make high-quality decisions for patient care, including for procedure-led specialities, you have to maintain a sharp focus. As a consultant, I also have to provide leadership to staff around me and communicate well with patients and their families. Routine: To help me sleep, I like to exercise. I go to spinning classes, the gym and do road cycling a few times a week. I have the Calm meditation app on my phone, which I use at night for a few minutes. This really helps me as I do stretching exercises. I write in my journal every night \u2013 it can be anything from random thoughts to reflections of gratitude. I avoid screens before bedtime and read 10-20 pages every night. Usually I fall asleep quickly but sometimes I use 4-7-8 breathing exercises to help me. Harpz Kaur Breakfast show presenter on BBC Asian Network I\u2019m definitely a bad sleeper and found it very difficult to overcome once I was given the breakfast slot. I decided to join yoga classes to help me unwind and relax. I train at the gym regularly so that I know I will be tired enough by the end of the day to naturally want to sleep. Routine: Changing the ambience of my home has been important. To make it a more relaxed atmosphere, I have calm/relaxation music playing through my speakers and light candles around the room. These little things make big differences. And I also make sure I am not doing too much throughout the day. I\u2019ve learned to put myself first and bear in mind that health literally is wealth. Toyah Willcox Singer and actor I have always had disrupted, broken sleep. Over a year, I could count on my fingers the times I have slept through the night. I don\u2019t think my insomnia is fixable: I think it\u2019s in my DNA. I cannot emphasise enough how important exercise is. I have to do at least a three-mile fast walk a day, usually in the afternoon. Movement is incredibly important in helping my body use up my energy. When I\u2019m disciplined enough, detoxing of stimulants and exercising is also a conscious part of my day. Routine: I take books on learning to bed \u2013 music theory, colour theory \u2013 and usually my brain thinks, \u201cUm, I think I\u2019d rather turn off,\u201d than learn something. But my natural pattern is to sleep from 11pm-1am, then I\u2019m awake till 7am and I only get into deep sleep at around 7-10am. Instead of lying there praying to go to sleep all night, I get up and work. At 4am you do feel a bit jet-lagged and brain-dead, but it\u2019s a very practical time to go through my emails, pay the bills, get rid of the mundane tasks. And there\u2019s times in the summer when I\u2019m awake as the sun is rising and I think this is the best, this is absolutely wonderful. Of course, if you have a 9-5 job this is a real problem, but as a singer, it can work well for me. Sarah Wood Air traffic controller, Nats At my operational unit, the shift pattern is two early mornings, two late afternoons and two nights, followed by four days off. This requires you to swing your body clock forwards and back by 12 hours at least twice a week, so there is always going to be an effect on your sleep. I\u2019m an expert napper and don\u2019t find it odd to be sleeping at any time of the day or night. The key to coping with such varied shift work is to embrace the inevitable changes to your lifestyle \u2013 don\u2019t fight it. I try to be kind to myself and plan my life activities around what sleep I can expect the next night. A lot of people struggle with staying asleep for long enough after a night shift to feel refreshed. Routine: My tip would be that you should prepare for sleep the moment you leave work. I wear sunglasses on the way home (as long as it\u2019s safe to do so) and ask my husband to leave all the curtains closed. I would recommend going through all the little things you would normally do. For example, if you like a hot drink before bed or to read a book, then do so, and wear your most comfortable pyjamas and some warm socks \u2013 comfort really is king. Martha Kearney Presenter, BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Everybody asks me about my sleep pattern, so my friend Ben had a T-shirt printed for me. One side reads: \u201cActually I don\u2019t mind getting up at 3.30am.\u201d The other side says: \u201cThank you for asking.\u201d But luckily I am a lark. I used to find working on Newsnight really exhausting \u2013 live on air at 10.30pm, then a few drinks afterwards with the producers in the Green Room. It was often hard to get to sleep afterwards. A low point came one night after work when I found myself watching Big Brother live \u2013 the contestants were all asleep. I definitely get less sleep as I get older. Working on the Today show has had an effect too \u2013 it is very odd going to bed at 8pm, especially on New Year\u2019s Eve. Getting to sleep on the first night in a run of shifts is tricky. Routine: I use an eye mask to block out the light, spray the pillow with lavender and put the radio on a timer. I also set three alarm clocks for 3.15am, after one morning when I overslept\u2026 Jack Trigger Sailor Sleep is so unbelievably important in offshore sailing, probably the most important thing, in fact. Plenty of studies have shown what sleep deprivation does to you. When you apply that to solo offshore sailing, it becomes even more relevant. There is such a fine line in this sport between sleeping too little and underperforming or making errors as a result, and sleeping too much and compromising your performance. If I don\u2019t get enough sleep on a race, the consequences are huge. Physically, it can make you more susceptible to things such as sea sickness. But more than that, there\u2019s a point where everything compounds and your body just says \u201cno\u201d. But it\u2019s amazing what the body can do. My philosophy on sleep is to listen to your body. It\u2019s all about cognitive function. When I\u2019m sleep deprived, I stop making good decisions. I also have type 1 diabetes. Obviously that can be very difficult with offshore sailing, but it\u2019s supposed to be challenging and it certainly isn\u2019t impossible. I enjoy proving that it can be done. Routine: How much sleep I get at sea will depend on the length and nature of the race. If I compete in a race over 24 hours, I won\u2019t sleep at all. For a three-day race, I\u2019ll sleep a little but not much. For races over three days, I\u2019ll try to get some sleep from the beginning so that I don\u2019t overexert myself too early on. Generally, I\u2019ll sleep 20-40 minutes every 2-3 hours. The longest I\u2019ll sleep at any one time will be 40 minutes and, if you take a race like the Route du Rhum, which I\u2019ve just finished, that was over 18 days. The longest I\u2019ve stayed awake during a race is probably about 62 hours. Alice Robb Author of Why We Dream When I was 22, I went through a period of pretty debilitating insomnia. I was sleeping only a few hours a night and I was basically miserable all the time. I got through that, thankfully, but I never took sleep for granted again.

It\u2019s true that the Parkland activists started with advantages most youth activists have not given: name recognition, media attention, \u201cthe moral high ground\u201d of being survivors, the immediate financial support of powerful backers like Oprah and George Clooney, who were among the celebrities who pleged $500,000 to support the nascent movement.</p> <p>But \u201cnone of those things guarantee success, in any way, shape or form\u201d, Morale Rocketto said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of times in political and movement spaces, there\u2019s an emphasis on whatever is the hot thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they could have begun and ended, as the hot thing.\u201d</p> <p>When they began to speak out after the shooting at their school, Parkland students wanted to make sure that their murdered friends were not forgotten in the endless series of American school shootings, that the news cycle did not simply move on after the latest series of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d. They have achieved that goal. Today, Democratic 2020 presidential candidates are courting the approval of the Parkland movement. California senator Kamala Harris mentioned the students as an inspiration in her campaign memoir. In December, the students traveled to South Africa to accept the International Children\u2019s Peace Prize.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/07/guns-v-grief-inside-americas-deadliest-cultural-chasm\">Guns v grief: inside America\u2019s deadliest cultural chasm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But teenagers also said they wanted to make Parkland the last mass shooting in America. On that goal, they aren\u2019t even close. In the months they have been mourning their own lost friends and teachers, the Parkland survivors have had to watch more school shootings, more domestic violence murders, shootings at a yoga studio, a bank, a synagogue, a video game tournament, a country music bar. A death count of five or six people lost in a mass shooting now barely makes a ripple in the Trump administration news cycle.</p> <p>The strange celebrity the Parkland students have been given is often painful. In the students\u2019 memoir of their movement, published this fall, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, the most famous of the March for Our Lives activists, described how uncomfortable it feels to be recognized on the street. \u201cAll of us know what it feels like to be Harry Potter now,\u201d she wrote \u2013 the boy who became famous for living when the people he loved died, the boy constantly reminded of the worst day of his life.</p> <p>The students\u2019 ability to make a political impact has sparked constant harassment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/23/conspiracy-theories-internet-survivors-truth\">including from conspiracy theorists</a> who labeled the teenagers \u201ccrisis actors\u201d, as well as pushback from gun rights activists who show up to the students\u2019 events fully armed. Hogg, in particular, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/12/gun-control-activist-david-hogg-parkland-people-dying\">has sparked the ire of right-wing pundits</a>, who have publicly mocked and dissected his grades, SAT scores, and college rejections and acceptances. (He took a gap year after graduating last spring, and announced in December that he would be attending Harvard in the fall.)</p> <p>\u201cEven when people come up to us quietly to say thank you, you never know if they\u2019re someone who\u2019s going to support you if they\u2019re just trying to shiv you or punch you or shoot you at close range, disguised by a friendly face,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez wrote.</p> <p>The hostility some of their political opponents show can be frightening, Corin said, but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can do.

The group is hoping to play a stronger lobbying role to pass gun control bills in state houses this year, as well as pressuring the senate, which is still controlled by Republican allies of the National Rifle Association, to pass a historic bill expanding background checks on gun sales. They have an 18-year-old as their lobbyist in DC.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible to measure the influence of March for Our Lives so far by tallying up their year of wins and losses. Dozens of gun control laws passed at the state level in 20 states. Eight states, including Florida, passed extreme risk protection order laws, which give family members and law enforcement a way to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from a person at risk of hurting others or themselves.</p> <p>These laws are already being used to prevent shootings, Hogg said. \u201cThe thing that I\u2019m most proud of is the stories that were not reported on because they didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re not stopping, we\u2019re not looking at it as an off-year</p> <footer> <cite>Jackie Corin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nationally, Democratic candidates, including many running on gun control platforms, swept the House of Representatives. One of the first priorities of the new Democratic House majority was introducing a new, stronger bill to expand background checks on gun sales. At the same time, Republican gun-rights supporters consolidated control of the senate, which will likely block the passage of any gun control legislation until at least 2020. And with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, Trump gave the NRA what it spent more than $30 million to secure in the 2016 elections: a lasting majority of pro-gun justices on the Supreme Court.</p> <p>If the sole bar is \u201cpassing Congressional gun control laws,\u201d then it looks like the March for Our Lives has not done much to disrupt the status quo of America\u2019s broken gun debate.</p> <p>But the attempt to measure the Parkland students\u2019 impact in terms of bills passed or not passed may miss the broader point. March for Our Lives has a more ambitious outlook than just policy. They are mirroring what the NRA and the Republican Party have done so well for decades: using the gun debate as a wedge issue, and aiming to take and hold power for a generation.</p> <p>The central framing of the March for Our Lives \u2013 young people rising up against corrupt politicians so beholden to special interests that they will risk kids\u2019 lives rather than change \u2013 is a resonant one. And it would be easy to extend that same framing to a broader set of issues, from racism to criminal justice reform to climate change, not just gun violence or school shootings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0147aa1dd0e421c24bdee0c327aeb330aace1167\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0147aa1dd0e421c24bdee0c327aeb330aace1167/0_0_4352_2928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A national movement</h2> <p>While the media spotlight still focuses most often on a handful of the most famous Parkland students, the teenage survivors a have spent the past year connecting with young activists who have long advocated for gun violence prevention in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington DC. Their goal is to build a truly national movement, and they\u2019ve already developed a deep bench of young leaders across the country \u2013 activists who are organizing on the local level, as well as with the national movement.</p> <p>In Arizona, Jordan Harb, a high school student who led a walkout protest after the Parkland shooting, went on to run a statewide youth voter registration campaign, in which high school students too young to vote worked to register their 18 and 19-year-old friends. In Wisconsin, Bria Smith, a charismatic 17-year-old local activist who joined the March for Our Lives\u2019 voter outreach bus tour this summer, has been deeply influenced by the political training of her summer activism. She\u2019s still working with March for Our Lives, as well as traveling across the country to speak with other young activists on racial justice. She also recently became the president of her local youth council in Milwaukee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/01/parkland-students-five-ways-fight-gun-violence-2019\">Take action: Parkland students on five ways to fight gun violence in 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if March for Our Lives disbands in a few months or years, the group will still have been instrumental in training a generation of young organizers across the country.

Within ten years \u2013 even by early 2021 \u2013 they hope the US will have already passed a set of stricter gun laws, invested in local violence prevention programs, and significantly reduced gun violence. But might the group still exist in some form, focused on youth voter engagement? Yes.</p> <p>This was the answer that Hogg, among others, gave , in a phone interview that had been scheduled for 9pm. He was very tired, but he gamely answered questions for about an hour. Finally, before answering that last question, he paused. There was some noise in the background. \u201cDoes March for Our Lives still exist in four years? Yeah \u2013 one second. I\u2019m brushing my teeth.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Hogg grew an inch over the past year. He notices it when he squeezes his lanky, now 6ft 1in frame into another airplane seat and struggles to fall asleep. Hogg is often on the road now. A year ago, at age 17, he was interviewing and filming his classmates as they hid in a closet from the gunshots they had just heard on their Parkland, Florida campus. Now, the 18-year-old and a small group of his friends have become internationally recognized gun violence prevention activists. For nine months after a shooting at their school left 17 students and teachers dead, the founders of March for Our Lives fought nonstop to vote out National Rifle Association-backed lawmakers, criss-crossing the country to hold rallies and voter registration events, as well as to build connections with veteran gun violence prevention activists in cities like New York and Chicago. Today, Hogg and the other students who first spoke out after the Parkland shooting are focusing on the quiet, unglamorous work of grassroots organizing. The group is training eight regional directors to help build out their March for Our Lives local chapters. They want to prepare for the 2020 presidential election by expanding the national reach of their youth voter registration and turnout operation. Yes, some of the teenagers are making plans to go to college next year. Yes, they are dealing with grief and exhaustion and backlash. They have had to learn to set some boundaries for the work they are doing, as well as learn how to weather brutal political losses. November\u2019s election saw longtime allies of the National Rifle Association win tight races for governor and US senate in Florida, the Parkland students\u2019 home state. By early January, a Republican legislator in Florida had filed a bill attempting to repeal the few compromise gun control measures the state had passed after the Parkland shooting. But the students who inspired national school walkouts last spring to protest government inaction on gun violence have seen enough progress that they want to keep fighting. Youth voter turnout nationwide spiked ten percentage points to an estimated 31% in 2018: still low, but the highest midterm election rate in decades. At least some of that increase is likely due to March for Our Lives\u2019 months of protests and get-out-the-vote efforts. \u201cOne of my goals in the next two years is to get 71% youth voter turnout in 2020,\u201d Hogg told the Guardian in a recent phone interview. Just under 50% of voters 18-29 voted in the 2016 presidential election. Why choose 71% as a goal? \u201cI like the way the number looks,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good goal that\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d On the other hand, he said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people that, quite frankly, really, really, really hate our president.\u201d There\u2019s no big election to organize around in 2019, but that does not mean there isn\u2019t urgent work to do, the group\u2019s new director of outreach said. \u201cI think this is the year of building,\u201d Jackie Corin, an 18-year-old senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and one of the group\u2019s founders, said. \u201cWe\u2019re not stopping, we\u2019re not looking at it as an off-year.\u201d Mobilizing young people March for Our Lives currently has nearly 200 local chapters across the country. By 2020, the group is hoping to \u201cdouble that, or even more\u201d, Corin said. When Hogg has asked politicians for advice on how \u201cto get change as quickly as possible,\u201d he has been advised that it\u2019s necessary to work both inside and outside the system. He is already talking about running for Congress as soon as he turns 25. If there are still politicians touting endorsements from the NRA after 2025, Hogg said, he would like to campaign against one of them. \u201cIf there was a Democrat that had an A rating from the NRA, I would totally try to primary them out.\u201d He\u2019s only one of the young activists who is now considering a career in politics. Corin, who has been organizing logistics for the group\u2019s nationwide bus tours and local partnerships while also trying to finish high school, is also thinking about elected office. National media interest in the Parkland movement peaked and then faded last spring after the students organized their first major event, the March for Our Lives in Washington, which drew hundreds of thousands of protesters in the nation\u2019s capital, and at least 1 million protesters at 800-plus sister marches worldwide. By then, the Parkland activists were already making a conscious effort to convert their viral social media presence into the only kind of currency that can truly challenge the power of the National Rifle Association: not money, or media attention, but turnout.

Political activists have been trying to solve the problem of low youth voter turnout for years, and except for Barack Obama, she said, there haven\u2019t been many successes. If the March for Our Lives is \u201ceven moderately successful\u201d in continuing to increase youth voter turnout in the next five or 10 years, that will have a big political impact, she said. If they can replicate the kind of success they saw this midterm cycle, she said, the students could become a political force that would rival the influence of the labor movement or outside groups like MoveOn. The next chapter There were no guarantees that the March for Our Lives would be able to sustain their movement even this long. It\u2019s true that the Parkland activists started with advantages most youth activists have not given: name recognition, media attention, \u201cthe moral high ground\u201d of being survivors, the immediate financial support of powerful backers like Oprah and George Clooney, who were among the celebrities who pleged $500,000 to support the nascent movement. But \u201cnone of those things guarantee success, in any way, shape or form\u201d, Morale Rocketto said. \u201cA lot of times in political and movement spaces, there\u2019s an emphasis on whatever is the hot thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they could have begun and ended, as the hot thing.\u201d When they began to speak out after the shooting at their school, Parkland students wanted to make sure that their murdered friends were not forgotten in the endless series of American school shootings, that the news cycle did not simply move on after the latest series of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d. They have achieved that goal. Today, Democratic 2020 presidential candidates are courting the approval of the Parkland movement. California senator Kamala Harris mentioned the students as an inspiration in her campaign memoir. In December, the students traveled to South Africa to accept the International Children\u2019s Peace Prize. But teenagers also said they wanted to make Parkland the last mass shooting in America. On that goal, they aren\u2019t even close. In the months they have been mourning their own lost friends and teachers, the Parkland survivors have had to watch more school shootings, more domestic violence murders, shootings at a yoga studio, a bank, a synagogue, a video game tournament, a country music bar. A death count of five or six people lost in a mass shooting now barely makes a ripple in the Trump administration news cycle. The strange celebrity the Parkland students have been given is often painful. In the students\u2019 memoir of their movement, published this fall, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, the most famous of the March for Our Lives activists, described how uncomfortable it feels to be recognized on the street. \u201cAll of us know what it feels like to be Harry Potter now,\u201d she wrote \u2013 the boy who became famous for living when the people he loved died, the boy constantly reminded of the worst day of his life. The students\u2019 ability to make a political impact has sparked constant harassment, including from conspiracy theorists who labeled the teenagers \u201ccrisis actors\u201d, as well as pushback from gun rights activists who show up to the students\u2019 events fully armed. Hogg, in particular, has sparked the ire of right-wing pundits, who have publicly mocked and dissected his grades, SAT scores, and college rejections and acceptances. (He took a gap year after graduating last spring, and announced in December that he would be attending Harvard in the fall.) \u201cEven when people come up to us quietly to say thank you, you never know if they\u2019re someone who\u2019s going to support you if they\u2019re just trying to shiv you or punch you or shoot you at close range, disguised by a friendly face,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez wrote. The hostility some of their political opponents show can be frightening, Corin said, but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can do. We can\u2019t let that fear consume us.\u201d What\u2019s been achieved? March for Our Lives is still focused on gun policy. The group is hoping to play a stronger lobbying role to pass gun control bills in state houses this year, as well as pressuring the senate, which is still controlled by Republican allies of the National Rifle Association, to pass a historic bill expanding background checks on gun sales.

Eight states, including Florida, passed extreme risk protection order laws, which give family members and law enforcement a way to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from a person at risk of hurting others or themselves. These laws are already being used to prevent shootings, Hogg said. \u201cThe thing that I\u2019m most proud of is the stories that were not reported on because they didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Nationally, Democratic candidates, including many running on gun control platforms, swept the House of Representatives. One of the first priorities of the new Democratic House majority was introducing a new, stronger bill to expand background checks on gun sales. At the same time, Republican gun-rights supporters consolidated control of the senate, which will likely block the passage of any gun control legislation until at least 2020. And with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, Trump gave the NRA what it spent more than $30 million to secure in the 2016 elections: a lasting majority of pro-gun justices on the Supreme Court. If the sole bar is \u201cpassing Congressional gun control laws,\u201d then it looks like the March for Our Lives has not done much to disrupt the status quo of America\u2019s broken gun debate. But the attempt to measure the Parkland students\u2019 impact in terms of bills passed or not passed may miss the broader point. March for Our Lives has a more ambitious outlook than just policy. They are mirroring what the NRA and the Republican Party have done so well for decades: using the gun debate as a wedge issue, and aiming to take and hold power for a generation. The central framing of the March for Our Lives \u2013 young people rising up against corrupt politicians so beholden to special interests that they will risk kids\u2019 lives rather than change \u2013 is a resonant one. And it would be easy to extend that same framing to a broader set of issues, from racism to criminal justice reform to climate change, not just gun violence or school shootings. A national movement While the media spotlight still focuses most often on a handful of the most famous Parkland students, the teenage survivors a have spent the past year connecting with young activists who have long advocated for gun violence prevention in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington DC. Their goal is to build a truly national movement, and they\u2019ve already developed a deep bench of young leaders across the country \u2013 activists who are organizing on the local level, as well as with the national movement. In Arizona, Jordan Harb, a high school student who led a walkout protest after the Parkland shooting, went on to run a statewide youth voter registration campaign, in which high school students too young to vote worked to register their 18 and 19-year-old friends. In Wisconsin, Bria Smith, a charismatic 17-year-old local activist who joined the March for Our Lives\u2019 voter outreach bus tour this summer, has been deeply influenced by the political training of her summer activism. She\u2019s still working with March for Our Lives, as well as traveling across the country to speak with other young activists on racial justice. She also recently became the president of her local youth council in Milwaukee. Even if March for Our Lives disbands in a few months or years, the group will still have been instrumental in training a generation of young organizers across the country. If they can stick together, it\u2019s hard to overestimate the political benefits of having a national network of media-tested, donor-connected, eloquent 25-year-olds who have been organizing campaigns together since their late teens. If you ask different members of March for Our Lives whether they organization will still exist in five or 10 years, they will give roughly the same answer. (They have always demonstrated impressive message discipline.) They don\u2019t want the organization to exist forever. Within ten years \u2013 even by early 2021 \u2013 they hope the US will have already passed a set of stricter gun laws, invested in local violence prevention programs, and significantly reduced gun violence. But might the group still exist in some form, focused on youth voter engagement? Yes. This was the answer that Hogg, among others, gave , in a phone interview that had been scheduled for 9pm. He was very tired, but he gamely answered questions for about an hour. Finally, before answering that last question, he paused. There was some noise in the background. \u201cDoes March for Our Lives still exist in four years? Yeah \u2013 one second. I\u2019m brushing my teeth.\u201d",

If Europe is indeed the world\u2019s bastion of democracy, its leaders should not abandon their principles for the sake of clumsy realpolitik. \u2022 Amr Darrag served in the cabinet of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi from May to July 2013",

At a time when politicians should be reaching out to leave voters with concrete proposals for rebalancing our economy, heavily based as it is on services and centred in the south-east, we get a continuation of turbo-charged austerity.

On my 2016 walk, I spoke to estate agents who told me that buy-to-letters from wealthier areas were scooping up whole rows of houses, paying cash and pricing out locals. Tenants forced into the private rented sector were now spending 52% of their income <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jul/03/one-in-seven-private-tenants-pays-more-than-half-income-in-rent-study-finds\" title=\"\">on rent</a>, compared with 7% in 1981. Thanks to the Tories\u2019 right-to-buy scheme, the stock of council properties had fallen from 5m in the early 80s to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/revealed-how-many-council-homes-7853057\" title=\"\">1.7m</a>, a number set to drop further.</p> <p>In Stoke-on-Trent (which voted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/14/ukip-prospect-stoke-on-trent-voted-leave\" title=\"\">69% leave</a>), 60,000 people had been employed in the potteries industry as recently as the late 1970s, before manufacturing was largely switched to east Asia.

There, I walked past Stoke City\u2019s Bet365 stadium. Bet365, like most betting companies, relies on poorer people to generate a significant portion of its income. It had become Stoke\u2019s largest private employer. In a city where nearly 40% of households were living on less than \u00a316,000 a year and 3,000 were dependent on food banks, Bet365\u2019s owner Denise Coates was paying herself the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/12/bet365-chief-denise-coates-paid-217m-last-year\" title=\"\">\u00a3594,520 a day</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of powerlessness that pervades everything now,\u201d the local YMCA chief told me. \u201cPeople are waiting to be rescued.\u201d But he knew it was a forlorn hope.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/09/theresa-may-england-maidenhead-brexit\">What I found in Theresa May\u2019s heartland: an England in miniature | Ian Jack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Walsall (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2017/oct/12/still-puzzled-by-the-brexit-vote-take-yourself-off-to-blakenall-heath\" title=\"\">68% leave</a>), the Labour leader of the council told me how Tory austerity had savaged his budget. In the near future the council would be able to do not much more than adult statutory services in social care and children\u2019s services. He told me that until recently, \u201cThe council was seen by residents as a friend that could help and protect you \u2026 now we\u2019re the hated enemy.\u201d</p> <p>That emasculation of local government has turned our country into one of the most centralised in the western world. \u201cThe establishment of a neoliberal consensus in Britain has been \u2026 an anti-municipal project,\u201d wrote Tom Crewe in a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n24/tom-crewe/the-strange-death-of-municipal-england\" title=\"\">essay</a> for the London Review of Books. \u201cAusterity is Thatcherism\u2019s logical end-point. People can no longer expect the services they pay for to be run in their interest, rather than the interest of shareholders.\u201d</p> <p>On I walked, past privatised parks, closed libraries and museums; past a junior school outside which a sign asked parents for donations to make up its budget shortfall. In Nuneaton (66% leave), I met a man who reeled off the names of closed-down factories like you might your football team\u2019s greatest all-time XI.

      "bodyText": "In May 2016, a few weeks before the EU referendum, I walked 340 miles from Liverpool to London to see what was happening to my country. I was travelling in the footsteps of a 1981 march against unemployment that my late father had helped to organise. In that year, Tory policies had devastated industry and sent unemployment skyrocketing. In 2016, Tory austerity was putting the final nail in the coffin of those broken communities. Even so, on my walk I was shocked by the level of poverty, by the sheer number of homeless people in doorways and parks, and by the high streets of boarded-up shops and pubs, full of payday loan outlets and bookies. People in those former industrial towns spoke of their anger and betrayal, of having being forgotten by Westminster politicians, of their communities having been destroyed as the manufacturing that had sustained them either folded or moved to low-wage economies. Nearly everyone I spoke to in those towns said they were going to vote for Brexit. There was a lot of talk of \u201ctaking back control\u201d, and in the context of the industrial wastelands, that sentiment made a lot of sense. But the EU issue was, for a majority, a proxy for their pain. There was a brief moment when it appeared the Conservatives grasped this. When Theresa May became prime minister on 13 July 2016, after David Cameron had fled the post-referendum carnage, she addressed the \u201cjust about managing\u201d and said the government \u201cwill be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours \u2026 When we take the big calls, we\u2019ll think not of the powerful, but you.\u201d But since then we have had a government paralysed by Brexit, effectively not governing at all. We have ongoing crises in most aspects of public policy: housing, transport, prisons, the benefits system, health, education. Homelessness is rocketing, as is food bank use. In some areas of our inner cities, Dickensian diseases such as rickets and beriberi have re-emerged. At a time when politicians should be reaching out to leave voters with concrete proposals for rebalancing our economy, heavily based as it is on services and centred in the south-east, we get a continuation of turbo-charged austerity. In their call for a second referendum, remainers should ask themselves whether the anger that drove the result in June 2016 has been even remotely addressed. That anger has long, deep roots. On my 2016 walk, I spoke to estate agents who told me that buy-to-letters from wealthier areas were scooping up whole rows of houses, paying cash and pricing out locals. Tenants forced into the private rented sector were now spending 52% of their income on rent, compared with 7% in 1981. Thanks to the Tories\u2019 right-to-buy scheme, the stock of council properties had fallen from 5m in the early 80s to 1.7m, a number set to drop further. In Stoke-on-Trent (which voted 69% leave), 60,000 people had been employed in the potteries industry as recently as the late 1970s, before manufacturing was largely switched to east Asia. In 2016 only 8,000 jobs were left. There, I walked past Stoke City\u2019s Bet365 stadium. Bet365, like most betting companies, relies on poorer people to generate a significant portion of its income. It had become Stoke\u2019s largest private employer. In a city where nearly 40% of households were living on less than \u00a316,000 a year and 3,000 were dependent on food banks, Bet365\u2019s owner Denise Coates was paying herself the equivalent of \u00a3594,520 a day. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of powerlessness that pervades everything now,\u201d the local YMCA chief told me. \u201cPeople are waiting to be rescued.\u201d But he knew it was a forlorn hope. In Walsall (68% leave), the Labour leader of the council told me how Tory austerity had savaged his budget. In the near future the council would be able to do not much more than adult statutory services in social care and children\u2019s services. He told me that until recently, \u201cThe council was seen by residents as a friend that could help and protect you \u2026 now we\u2019re the hated enemy.\u201d That emasculation of local government has turned our country into one of the most centralised in the western world. \u201cThe establishment of a neoliberal consensus in Britain has been \u2026 an anti-municipal project,\u201d wrote Tom Crewe in a 2016 essay for the London Review of Books. \u201cAusterity is Thatcherism\u2019s logical end-point. People can no longer expect the services they pay for to be run in their interest, rather than the interest of shareholders.\u201d On I walked, past privatised parks, closed libraries and museums; past a junior school outside which a sign asked parents for donations to make up its budget shortfall. In Nuneaton (66% leave), I met a man who reeled off the names of closed-down factories like you might your football team\u2019s greatest all-time XI. He railed against the amount of money spent on infrastructure projects in the south-east compared with the rest of the country (figures from the IPPR in 2014 showed that every Londoner had \u00a35,426 spent on them annually, compared with \u00a3223 in the north-east) and told me he would be voting out in the EU referendum. But that might make the economy even more precarious, I said. He paused for a moment, narrowed his eyes. \u201cIf the economy goes down the toilet,\u201d he said, \u201cat least those bastards [in London] will finally know what it feels like to be us.\u201d Later, I walked through Northamptonshire (59% leave), where the Tory county council had recently reduced its core staff from 4,000 to 150 and become the first council in the UK to outsource to private providers every single one of its services, including child protection, reducing itself to the role of a commissioning body. It is a model that other councils are investigating. In February 2018, the council declared itself effectively bankrupt. Others will surely follow. In her 2007 book The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein charted the rise of disaster capitalism. In Britain and the US, in 1979 and 1980 respectively, it was introduced with the promise that a rising tide would lift all boats. Klein wrote that the end result was always the same: small groups did very well, sucking up more and more of the wealth, while large sections of the population became fragmented, left with decaying public infrastructure, declining incomes and either rising unemployment or increasingly precarious work. Towards the end of 2018, Philip Alston, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, undertook a two-week tour of the UK. He concluded \u2013 citing figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, that showed around 14 million people were living in poverty and 1.5 million were destitute \u2013 that the UK government had inflicted \u201cgreat misery\u201d on its people with \u201cpunitive, mean-spirited and often callous\u201d austerity policies, and that in this country \u201cpoverty is a political choice\u201d. In 1976, three decades of the postwar settlement had seen the UK reach \u201cpeak equality\u201d, according to a 2013 economic study, when the country was better off than it had ever been before or since. Forty years of neoliberalism has destroyed that for ordinary people. If you asked the vast majority of people what they want, they would say that essential services should be renationalised (a 2017 YouGov survey found only 25% and 31% of people respectively thought our trains and energy companies should be privately run).

Everybody moans about it, but nothing seems to change: the baffling practice of the Bafta telecast running two and a quarter hours later than real-world events sucks almost every scrap of excitement out of watching the thing. In the age of spoiler-tastic social media, everyone knows the results, so why bother? Presumably the BBC don\u2019t want to give up a prime piece of early Sunday evening TV real estate, and the Baftas want to catch the morning papers\u2019 first editions, but something has got to change. Watching the tuxed and gowned beautiful people spout sententious truisms while thanking their agents is only bearable if there\u2019s actual excitement to be had; the Baftas appear to doing their level best to avoid anything like that happening. Oscars \u2013 winner! If the lion\u2019s share of blame must fall on Lumley\u2019s shoulders for the ceremony itself \u2013 once we were allowed to watch it \u2013 being such a damp squib, that\u2019s surely good news for the Academy Awards in a fortnight. If ever there was a case for ditching hosts for ever, Sunday night\u2019s ceremony was it.",

This is Frida, the child Nielsen and her husband, Mattia Dessi, had last year, after more than a decade of failed in-vitro fertilisation attempts. The couple, who this year celebrate their 16th wedding anniversary, had been told they had only a 2.5% chance of success, but Nielsen gave birth at the age of 54. \u201cI was always like: \u2018I want to do it until there are no more embryos left,\u2019\u201d says Nielsen. \u201cSomebody has to win the lottery.\u201d And she did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/25/actor-brigitte-nielsen-defends-having-baby-at-54-saying-its-my-life\">Actor Brigitte Nielsen defends having baby at 54, saying: 'It's my life'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>IVF is not a process everyone could cope with, she says. \u201cYou\u2019re on a lot of medication. It is very expensive. Hormones will do different things to different women ... you always think you\u2019re going to get pregnant, but most of the time, the phone call comes and it\u2019s: \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 It is devastating. The partner you\u2019re with has to be onboard as much as you, unless you\u2019re a woman who wants to have a baby on your own. You have to stay realistic and, if you\u2019re older, the odds are against you.\u201d</p> <p>The couple first saw Frida\u2019s heartbeat five weeks into the pregnancy, and went for checkups every week. \u201cMy doctor said: \u2018If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone until you\u2019re 27 weeks pregnant.\u2019\u201d At that point, the doctor told her: \u201cThey have a 98% chance of survival, though they will have to stay in the hospital.\u201d So, until 27 weeks, she kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her mother.</p> <p>\u201cI get a lot of letters and emails from women, so excited that I\u2019ve given them the courage,\u201d says Nielsen of the reaction to her being an older mother; although in certain sections of the media the response was quite unpleasant. \u201cSome find it ridiculous, some find it awful, and some love it. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business. It\u2019s my husband and my life and we love what we do.\u201d Besides, she says: \u201cWhen people say you were 54 \u2013 yeah, well, what about all the men who are in their 60s, 70s, 80s?

Growing up in Copenhagen, she wore a corset to correct her scoliosis and orthopaedic shoes because her right leg was longer than the left one. She was 6ft 1in (1.85m) tall and so skinny that she wore three pairs of trousers to school; the kids called her \u201cgiraffen\u201d. Nielsen planned to be a librarian, like her mother.

De Laurentiis flew her to Hollywood to star in his fantasy epic Red Sonja, where she made her film debut as a barbarian who shuns the male touch, and he gave Gitte, as she was then known, a new name: Brigitte. This identity gave her the brash alter ego she had secretly craved. It gave her the confidence, for instance, to pay a bellboy $20 to deliver her headshot and phone number to Sylvester Stallone\u2019s hotel room, even though they were both married to other people. Stallone divorced his wife. Nielsen left her first husband and infant son. Within a year, Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actor and most striking new starlet were hitched.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a horrible marriage,\u201d she admits with a shrug. Stallone was nearly twice her age, and would rather tuck into a long meal with his battalion of bodyguards than take his 22-year-old bride dancing. (He did, however, etch her face on a $20,000 glass dining room table.) The press dubbed them Beefcake and Cheesecake.</p> <p>Stallone\u2019s most priceless gift to her was the role of Ludmilla Drago, the Russian wife of Dolph Lundgren\u2019s Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, a jingoistic distillation of the cold war to a boxing ring. Her chiselled features were well cast for an Olympic swimmer turned Soviet spokeswoman. She could have silently stalked across the screen once and made an indelible impression. Yet Nielsen is empathetic in a scene where Ludmilla defends her husband after he accidentally kills Apollo Creed. Unfortunately, afterwards, Hollywood couldn\u2019t think of anything to do with an angular blonde who towered over her male co-stars. Ordinary characters were out.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody looks at you as a villain,\u201d says Nielsen, and once she divorced Stallone, even the villain offers dried up. \u201cAfter I left Sylvester, I kind of felt like I was blacklisted for a long time,\u201d she says. The paparazzi hounded her about romantic conquests. She was tied to an NFL player, a blockbuster director and her female assistant. Some rumours were true, some weren\u2019t. \u201cI am almost positive that had I not been in the public eye with this famous man, that would never have happened. But they always thought: after Stallone, who is going to be next?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bef4ea6d42255ee1cc96407c780d8444fb90ac58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bef4ea6d42255ee1cc96407c780d8444fb90ac58/0_0_3504_2308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki in Rocky IV, 1985, which was directed by Sylvester Stallone.

I said: \u2018I\u2019m not an American \u2013 screw that, I\u2019m out of here!\u2019\u201d She moved to Europe for nearly two decades, working as a singer and picking up acting gigs. She had two more husbands, bore three more sons, and made a few films she is proud of, including Lamberto Bava\u2019s five-film Fantaghir\u00f2 franchise, in which she played Strega Nera, the Black Witch. </p> <p>During her fourth marriage, Nielsen began drinking. As that relationship neared its end, she took an overdose. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to die, but in that moment, you are so far out, you are literally ill, and you are drowning,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it happens \u2013 and that\u2019s why I choose to talk about it so people don\u2019t feel alone.\u201d</p> <p>Reality TV was, oddly, her salvation. Starting with 2003\u2019s Danish Big Brother VIP, Nielsen spent years getting drunk on The Surreal Life, Strange Love and Celebrity Rehab. It wasn\u2019t pretty \u2013 but it allowed her to see her addiction clearly. Plus, reality TV continues to hold her accountable. When she has relapsed, the tabloids notice.</p> <p>She credits her current happiness to her fifth husband, Dessi. When they got together, she says: \u201cEverybody was laughing in a bad way at us, because he was 25 and I was almost 40, so I was a joke. It\u2019s always the woman that has to pay for the jokes.\u201d</p> <p>When the producers of Creed II asked her to resurrect Ludmilla Drago last year, she said yes \u2013 she was eight months pregnant with Frida, and they had to shoot around her belly. On set, says Nielsen: \u201cSylvester and I kind of buried the hatchet. He was in his American corner, I was in my Russian corner. We were very professional, and it worked out just fine.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Hollywood is finally ready for her return. \u201cWhat\u2019s good for me now is that the Marvel Universe is open to a lot of things, so I fit right in,\u201d she notes. \u201cAnd they\u2019re redoing Red Sonja.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9884f5913e4c100bd3b70fa4c25fc5a56a4fca7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9884f5913e4c100bd3b70fa4c25fc5a56a4fca7b/0_0_2663_1860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nielsen as Strega Nera in the 1991 film Fantaghir\u00f2 2 (1991), directed by Lamberto Bava.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nielsen as Strega Nera in the 1991 film Fantaghir\u00f2 2 (1991), directed by Lamberto Bava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/Micro Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s an opportune time to bring back a heroine who snarled: \u201cNo man may have me, unless he\u2019s beaten me in a fair fight.\u201d Although not if the studio insists on hiring the alleged sex offender Bryan Singer to direct. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if Bryan Singer is going to stick with the project or not,\u201d says Nielsen, neutrally.</p> <p>Her focus, for now, is firmly on Frida. \u201cI\u2019m going to really have to protect her,\u201d she says, mentioning her fears around social media. \u201cYou see a lot of solitude and loneliness ... I want to empower her. I want her to travel, and have responsibilities; a little bit of the upbringing I had.\u201d</p> <p>Being a mother in her 50s definitely has benefits, she says: \u201cI love having her now, because I had no idea what I was doing when I had my first baby at 20. I was all over the place. Work first, travel first, love first \u2013 it can wait. Although you don\u2019t have to wait until you\u2019re 54.</p> <p>\u201cI wonder why this all happens now,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the reason is I\u2019ve been doing very well for years now, psychologically and physically. I wish I\u2019d always been like this \u2013 but better late than never.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 February 2019 to clarify details of Nielsen\u2019s experience during the Seychelles coup attempt.</p>",

I said: \u2018I\u2019m not an American \u2013 screw that, I\u2019m out of here!\u2019\u201d She moved to Europe for nearly two decades, working as a singer and picking up acting gigs. She had two more husbands, bore three more sons, and made a few films she is proud of, including Lamberto Bava\u2019s five-film Fantaghir\u00f2 franchise, in which she played Strega Nera, the Black Witch. During her fourth marriage, Nielsen began drinking. As that relationship neared its end, she took an overdose. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to die, but in that moment, you are so far out, you are literally ill, and you are drowning,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it happens \u2013 and that\u2019s why I choose to talk about it so people don\u2019t feel alone.\u201d Reality TV was, oddly, her salvation. Starting with 2003\u2019s Danish Big Brother VIP, Nielsen spent years getting drunk on The Surreal Life, Strange Love and Celebrity Rehab. It wasn\u2019t pretty \u2013 but it allowed her to see her addiction clearly. Plus, reality TV continues to hold her accountable. When she has relapsed, the tabloids notice. She credits her current happiness to her fifth husband, Dessi. When they got together, she says: \u201cEverybody was laughing in a bad way at us, because he was 25 and I was almost 40, so I was a joke. It\u2019s always the woman that has to pay for the jokes.\u201d When the producers of Creed II asked her to resurrect Ludmilla Drago last year, she said yes \u2013 she was eight months pregnant with Frida, and they had to shoot around her belly. On set, says Nielsen: \u201cSylvester and I kind of buried the hatchet. He was in his American corner, I was in my Russian corner. We were very professional, and it worked out just fine.\u201d Perhaps Hollywood is finally ready for her return. \u201cWhat\u2019s good for me now is that the Marvel Universe is open to a lot of things, so I fit right in,\u201d she notes. \u201cAnd they\u2019re redoing Red Sonja.\u201d It\u2019s an opportune time to bring back a heroine who snarled: \u201cNo man may have me, unless he\u2019s beaten me in a fair fight.\u201d Although not if the studio insists on hiring the alleged sex offender Bryan Singer to direct. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if Bryan Singer is going to stick with the project or not,\u201d says Nielsen, neutrally. Her focus, for now, is firmly on Frida. \u201cI\u2019m going to really have to protect her,\u201d she says, mentioning her fears around social media. \u201cYou see a lot of solitude and loneliness ... I want to empower her. I want her to travel, and have responsibilities; a little bit of the upbringing I had.\u201d Being a mother in her 50s definitely has benefits, she says: \u201cI love having her now, because I had no idea what I was doing when I had my first baby at 20. I was all over the place. Work first, travel first, love first \u2013 it can wait. Although you don\u2019t have to wait until you\u2019re 54. \u201cI wonder why this all happens now,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the reason is I\u2019ve been doing very well for years now, psychologically and physically. I wish I\u2019d always been like this \u2013 but better late than never.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 February 2019 to clarify details of Nielsen\u2019s experience during the Seychelles coup attempt.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has hinted he could revoke a $200m agreement with Bob Katter for Queensland water projects if the maverick sides with Labor and fellow crossbenchers to support an extension of the parliamentary sitting calendar against the government\u2019s wishes. With parliament set to resume on Tuesday, and with Labor and several crossbenchers lining up to extend the sitting weeks to allow consideration of the recommendations from the banking royal commission, the prime minister was asked twice on Monday whether Katter would lose his water deal in the event he forced the extension. Rather than ruling it out, the prime minister said at the National Press Club he didn\u2019t intend to \u201centertain\u201d the question. Morrison reached an agreement with Katter last November, in which he agreed to provide $200m for water projects to shore up Katter\u2019s support in the House of Representatives following the loss of the government\u2019s lower house majority. An exchange of letters between Morrison and Katter at the time made it clear the government expected support during any motions and second reading amendments \u201cthat attempt to cause disruption to the good order of the House\u201d. Katter has not yet stated definitively whether he will support a motion extending the sitting program or not, although he has expressed some interest in doing so. The government opposes the move. Last week, the mercurial Queenslander told Guardian Australia there \u201cmay be some merit\u201d to extra sitting weeks of parliament to consider banking reforms and he would \u201cseriously consider\u201d it. Katter complained the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull had \u201cgazumped the crossbench by putting in a toothless tiger\u201d in setting up a banking royal commission on the government\u2019s terms and wants to see more scrutiny on bank bosses than \u201clittle blokes selling mortgages\u201d. \u201cBut the prime minister [Scott Morrison] may threaten to go to the people and dump on us [at an early election] \u2026 There\u2019s going to be a lot of brinksmanship here. We\u2019ll see who blinks first,\u201d he said. Katter\u2019s vote only comes into play if the other House crossbenchers side with Labor on the motion. Government sources are privately confident they have the numbers to repel the sortie. With the political fight between the major parties escalating, Labor on Monday said it would no longer sign up to pairing arrangements for votes requiring an absolute majority of 76 MPs in the House of Representatives. The government leader in the house, Christopher Pyne, responded that the \u201cunprecedented\u201d move would prevent members attending to sick family members or getting medical attention. \u201cThe then-opposition never stooped this low even in the darkest days of the 43rd parliament,\u201d he said, although the Tony Abbott-lead opposition was criticised for restricting the practice of pairing. The implied threat to Katter was part of a wide-ranging speech from Morrison that focused on amplifying political conflict with Labor over national security. The prime minister also confirmed the Coalition would announce measures on climate policy before the next federal election \u2013 something the government has been telegraphing for some weeks. Morrison acknowledged that climate change was a factor in the frequency of extreme weather events Australia has experienced over the summer months. The government is expected, as part of the reboot, to beef up the Emissions Reduction Fund, a vestige of Tony Abbott\u2019s Direct Action program and possibly expand the fund\u2019s remit. There is also an internal push to increase funding for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Arena, as well as craft a package of measures targeted at households.",

      "bodyText": "Well that was an awfully long night that felt less like an awards show and more like an extended concert. Just nine awards were televised tonight in a ceremony that stretched to almost four hours and at many, many times, we really did feel the strain. But for every misstep (the length, Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Motown tribute, the decision to cut off so many key speeches), there was also plenty to applaud. After last year\u2019s very male ceremony, tonight saw female winners almost double and host Alicia Keys prioritising music and positivity over wisecracks made for a refreshing change. But next year, please for the sake of us all, keep it under three hours, yeah? Here\u2019s a look back at the big stories of the night: And the question everyone\u2019s really asking is: Just to make sure there\u2019s no bad blood, producers are trying to explain that Drake\u2019s microphone being cut was not supposed to be censorship Cardi B has been celebrating her big win over on Instagram in exactly the way you would expect while also paying tribute to Mac Miller In case you haven\u2019t seen Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Motown tribute and would like to make your own mind up then here you go If you\u2019re already to relive a very long night then here\u2019s a whole bunch of lovely pictures: And just a reminder of the night\u2019s most gif-worthy moment One thing that\u2019s surprised many is the lack of conversation surrounding 21 Savage on stage tonight with the rapper, currently facing deportation, only receiving a very late mention from composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson. Here\u2019s a chance to watch Cardi B\u2019s speech, one of the more entertaining of the night: According to her tweets, Ariana Grande is annoyed with the Grammys for inviting Mac Miller\u2019s mother to the ceremony, knowing that her late son hadn\u2019t won an award. The tweets have now been deleted but Grande was responding to fans who queried her tweeting \u201ctrash\u201d while Cardi B won best rap album. She later clarified why she was so angry. So while This is America winning song of the year was a landmark win for rap, the fact that it also picked up record of the year is quite something too. It\u2019s the first time either award has been given to a hip-hop track. Somewhere, far away from the Grammys, Donald Glover is surely celebrating. Rushing to the finish line here, Kacey Musgraves won the night\u2019s biggest award for her country pop crossover album. She was clearly one of the night\u2019s big stars, appearing in three performances and winning a number of awards before the show even began. \u201cWinning this doesn\u2019t make my album any better than any other in this category,\u201d a rather humble Musgraves said on stage. But again, even for the night\u2019s biggest award, she was cut off just a few sentences into her speech. If there\u2019s one key learning from tonight, it\u2019s that next year\u2019s ceremony needs to be tighter. Running at almost four hours, it\u2019s been wildly overlong. Damn, one of the night\u2019s biggest awards has gone to one of the night\u2019s biggest no-shows. It\u2019s quite the win for Donald Glover, whose political anthem seemed like a less obvious choice over say Cardi B, Lady Gaga or Maren Morris. A big night for hip-hop. But with time constraints, another speech that was cut short. After a reminder of all the artists we\u2019ve lost this past year, the Grammys unveiled their big Aretha Franklin tribute. Fantasia, Andra Day and Yolanda Adans came on stage to sing a note perfect rendition of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. The three were so perfectly picked (Fantasia sang at Aretha\u2019s funeral last year) that they almost made up for the miscast Motown tribute earlier in the evening. Almost. Before the final awards are announced, if they ever indeed are, here\u2019s a reminder of who has won what tonight: Hmmmmm Back on stage so soon, British singer Dua Lipa has taken home one of the night\u2019s biggest awards, winning out in a competitive category. She\u2019s cut off with music incredibly fast though, another sign that producers are aware of how late it\u2019s running. They cut the mic too! Feels like the awards are going to come thick and fast now, if they\u2019re given the time to speak. So many awards still but instead, now time for another one of the night\u2019s big duets: St Vincent and Dua Lipa. Both sporting the same haircut and both indulging in some homoerotic posturing, they stop just short of anything that would get them in trouble with CBS. Drake\u2019s microphone was also cut in both the arena and the telecast, seemingly a rather deliberate tactic given that his speech was about the ultimate irrelevance of the Grammys. This is probably on the way It\u2019s been quite the month for the extremely talented R&amp;B duo Chloe x Halle who, just a week after performing at the Super Bowl, have now nabbed a key slot tonight. After a rather lovely rendition of Where is the Love, they then announced the winner of tonight\u2019s biggest rap award. Bringing Offset on stage (sure to spark plenty of chatter surrounding their relationship status), Cardi B was a surprisingly nervous and teary winner. \u201cOoh the nerves,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I need to start smoking weed.\u201d It all ended rather awkwardly though with Cardi cut off mid-speech, not the first time that\u2019s happened tonight. In case you missed tonight\u2019s starry opening then here you go: One of tonight\u2019s big winners Brandi Carlile is now on stage with a rousing performance of The Joke. She might not be familiar to a wider crowd but the folk/country singer has delivered one of the night\u2019s best vocals, proving her earlier non-televised wins to be entirely worth it. Before JLo performed her Motown tribute, Twitter was unsure. After JLo performed her Motown tribute, Twitter is pretty certain it was a disaster: Wahey! The infinitely talented 21-year-old has beaten out more seasoned performers for a surprise, deserved win. \u201cIt\u2019s not even an album, it\u2019s an EP!\u201d she jokes on stage. She also decided to bring her entire production team on stage, a nice touch, and a good sign that the Grammys is focusing on rewarding young, lesser-known talent. Smokey Robinson is on stage to introduce a Motown tribute which gives him a chance to do a quick, seemingly impromptu duet with Alicia Keys. Now, as feared the performance is being led by Jennifer Lopez, a singer who isn\u2019t easily associated with Motown. She\u2019s leading a medley, including Dancing in the Street and Mr Postman, and while it\u2019s not a total disaster given her ability as a dancer, it\u2019s a totally awkward fit. It just feels like a bit from her Vegas concert which makes it a relief to see Robinson return to the stage. She\u2019s then joined by Keys, a singer who would have made a much better choice for a Motown tribute. Now it\u2019s Ne-Yo whose voice makes somewhat more sense but it\u2019s too little too late and Lopez is still thrashing around the stage like she\u2019s forgotten what she\u2019s up there for. What a mess. Same Another one of tonight\u2019s centrepiece performances and a chance for Travis Scott fans to see him do more than add a brief flash of energy to Maroon 5\u2019s lifeless Super Bowl set. Scott goes from being mournful with James Blake to jumping in a cage surrounded by fans crawling all over. He then indulges in a spot of crowdsurfing (as he also did during the Super Bowl) before moshing along for one of the night\u2019s most energetic and most decidedly un-CBS moments of the night. Another new trailer launched during the Oscars, this time for Ron Howard\u2019s Pavarotti documentary Oh and in case you were worried, Ariana Grande has not let a good dress go to waste: Another one of tonight\u2019s big performances: Lady Gaga singing her Grammy-winning song from A Star is Born. Given how famous her big screen rendition of Shallow has already become, it\u2019s interesting to see her try and add a new spin and it\u2019s very clearly an attempt to differentiate this from what we now know so well. Rocking around the stage with more bravado than Ally could have managed in the moment, she delivers flawless vocals while displaying excess physical energy. It would have been thrilling to see her joined by Bradley Cooper but as mentioned before, he\u2019s in the UK for the Baftas. That duet will have to wait for the Oscars ... In case you missed Drake\u2019s speech: Now it\u2019s time for Diana Ross, similarly sort of paying tribute to herself, but again like with Dolly Parton, it\u2019s preferable to her sitting in the audience awkwardly watching a ragtag group sing her songs for her. Introduced by her nine-year-old grandson, she\u2019s on stage to sing The Best Years of My Life, an apt choice, and Ross is visibly moved by the opportunity, tearing up near the end before changing tack for Reach Out and Touch (Everybody\u2019s Hand). She\u2019s now going around the audience to get others involved (including Jaden Smith!) and everyone has remained on their feet throughout. So interestingly Ariana Grande, a no-show tonight after a fallout with producers, had tweeted support for Drake\u2019s anti-Grammys speech but deleted it soon after. Here\u2019s a screengrab though ... Oof finally, another award, thank God for that *checks watch*. A competitive race here but Drake, the second most-nominated artist tonight wins out. And wait, Drake is actually there! Rumours had suggested he wasn\u2019t going to attend but as a surprise, he entered from stage left to pick up his Grammy. He makes a swift dig at the Grammys for finally including him in the right category (he had previously attacked them for calling Hotline Bling a rap song) before explaining that sold out tour dates and success outside of awards ceremonies is what really matters. It\u2019s an interesting win-lose for the Grammys with Drake attending but then using his speech to sort of tear them apart. One of the night\u2019s more interesting moments for sure. Keys is running through a medley of songs she wishes she has written, including Killing Me Softly, Use Somebody, Doo Wop (That Thing) and Unforgettable, and it would have been a rotten waste to hire a talented singer and musician like this and not have her perform. But yeah just a reminder that we\u2019re almost two hours in and only three awards have been handed out on stage ... Alicia Keys is playing two pianos at the same time. James Corden/most people in the world could never. No surprise here with the breakout country pop star winning the big country award of the night (it\u2019s her third time on stage tonight already). \u201cI love country music with everything that I am and I\u2019m very proud to be charing my version of that with the world,\u201d a very flattered and gracious Musgraves says to the crowd. Another performance! Only two awards handed out in the first 90 minutes! Just saying! But hey, here\u2019s one of the night\u2019s biggest moments: Cardi B. While many big stars decided not to perform or even attend tonight, the rapper, who boasts multiple nominations tonight, remains one of the best gets by eager producers. She\u2019s performing Money on a cushioned lounge club set, using her vibrant stage presence to remind us all just why she\u2019s at the top of her game right now. She\u2019s effortlessly in control and even an accidental necklace slip doesn\u2019t put her off, vamping across the stage with style. I predict some major wins for her later. I mean ... Already a Grammy winner tonight, one of the year\u2019s breakout artists H.E.R. has now taken to the stage, complete with a see-through guitar! She\u2019s been quickly racking up an impressive set of songs, released via EPs, and it\u2019s great to see her given such a big stage. Singing one of her more recent songs Hard Place, she\u2019s joined by a choir to add even more soul and it\u2019s a rousing reminder that the Grammys has made some good decisions this year. For once. Dolly\u2019s show-stopping performance is landing rather well on Twitter: Oh and a rather big trailer was dropped last commercial break! Here\u2019s a longer look at Aladdin, featuring Will Smith as a very swole genie One of the biggest setpieces tonight now: a tribute to Dolly Parton. An all-star set of performers, including Miley Cyrus (again), Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris, Little BIg Town and Katy Perry, are here to do so. It starts with the far less experienced Musgraves sing Perry off the stage before the pair is joined by Parton herself. After they all take turns to sing Here You Come Again, Cyrus, Parton\u2019s god-daughter, joins her for a Jolene duet. It\u2019s rare to see a Grammys tribute actually feature the person being celebrated and it\u2019s a joy to see Parton have fun with younger generations all enjoying her music. The medley continues, with help from Morris and then Little Big Town, and it\u2019s an unusual example of a group performance on the Grammys that actually works as intended. Parton\u2019s stage presence remains really quite something. Just to add that Childish Gambino\u2019s win for song of the year is quite a landmark victory. Apparently it\u2019s the first time a hip-hop track has won that particular award. The same goes for record of the year so let\u2019s see what happens later ... Post Malone surprising millions now by actually singing rather well before launching into Rockstar, the song he was supposed to be reportedly performing with 21 Savage. Instead, he\u2019s then joined by Red Hot Chili Peppers and quite frankly, the mix of the two acts is a total mess. It\u2019s hard to figure out who is singing what and why anyone thought this would be a good idea. Might be a problem with the volume of the microphones but it\u2019s not pleasant. These duets are often a gamble and this one is most definitely a gamble that didn\u2019t pay off. Something resembling a comedy skit now with Alicia Keys talking about her regret over not winning song of the year and instead, losing to John Mayer. He then joins her on stage. It\u2019s not entirely not funny? Weird to announce this one so early (it\u2019s usually right near the end) but nice to see one of the year\u2019s best songs get the attention it deserves, especially at a ceremony that often rewards the more obvious tracks. Donald Glover isn\u2019t in attendance though, one of many stars who isn\u2019t, and there\u2019s a bit of an awkward fumble on stage right after. Google Pixel also just premiered a rather excellent new ad that sees Childish Gambino have a dance off with a \u201cplaymoji\u201d version of himself. Shame he won\u2019t be dancing at the actual ceremony though ... A drastic tempo change now with Janelle Monae, up for some of the night\u2019s biggest awards, performing Make Me Feel. There\u2019s her trademark sci-fi slant to the staging, with a group of latex-clad women dancing with her on stage, sort of like her own stormtroopers. It\u2019s a strings-heavy take on the song and wait, Monae has now been joined by more women all wearing the much-talked about pink vagina pants. This should happen next year: Kacey Musgraves, one of the last year\u2019s biggest breakout stars, is on stage singing her ballad Rainbow. It\u2019s a stripped back, slow moment and it\u2019s nice to see her allowed to perform one of the lesser known tracks from her album rather than another performance of High Horse, which surely even she is sick of at this stage. She\u2019s already won best country performance and best country song tonight. And here\u2019s a look at that supergroup of women who got everyone on their feet in the opening: Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Alicia Keys, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez. No real surprise here but a deserved win for the show-stopping song that brought the house down in A Star is Born. Gaga is there to collect it alone as Cooper is at the Baftas, which is probably for the best given that, well, we know what happened when this happened to Ally and Jackson. Gaga uses her speech to discuss the importance of the film\u2019s focus on mental health and offers some kind, worthy advice to a big crowd. Shawn Mendes is on stage with a sort of half maybe slightly on fire piano, which has a sort of Monster House vibe to it as if it\u2019s about to come alive and eat the poor lad. He\u2019s moved from piano to guitar and has been joined by Miley Cyrus. They are singing In My Blood, his anthem about overcoming anxiety. Cyrus is a nifty addition to the song and is always a hugely underrated live performer. It\u2019s one of many duets tonight and with two live performances before an award has been handed out on stage, it\u2019s also a reminder that tonight is going to be music-heavy. Alicia Keys is here and after turning heads on the red carpet in red, she\u2019s already had her first outfit change of the night. She arrived to a standing ovastion. \u201cThis is love, this is light, this is living,\u201d she said to the crowd. While she might not be a trained host, her experience as a performer means that she\u2019s extremely comfortable in front of such a big crowd. Eschewing jokes, she\u2019s choosing to focus on positivity while it\u2019s easy to be cynical, it\u2019s a refreshing change, especially given the fact we\u2019ve had to see James Corden mug his way through this bit in years past. There\u2019s also quite the reveal with Keys introducing Michelle Obama, Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith and Jennifer Lopez aka \u201csome of her sisters\u201d. Each woman is talking about how much music means to them with Obama receiving the most electric reaction I\u2019ve heard at an awards ceremony for years. \u201cMusic has always helped me tell my story,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a smart way for producers to counter claims that last year\u2019s ceremony was a tad too male and that this year\u2019s ceremony is a tad too light on big names. The 61st Grammy awards has officially kicked off! Get settled in because it\u2019s going to be an exhaustingly long night. The first performer is Camila Cabello with some help from Ricky Martin, Young Thug , J Balvinand others. It\u2019s a rather fantastic set with the singer belting out Havana in a West Side Story-esque stage production. She\u2019s a technically flawless performer but given that it\u2019s a song that was released almost 18 months ago, it feels like a slightly dusty way to kick things off. But damn, that set is so impressive, I kind of want the rest of the night to take place here. There\u2019s also an infectious party vibe that at least starts tonight off on a high note In case you want to make some bets with friends, pets or imaginary partners, here\u2019s our guesses for the biggest categories tonight: Aaaaaaand the most retweeted tweet of the evening is from someone who isn\u2019t going to be there this evening. Forgive the typo but a round of applause for Chrissy Teigen Bookmark this! It\u2019s an updating list of winners, including those who have already been announced. Many, many, many, more still to be added. Is it an egg? Is it a whole load of meat? Nope, it\u2019s Lady Gaga just wearing a very normal, but very nice, dress Cardi B is here! With Offset! And a confusing dress! Tonight\u2019s most nominated female artist is Brandi Carlile, a folk-rock singer songwriter whose sixth album has seen her crossover into the mainstream. Eve Barlow spoke to her recently about the nominations and her plan to subvert the ceremony More pictures of stars on the red carpet! Judge their outfits if you want! Grande isn\u2019t the only one who producers couldn\u2019t secure for a slot tonight. According to the New York Times, Kendrick Lamar, Drake and Childish Gambino all turned down the chance to perform. Drake has previously expressed frustration with the Grammys, starting in 2017 when he won best rap song and best rap/sung collaboration for Hotline Bling. He didn\u2019t attend that night and later said: \u201cEven though Hotline Bling is not a rap song ... the only category they can manage to fit me in is a rap category.\u201d The following year he refused to submit his playlist More Life for consideration. It\u2019s unclear if Drake will even attend although well-known awards predictor YouTube has revealed it things that he will win the most Grammys tonight, based on the popularity of his videos. Back to Jennifer Lopez, who\u2019s received heat for reportedly heading up tonight\u2019s Motown tribute. She has a defender! And it\u2019s Smokey Robinson! Someone who knows a thing or two about Motown... \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who is intelligent is upset,\u201d he said to Variety. \u201cI think anyone who is upset is stupid.\u201d So there you go. This year will see an emotional tribute to Aretha Franklin, who died last August. Her death was just prior to the VMAs which led to a last-minute, much-criticised speech from Madonna who shared some personal anecdotes before announcing best video of the year. While she was met with complaints labelling it self-indulgent, she later defended her words, claiming that it wasn\u2019t intended to be a tribute. Tonight will be see a more formal tribute to the singer from Yolanda Adams, Andra Day and American Idol alum Fantasia Barrino, who also performed at Franklin\u2019s funeral last year. Janelle Monae is pulling a classic Janelle Monae, in that she is looking like no one else on this or any other red carpet. As a non-fashion expert, I predict that fashion experts will be all over this tomorrow: As mentioned before, she won\u2019t be performing or even attending tonight but Ariana Grande has shared her gratitude for winning her first ever Grammy on Twitter: We\u2019ve been allowed a sneak peek of who will be sitting next to who and, well, the most surprising thing about these images is just how atrociously uncomfortable the seats look. I predict Gaga will spend most of the night cracking her neck. Joy Villa, a singer mainly known for wearing attention-seeking far-right dresses on the Grammys red carpet has, well, made herself known yet again this year for wearing an attention-seeking far-right dress on the Grammys red carpet. I guess it worked because here I am posting about it but yes, after her pro-life get-up last year, now here\u2019s her build the wall outfit. Good luck making small talk tonight Joy! Tonight\u2019s host is 15-time winner Grammy award winner Alicia Keys, making a refreshing change from James Corden (although, a stack of wet books would have made a refreshing change from James Corden) and it\u2019ll be the first time in 14 years that a woman has taken charge of the show. She\u2019s a confident performer but can she impress as a host? The above stab at comedy is, ahem, not exactly a laugh riot. There\u2019s also a small protest outside of the Grammy Museum on behalf of 21 Savage, who is no longer able to perform tonight because of ICE intervention. Footage here: When you think of Motown, unless you also happen to be looking directly at a picture of her, it\u2019s entirely unlikely that you\u2019d think of Jennifer Lopez. The singer, whose music bears no resemblance to the soul empire, has raised eyebrows with the announcement that she will be headlining a Motown tribute during tonight\u2019s ceremony. Twitter has been buzzing ... The red carpet is filling up with stars, including Ricky Martin, Ella Mai, Leon Bridges, Camila Cabello and Questlove. Here\u2019s a whole bunch of pics (more on the way): 21 Savage was set to attend tonight\u2019s ceremony but as you may have heard, he was arrested last week and is being threatened with deportation because of Ice questioning his citizenship. His co-manager took to Twitter to complain that those involved with the Grammys won\u2019t let his mother take his ticket. Here\u2019s what he has to say: Because there are just so many damn Grammys, a whole bunch have already been announced, including some rather big ones. It\u2019s been a good night for Lady Gaga already and Ariana Grande, a no-show, has won her first Grammy. Here are some of the big winners so far: Best pop solo performance: Lady Gaga - Joanne Best pop vocal album: Ariana Grande - Sweetener Best music video: Childish Gambino - This is America Best urban contemporary album: Beyonce and Jay-Z - Everything is Love Best R&amp;B song: Ella Mai - Boo\u2019d Up Best alternative music album: Beck - Colors Best music film: Quincy Best comedy album: Dave Chappelle - Equanimity &amp; the Bird Revelation Best Americana album: Brandi Carlile - By the Way, I Forgive You Best song written for visual media: Lady Gaga &amp; Bradley Cooper - Shallow One big name who won\u2019t be performing, or even attending, tonight is Ariana Grande, despite being heavily featured in ads promoting the ceremony. Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich had originally said that Grande was initially slated to appear but \u201cfelt it was too late for her to pull something together\u201d. The singer responded on Twitter claiming this was incorrect. \u201cI\u2019ve kept mouth shut but now you\u2019re lying about me,\u201d she tweeted, explaining her absence was down to a stifling of creativity and self-expression. It\u2019s a major blow for the producers with Grande sitting pretty at the very top of the food chain and comes after a similar problem last year when Lorde refused to perform after only being offered a spot in a Tom Petty tribute over a solo sequence. Music\u2019s biggest, and longest, night is here yet again with a host of major names lined up to either win, lose or perform. This year\u2019s nominees are led by Kendrick Lamar, whose explosive opening was one of last year\u2019s inarguable highlights, and after winning five awards that same night, he\u2019s up for eight for his work on the Black Panther soundtrack. It\u2019s a film that\u2019s featuring heavily this awards season, as the first superhero adventure ever to receive a best picture nomination, and just two weeks after it picked up the biggest award of the night at the SAGs, can it dominate the Grammys as well? Competition comes in the form of Drake, Boi-1da, Brandi Carlile, Cardi B and Lady Gaga, whose Star is Born soundtrack should also be a force to reckon with. She\u2019s one of many A-list performers scheduled for the night, alongside Janelle Monae, Miley Cyrus, Ricky Martin, Diana Ross and Shawn Mendes. We\u2019ll be here for the whole damn thing. Come sit with us.",

In all, 31 women took home awards Sunday night \u2013 up from 17 the year before.</p> \n<p>At three and a half hours, the Grammys were more concert than award show \u2013 and the emotional high point fittingly arrived in self-tributes to two iconic female artists, country icon and bouffant legend Dolly Parton, and ultimate 70s diva Diana Ross.</p> \n<p>Parton, 73, and with as much stage presence as ever, took the stage with her god-daughter Miley Cyrus, Little Big Town, Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris for a medley of hits \u2013 Here You Come Again, Jolene, After the Gold Rush and a bouncing rendition of the working-women anthem 9 to 5.</p> \n<p>Ross, resplendent in a scarlet gown, celebrated her upcoming 75th birthday with an uplifting tour through her catalog, with added inflections of \u201ctogether we have no limits\u201d, \u201cAll is possible with music and with you\u201d, and birthday diva staple \u201chappy birthday to me!\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26474c181eb58cfb04aefa055b35d6c51ccf777d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26474c181eb58cfb04aefa055b35d6c51ccf777d/0_0_4803_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drake and Neil Portnow backstage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drake and Neil Portnow backstage.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Kovac/Getty Images for The Recording Academy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For all the celebration, however, the Grammys could not escape its prominent detractors \u2013 the biggest elephant in the room Sunday night was who wasn\u2019t actually in the room. Multi-nominees Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar and Drake <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/arts/music/grammy-awards-diversity.html\">reportedly declined to perform</a> \u2013 further evidence of that \u201cthe fact of the matter is, we continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world\u201d, as Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich told the New York Times. Ariana Grande, whose album Thank U, Next, is currently dominating world streams, contentiously pulled out after producers refused to let her perform her hit 7 Rings.</p> \n<p>However, in a surprise twist, Drake hopped on stage to accept his award for best rap song, though not before taking a veiled jab at the Grammys.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe play an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,\u201d he told aspiring artists. \u201cThis is a business where sometimes, it\u2019s up to a bunch of people who might not understand what a mixed-race kid in Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York or anybody else.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe point is, you\u2019ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word.\u201d If you have people with regular jobs coming to your shows, then \u201cyou don\u2019t need this right here. I promise you, you already won,\u201d he said before the show cut him off.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeautifully said,\u201d Grande replied in a since-deleted tweet.</p> \n<p>Also pointedly absent on Sunday was 21 Savage, who was reportedly set to perform his hit Rockstar with Post Malone until he was detained by Ice for overstaying an immigration visa in his youth. The rapper remains in custody, as a small group of protesters outside the Grammys museum and a #Free21Savage hashtag spreading on Twitter reminded.</p> \n<p>Twitter watchers also found plenty of material in perhaps the night\u2019s biggest and most confusing bungle: Jennifer Lopez\u2019s tribute to the hits of Motown. Though joined by Keys, Smokey Robinson and Ne-Yo, the performance was more cavorting Vegas revue than authentic homage to the legendary Detroit record label of almost exclusively black artists.</p>",

At three and a half hours, the Grammys were more concert than award show \u2013 and the emotional high point fittingly arrived in self-tributes to two iconic female artists, country icon and bouffant legend Dolly Parton, and ultimate 70s diva Diana Ross. Parton, 73, and with as much stage presence as ever, took the stage with her god-daughter Miley Cyrus, Little Big Town, Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris for a medley of hits \u2013 Here You Come Again, Jolene, After the Gold Rush and a bouncing rendition of the working-women anthem 9 to 5. Ross, resplendent in a scarlet gown, celebrated her upcoming 75th birthday with an uplifting tour through her catalog, with added inflections of \u201ctogether we have no limits\u201d, \u201cAll is possible with music and with you\u201d, and birthday diva staple \u201chappy birthday to me!\u201d For all the celebration, however, the Grammys could not escape its prominent detractors \u2013 the biggest elephant in the room Sunday night was who wasn\u2019t actually in the room. Multi-nominees Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar and Drake reportedly declined to perform \u2013 further evidence of that \u201cthe fact of the matter is, we continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world\u201d, as Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich told the New York Times. Ariana Grande, whose album Thank U, Next, is currently dominating world streams, contentiously pulled out after producers refused to let her perform her hit 7 Rings. However, in a surprise twist, Drake hopped on stage to accept his award for best rap song, though not before taking a veiled jab at the Grammys. \u201cWe play an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,\u201d he told aspiring artists. \u201cThis is a business where sometimes, it\u2019s up to a bunch of people who might not understand what a mixed-race kid in Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York or anybody else.\u201d \u201cThe point is, you\u2019ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word.\u201d If you have people with regular jobs coming to your shows, then \u201cyou don\u2019t need this right here. I promise you, you already won,\u201d he said before the show cut him off. \u201cBeautifully said,\u201d Grande replied in a since-deleted tweet. Also pointedly absent on Sunday was 21 Savage, who was reportedly set to perform his hit Rockstar with Post Malone until he was detained by Ice for overstaying an immigration visa in his youth. The rapper remains in custody, as a small group of protesters outside the Grammys museum and a #Free21Savage hashtag spreading on Twitter reminded. Twitter watchers also found plenty of material in perhaps the night\u2019s biggest and most confusing bungle: Jennifer Lopez\u2019s tribute to the hits of Motown. Though joined by Keys, Smokey Robinson and Ne-Yo, the performance was more cavorting Vegas revue than authentic homage to the legendary Detroit record label of almost exclusively black artists.",

Bob Spriggs, who suffered from dementia and Parkinson\u2019s disease, first entered the Oakden in January 2016 and died six months later, the royal commission into aged care heard in Adelaide on Monday. His wife, Barbara, and son, Clive, helped blow the whistle on widespread abuse and use of chemical restraints and were the first witnesses. Their complaint sparked a state investigation into the centre which dubbed it \u201ca shameful chapter in South Australia\u2019s history\u201d. Spriggs had been given 10 times the dose of anti-psychotic drugs and had suffered unexplained bruising, the royal commission was told. An emotional Mrs Spriggs said it wasn\u2019t easy to speak out and it took a long time to be heard. \u201cIt took all my courage and will to keep going,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeaking out lifted the lid on a problem which was much wider than the way Bob had been treated.\u201d She talked about enormous \u201choops\u201d the family had to go through to find out what happened to him, including lodging a freedom of information request and navigating a bureaucratic maze. Mrs Spriggs called for a plain English and user-friendly complaints system, that wasn\u2019t solely online, as well as an automatic red flag trigger at hospital level if aged care residents are found with unexplained bruises. \u201cI think about those people who hurt Bob and I wonder whether they are employed somewhere else,\u201d Mrs Spriggs said. \u201cI wonder if their [new] employers know about their previous conduct.\u201d A national database that tracked abusive employees\u2019 conduct would help provide greater levels of accountability, Mrs Spriggs said. Mr Spriggs said CCTV footage would help keep vulnerable residents safe. He questioned where Oakden staff were now and whether they worked in the sector interstate. \u201cThere should be a mark against their name,\u201d Mr Spriggs said. \u201cNobody has been made accountable for what happened to my dad.\u201d Mrs Spriggs described the accommodation at Oakden as \u201c19th century\u201d and said it had been heartbreaking to leave her husband at such a \u201crundown\u201d facility. \u201cIt was like a prison,\u201d Mrs Spriggs said. \u201cMy gut was telling me this was not good.\u201d Mrs Spriggs was in disbelief that auditors had missed key signs of abuse at Oakden and said they needed better training. Oakden had met all 44 aged care standards during a check in February 2016 and was reaccredited until 2019. It also passed an unannounced inspection in October 2016. A March 2017 audit found 15 of 44 standards had not been met \u2013 three sanctions were imposed and accreditation period reduced to October 2017. Council on the ageing chief executive Ian Yates questioned whether tougher sanctions were needed and whether some people should be banned from the industry. Yates said the system was missing out on using competition as a tool to lift quality. \u201cWhat are the incentives to do well?\u201d he said. Good providers needed the capacity to expand in areas where poor services were being delivered, Yates said. He pointed to a star system in the United Kingdom that ranked aged care centres and acknowledged ones going above and beyond, those failing and needing to improve in certain areas. Yates noted that privacy provisions in aged care laws were a constraint in publishing information about complaints. \u201cIf a decision has been made about a complaint, everybody ought to know about it,\u201d he said. Yates expressed concern that the use of sedative drugs in nursing homes was much higher than clinically expected. \u201cIt\u2019s far too widespread,\u201d he said, adding that food quality also needed improvement. In some cases residents were going hungry missing meals because no staff were available to hand-feed them, Yates said. The hearing was told the aged care sector was ill-equipped to care for people who acquired disabilities after the age of 65, which is the cut off for the national disability insurance scheme. Counsel assisting, Peter Gray, told the hearing 900 out of the 2,000 aged care homes across the country had met the royal commission\u2019s deadline to provide information about substandard care incidents. And 79 out of the 100 biggest aged care service providers had responded to the commission. Gray warned those aged care providers who hadn\u2019t done their homework would be closely scrutinised. Gray said 800 public submissions had been received so far and staffing levels, quality of care and substandard care were the dominant issues. The hearings in Adelaide, overseen by commissioners Richard Tracey and Lynelle Briggs, will continue for the next two days and next week before sessions around the country. Ahead of Monday\u2019s hearing Scott Morrison unveiled a $662m funding boost to aged care. The prime minister earmarked $320m to residential facilities, the equivalent of about $1,800 per Australian resident \u2013 to help improve services for residents, while the rest will be spent on home care packages. The commission\u2019s final report deadline is 30 April next year.",

      "bodyText": "The prominent economist and Reserve Bank board member Ian Harper has warned the Morrison government against pursuing its controversial \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation, declaring \u201coverreach\u201d in Australia\u2019s energy sector would likely be harmful. Harper, who was appointed by the Coalition to review Australia\u2019s competition policy and serve on the central bank board, has used a submission to a parliamentary inquiry to warn the Morrison government against pursuing special sanctions for the energy sector. Harper\u2019s competition policy inquiry recommended changes to the misuse of market power provisions in Australian trade practices law, but did not recommend a divestiture power because it was considered unnecessary and undesirable. The prominent economist and dean of the Melbourne Business School says in his submission to the inquiry that divestiture powers \u2013 which are being proposed in the so-called \u201cbig stick\u201d package \u2013 were avoided in his review because \u201cthey are unpredictable in their impact and may even be counterproductive if the segregated entities prove to be commercially unviable, potentially leaving the market less competitive after forced divestiture than it was beforehand\u201d. He says the powers being proposed in the government\u2019s energy policy overhaul \u201care neither necessary nor desirable\u201d. Harper says changes to the misuse of market power provisions, which the parliament has now adopted, has given regulators sufficient power to take action if there is anti-competitive behaviour in the energy sector. He says competition policy should not discriminate against particular sectors of the economy, and to do so \u201cdistorts investment decisions, promoting inefficiency and ultimately harming the interests of consumers\u201d. Harper says singling out one industry for a particular sanction would create \u201cmore intrusive regulation imbalances\u201d in competition policy. He says his competition inquiry rejected calls to single out supermarkets and fuel retailers for special treatment for that reason. \u201cOver-reach is harmful because it is counterproductive \u2013 it harms competition by penalising pro-competitive conduct,\u201d Harper says. \u201cThe threat of divestiture discourages investment and hence the entry of new capital into an industry. Actual forced divestiture may reduce rather than increase the number of competitors in an industry if the dismembered parts of a corporation are commercially unviable\u201d. The expert critique comes as the \u201cbig stick\u201d package faces amendments in the event it clears the House of Representatives in the short parliamentary sitting period before the federal election. On Monday the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick confirmed the party\u2019s intention to push amendments in the Senate to extend the divestiture powers beyond the energy industry to the economy-at-large \u2013 a development he flagged to Guardian Australia late last year. Patrick told Guardian Australia the Centre Alliance plan would amend the government\u2019s \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation to allow courts to break up companies found to have \u201cabused their market power\u201d in any industry \u2013 an idea that may win support from Nationals who have long championed such a mechanism. He said the party would then push for a second divestiture power in corporations law for other forms of misconduct, in circumstances such as the banks\u2019 conduct revealed at the financial services royal commission. Patrick said the threshold for that penalty was \u201cstill under consideration\u201d, with options including listing particular offences where divestiture is available or specifying courts only break companies up where they have engaged in \u201cegregious\u201d or repeated offences. Centre Alliance cannot introduce the second plank into the government\u2019s energy bill, but Patrick said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that recommendations of the royal commission will require corporations law changes that will provide an opportunity.",

Ethical lobbying is a valuable and important element of a healthy democracy. It helps those who have a stake in government policy to convey their views and expertise. There are two broad types of lobbyists: third-party lobbyists, who are engaged as consultants; in-house lobbyists, who work directly for corporations or interest groups.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who hires lobbyists? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For many Australians, lobbying conjures images of powerful corporations working to sway politicians behind the scenes. There is a truth in that. The big banks, mining and energy giants, pharmaceutical companies, casinos, Amazon, Google and Facebook all engage lobbyists. But lobbyists also work on behalf of not-for-profits and community groups, including for veterans, social workers, aged-care staff, school principals and environmental organisations.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the lobbyist register? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The lobbyist register is the public's only window into the world of lobbying. It's a publicly available online list of lobbying firms, individual lobbyists and their clients. The register was a huge step forward when it was introduced in 2008, but remains frustratingly opaque. It doesn't tell us who is lobbying whom, about what, or when. Compare that with the ACT, where lobbyists are required to file quarterly reports on their activities, or NSW, where ministers are required to publish their diaries. The federal register is also completely blind to the activities of in-house lobbyists.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the lobbyist code of conduct?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The code tells lobbyists how they must behave when approaching the government and is designed to maintain ethical standards. But the code is not legislated and has no real teeth. It goes largely unenforced and the punishments are weak. The worst sanction available to authorities is removing a lobbyist from the register. The US and Canada have fines or jail terms for law breaches.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who keeps an eye on lobbyists? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Federally it's the prime minister's&nbsp; department that loosely oversees lobbying. It takes on a largely administrative role, rather than an investigative or regulatory one. Its core job is to maintain the register and communicate the code's requirements to lobbyists. It lacks independence, relies on reports of bad lobbying and rarely, if ever, takes enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some states, including <a href=\"https://www.dpc.nsw.gov.au/publications/ministers-diary-disclosures/\">New South Wales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cabinet.qld.gov.au/ministers/diaries.aspx\">Queensland</a>, have partially addressed the problem by publishing the diaries of ministers, which shows who they have met with and what issue was discussed.</p> \n<p>Whish-Wilson said the backflip on the registry was an \u201call too familiar trend\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cLong after the announcement to deflect public outrage, the lobbyists walk the halls and get their way,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows that this government serves at the pleasure of the rich and the powerful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jason Ward, the principal analyst at the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, said beneficial ownership registers have already been set up in several jurisdictions and were \u201cnow part of emerging global standards\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSetting up a registry would be a cheap, simple and effective first step towards making companies pay their fair share of tax,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact the government has spent nearly three years talking about this and has achieved absolutely nothing begs the question, what are they scared of?\u201d</p> \n<p>Shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, said Australians \u201cdeserve to know who truly owns our firms\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnly Labor will crack down on tax havens and multinational tax avoidance,\u201d he said. </p>",

Then, for 18 months, they were in a sexual relationship.</p> <p>But last year, when Pavan Gupta* turned 24, his parents began pressuring him to marry. When they introduced him to a girl he liked, Gupta ended his relationship with his girlfriend, Geeta Jain, telling her he could not disappoint his parents. \u201cI liked her but I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life with her. I always told her I was an only child and would have to go along with my parents\u2019 choice,\u201d says Gupta.</p> <p>In March, as Gupta was preparing for his wedding, Jain went to the Delhi police and accused him of rape. She said she had slept with him only on promise of marriage and, since he had not married her, consent was procured on a false pretext, making the sex rape.</p> <p>\u201cEven if I had misled her and told her I\u2019d marry her, it still wouldn\u2019t make the sex rape. How can consensual sex for over a year be rape?\u201d asks Gupta.</p> <p>Last month, the supreme court ruled that rape cannot be invoked in cases of consensual sex after a relationship ends and the man declines to marry the woman, for whatever reason. The judges said a clear distinction had to be drawn between the two. But the ruling is of no help to Gupta. His life has already been shattered.</p> <p>His mother had a heart attack a week after she learned of the accusation against him. She died a few days later. His fiancee called off the wedding.

Research carried out in 2015 by journalist Rukmini Shrinivasan, who worked for the Hindu newspaper at the time, revealed that when parents discover their unmarried daughters are in a sexual relationship, their horror at potential \u201cdishonour\u201d to the family name leads many to make spurious allegations of rape, having first bullied their children into submission.</p> <p>By their logic, saying a daughter has been raped is preferable to people thinking she is sexually active.

They raise plenty of questions, too. Even if a man promised to marry a woman, can he not change his mind? How can judges determine a man\u2019s sincerity or falsity in talking of marriage?</p> <p>Even more troubling is that the notion of sex constituting rape if a man \u201creneges\u201d on a promise of marriage is not in the penal code. It has evolved on a case-by-case basis as a result of judges choosing to interpret the notion of \u201cconsent\u201d in this fashion. As a consequence, men can be charged with rape if they falsely obtain consent for sex by promising to marry a woman and then changing their mind.</p> <p>The only solace for men who have been falsely accused is that many of these cases are thrown out of court. The supreme court ruling last month, for example, related to a nurse at a government hospital in Maharashtra. She was a widow who fell in love with a doctor and moved in with him. After living together for some years, he left her and married someone else.</p> <p>The judges said that having lived with the man for some years, the nurse could not allege rape. They pointed out that it was possible the doctor, on account of circumstances he could not have foreseen or could not control, was not able or willing to marry her. Whatever the reason, it was not rape. The doctor was acquitted.</p> <p>But between the arrest and the acquittal lies much distress. Jeevan Kishore is married with two children and works as a \u201chalwai\u201d or sweet maker in New Delhi. He started a sexual relationship with a much older woman who was separated from her husband and had two children. \u201cShe was financially in bad shape. I used to lend her money, pay for her rent sometimes, and for medical costs if her relatives back in the village fell ill,\u201d says Kishore.</p> <p>When her young son fell ill, Kishore paid the hospital bills. When he died, he paid for the funeral. Then, he says, she began demanding larger and larger sums of money. \u201cShe told me if I didn\u2019t give her the money, she would accuse me of rape. I was dumbstruck,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Eighteen months ago, that\u2019s exactly what she did. Last month, he was acquitted. \u201cMy wife was angry with me over my unfaithfulness but she knew I was incapable of rape. I thank God the judge realised it was a false case.

      "bodyText": "Their romance began at work. She asked him out for coffee with her friends. He took her out for lunch. Dinners and walks in New Delhi\u2019s Lodhi Gardens followed. Then, for 18 months, they were in a sexual relationship. But last year, when Pavan Gupta* turned 24, his parents began pressuring him to marry. When they introduced him to a girl he liked, Gupta ended his relationship with his girlfriend, Geeta Jain, telling her he could not disappoint his parents. \u201cI liked her but I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life with her. I always told her I was an only child and would have to go along with my parents\u2019 choice,\u201d says Gupta. In March, as Gupta was preparing for his wedding, Jain went to the Delhi police and accused him of rape. She said she had slept with him only on promise of marriage and, since he had not married her, consent was procured on a false pretext, making the sex rape. \u201cEven if I had misled her and told her I\u2019d marry her, it still wouldn\u2019t make the sex rape. How can consensual sex for over a year be rape?\u201d asks Gupta. Last month, the supreme court ruled that rape cannot be invoked in cases of consensual sex after a relationship ends and the man declines to marry the woman, for whatever reason. The judges said a clear distinction had to be drawn between the two. But the ruling is of no help to Gupta. His life has already been shattered. His mother had a heart attack a week after she learned of the accusation against him. She died a few days later. His fiancee called off the wedding. He lost his job. His peace of mind was destroyed. The trial is dragging on because Jain frequently does not attend hearings. Something strange is going on in India. Women are becoming more educated and confident. Pre-marital sex is on the rise \u2013 a hotel chain called StayUncle offers rooms for an hour or two to couples seeking somewhere to have sex.

A welder stands by ready to seal it into the wall of one of hundreds of units the company is constructing for the Dubai-owned Damac tower block in Nine Elms, south-west London.

Signs pasted over the units read: \u201cWet plaster!\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t step on the ceiling!\u201d</p> <p>Von Gruben and other shareholders rescued Deba from bankruptcy in the early 1990s, transforming it into one of Europe\u2019s leading bathroom specialists. It now has an annual turnover of \u20ac25m (\u00a322m) and employs around 180 staff in Germany and 50 in Poland.</p> <p>Each week it transports around five lorryloads of ready-to-use bathroom units complete down to the last detail, including plugs and shaving points.

Until, that is, Brexit came along.\u201d</p> <p>The company had already suffered from the sharp fall in the value of the pound after the 2016 referendum, which meant lower euro returns on jobs in progress that had been calculated in pounds.

      "bodyText": "Dietrich von Gruben finds it distressing on a personal and professional level that Britain wants to leave the EU, but he accepts the decision with a qualification. \u201cIf you join a club you should also be able to leave it, but you should at least prepare a way or have an idea as to how you want to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cI am quite anxious about what the complete lack of preparedness might mean for my business.\u201d The managing shareholder of Deba, a manufacturer of pre-fabricated bathrooms, overwhelmingly for the luxury UK market, says uncertainty over Brexit has left him feeling very unclear about the future. The mittelstand firm \u2013 one of the 3.3m small to medium-sized, often family-run, companies which make up the backbone of the German economy \u2013 currently relies on the UK for 70% of its turnover. The factory floor in Salzwedel, Saxony-Anhalt, gives an insight into how British, or more specifically, London-focused the company has become since it entered the UK market eight years ago. Two workers are painstakingly arranging a mosaic of hundreds of tiny Versace-designed grey and white patterned tiles. A welder stands by ready to seal it into the wall of one of hundreds of units the company is constructing for the Dubai-owned Damac tower block in Nine Elms, south-west London. Deba is also proud of having completed no fewer than 1,242 bathrooms for the Battersea power station conversion \u2013 \u201cone of our biggest showpieces so far\u201d, Von Gruben says. Elsewhere a shower wall cut out of Thessaloniki Grigio marble is destined for a luxury development next to the Shard, for now the EU\u2019s tallest building, which Deba is kitting out with 290 bathrooms. Signs pasted over the units read: \u201cWet plaster!\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t step on the ceiling!\u201d Von Gruben and other shareholders rescued Deba from bankruptcy in the early 1990s, transforming it into one of Europe\u2019s leading bathroom specialists. It now has an annual turnover of \u20ac25m (\u00a322m) and employs around 180 staff in Germany and 50 in Poland. Each week it transports around five lorryloads of ready-to-use bathroom units complete down to the last detail, including plugs and shaving points. Timing is everything. The bathrooms must arrive to fit into tight building schedules, and almost immediately on delivery, are lifted up and slotted in before the outer walls and windows are added. Wind is the biggest day-to-day unknown. \u201cSuch an operation, involving a cube of up to 2.5 tonnes, is obviously precarious so you have to keep an eye on the weather,\u201d explains Georg von Gruben, Dietrich\u2019s son and business partner. These days, however, it is Brexit has far greater potential to blow the company off course. \u201cTo try to guess is like reading tea leaves,\u201d says his father. \u201cWhere\u2019s the voice of reason? I think the only one talking any sense right now is the Queen.\u201d The Danish haulier DFDS has been in talks with Deba to try to establish a plan of action and intends to stage a dry run with customs checks based on WTO rules at the port of Calais. \u201cIt\u2019ll be surreal to be effectively treated like a Russian,\u201d Von Gruben says. His son talks about the extensive effort the company has made to understand the British market since it first secured a licence in 2011. \u201cThe large number of regulations and provisions that deviate from German and EU norms \u2026 we had a few inevitable hiccups at the start, but this all comes naturally to us now, and for several years everything had been going swimmingly. Until, that is, Brexit came along.\u201d The company had already suffered from the sharp fall in the value of the pound after the 2016 referendum, which meant lower euro returns on jobs in progress that had been calculated in pounds. As soon as they were able, they adjusted their prices upward. \u201cYou take things like that on the chin. You have to,\u201d says Von Gruben junior. But what immediately concerns the company is the idea that its smooth-running operation might grind to a halt through no fault of its own. \u201cOur bathrooms could get stuck at the border, in which case we may not be able to fulfil outstanding contracts. Delays on the building site translate into higher costs, and in the worst-case scenario, customers would jump ship,\u201d he says.

He tells her the shots that killed Woodard were the first he has fired as a police officer. She wants him to tell her about his time in the jungle during the Vietnam war, but he\u2019d rather not. \u201cOne thing I learned in the war is that life happens now \u2026 I really don\u2019t spend time remembering stuff.\u201d</p> <p>In 1990, the task force is chewing over the Julie Purcell voicemail and the idea that Tom was in on his son\u2019s death and daughter\u2019s disappearance. The bigwigs want someone to \u201cgo at him hard\u201d, and West says he is up to the job. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that call was but no way we could be that wrong,\u201d says West before the pair talk to Tom. Hays suggests giving the interrogation to another member of the team, but West is adamant. \u201cThem mothers will eat him alive,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1f551da4c9f6661dd9c0eae2cb5aad47b27d92b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f551da4c9f6661dd9c0eae2cb5aad47b27d92b/0_98_5196_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy and Tom Purcell, parents of the missing children\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucy and Tom Purcell, parents of the missing children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warrick Page/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The interrogation sees West and Hays adopt a bad-cop-bad-cop routine with Purcell, who seems genuinely horrified by the suggestion that he is involved. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone who saw you after 6:30,\u201d says Hays. Purcell turns to West for help but gets nothing but a grimace back. He tells them he went back inside after working on his car and then listened to a St Louis Cardinals game. Hays tells him about the peephole they found in Will\u2019s room. The bosses now believe it was Tom who planted the evidence at Woodard\u2019s home.</p> <p>The phone call that Julie made came from a truck stop in Russellville. The duo head out there and Hays explains why he didn\u2019t mention that he thought the backpack and other evidence was planted at Woodard\u2019s house. He didn\u2019t want to give the bosses that info yet, he says, because he thought the timing was off, but also possibly because he knows that they can use information like that carelessly.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this blog details events in the sixth episode of the third season of True Detective, which airs on Sunday nights on HBO in the US, and Mondays in the UK on Sky Atlantic at 2am and 9pm. \u2018No way we could be that wrong\u2019 Hays and Amelia are in bed in 1980, partaking in some post-coitus pillow talk. He tells her the shots that killed Woodard were the first he has fired as a police officer. She wants him to tell her about his time in the jungle during the Vietnam war, but he\u2019d rather not. \u201cOne thing I learned in the war is that life happens now \u2026 I really don\u2019t spend time remembering stuff.\u201d In 1990, the task force is chewing over the Julie Purcell voicemail and the idea that Tom was in on his son\u2019s death and daughter\u2019s disappearance. The bigwigs want someone to \u201cgo at him hard\u201d, and West says he is up to the job. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that call was but no way we could be that wrong,\u201d says West before the pair talk to Tom. Hays suggests giving the interrogation to another member of the team, but West is adamant. \u201cThem mothers will eat him alive,\u201d he says. The interrogation sees West and Hays adopt a bad-cop-bad-cop routine with Purcell, who seems genuinely horrified by the suggestion that he is involved. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone who saw you after 6:30,\u201d says Hays. Purcell turns to West for help but gets nothing but a grimace back. He tells them he went back inside after working on his car and then listened to a St Louis Cardinals game. Hays tells him about the peephole they found in Will\u2019s room. The bosses now believe it was Tom who planted the evidence at Woodard\u2019s home. The phone call that Julie made came from a truck stop in Russellville. The duo head out there and Hays explains why he didn\u2019t mention that he thought the backpack and other evidence was planted at Woodard\u2019s house. He didn\u2019t want to give the bosses that info yet, he says, because he thought the timing was off, but also possibly because he knows that they can use information like that carelessly. He has another argument with Amelia, who reveals she is writing a sequel to her first non-fiction book. They spar about Hays\u2019s new position and his lack of ability to knot a tie. Amelia heads to a nunnery to talk to girls who might have ran with Julie.

      "bodyText": "Japanese women are pushing back against a tradition that dictates they must give chocolates to male colleagues on Valentine\u2019s Day, with growing anger at the practice of \u201cforced giving\u201d. Until recently, women in the workplace were expected to buy chocolates for their male workmates as part of a tradition called giri choco \u2013 literally, obligation chocolates. Men are supposed to reciprocate on 14 March on White Day \u2013 an event dreamed up by chocolate makers in the early 80s to boost sales. But there is growing evidence that giri choco is falling out of favour. For a growing number of people, the pressure to avoid causing offence by spending thousands of yen on chocolates for coworkers is becoming intolerable. Some companies are now banning the practice, which is seen by many workers as a form of abuse of power and harassment. A survey found that than 60% of women will instead buy chocolates as a personal treat on 14 February. More than 56% said they would give chocolates to family members, while 36% would make the same gesture towards partners or the objects of a crush. Keeping on the right side of colleagues, however, was furthest from their thoughts, with just 35% saying they planned to hand out chocolate treats to men at their workplace, according to the poll by a Tokyo department store. \u201cBefore the ban, we had to worry about things like how much is appropriate to spend on each chocolate and where we draw the line in who we give the chocolates to, so it\u2019s good that we no longer have this culture of forced giving,\u201d one of the surveyed office workers said, according to the Japan Today website. SoraNews24, meanwhile, reported on the recent phenomenon of gyaku choco \u2013 reverse chocolate \u2013 in which men give chocolates to spouses, girlfriends or prospective lovers. Giving chocolate as Valentine\u2019s Day gifts took off commercially in Japan in the mid-1950s, growing into a multimillion-dollar market that provides some manufacturers with a sizeable chunk of their annual sales in just a few days. But the backlash against giri choco has prompted some confectioners to revamp their marketing campaigns. In the run-up to Valentine\u2019s Day last year, the Belgian chocolatier Godiva caused a stir when it ran a full-page newspaper ad urging businesses to encourage female employees not to hand out giri choco if they felt they were doing so under duress. \u201cValentine\u2019s Day is a day when people convey their true feelings, not coordinate relationships at work,\u201d the ad said. While individual consumers weigh up their gift-giving options, Japan\u2019s collective Valentine\u2019s chocolate obsession is gathering pace as the day approaches. Japan Airlines will hand out chocolates to passengers \u2013 male and female \u2013 on all of its domestic and international flight on 14 February, while a hot spring resort near Tokyo has unveiled a bath filled with steaming \u201cchocolate water\u201d. But the prize for the most improbable Valentine\u2019s gimmick must go to a chain of sushi restaurants whose diners will be offered slivers of raw yellowtail raised on feed mixed with, yes, chocolate.",

Instead over the next five years, billions of dollars were either embezzled out of the country or laundered through subsidiary companies by those who ran it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0ea69362731cb12bcb18362ce93db044fb2e94f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0ea69362731cb12bcb18362ce93db044fb2e94f/0_225_3581_2149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malaysian police confiscate hundreds of designer handbags and dozens of suitcases containing cash and jewellery as part of an investigation into Najib Razak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malaysian police confiscate hundreds of designer handbags and dozens of suitcases containing cash and jewellery as part of an investigation into Najib Razak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is alleged about a quarter of the stolen funds ended up in Najib\u2019s personal bank account, funding lavish credit card spending sprees by him and his wife, Rosmah Mansour. Even more extravagant was the spending by financier Jho Low, a friend of Najib\u2019s stepson, Riza Aziz, who was an informal consultant on 1MDB. He allegedly siphoned billions from the fund, using it to buy vast amounts of prime Manhattan real estate, $8.1m worth of jewellery and a glass piano for Australian model Miranda Kerr, a Picasso painting and Oscar statuette for Leonardo Di Caprio, superyachts, and to throw ostentatious parties attended by the likes of Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Foxx. He even bankrolled Hollywood movie The Wolf of Wall Street.</p> <p>\u201cA number of corrupt 1MDB officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account,\u201d Lynch said in 2016.

Najib later organised an arrest warrant for Rewcastle-Brown, fired the attorney general who was investigating 1MDB, placed the damning report under the Official Secrets Act and removed all anti-corruption officers who were part of the investigation. A subsequent 1MDB probe, carried out under Najib\u2019s watch and widely considered to be a farce, then cleared the prime minister of all charges.</p> <p>For Rewcastle-Brown, the prospect of seeing Najib \u2013 who was in power for nine years before he was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/10/malaysia-election-confusion-as-rival-questions-mahathirs-right-to-be-sworn-in\"> toppled in the election</a> in May last year \u2013 on trial after so many years of being persecuted by his administration in her bid to expose 1MDB was \u201csurreal\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/1mdb-inside-story-worlds-biggest-financial-scandal-malaysia\">1MDB: The inside story of the world\u2019s biggest financial scandal | Randeep Ramesh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is quite something to see that it is he now in the dock, although I take no pleasure in his downfall,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a tribute to the power of public opinion, which Najib failed to judge.\u201d</p> <p>Even before it had reached the Malaysian high court, the revived 1MDB investigation, instigated by the new government as soon as they took power in May last year, already had the country gripped. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/najib-raids-273m-of-goods-seized-from-former-malaysian-pms-properties\">Raids on Najib\u2019s properties</a> saw the police seize a cache of luxury goods worth up to $273m - including 1,400 necklaces, 567 designer handbags, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras - the biggest seizure of its kind in Malaysian history.</p> <p>Subsequently, Najib was arrested on four separate occasions \u2013 the latest on Friday as he sat having an anniversary dinner with his wife.

      "bodyText": "It is known as the \u201clargest kleptocracy case in the world\u201d, a tangled tale of Hollywood celebrities, Malaysian politicians, luxury yachts, Picasso paintings, power and mind-boggling amounts of stolen money. On Tuesday the latest chapter begins in a corruption scandal that not only saw billions of dollars of Malaysian state money disappear, but also entangled Leonardo Di Caprio, Paris Hilton and Miranda Kerr; illicitly funded two Hollywood films and prime Manhattan real estate and dragged the reputation of one of the world\u2019s biggest investment banks into the mud. In a Kuala Lumpur court, the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak will stand trial for his alleged role in the 1MDB saga and what prosecutors will say were elaborate attempts to cover it up. Najib, who has consistently denied all charges, is the first ex-prime minister of Malaysia to face charges of corruption while in office. The anticipated airing of dirty political laundry in court over the next few months \u2013 in particular how Najib and his wife allegedly spent the millions of embezzled money \u2013 already has the country on tenterhooks. \u201cThis trial is hugely important for Malaysia,\u201d said Bridget Welsh, associate professor of political science at John Cabot University, who is an expert on Malaysian politics. \u201cThis is not just an issue of accountability, this is a huge international scandal which has really shamed Malaysia.\u201d A global scandal The ramifications of the trial will be felt not just in Malaysia but globally; it was US attorney general Loretta Lynch who described 1MDB as \u201cthe largest kleptocracy case\u201d in the world, and 1MDB investigations ongoing in 12 countries. In the US, the justice department charged two former Goldman Sachs bankers with conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from Malaysia\u2019s state development fund. \u201cThis trial involves not just Malaysia and Najib, this involves the whole global financial system and the people who gamed the system to their advantage,\u201d added Welsh. The 1MDB scandal began in 2009, when a newly sworn-in Najib set up and oversaw a government fund, titled 1Malaysia Development Berhad or 1MDB, whose intended purpose was helping attract foreign investment in Malaysia. Instead over the next five years, billions of dollars were either embezzled out of the country or laundered through subsidiary companies by those who ran it. It is alleged about a quarter of the stolen funds ended up in Najib\u2019s personal bank account, funding lavish credit card spending sprees by him and his wife, Rosmah Mansour. Even more extravagant was the spending by financier Jho Low, a friend of Najib\u2019s stepson, Riza Aziz, who was an informal consultant on 1MDB. He allegedly siphoned billions from the fund, using it to buy vast amounts of prime Manhattan real estate, $8.1m worth of jewellery and a glass piano for Australian model Miranda Kerr, a Picasso painting and Oscar statuette for Leonardo Di Caprio, superyachts, and to throw ostentatious parties attended by the likes of Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Foxx. He even bankrolled Hollywood movie The Wolf of Wall Street. \u201cA number of corrupt 1MDB officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account,\u201d Lynch said in 2016. International investigators now say at least $4.5bn was eventually stolen from 1MDB. An arrest warrant is out for Low \u2013 who went into hiding after Najib lost the election, many believe in China \u2013 and he has yet to be found by the Malaysian authorities. How it unravelled It was British journalist Clare Rewcastle-Brown who first exposed the scandal in early 2015 on her website The Sarawak Report. Najib later organised an arrest warrant for Rewcastle-Brown, fired the attorney general who was investigating 1MDB, placed the damning report under the Official Secrets Act and removed all anti-corruption officers who were part of the investigation. A subsequent 1MDB probe, carried out under Najib\u2019s watch and widely considered to be a farce, then cleared the prime minister of all charges. For Rewcastle-Brown, the prospect of seeing Najib \u2013 who was in power for nine years before he was toppled in the election in May last year \u2013 on trial after so many years of being persecuted by his administration in her bid to expose 1MDB was \u201csurreal\u201d. \u201cIt is quite something to see that it is he now in the dock, although I take no pleasure in his downfall,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a tribute to the power of public opinion, which Najib failed to judge.\u201d Even before it had reached the Malaysian high court, the revived 1MDB investigation, instigated by the new government as soon as they took power in May last year, already had the country gripped. Raids on Najib\u2019s properties saw the police seize a cache of luxury goods worth up to $273m - including 1,400 necklaces, 567 designer handbags, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras - the biggest seizure of its kind in Malaysian history. Subsequently, Najib was arrested on four separate occasions \u2013 the latest on Friday as he sat having an anniversary dinner with his wife. He faces a total of 42 charges relating to 1MDB, ranging from corruption and money laundering to abuse of power, taking illegal bribes and criminal breach of trust. His wife is facing 16 criminal charges. Both have pleaded not guilty to all counts and speaking after being arrested a second time in September last year, Najib told reporters: \u201cI am not a thief \u2026 but I am happy because now I have the opportunity to clear my name on this issue once and for all.\u201d If found guilty and given consecutive sentences, 65-year-old Najib could be facing years, if not a lifetime, behind bars. Tuesday\u2019s trial is the first of the three 1MDB-related trials that he is due to face and focuses on three charges of money laundering, three of criminal breach of trust and one of abuse of power relating to a sum of 42m Malaysian ringgit ($10m) which was transferred from a 1MDB subsidiary company, SRC International, into Najib\u2019s personal bank accounts. At a later date, he is due to face two more 1MDB trials, first relating to a sum of $681m, which Najib has maintained was a gift from a Saudi prince, and another on multiple charges of abuse of power. Separately from 1MDB, Najib is also due to face trial for charges relating to misappropriated funds from his party UMNO. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Najib meanwhile has sought to recast himself as a victim of a politicised vendetta and paint the trial as a political hit job, embarking on a full-blown social media campaign, which recently saw him record a viral video of him singing 1970s hit Kiss and Say Goodbye, but with the lyrics altered to criticise the new government and protest his innocence. Yet, Welsh was sceptical about how effective this charm offensive, which has also attempted to polarise the country along volatile ethnic lines, would be in shifting the court of public opinion in the former prime minister\u2019s favour. \u201cI think finally people will understand how much damage Najib has done to Malaysia.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>With its bloated lineups and flag-wearing clientele, the multi-city Big Day Out (BDO) was long seen as the king of the Australian festival scene. In its final years the festival waned in popularity, its splintered audiences instead opting to attend smaller boutique festivals that were springing up in its wake.</p> <p>St Jerome\u2019s Laneway festival was a small operation that sprung from the lanes of Melbourne. It could afford to book left-of-centre acts due to low operational costs and a minuscule capacity. The festival became beloved for lineups including acts like Deerhunter alongside buzzy newcomers. As it grew into larger venues and national tours, Laneway didn\u2019t lose its reputation as a taste-making event.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/05/jimmy-barnes-baker-boy-stella-donnelly-20-best-australian-tracks-for-february\">Jimmy Barnes, Regurgitator, Thelma Plum: 20 best Australian tracks for February</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in 2019, the pendulum seems to have swung curiously back to the BDO-style superfestival. Stepping into the new site of Footscray Park for Laneway\u2019s 15th Melbourne iteration, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking you\u2019d been transported back to the halcyon days of the BDO. Gone are narrow concrete lanes and hidden-away stages, replaced with gargantuan side-by-side alternating stages. And like the BDO, this year\u2019s Laneway is 16+, a first for the festival in Melbourne. Watching as punters stream into the massive park, it feels clear that Australia\u2019s prime boutique festival has received a significant upgrade, moving from an idiosyncratic, punter-unfriendly location to something larger, easier to navigate and, perhaps, lacking in identity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd1ad90e6cd6d84b8cbe0decabdd44d9c5d9f473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd1ad90e6cd6d84b8cbe0decabdd44d9c5d9f473/0_0_2048_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"G-Flip\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melbourne drummer and singer-songwriter G Flip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Befitting a festival that once staked its name on singular niche artists before edging towards the centre of culture, two of the more leftfield choices of Laneway 2019 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/23/indie-rock-star-mitski-new-album-rave-reviews-japanese-american-songwriter\">Japanese-American auteur Mitski</a> and New York punks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/20/parquet-courts-wide-awake-review-danger-mouse\">Parquet Courts</a>.

      "bodyText": "With its bloated lineups and flag-wearing clientele, the multi-city Big Day Out (BDO) was long seen as the king of the Australian festival scene. In its final years the festival waned in popularity, its splintered audiences instead opting to attend smaller boutique festivals that were springing up in its wake. St Jerome\u2019s Laneway festival was a small operation that sprung from the lanes of Melbourne. It could afford to book left-of-centre acts due to low operational costs and a minuscule capacity. The festival became beloved for lineups including acts like Deerhunter alongside buzzy newcomers. As it grew into larger venues and national tours, Laneway didn\u2019t lose its reputation as a taste-making event. But in 2019, the pendulum seems to have swung curiously back to the BDO-style superfestival. Stepping into the new site of Footscray Park for Laneway\u2019s 15th Melbourne iteration, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking you\u2019d been transported back to the halcyon days of the BDO. Gone are narrow concrete lanes and hidden-away stages, replaced with gargantuan side-by-side alternating stages. And like the BDO, this year\u2019s Laneway is 16+, a first for the festival in Melbourne. Watching as punters stream into the massive park, it feels clear that Australia\u2019s prime boutique festival has received a significant upgrade, moving from an idiosyncratic, punter-unfriendly location to something larger, easier to navigate and, perhaps, lacking in identity. Befitting a festival that once staked its name on singular niche artists before edging towards the centre of culture, two of the more leftfield choices of Laneway 2019 are Japanese-American auteur Mitski and New York punks Parquet Courts. Both of them feel deeply attuned with the spirit of \u201cold Laneway\u201d, whatever that means \u2013 and both happen to be touring records that tie their once-inscrutable artistic vision with something more populist. Despite the fact she\u2019s basically five-for-five in terms of records, Mitski\u2019s set feels stunted. Her widely loved latest record Be The Cowboy finds the artist donning different guises to play various characters, but that theme\u2019s manifestation onstage \u2013 Mitski performing exaggerated, chaotic dance moves with a hardened deadpan \u2013 is strangely distracting. These songs are complex and contain multitudes; adornment feels like overkill. This becomes particularly clear during the performance of Puberty 2 highlight Dan the Dancer, when Mitski leans back on a chair onstage and slowly kicks her legs in the air like a catatonic cabaret act. It might have worked on a smaller stage; for thousands, though, it feels closed-off. Parquet Courts, touring 2018\u2019s Wide Awake, seem intent on bringing the newfound communal spirit of their once outsider-averse art rock to the Laneway masses. Wide Awake! mightn\u2019t necessarily be their best or most conceptually exciting record (it reminds me a troubling amount of execrable Australian band Jet), but it feels completely suited to the crowds of excitable, festival shirt-wearing Laneway punters. Parquet Courts, to be sure, are definitionally a serious band \u2013 Wide Awake, among other things, meditates a lot on mass and state-sanctioned violence in the US \u2013 but there\u2019s no trouble translating that to a festival set. A song like Wide Awake is innately smart and silly, so there\u2019s rarely any sense of compromise. The festival\u2019s homegrown fare, too, is generally solid. Melbourne drummer and singer-songwriter G Flip, a Spotify success story signed to Sydney label Future Classic, delivers a gloriously demented set that begins with her drumming along to Fatboy Slim before ceding the drums to a session musician and dancing along to her own tracks in front of the crowd. Songs like Killing My Time are certainly a lot, but she sells them with an endearing grin. Arnhem Land rapper Baker Boy, quickly becoming a staple on the festival circuit, continues to delight. His set \u2013 which comprises his 2000s-throwback hit Marryuna, professional dancers, rap-rock and multiple guest vocalists \u2013 is entirely captivating, despite the fact he has only released four-odd songs. If there\u2019s any evidence Laneway\u2019s community ethos still remains, it\u2019s in the sets of three acts entirely disparate in style but tied in spirit. Garage pop three-piece Skegss, playing early in the day to a huge crowd, seem intent on creating harmony in their raucous audience with sweet, simple songs about love and friendship.

      "bodyText": "An Emirati woman who fled her family and is now trapped in a detention centre in North Macedonia is begging to be allowed to claim asylum elsewhere instead of being deported back home, the Guardian has learned. Hind Mohammed al-Bolooki, 43, says she was locked in a room at her home in Dubai in October last year by family members after she asked for a divorce, but she managed to escape and leave the country. Her asylum application in North Macedonia was rejected on Tuesday after what Bolooki\u2019s friends claim was pressure on the local authorities from the UAE to send her back to her family. Bolooki was given a grace period of 15 days to leave the country, but she has been held at a detention centre for immigrants since 7 December with no prospect of release, and it is feared she will be deported back to the UAE when the clock runs out. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to get out of here,\u201d she said in a voice message. In a video filmed in December while hiding just before she was arrested in the North Macedonian capital, Skopje, Bolooki said her family would not grant her request for a divorce and demanded her passport because they could not trust her. \u201cI am a mother of four children. No mother would leave her kids like this,\u201d she said, voice breaking. \u201cBut I had to leave my kids. I had no other choice.\u201d Attempts to reach Bolooki\u2019s family for comment went unanswered or were unsuccessful. Bolooki made her escape after being allowed to go to the toilet. She climbed through a window without her shoes and hid on a nearby construction site for two hours before asking a taxi driver to take her to a friend\u2019s house in Sharjah, a city half an hour away. She had already left her passport in the safekeeping of a sympathetic acquaintance. \u201cThat\u2019s when she called me and asked me to book her a ticket to North Macedonia,\u201d said Nenad Dimitrov, a close friend. The pair had met while he worked as a personal trainer on a luxury cruise liner in Florida. They stayed friends, visiting each other in Dubai and Skopje. \u201cShe said she couldn\u2019t use her own credit card. And I knew something was different this time,\u201d he said. Bolooki travelled overland to Bahrain and then flew through Turkey and Serbia to Dimitrov\u2019s family home. The euphoria of a successful escape was quickly extinguished by the realities of negotiating North Macedonia\u2019s legal system to apply for asylum and a lack of contact with her children. At home, a family friend said Bolooki\u2019s youngest children, aged 13 and 14, did not know their mother\u2019s whereabouts and had been told she was on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Her 20-year-old daughter, Fatma, has been desperate for news of her mother, but contact with her stopped suddenly a few weeks ago. Bolooki\u2019s friends fear her phone has been taken away. At every stage of the process, North Macedonia officials pressured her to drop her case and return home to her family, Bolooki\u2019s immigration lawyer and Dimitrov allege. Bolooki was arrested and taken to the Gazi Baba immigration detention centre on 7 December on the grounds that she posed a threat to national security while her asylum application was pending. She has not been allowed visitors or access to her lawyer. The final rejection of her asylum application on Tuesday \u2013 on the grounds she did not face danger if she returned home to the UAE \u2013 included a 15-day grace period to leave the country. The refugee is keen to seek asylum somewhere else but cannot do so from detention. The Helsinki Committee, a human rights NGO, has tried to intervene, accusing the North Macedonian government of violating Bolooki\u2019s rights by detaining her and rejecting her asylum at the request of the UAE. \u201cIt appears Bolooki\u2019s case had been rushed through the asylum system at an unprecedented speed so the authorities can close her case and send her home,\u201d the committee\u2019s director, Uranija Pirovska, told local television. \u201cShe has no criminal record and no reason has been given for her detention. It is also exceptional that she has not been allowed visitors. The case is suspicious from top to bottom.\u201d According to watchdog Transparency International, North Macedonia scores 35 out of 100 in its perceived level of public sector corruption. Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cCertainly if an Emirati woman flees to a country that doesn\u2019t have a strong rule of law, it\u2019s possible that the UAE can exert monetary and diplomatic pressure to send her back home. \u201cSheikha Latifa is an instructive case. There was clearly pressure put on the Indian government to board that boat and take her back. There is a lot of interest in fleeing Saudi women at the moment but the situation for Emirati and other women in the Gulf is often just as bad.\u201d Sheikha Latifa, the 33-year-old daughter of Dubai\u2019s powerful ruler, made headlines last year after she reportedly escaped ill-treatment by her family, only to be seized by armed men from a yacht off the coast of India and returned to the UAE. The UAE denied Sheikha Latifa fled ill-treatment and says she is safe and well at home with her family. Unlike in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, in the UAE control of women\u2019s freedom of movement by male guardians is not written into law, but in practice travel is often highly restricted by husbands and fathers. Women cannot marry without a male relative\u2019s permission and Emirati law prioritises men in personal status matters such as marriage, divorce and custody of children. \u201cHind has been through such awful things,\u201d said Dimitrov. \u201cI\u2019m worried I will get in trouble for helping her. But I\u2019m more worried she will be locked away or killed if she goes back.\u201d HE Ahmed Almulla, the deputy head of mission at the UAE embassy in Rome, said: \u201cThe UAE Embassy in Rome, which is responsible for diplomatic and consular relations with the Republic of Macedonia, is aware of Mrs Albolooki\u2019s social media posts. The embassy will collect any evidence of illegal threats made against her and pass it to police so that it can be fully investigated. Our embassy staff are ready to help Mrs Albolooki in any way they can. \u201cDomestic abuse is a serious crime, and has no place whatsoever in the UAE; Emirati women are protected and fully empowered under UAE laws. Crimes involving harm against women are severely prosecuted under UAE law, and these allegations should and will be fully investigated.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond must find an extra \u00a35bn in this year\u2019s Whitehall spending review to reverse planned cuts and meet his claim of ending austerity, a leading thinktank has revealed. The Institute for Fiscal Studies told the chancellor that funds pledged in last year\u2019s budget to boost NHS spending, defence and international aid failed to safeguard local councils and some of the worst-hit government departments from further shortfalls. The thinktank said a minimum of \u00a32.2bn would be needed to freeze all budgets and protect them from inflation, but ministers would need to find an extra \u00a35bn to allow departments to maintain services in line with the UK\u2019s rising population. Hammond claimed that \u201causterity is coming to an end\u201d in last year\u2019s autumn budget after better-than-expected tax revenues and a relaxation of his deficit rules allowed him to promise a \u00a330bn boost in public spending by 2024. Figures from the IFS showing that to match his promise, Hammond needed to find more funds will come as a blow to the Treasury as it prepares the chancellor\u2019s spring statement due on 13 March. A sharp slowdown in economic growth in recent months is expected force the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, to downgrade government tax income and increase expenditure over the next five years. Brexit uncertainty over the coming weeks is likely to make the situation worse, while the population continues to expand at around 1m people every four years, heaping further pressure on Hammond to find extra funds to meet his promise of ending the austerity programme which began almost a decade ago. Ben Zaranko, a research economist at the IFS, said provisional plans set out in the autumn 2018 budget revealed cuts in day-to-day spending on public services outside health, defence and overseas aid of about 0.4% a year in real terms and 0.9% per capita. The budget squeeze will be added to cuts of up to 40% in the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and local government since 2010. Zaranko said the next round of cuts would be at a much slower pace than seen over the last decade \u201cbut would by no means represent an \u2018end to austerity\u2019 \u201d. Richard Watts, the leader of Islington council and chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s resources board, said: \u201cIf the government fails to adequately fund local government in the spending review then there is a real risk to the future financial viability of some services and councils. \u201cCouncils were at the front of the queue when austerity started so local services should be at the front of the queue if it is coming to an end.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said government claims that austerity was over were unravelling. \u201cThe evidence is mounting that, despite Theresa May\u2019s rhetoric, austerity is not over. Unless Philip Hammond, at the very least, finds another \u00a35bn at the spring statement, departments will be planning for yet more cuts next year. \u201cNine years of brutal Tory austerity have wounded our public services and the whole country which relies on them.

      "bodyText": "A no-deal Brexit would damage police powers to detain foreign suspects and leave British fugitives in Europe beyond the law, a police chief has said. Deputy assistant commissioner Richard Martin is leading national police preparations to cope with the loss of key crime-fighting measures if Britain leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal. \u201cCriminals are entrepreneurs of crime \u2026 if there is a gap to exploit I\u2019m sure some of them probably would,\u201d he said. In the event of no deal, British police would lose access to a range of Europe-wide tools such as the SIS-2 database of convictions and wanted suspects, and the European arrest warrant, which speeds up extradition and allows arrests if officers suspect someone is wanted overseas. Martin said such a loss of powers would mean that police were unable to detain foreign suspects even if they were spotted in Britain, and even if Interpol had issued an international notice for their arrest. \u201cWe could not arrest that person in front of us, while with an EAW we can do it instantaneously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe officer has to go to a magistrates court to get a warrant under the 1957 convention of extradition,\u201d he added. Checks under the system could take up to 66 days. Asked if he was worried foreign criminals would abscond while UK police waited for information to come back, Martin said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get information back in a timely fashion \u2026 that is a very real possibility.\u201d Under the terms of the agreement struck by Theresa May last year, both sides committed to establishing a broad and deep partnership across law enforcement, criminal justice and security. But in a no-deal scenario, UK agencies also face being locked out of systems for exchanging data such as criminal records, alerts on wanted individuals, DNA, fingerprints and airline passenger information. They would have to revert to alternative conventions, international policing tools and bilateral channels to enable extraditions, trace missing people and share intelligence. Martin said: \u201cThere is a tool behind any that we might lose but it\u2019s not a one-for-one capability. Every fallback we have is more bureaucratic, it is slower \u2026 We go back to a slower, clunkier place.\u201d Some of the pan-European tools that British officers could lose access to have been in use for more than a decade. They used the SIS-2 database 539 million times last year. \u201cIf we exit the EU without a deal that gets switched off overnight\u201d, Martin said. Around 17% of people taken into police custody areas in the UK are foreign nationals, rising to 27% in London, he said. He also said it would be harder to detain and extradite suspects wanted in the UK such as Jamie Acourt, who was arrested in Spain on a drugs offence in Spain and returned quickly to Britain. He is also a suspect in the Stephen Lawrence murder. Martin denied Britain could become a haven for criminals, but said the extra time and effort needed would damage already stretched frontline policing. \u201cIf something takes two or three times as long as when you were doing it before, that\u2019s probably another couple of hours maybe you are not back on the streets \u2026 It will have an impact on the frontline.\u201d It would also impact the rest of the criminal justice system, with thousands of extra visits by police to magistrates for the warrants they would need. Some forces need assistance to be fully ready for a no-deal Brexit, and are being helped by a new international crime coordination centre with 50 staff, with more being trained in the regions. All this could leave Britain less safe in many ways, Martin said. Border staff, for example, would find it a lot harder to screen for past offences, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got access to some of those really critical systems like SIS-2, you probably won\u2019t know what their convictions are,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Myanmar soldiers are shelling villages, detaining civilians and blocking aid as part of a new crackdown in Rakhine state by some of the army units implicated in atrocities against the Rohingya, a rights group says. Villagers and local activists in the northern Myanmar state have told Amnesty International that artillery or mortar shells are being fired in the vicinity of townships and people are returning to abandoned communities to find properties looted and damaged. Military activity in the restive state has intensified since early January when an armed ethnic Rakhine group called the Arakan Army attacked four police posts, reportedly killing 13 officers. More than 5,200 people have been displaced by the subsequent fighting, the UN says, and dozens of families have reportedly fled into neighbouring Bangladesh. Nearly a million Muslim Rohingya people are sheltering in sprawling refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, but most of those displaced in the latest fighting belong to Buddhist ethnic minorities who, unlike the Rohingya, are recognised as Burmese citizens. The Arakan Army is made up predominantly of members of the Rakhine ethnic minority who are fighting for independence for the coastal state that was an autonomous kingdom until the 18th century. Myanmar\u2019s borderlands are wracked by several insurgencies who fight in the name of the country\u2019s patchwork of ethnic or religious minorities. A woman belonging to the ethnic Mro minority told Amnesty that security forces had restricted the amount of rice that could be brought into the her village in Kyauktaw township, exacerbating an existing shortage of supplies. State authorities have barred any UN or international humanitarian agencies except for the Red Cross and the World Food Programme from operating in conflict-affected areas. Some community leaders also appear to have been arbitrarily detained, Amnesty said. \u201cThese latest operations are yet another reminder that the Myanmar military operates without any regard for human rights,\u201d said Tirana Hassan, the organisation\u2019s director of crisis response. \u201cShelling inhabited villages and withholding food supplies is unjustifiable under any circumstances.\u201d Amnesty said it had received reports that army divisions accused of carrying out crimes against the Rohingya, including the 99th Light Infantry Division (LID), had been deployed to Rakhine state since the 4 January attacks. In September, members of a UN fact-finding mission called for the investigation and prosecution of senior Myanmar army officials for crimes that could amount to genocide against ethnic minorities in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan states. Their report said the 99th LID \u201cwere responsible for some of the most serious violations\u201d. \u201cDespite international condemnation over the Myanmar military\u2019s atrocities, all evidence suggests that they are brazenly committing yet more serious abuses,\u201d Hassan said. The international criminal court has ruled it can prosecute Myanmar for alleged crimes against humanity. Prosecutors are currently assessing whether enough evidence exists to apply for a full-blown investigation, the second step in deciding whether to lay charges.",
