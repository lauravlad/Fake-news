      "body": "<p>In politics, it\u2019s possible to have logic, and even principle, on your side \u2013 and still get it badly wrong. John McDonnell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/06/john-mcdonnell-open-to-second-scottish-independence-vote\" title=\"\">change of Labour policy</a>, declaring on Tuesday night that the party \u201cwould not block\u201d a second referendum on independence for Scotland, is a case in point.</p> <p>McDonnell made the argument that any new vote should be for the people of Scotland and their parliament to determine. \u201cWe would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That\u2019s democracy.\u201d The notion of Holyrood voting for a referendum, only for a future Labour government in Westminster to stand in its way, is indeed hard, if not impossible, for any democrat to defend. Sure, some will argue that Scotland had its once-in-a-generation chance to decide in 2014. But that\u2019s tricky to sustain when Labour is (sort of) committed to holding a second referendum on Brexit, even though that decision was supposedly settled just three years ago. Surely democratic consistency demands precisely the stance McDonnell has now taken.</p> <p>And yet the way the shadow chancellor made this move could hardly have been worse. First, he said this: \u201cThe Scottish parliament will come to a considered view \u2026 and they will submit that to the government and the English parliament itself.\u201d Doubtless, he will insist it was a mere slip of the tongue, but to refer to Westminster as \u201cthe English parliament\u201d, when it is of course the sovereign body of the entire UK, is far more serious than that. At a stroke, McDonnell was confirming the nationalist view that sees Scotland as ruled by England, rather than as a member of a union of nations. It also suggests McDonnell has forgotten the 59 MPs who represent Scottish constituencies in Westminster \u2013 seven of them for his own party.</p> <p>That itself points to a larger problem with the manner of McDonnell\u2019s statement.

John McDonnell\u2019s change of Labour policy, declaring on Tuesday night that the party \u201cwould not block\u201d a second referendum on independence for Scotland, is a case in point. McDonnell made the argument that any new vote should be for the people of Scotland and their parliament to determine. \u201cWe would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That\u2019s democracy.\u201d The notion of Holyrood voting for a referendum, only for a future Labour government in Westminster to stand in its way, is indeed hard, if not impossible, for any democrat to defend. Sure, some will argue that Scotland had its once-in-a-generation chance to decide in 2014. But that\u2019s tricky to sustain when Labour is (sort of) committed to holding a second referendum on Brexit, even though that decision was supposedly settled just three years ago. Surely democratic consistency demands precisely the stance McDonnell has now taken. And yet the way the shadow chancellor made this move could hardly have been worse. First, he said this: \u201cThe Scottish parliament will come to a considered view \u2026 and they will submit that to the government and the English parliament itself.\u201d Doubtless, he will insist it was a mere slip of the tongue, but to refer to Westminster as \u201cthe English parliament\u201d, when it is of course the sovereign body of the entire UK, is far more serious than that. At a stroke, McDonnell was confirming the nationalist view that sees Scotland as ruled by England, rather than as a member of a union of nations. It also suggests McDonnell has forgotten the 59 MPs who represent Scottish constituencies in Westminster \u2013 seven of them for his own party.
