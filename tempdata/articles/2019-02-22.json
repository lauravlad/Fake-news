      "body": "<p>On his summer holidays from his job as co-host of the ABC\u2019s breakfast radio show in Melbourne, Sami Shah got to work. He\u2019s making a Radio National series on freedom of speech in Australia, called Shut Up, for which he has interviewed everyone from conservative journalist Andrew Bolt to lawyer Nyadol Nyuon. He\u2019s finishing off a Melbourne Comedy festival show. He writes micro stories on Medium. He\u2019s chipping away at a novel.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done one thing at one time,\u201d he says over coffee in his inner-city home. \u201cI get bored quickly otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cOne reason is that I\u2019m a workaholic; I enjoy doing these things. The other thing is there is a pressure that might be self-inflicted that I feel as an immigrant, a person of colour \u2026 [I] try to work hard to say, \u2018I have things I can do, things I can provide, things I can create, and I hope you like them\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Shah, 40, speaks rapid-fire, words and ideas tumbling out, strong in his opinions but always keen for debate. He had lessons to slow the pace down a little, just one of his challenges when he started at the breakfast shift at the beginning of last year.</p> <p>Not only were he and co-host Jacinta Parsons replacing the dumped veteran Red Symons, but Shah also had a Pakistani accent. He lived in Karachi before migrating with his then wife and young daughter in 2012.</p> <p>Who on earth cared about his accent? Some listeners did, with feedback that he was hard to understand, but there were also heartening responses from everyone \u2013 Iranian Australians to the Irish \u2013 grateful to hear a different accent in a city <a href=\"http://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/2GMEL?opendocument\">where close to 40% of the residents were born overseas.</a></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible for me to learn how much it matters to people,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019d think \u2018what\u2019s it matter?\u2019 But apparently it does a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Morning host Jon Faine is more blunt: \u201cSome of the abuse that\u2019s been directed at him is little short of extraordinary. Some of it is just plain racist.\u201d</p> <p>Shah may be precociously talented, but he carries the burden of representing \u201cdiversity\u201d in a media long dominated by Anglo faces.

It\u2019s been the thread through his life. As a stand-up comedian in Pakistan, he was threatened for making jokes about Islam. He worked as a TV journalist and was threatened for criticising government policy and politicians. He assumed Australia would be a free-speech paradise and, compared with Pakistan, where blasphemy is punishable by death, it is.</p> <p>Yet he bumped up against its edges here, too. His 2016 <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/earshot/sami-shahs-quest-to-understand-islam-in-australia/7648654\">radio series on Islam in Australia</a>, followed by a book, the Islamic Republic of Australia, were his attempts to provide \u201cnuance\u201d to a noisy debate that too often fell into non-Muslims\u2019 stereotypes about Islam and Muslims\u2019 defensiveness about criticism of their religion. The book highlights the diversity of Muslims in Australia and, while it certainly criticises Islam, he wrote that he \u201cconstantly worried about fuelling anti-Muslim bigotry\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/30/for-australia-to-prosper-free-speech-must-be-extended-to-all-of-us\">For Australia to prosper, free speech must be extended to all of us | Yassmin Abdel-Magied</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the book was published, the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4815088/Ex-Muslim-couple-say-lucky-left-Pakistan.html\">Daily Mail ran a hyped-up story that avoided Shah\u2019s nuance</a>, reporting that the family had \u201cfled\u201d Pakistan \u2013 they arrived in Australia on a skilled immigrant program \u2013 and felt lucky to escape a country that executed apostates.</p> <p>That story enraged Islamist extremists all over the world, and Shah was inundated with death threats, and forced to cancel his comedy acts for six months and disable his social media accounts.

      "bodyText": "On his summer holidays from his job as co-host of the ABC\u2019s breakfast radio show in Melbourne, Sami Shah got to work. He\u2019s making a Radio National series on freedom of speech in Australia, called Shut Up, for which he has interviewed everyone from conservative journalist Andrew Bolt to lawyer Nyadol Nyuon. He\u2019s finishing off a Melbourne Comedy festival show. He writes micro stories on Medium. He\u2019s chipping away at a novel. \u201cI\u2019ve never done one thing at one time,\u201d he says over coffee in his inner-city home. \u201cI get bored quickly otherwise. \u201cOne reason is that I\u2019m a workaholic; I enjoy doing these things. The other thing is there is a pressure that might be self-inflicted that I feel as an immigrant, a person of colour \u2026 [I] try to work hard to say, \u2018I have things I can do, things I can provide, things I can create, and I hope you like them\u2019.\u201d Shah, 40, speaks rapid-fire, words and ideas tumbling out, strong in his opinions but always keen for debate. He had lessons to slow the pace down a little, just one of his challenges when he started at the breakfast shift at the beginning of last year. Not only were he and co-host Jacinta Parsons replacing the dumped veteran Red Symons, but Shah also had a Pakistani accent. He lived in Karachi before migrating with his then wife and young daughter in 2012. Who on earth cared about his accent? Some listeners did, with feedback that he was hard to understand, but there were also heartening responses from everyone \u2013 Iranian Australians to the Irish \u2013 grateful to hear a different accent in a city where close to 40% of the residents were born overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible for me to learn how much it matters to people,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019d think \u2018what\u2019s it matter?\u2019 But apparently it does a lot.\u201d Morning host Jon Faine is more blunt: \u201cSome of the abuse that\u2019s been directed at him is little short of extraordinary. Some of it is just plain racist.\u201d Shah may be precociously talented, but he carries the burden of representing \u201cdiversity\u201d in a media long dominated by Anglo faces. Bolt rolled his arm over, saying Shah\u2019s accent would be \u201cdistancing for many Australian listeners\u201d, and worse, that diversity was well and good, but Shah was \u201cyet another ABC-style leftist\u201d. When ratings dipped \u2013 predictable for a new line-up \u2013 the story focused on Shah. As it happened, he and Parsons got used to each other, the show found its rhythm, and ratings picked up late last year. It is impossible to pigeonhole Shah. He grew up in Pakistan within a moderate Muslim family, studied English at the University of Virginia in the US, and became for a time a radically-minded Muslim after 11 September, when he was drawn to his religion in defence against its persecution and because of his outrage that America\u2019s allies fell so quickly into line to support the invasion of Iraq. He moved back to Karachi in 2002 and gradually became an open atheist, rejecting religion as a human invention. As he describes it, his rage was channelled into acerbic comedy rather than faith. He and his then wife and young daughter moved to Australia in 2012 in part because he could not stand the thought of his child having fewer freedoms than a boy would have had in Pakistan. Breakfast radio is mostly light-hearted \u2013 although he and Parsons have introduced more thoughtful discussions, including a back-and forth about television personality Kerri-Anne Kennerley\u2019s recent remarks about Australia Day. Shah loves the radio show, but he\u2019s restless, and the chance to do a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into the fraught area of free speech intrigued him. What are the limits of free speech in this country? How do we resolve the tension between the right to free speech, even offensive speech, and the harm it can cause? \u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about free speech,\u201d he says.

He worked as a TV journalist and was threatened for criticising government policy and politicians. He assumed Australia would be a free-speech paradise and, compared with Pakistan, where blasphemy is punishable by death, it is. Yet he bumped up against its edges here, too. His 2016 radio series on Islam in Australia, followed by a book, the Islamic Republic of Australia, were his attempts to provide \u201cnuance\u201d to a noisy debate that too often fell into non-Muslims\u2019 stereotypes about Islam and Muslims\u2019 defensiveness about criticism of their religion. The book highlights the diversity of Muslims in Australia and, while it certainly criticises Islam, he wrote that he \u201cconstantly worried about fuelling anti-Muslim bigotry\u201d. After the book was published, the Daily Mail ran a hyped-up story that avoided Shah\u2019s nuance, reporting that the family had \u201cfled\u201d Pakistan \u2013 they arrived in Australia on a skilled immigrant program \u2013 and felt lucky to escape a country that executed apostates. That story enraged Islamist extremists all over the world, and Shah was inundated with death threats, and forced to cancel his comedy acts for six months and disable his social media accounts.

Two sources on the island have now complained that Paladin \u201cdoes nothing\u201d of substance on the island, aside from check IDs and maintain a general presence. So how precisely has Paladin, a thinly capitalised security contractor, spent the hundreds of millions of dollars it received from taxpayers? The past fortnight has shed light on how the firm got the Manus contract in the first place, largely due to the sustained reporting of the Australian Financial Review. The contract was awarded in a questionable, substandard government procurement process. For all intents and purposes, it could have been perceived to be a closed tender, not opened up to other potential bidders. The home affairs department said it faced urgent circumstances.

The firm\u2019s name raised barely a flicker of recognition for many. Headed up by the former Australian soldier Craig Thrupp and his partner Ian Stewart, Paladin wasn\u2019t working in Australia. Its Australian subsidiary, Paladin Aus Pty Ltd, was, until recently, registered to a beach shack on Kangaroo Island. The focus of Paladin\u2019s work in PNG had been on security, rather than the provision of garrison and welfare for which it had been contracted. A federal court case involving its former chief executive, Craig Coleman, reportedly made several damning allegations about its preparedness for the job. But the department was in a bind. So it used special measures within the rules of governing procurement to approach Paladin and offer it the work, using letters of intent, rather than a finalised contract, to provide quicker access to $89m in funding. Guardian Australia has identified at least two other comparable firms \u2013 Tactical Solutions International and Loda Security \u2013 that offer similar services to Paladin and operate in PNG. The firms did not respond to questions about whether they were interested in the work before the contract went to Paladin. The handling of the Paladin contract appears to be part of a broader pattern. Two of Australia\u2019s other major offshore processing contracts were awarded in much the same manner. Canstruct was directly approached for an even bigger deal, worth $591m, to run the Nauru detention centre. Canstruct was the only bidder in an effectively closed tender process. It was a construction firm with limited experience running the garrison or welfare services it was now tasked with providing. \u201cOne day they were building tunnels and the next they were managing welfare services for a group of highly vulnerable and traumatised people,\u201d the Human Rights Legal Centre\u2019s legal advocacy director, Keren Adams, said.

The department\u2019s explanation for directly approaching Canstruct and giving it the contract? Again, it could identify no one else interested in the work. And so it was again with Pacific International Hospital, the local PNG provider asked to run healthcare services on Manus from a small clinic at the East Lorengau camp. PIH, which runs Port Moresby hospital, was selected in a limited tender despite a shocking record treating asylum seekers. A Queensland coroner was scathing of its care of Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei, who died from a treatable leg infection in 2014. PIH staff sat without acting as Kehazaei lay in a critical condition, failing to comprehend that he was dying, even as alarms sounded from the life-saving machines he was attached to. Further, PIH\u2019s chairman, PNG\u2019s former deputy prime minister Sir Moi Avei, was found guilty of misconduct involving his handling of public funds while in office. The concerns did not appear to dissuade the Australian government. It has handed PIH $21.5m over 10 months to provide healthcare on Manus, without a contract having yet been finalised. Limited tenders by their very nature pose risks. There are risks to the integrity of the process, and to the effective use of taxpayers\u2019 money.

Meanwhile, pressure on the government has continued to build. Labor asked the auditor general to scrutinise the contract, a request currently under active consideration. The shadow immigration minister, Shayne Neumann, said the audit was warranted due to \u201cthe level of expenditure associated with these contracts, the government\u2019s poor track record, and the concerning reports and allegations related to the entities involved\u201d.

The Bahraini refugee, whose recent imprisonment in Thailand shone an uncomfortable spotlight on the intersection between human rights, diplomacy and sport, was always going to be the focus of Pascoe Vale\u2019s first home game of the season. And it was always going to be a celebration. Even as their opponents Bentleigh Greens put one, two and then three goals past the Pascoe Vale keeper, the atmosphere remained upbeat at the football ground in Melbourne\u2019s multicultural northern suburbs.

Over two days, she had helped Lawrence create a enormous \u201cSave Hakeem\u201d banner on the living room floor that became a pre-game fixture at local football matches as people campaigned for his release. On Friday night, Lawrence presented a new banner to the club: a portrait of Al-Araibi with a new message, \u201c#SavedHakeem\u201d. In January, Pascoe Vale, a club in Australia\u2019s second-tier National Premier League competition, chose to re-sign the defender and former Bahraini international.

This month, the search engine Lyst ranked Versace No 6 on its hottest brand index for the fourth quarter of 2018 after analysing the online shopping behaviour and social media engagement of 5 million consumers globally. The latter is an area the fashion house has become adept at cultivating, thanks in large part to its courting of influential Instagram stars. During the same period, searches for the brand\u2019s Accappatoio bathrobe, which features a belt and cuffs in the brand\u2019s signature gold baroque pattern, increased by 240% \u2013 Lyst attributes this rise to Instagram feeds showing Kanye West and Drake, among others, wearing one. On Friday, Versace acknowledged the power of the social media platform, saying there were things that were \u201cmade for Instagram\u201d. Of her menswear show in January, Versace said the 90s held \u201ca specific idea of a man, but since then, fashion has evolved dramatically and today one cannot define men in just that same, clear way\u201d. On Friday she showed how her woman has evolved, reflecting that \u201ceverything is about the feeling of how we live today\u201d.",

In the event of Fifa\u2019s appeal committee upholding the ban, Chelsea could file a further appeal with the court of arbitration for sport.</p>\n    <p><b>Will Chelsea definitely be banned from the summer transfer window?&nbsp;</b>No. Any ban would take effect only upon completion of the appeal process, which has taken a long time before \u2013 although Fifa are expecting to consider Chelsea's appeal before the summer window opens. Chelsea may still be free to sign new players this summer, but their bargaining position would be weakened.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>What were the outcomes of similar appeals?&nbsp;</b>In 2014, Barcelona signed Luis Su\u00e1rez, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen while awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a similar ban, which was eventually upheld by Cas, leaving the Catalan club unable to buy players during 2015. The following year Real Madrid got a ban reduced by Cas to one transfer window. In 2017, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s two-window ban was confirmed by Cas. Chelsea have previously appealed successfully against a Fifa ban when, in 2009, Cas ruled that they were not guilty of wrongdoing when bringing Ga\u00ebl Kakuta from Rennes.</p>\n    <p><b>What does this mean for Chelsea\u2019s current squad?&nbsp;</b>If players such as Eden Hazard and Callum Hudson-Odi wish to leave this summer, they may find the exit blocked if the club is not allowed to sign new players. That, however, would allow them to leave for free the following summer when their contracts, like those of Willian and Pedro, expire. Players currently on loan at other clubs, such as Dujon Sterling, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham, could find more opportunities at Stamford Bridge.</p>\n    <p><b>Are any other Premier League likely to face similar punishment?&nbsp;</b>Fifa is investigating four Premier League clubs.

Spurs have still to play both clubs, moreover, which is why he describes his team\u2019s fixture with Burnley as being like a final \u2013 fail to win and the upcoming fixtures against Chelsea and Arsenal will lose some of their appeal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/22/chelsea-steve-holland-maurizio-sarri-sacked-england\">Chelsea may turn to England coach Steve Holland if Maurizio Sarri is sacked</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt could be a massive weekend,\u201d said the Spurs manager. \u201cThe football is like a final for us at Burnley. It\u2019s going to be key in the future of the Premier League. It\u2019s a massive three points. If we\u2019re going to be capable of winning the three points, to see us close to them [Liverpool and Manchester City], things will happen in different games. But whether we get close to them or keep distance, we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>Having the opportunity to put extra pressure on the teams above them is an advantage that Pochettino did not enjoy so much when competing against Leicester in the 2015-16 title race when, partly because of his team\u2019s Europa League commitments, only two of Spurs\u2019 last 12 matches took place on Saturdays. Pochettino grumbled about that at the time so he is pleased the situation is different now.</p> <p>He is also happy that Harry Kane is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/20/harry-kane-returns-to-training-ahead-of-tottenhams-trip-to-burnley\" title=\"\">pencilled in to return</a> from injury.

However, Pochettino will not rush him back and, with his team having collected maximum points during the striker\u2019s absence, says suggestions that his team are dependent on Kane are unfounded.</p> <p>\u201cI have never believed that and I am never going to believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cHarry Kane is one of the most important players for us, one of the best strikers in the world.

      "bodyText": "Mauricio Pochettino has urged Tottenham\u2019s players to take advantage of the timing that could make this a pivotal weekend in the Premier League title race. Spurs travel to Turf Moor on Saturday with the message from their manager that victory would heap pressure on to Manchester City, otherwise engaged at Wembley on Sunday afternoon, straight after Liverpool\u2019s game at Old Trafford. City are competing in the Carabao Cup final and Liverpool face a difficult challenge at Manchester United so Pochettino knows there is a chance that Spurs could be within two points of both by the end of the weekend. Spurs have still to play both clubs, moreover, which is why he describes his team\u2019s fixture with Burnley as being like a final \u2013 fail to win and the upcoming fixtures against Chelsea and Arsenal will lose some of their appeal. \u201cIt could be a massive weekend,\u201d said the Spurs manager. \u201cThe football is like a final for us at Burnley. It\u2019s going to be key in the future of the Premier League. It\u2019s a massive three points. If we\u2019re going to be capable of winning the three points, to see us close to them [Liverpool and Manchester City], things will happen in different games. But whether we get close to them or keep distance, we\u2019ll see.\u201d Having the opportunity to put extra pressure on the teams above them is an advantage that Pochettino did not enjoy so much when competing against Leicester in the 2015-16 title race when, partly because of his team\u2019s Europa League commitments, only two of Spurs\u2019 last 12 matches took place on Saturdays. Pochettino grumbled about that at the time so he is pleased the situation is different now. He is also happy that Harry Kane is pencilled in to return from injury. The England captain scored a hat-trick on his last trip to Turf Moor and is eager to play after an ankle injury forced him to miss Spurs\u2019 past seven matches. However, Pochettino will not rush him back and, with his team having collected maximum points during the striker\u2019s absence, says suggestions that his team are dependent on Kane are unfounded. \u201cI have never believed that and I am never going to believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cHarry Kane is one of the most important players for us, one of the best strikers in the world. But football is about the collective. Sometimes it\u2019s very frustrating for us [to hear talk of dependency on Kane]. It\u2019s so unfair that the perception is different to what we see.\u201d",

The Hammers had six shots to Fulham\u2019s 16, three on target to their opponents\u2019 four, but they popped two in the onion bag and that\u2019s all that counts.</p> <p>West Ham\u2019s form is much less impressive now, with the last couple of months featuring one win in seven league games and FA Cup elimination at League One Wimbledon. Fulham have won two of their last seven in the league, but they were both at home (to Huddersfield and Brighton) and the latter is the only game played in 2019 that they haven\u2019t lost, a list that also includes the visit of League Two Oldham in the Cup.</p> <p>So this represents a chance for both teams to get the ball of form and fortune rolling once again (or for the first time, in Fulham\u2019s case). West Ham will go ninth if they win, and though recent results have been poor from tonight they play four of the bottom five (and Manchester City) in five games. With Manuel Lanzini in the squad for the first time this season after knee injury, there is plenty of cause for optimism. But they\u2019ve got to put Fulham away first.</p> <p>All that and also the occasional update from Cardiff, where Watford visit. Welcome! Let\u2019s hope for fun times.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m gone. It\u2019s been a blast. Bye! Here\u2019s Claudio Ranieri: It\u2019s unbelievable. We started very well with great chances. They were very dangerous on the corners, it\u2019s normal with the tall players. The referee didn\u2019t see the first goal was handball, and after West Ham moved the ball very quickly. I don\u2019t know if we were very scared. Second half was much better, we were in control of the ball but without doing something good. On his side\u2019s defensive issues: Look, we are always speaking about to cover well to be concentrated and with determination. But also we need some luck. It\u2019s unbelievable, what happened this year. But we never give up, never. It\u2019s important to recover soon \u2013 physically, but also psychologically. Here\u2019s a report on tonight\u2019s other Premier League game: Gerard Deulofeu finally fulfilled his true potential with a dazzling hat-trick to inspire Watford to a 5-1 thumping of Cardiff City. The pitch was the playground of the former Barcelona prodigy as he netted a first-half strike followed up by a pair of calm finishes, and he even found time to set up Troy Deeney to put the final nail in the coffin. Sol Bamba grabbed a consolation from close range with 10 minutes to go, but Deeney had the last laugh as he completed a close-range double. Much more here: Here\u2019s Ryan Babel\u2019s take: I feel like every time we start [the game] very exciting, everybody\u2019s hungry, and then I feel like we give away very cheap goals. And that kind of breaks our spirit very quick and very easy. Not only today, also the games since I\u2019ve been here. It might be we don\u2019t deserve to concede them but we concede them for a reason and we need to change that as soon as possible. Here\u2019s Nick Miller\u2019s match report from the London Stadium: Fulham have only themselves to blame for their season as a whole, confused decision making and erratic management in all likelihood sending them straight back to the Championship. But on this one occasion they can feel genuinely aggrieved that their fate was unfairly decided by someone else. The Cottagers were a goal ahead and things were looking promising against West Ham, when Javier Hern\u00e1ndez punched home a goal and changed the course of this game, which ended in a 3-1 defeat for Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side. Much more here: Declan Rice is named man of the match, and Noble hands the award over. \u201cIt\u2019s every week, this,\u201d he says as he does so. Gary Neville, who insists that Rice\u2019s long-term future is at centre-half, asks the player what he thinks: \u201cI think the way I\u2019ve been playing this season, I\u2019m really enjoying midfield,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see my future.\u201d Mark Noble has a chat: To be honest we started terribly. They should have scored three goals in the first 10 minutes. I thought as soon as they scored we took control of the game. We\u2019ve seen the [first] goal, it\u2019s probably handball, but sometimes you get the rub of the green and we got that today. I thought after that we dominated the game. We\u2019ve had great form here in the last couple of months, and tonight was another great win for us. Especially against the bigger teams we\u2019ve been really good here. 90+4 mins: It\u2019s all over! Another blow for Fulham as they continue to search for a straw to clutch, and a final score that slightly flatters West Ham. 90+3 mins: Troy Deeney scores Watford\u2019s fifth in Cardiff. Deulofeu is not involved, probably because he\u2019s been substituted. 90+2 mins: Two minutes of stoppage time were announced, which might be bumped up to three because of the goal. A few seconds into stoppage time West Ham make the game safe! Arnautovic sets up Lanzini again but this time his shot is blocked. It rolls back to Arnautovic, who dinks a cross into the middle of the area, and Antonio heads with more precision than power, in off the post! 89 mins: Arnautovic hits the bar! West Ham have finally woken up and started toying with their desperate opponents. They pass the ball around and through Fulham\u2019s area for an age before Arnautovic hammers a shot towards the near corner from the right side of the box, and Rico fingertips it onto the woodwork! 87 mins: Now Arnautovic tees up Lanzini on the edge of the area, but again the Argentinian can\u2019t get a shot away! The ball is half-cleared and Declan Rice has a pop, but skews his shot well wide from 20 yards or so. 86 mins: West Ham have another corner, and win a couple of headers before Rico catches the ball. They\u2019re 11-0 up on the corner count now. 84 mins: Nearly a chance for Fulham: Cairney passes to Mitrovic in the area, who spins but is in a thicket of defenders when he finally attempts a shot, which hits one of them and squirms to Fabianski. 83 mins: Cardiff have a consolation against Watford, Bamba volleying over the line from a couple of yards with his left foot after a corner leads to a goalmouth scramble. 81 mins: Fulham continue to dominate possession, though none of it is happening in areas that will particularly worry West Ham. 78 mins: Save! West Ham attack, and Snodgrass tees up Lanzini for a fairytale comeback goal but he puzzlingly decides not to shoot when in loads of space on the edge of the area and instead passes back to Snodgrass. This time he chips a cross to Arnautovic at the far post, whose header is punched away by Rico! 76 mins: Manuel Lanzini is back! And Felipe Anderson is off. 75 mins: Watford score a fourth! This time Deulofeu claims a superb assist to present Troy Deeney with a tap-in! 74 mins: Good Watford-related stat, this one: 72 mins: Fulham have looked pretty comfortable in the last 10 minutes or so, and currently appear the more dangerous side. Albeit without being very dangerous. 70 mins: As it stands both Watford and West Ham are going to move up a place in the Premier League table, the Hornets vaulting Wolves into seventh and the Hammers pipping Everton to take ninth. Wolves have played 26 matches, while the others involved in the sixth-to-10th tussle will (come the final whistle) have completed 27. 67 mins: Fulham come close! Cairney slides a fine pass into Mitrovic, who runs into the area and is poised to shoot, but Fredericks bursts through him to prod the ball away. 66 mins: \u201cThat tactic has always seemed rather boorish to me,\u201d writes Gabriel Piller about the Mexican\u2019s habit of standing on Rico\u2019s toes at corners, as Arnautovic is played through but caught offside. \u201cWhat do you think of a rule of an arm\u2019s worth of distance in for one of the keeper until the cross is taken? Do you think that would work?\u201d Surely blocking the goalkeeper is deliberate obstruction and should result in a defensive free kick? 64 mins: Deulofeu has completed his hat-trick in Cardiff, neatly chipping the keeper after being played through again, after Arter gave the ball away to Capoue in the centre circle. It\u2019s now Cardiff 0-3 Watford. 63 mins: West Ham bring on Arnautovic, taking off Cheatcharito. 62 mins: Watford have taken a two-goal lead in Cardiff, Deulofeu scoring again on the break, the Spaniard astonishingly failing to foul up a one-on-one, though his effort was very nearly cleared off the line. 58 mins: \u201cCould a retroactive red card be given to Javier Hernandez for deliberate handball in the box, since neither the referee or his assistant saw the blatant foul?\u201d wonders Bob Zoellner. Presumably like other fouls if the referee did not see it and does not include it in his report, retrospective action is possible if it is considered red-card-worthy. 56 mins: Fabianski makes a save! Mitrovic does brilliantly to control and hang onto a high ball when outnumbered and plays it infield to Babel, whose first-time drive stings the keeper\u2019s palms, but stays in them. 54 mins: Fulham enjoy a couple of minutes of pressure, which ends when Markovic handles just outside the West Ham area. 51 mins: West Ham win their first corner of the second half. Hernandez is positioning himself on Rico\u2019s toes every time they get one, and Rico is shoving him forcefully in the back as the kick is taken, freeing himself to rush out and hopelessly flap at the ball. He could in this way have conceded at least three penalties so far. 49 mins: A surprisingly calm start to the second half. West Ham are hogging possession, but don\u2019t seem inclined to actually get into Fulham\u2019s penalty area. 46 mins: They\u2019re off! West Ham have also made a change, bringing Fredricks on for Zabaleta. The players are coming back out. Fulham are making a double substitution: Anguissa and Markovic come on, and Sessegnon and Seri come off. It\u2019s also half time in Cardiff, where Watford lead 1-0. Cardiff should have had a penalty after Janmaat fouled Josh Murphy in the box three minutes from the break, but didn\u2019t get one. 45+3 mins: That\u2019s the end of an often scrappy but nevertheless memorable first half. Fulham have been utterly abject for at least half an hour, but the way West Ham scored their equaliser means they can still consider themselves unfortunate to be trailing. I\u2019ll be back in 10 minutes. 45+1 mins: There\u2019ll be a couple of minutes of stoppage time. They start with yet another attacking set-piece for West Ham, unconvincingly cleared. 44 mins: I think Fulham might have a cunning strategy to wear out West Ham\u2019s defenders by making them constantly come forward for set pieces. West Ham have had eight corners now, plus a smattering of free-kicks. 42 mins: Nearly a third! Cresswell crosses well from the left flank, and Bryan clears ahead of a West Ham player preparing for a tap-in. Antonio comes close from the latest corner. Another corner, and another goal! There\u2019s no quibbling about this one: a good delivery, a good run, a good leap and a good header at the near post! 39 mins: Cheatcharito has the gumption to hit the ball into Nordveit\u2019s arm and demand a handball decision. 37 mins: Going back to the West Ham goal, the cheatery will handily deflect attention from Sergio Rico\u2019s utterly useless attempt to flap clear. Had he done his job decently, the rest of it would never have happened. 35 mins: The ball falls to Cheatcharito again, just inside the area this time, and he sidefoots a shot across goal and narrowly wide. 33 mins: The referee couldn\u2019t really be expected to see that, given his position, and his assistant was on the wrong side of the pitch to do so. I don\u2019t think you can blame anyone for that except Cheatcharito. 31 mins: That is absolute pure cheatery, no doubt about it. Hernandez fell over in the process of arming the ball over the line and stayed down long enough that he didn\u2019t have to look anyone in the eye as he got to his feet. West Ham win another corner corner, their fifth. Rico comes out to punch clear but makes a massive hash of it, Antonio heads it back in, it flicks off Ogbonna and Hernandez turns it in with a combination of head and left arm at the far post! 26 mins: \u201cThe standard of midweek Champion League games always brings mid-table Premier League games into sharp relief,\u201d notes Paul Fitzgerald, as Antonio spears in another decent cross. This is certainly no classic, though Fulham will be delighted to be referred to as mid-table. 23 mins: Antonio\u2019s low cross is awkwardly pushed away to the edge of the area, where Zabaleta runs onto it. His shot is deflected wide off Serri. 22 mins: Zabaleta goes down under Mitrovic\u2019s perfectly fair challenge, and receives a textbook dismissive get-up gesture in return. 19 mins: Meanwhile in Cardiff, Gerard Deulofeu has given Watford the lead. It\u2019s 0-1 there. 18 mins: Now Bryan, fouled by Antonio a couple of minutes ago, fouls Antonio. The wild momentum with which the game began has been quietened a bit because the referee keeps blowing his whistle. 16 mins: Snodgrass chips a nice ball down the left flank for Felipe Anderson to run onto. Odoi however runs onto it quicker, and when the Brazilian pushes him out of the way wins a free kick. 14 mins: Babel just executed one of the most dismal headers you\u2019re ever likely to see in a game of professional football, accidentally nodding a just-cleared ball back into his own area. The defence clears again. 12 mins: It is, I\u2019m told, precisely 3,000 days since Babel\u2019s last Premier League goal, scored in December 2010. 11 mins: West Ham continue to press. Cresswell\u2019s cross deflects behind, and it\u2019s another corner. Babel heads this one away. 8 mins: From the corner, West Ham win another corner. And from that corner, Diop heads six inches wide of the post, with Antonio sliding in but fractionally too late to turn it in! 7 mins: West Ham have an attack, which ends with Hernandez being played in on the right side of Fulham\u2019s penalty area, and his cross-shot being cleared for a corner. 6 mins: A wild opening to the game, which is being played at great pace and with greater imprecision. 4 mins: Zabaleta also plays a part in this, losing Sessegnon on Fulham\u2019s left flank. Sessegnon immediately plays a low, hard cross into the six-yard box, and Babel turns it in! And he makes amends within seconds! 1 min: Incredible miss! Zabaleta\u2019s hopeless backpass releases Ryan Babel, who advances on the keeper, does a stepover or two and then passes the ball into his face! 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Mitrovic has the first kick, and Fulham promptly bosh the ball out of play on the left touchline. The players are out of the tunnel! The players are in the tunnel! Manuel Pellegrini has a chat, firstly about the impact of the two-week football-free break which ends tonight: There are positive things and negative. We tried to continue in the FA Cup but we couldn\u2019t, so we could not play last week. On the other side I think we recovered seven or eight players who are playing all the games. I think Fulham have a very good team, they brought good players. The other games maybe they couldn\u2019t win but they always create several options before they concede the first goal, so we have to play well if we want to win. On picking Hernandez over Arnautovic: He\u2019s not under pressure. All the strikers want to score, but not because Marko is not playing. Marko has just arrived from some issues he had last month. Maybe they can work both of them together. Tonight we start with Javier but we have options. And on West Ham\u2019s targets for the remainder of the season: First to win this game. After that we must try to win the next game. We don\u2019t really have a target. That will be linked with the way we play every game. Here\u2019s Claudio Ranieri on his team selection: We had to do something to try to win. We know it\u2019s difficult. They have some good players. We have to score and I think with Sessegnon and Cairney we have good potential to score. We know we are in trouble, but we are positive. When I saw my players in training sessions, they are working so hard. The intention is good and we have to continue to try. It\u2019s difficult but my players are strong. they want to fight, to survive. A win is very important for us. We have to continue, we have to think in a positive way, and I hope we can win. Schurrle has a virus, he says. So West Ham bring Zabaleta in for Fredericks, and Fulham make a trio of switches: Havard Nordveit makes his debut in defence against his former club, while Tom Cairney and Ryan Sessegnon are parachuted into midfield. Also: Cardiff: Etheridge, Ecuele Manga, Morrison, Bamba, Bennett, Arter, Paterson, Bacuna, Ralls, Josh Murphy, Niasse. Subs: Zohore, Smithies, Reid, Gunnarsson, Cunningham, Mendez-Laing, Hoilett. Watford: Foster, Janmaat, Mariappa, Cathcart, Masina, Doucoure, Capoue, Hughes, Pereyra, Deulofeu, Deeney. Subs: Gomes, Britos, Cleverley, Sema, Gray, Quina, Navarro. Referee: Roger East. The team news has landed, and this is it: West Ham: Fabianski, Zabaleta, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Noble, Rice, Snodgrass, Antonio, Hernandez, Felipe Anderson. Subs: Arnautovic, Carroll, Lanzini, Adrian, Obiang, Nasri, Fredericks. Fulham: Sergio Rico, Odoi, Nordtveit, Ream, Bryan, Chambers, Seri, Babel, Cairney, Ryan Sessegnon, Mitrovic. Subs: Ayite, Vietto, Le Marchand, Christie, Zambo, Markovic, Ramirez. Referee: Lee Mason A couple of months ago West Ham went to Craven Cottage and won their fourth Premier League match in a row, Felipe Anderson inspiring a 2-0 victory. The Hammers had six shots to Fulham\u2019s 16, three on target to their opponents\u2019 four, but they popped two in the onion bag and that\u2019s all that counts. West Ham\u2019s form is much less impressive now, with the last couple of months featuring one win in seven league games and FA Cup elimination at League One Wimbledon. Fulham have won two of their last seven in the league, but they were both at home (to Huddersfield and Brighton) and the latter is the only game played in 2019 that they haven\u2019t lost, a list that also includes the visit of League Two Oldham in the Cup. So this represents a chance for both teams to get the ball of form and fortune rolling once again (or for the first time, in Fulham\u2019s case). West Ham will go ninth if they win, and though recent results have been poor from tonight they play four of the bottom five (and Manchester City) in five games. With Manuel Lanzini in the squad for the first time this season after knee injury, there is plenty of cause for optimism. But they\u2019ve got to put Fulham away first. All that and also the occasional update from Cardiff, where Watford visit. Welcome! Let\u2019s hope for fun times.",

The controversial equaliser came from a Robert Snodgrass corner, improperly cleared and turned in at the far post. Just before the break West Ham were ahead, again from a Snodgrass corner but this time it was fair, Issa Diop given all the time and space he needed to batter a close-ranger header past Sergio Rico. Fulham were slightly the better team after half-time but as Ranieri said that did not translate into many real chances. The home crowd was roused first by the return of Manuel Lanzini, on as a substitute after missing the season to date with a cruciate ligament injury, and then West Ham\u2019s third goalin the final moments, Michail Antonio bouncing a header in from a Marko Arnautovic cross. It was West Ham\u2019s first win in six weeks, gratefully received even if the performance was not dazzling. \u201cAfter those 10 strange minutes [at the start] we dominated the game,\u201d Manuel Pellegrini said. \u201cIt was a good performance.\u201d For Ranieri and Fulham, who are eight points from safety, time is running out. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a miracle [to survive] but we must fight together,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in my players. They lack experience but they have a very big heart. We have to believe that something will change.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It looks like a small thing to stub your toe against, but let\u2019s start here. A number of significant people said goodbye to politics over this past week \u2013 two former deputy prime ministers, the first Australian woman to be appointed deputy leader of a major Australian political party, Australia\u2019s youngest female cabinet minister. Substantial people. Julie Bishop, Wayne Swan, Jenny Macklin, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer. Bishop\u2019s mode of departure, with a statement on spec just after question time, ensured a captive audience, but the government roll-up for Swan and Macklin was paltry to put it mildly, and O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s guard of honour took time to reach critical mass. In times gone by, people turned up from across the divide to bear witness when colleagues bid their farewells. It was the done thing because tapping that collective spirit is sustaining in a combat sport. But now, animus and partisanship pervade everything, sour everything. There are a lot more important things to be worried about in politics right at the moment than whether or not parliamentarians can bring themselves to extend basic courtesies to one another. But failing to respect colleagues, and the conventions of the institution, does point to a bigger malaise. It suggests that at least some of the current crop of parliamentarians view themselves predominantly as partisans with knuckledusters \u2013 a bunch of freewheeling bros knocking back 15 beers at the uni bar before giving each other wedgies and heading out for a wider rampage \u2013 rather than the custodians of the institution of democratic politics. If the wider imperatives of being a parliamentarian get obscured, a whole class of protagonists can drift into being strangers in their own culture, and mentor others to the same end. Bearings get lost. Bad judgments get made. Lack of judgment was the recurring theme of a strange, brutal, chaotic, dumpster fire of a parliamentary fortnight. Come with me on a brief walk of shame. Tim Wilson, the chair of the economics committee, was lucky to avoid a date with the privileges committee for not always conforming with the conventions usually observed by chairs of House committees (as the Speaker put it diplomatically) with his antics in the franking credits inquiry. But instead of chastising Wilson, or reflecting carefully on Tony Smith\u2019s commentary, his colleagues gave him the verbal equivalents of high fives. Mathias Cormann did not, until he was contacted by the Age, pay for an overseas holiday he booked with a mate who is a party donor and office holder and the recipient of a lucrative government travel contract from the finance department. (Cormann insists he played no role in awarding the contract.) The finance minister said he didn\u2019t notice when the $2,780 that was supposed to be charged to his credit card for the Singapore holiday, wasn\u2019t. Explaining how this could happen, he said there was so much travel on his credit card that it was hard to keep up. This latter point was a bit strange given ministers, according to checks I\u2019ve made this week, don\u2019t routinely book flights on their personal credit cards. The sun set on Cormann\u2019s bad day, then it rose on Joe Hockey\u2019s bad day, when an email turned up in a Senate estimates committee suggesting that same mate Cormann had booked the holiday with could whistle up a meeting, pronto, with the American ambassador and former treasurer, because, \u201cHockey owes me\u201d. (Andrew Burnes, chief executive of Helloworld and mate of Hockey and Cormann, denies he ever used that locution, and Hockey says all proper protocols were followed). Michaelia Cash has put in so many bad days it\u2019s hard to remember when her last good day was. This week police and prosecutors gave evidence suggesting the minister\u2019s decision not to give a proper witness statement was a factor impeding their efforts to lay charges in an imbroglio that began when her office tipped off media outlets about impending raids on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union headquarters. Perhaps, even more bizarrely, the minister who used to be responsible for the federal police, Michael Keenan, also declined to give a proper witness statement to assist them with their inquiries. Wrap your head around that fact for a minute then ask the question that automatically suggests itself to any rational person: should either of them still be ministers? Why, pray tell, are they still there? Persisting with poor judgment, and implicitly, with responsibility, there was also the small curiosity of why Scott Morrison ducked almost every question he was asked about Hockey and Helloworld in question time on Thursday, hand balling them through to Christopher Pyne. Why is prime ministerial responsibility intermittent? It really wasn\u2019t clear why. What is clear is this: the past fortnight has been a rolling demonstration of freewheeling and fecklessness. The worst of this is the behaviour alienates people from their politics even further, and the wider that representation gap becomes, the harder it is for governments to do anything that needs doing. That\u2019s what I really care about \u2013 that corrosive Catch 22. But given where we are in the political cycle, I\u2019m also obliged to consider what this all means for the looming election contest. Two things. The backroom brains trust of the government will tell you every day of chaos or ministerial misjudgment is a day where the Coalition doesn\u2019t inch out of the massive hole it has dug for itself. I also suspect at least some of this recent carnival of chaos is resonant enough to be memorable. Projecting to the world as if you believe there is one rule for you, the political class, and another rule for everyone else, is a lethal gesture in the current political climate. But despite all the lead in the saddle bags, a number of government folks are actually daring to hope at the moment. They hope the sonic boom on border protection, never mind the facts and the fine print, can peel a couple of points off Labor at a time when the contest would naturally tighten, and they hope boats is an issue that can corrode and crack the unity the ALP has exhibited during this two terms in opposition. Scott Morrison will also have something to say on climate change imminently, and even if whatever is unveiled doesn\u2019t make sense, the fact that there\u2019s something to sell will please the Liberal MPs currently getting hammered about the government\u2019s monumental, unbelievable, inexcusable idiocy in this space every time they knock on a door. Labor has also had a wobbly start to the election season. The opposition has set the political agenda for most if not all of this term, but that hegemony in agenda-setting has been tested in the opening months of 2019. Internal disquiet triggered a backdown on mortgage brokers in Labor\u2019s banking royal commission response. Resolving what to do on the medical evacuations bill was difficult. Defending its position against the truthy onslaught from the government on border protection is also difficult. By supporting the medical evacuations bill, Labor has sent a signal to its own supporters that it is defaulting more on the progressive side of the ledger, and that looks to have stirred up elements of the traditional, right-leaning working base who evidently fear Bill Shorten might suddenly tilt progressive on the Adani coal project as well, in their minds, sinking a putative Labor government. Various unions are rumbling about coal jobs in central Queensland, and how Shorten needs to protect them, which is both a thing, and a proxy fight over strategy. In my first weekend column for the year, I referenced a live debate inside Labor about whether a southern states strategy could win the coming election, rather than the usual rationale, which is all electoral roads lead to Queensland. There is all the usual talk about, and genuflections to, Queensland, but both of the major parties believe that what happens in Victoria \u2013 the most progressive state in the country \u2013 will determine the next government of Australia. If Victoria swings decisively for Labor as it did in the state election last year, it is very hard for the government to make up sufficient ground elsewhere to hold onto power. That\u2019s why, pretty shortly I reckon, we\u2019ll be hearing from Morrison on climate change.",

Four weeks out from the New South Wales election, both major parties are having trouble getting their message heard in the shadow of ever-rancorous politics in Canberra and a looming federal vote.

Four of the government\u2019s six marginal seats are held by the Nationals, and there are concerns that three-cornered contests and insurgent minor parties and independents could also make safer seats vulnerable. One policy revealed this week was a new $250 regional seniors\u2019 travel card, to ease the cost of fuel, taxis, trains and coaches. But mail-outs promoting the policy \u2013 which urged people to vote Nationals to get their card and featured a mock-up card emblazoned with the Nationals\u2019 logo and \u201c$250\u201d \u2013 were quickly referred to the NSW Electoral Commission by the independent MP Jeremy Buckingham. \u201cI think it\u2019s cynical and manipulative and potentially a breach of the law, and it shows how desperate the Nationals are,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88c6167d5a17131a91669dde09bd1cd8bb330e5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88c6167d5a17131a91669dde09bd1cd8bb330e5b/0_270_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"The letter sent by the NSW Nationals promoting a new Regional Senior\u2019s Transport Card\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A letter sent by the NSW Nationals promoting a new regional senior\u2019s transport card, which was referred to the NSW Electoral Commission.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokeswoman for the NSW Electoral Commission said the electoral act\u2019s bribery provisions exclude \u201ca declaration of public policy or a promise of public action \u2026 Government or election commitments are likely to fall within this exclusion.\u201d Professor Graeme Orr, an electoral law expert, said while the mock-up of the card was problematic from an ethical perspective, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing unlawful here\u201d.</p> <h2>Greens grapple over golden ticket spot</h2> <p>The lingering uncertainty over the Greens\u2019 upper house ticket, caused by the departure of Buckingham last year, is expected to be addressed at a meeting of the state delegate council this weekend, with the NSW party in the midst of a deep schism. Buckingham had been preselected in the third, probably unwinnable, position on the ticket but was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/08/jeremy-buckingham-calls-nsw-greens-rotten-after-party-asks-him-to-step-aside\">formally asked to step aside in December</a>, following accusations of sexual misconduct from a former Greens staffer, which Buckingham strenuously denied. He has since quit the party and is running as an independent. The council is expected to address the matter of the third vacant spot. One option would be for Dawn Walker, who was preselected in the fourth position, to be moved up into third. Walker last year requested a formal recount, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/12/serious-democratic-flaws-nsw-greens-mp-demands-preselection-recount\">arguing in December that people who had voted for Buckingham had been \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d</a>. Her supporters still hope a recount could allow her to move into the second (and more likely winnable) position, with votes that had gone to Buckingham expected to flow to her instead. However, Greens\u2019 NSW co-convener Sylvia Hale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/12/serious-democratic-flaws-nsw-greens-mp-demands-preselection-recount\">said late last year</a> a recount would \u201cbe a break from precedent and would involve establishing a new process\u201d. Incumbent MLC David Shoebridge was preselected in the first spot and Abigail Boyd in second. Parties must submit their final ballots by 6 March.</p> <h2><strong>Warning sounds</strong></h2> <p>Thousands of people gathered for the Don\u2019t Kill Live Music rally in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park on Thursday night, protesting against the state government\u2019s new festival licensing regime, which is due to come into effect in less than a week. The racing minister, Paul O\u2019Toole, said this week low-risk festivals would be free under the scheme, and others would have to pay $650, equivalent to the current special event licence fee.

      "bodyText": "The week began with a shock poll showing Labor\u2019s lead in the polls shrinking, and continued with bombshell emails and shock resignations \u2026 all in federal politics. Four weeks out from the New South Wales election, both major parties are having trouble getting their message heard in the shadow of ever-rancorous politics in Canberra and a looming federal vote. The last time NSW and the nation went to the polls in the same year was 2007 (though the elections were eight months apart, not two) when state Labor was able to capitalise on the campaign against WorkChoices to retain government. Both the Liberals and Labor have already made big spending promises in the key areas of health and education to try to cut through. The Coalition has pledged $2bn for an additional 4,600 teachers and $2.8bn for 5,000 extra nurses, while Labor has pledged $1bn for Nepean hospital in western Sydney, promised to match its opponents on additional nurses, and announced its plan for a state-owned renewable energy company. Neither party has begun its metro TV advertising campaigns yet \u2013 expect to see that imminently. \u201cOne of the problems this time around,\u201d says Peter Lewis, director of Essential Media, \u201cis it\u2019s a bit hard to know what this election\u2019s about. Stadiums? Congestion?\u201d Operation Normal Journalists have condemned Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s behaviour towards media colleagues at the Newcastle Herald after a video of a press conference went viral. The clip shows portions of a 15 February press conference in Newcastle at the unveiling of the city\u2019s new light rail. The premier made a derisory aside after a question from a reporter at the Herald, the hometown newspaper, which has reported extensively on the project\u2019s rollout. Journalist Michael Parris: \u201cYou\u2019ve committed four years ago to releasing a business case for the extension \u2013 we still haven\u2019t seen it?\u201d Transport minister Andrew Constance: \u201cSorry, which media outlet are you from?\u201d Parris: \u201cNewcastle Herald.\u201d Berejiklian (laughing): \u201cThat\u2019s normal for them ... that\u2019s operation normal.\u201d Later Constance tried to school the newspaper on its attitude: \u201cI think there\u2019s an obligation on the part of the Herald to be positive about this town.\u201d The Australian\u2019s Andrew Clennell responded to the clip on Twitter, saying \u201ctreating journalists with contempt like this is appalling\u201d, while the Courier Mail\u2019s Dennis Atkins said: \u201cThis is why journalism matters. Look, listen and shake your head.\u201d Parris told Guardian Australia he was surprised by the big reaction the clip received, but rejected any suggestion of victimisation. \u201cAt no stage did I feel like I was being bullied,\u201d he said. Nationals\u2019 $250 bid The outcome of the election could be determined largely by voters in the bush, and the Nationals have kicked off with some big spending promises of their own. Four of the government\u2019s six marginal seats are held by the Nationals, and there are concerns that three-cornered contests and insurgent minor parties and independents could also make safer seats vulnerable. One policy revealed this week was a new $250 regional seniors\u2019 travel card, to ease the cost of fuel, taxis, trains and coaches. But mail-outs promoting the policy \u2013 which urged people to vote Nationals to get their card and featured a mock-up card emblazoned with the Nationals\u2019 logo and \u201c$250\u201d \u2013 were quickly referred to the NSW Electoral Commission by the independent MP Jeremy Buckingham. \u201cI think it\u2019s cynical and manipulative and potentially a breach of the law, and it shows how desperate the Nationals are,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for the NSW Electoral Commission said the electoral act\u2019s bribery provisions exclude \u201ca declaration of public policy or a promise of public action \u2026 Government or election commitments are likely to fall within this exclusion.\u201d Professor Graeme Orr, an electoral law expert, said while the mock-up of the card was problematic from an ethical perspective, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing unlawful here\u201d. Greens grapple over golden ticket spot The lingering uncertainty over the Greens\u2019 upper house ticket, caused by the departure of Buckingham last year, is expected to be addressed at a meeting of the state delegate council this weekend, with the NSW party in the midst of a deep schism. Buckingham had been preselected in the third, probably unwinnable, position on the ticket but was formally asked to step aside in December, following accusations of sexual misconduct from a former Greens staffer, which Buckingham strenuously denied. He has since quit the party and is running as an independent. The council is expected to address the matter of the third vacant spot. One option would be for Dawn Walker, who was preselected in the fourth position, to be moved up into third. Walker last year requested a formal recount, arguing in December that people who had voted for Buckingham had been \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d. Her supporters still hope a recount could allow her to move into the second (and more likely winnable) position, with votes that had gone to Buckingham expected to flow to her instead. However, Greens\u2019 NSW co-convener Sylvia Hale said late last year a recount would \u201cbe a break from precedent and would involve establishing a new process\u201d. Incumbent MLC David Shoebridge was preselected in the first spot and Abigail Boyd in second. Parties must submit their final ballots by 6 March. Warning sounds Thousands of people gathered for the Don\u2019t Kill Live Music rally in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park on Thursday night, protesting against the state government\u2019s new festival licensing regime, which is due to come into effect in less than a week. The racing minister, Paul O\u2019Toole, said this week low-risk festivals would be free under the scheme, and others would have to pay $650, equivalent to the current special event licence fee. But the music industry says the fee isn\u2019t the issue \u2013 it still doesn\u2019t know how the scheme will operate, how risk assessments will be carried out and how requirements such as police numbers will be determined. Two festivals pulled the pin recently, citing onerous policing bills and the difficult political climate. The chief executive of Live Performance Australia, Evelyn Richardson, said the implementation of the regime should be delayed so that interested parties could \u201cwork through the issues\u201d. Ocean Alley, Dan Sultan and Cloud Control played for the crowd, who came armed with signs taking aim at the premier.

He was a teenage force with energy to burn, an active, happy boy with a future looking bright. He\u2019d been swimming in the river with his brothers, running up and down the bank, legging the stairs of the waterslide, enjoying the cool water on a summer\u2019s day. He\u2019d announced he was feeling sick, left the water and within an instant had collapsed a few steps along the bush track towards the family camp site where he\u2019d pitched his little tent. A bushwalker and several paramedics had tried to revive him as his brothers and father reeled in shock at what was unfolding before them. Tom\u2019s heart had given out.</p> <p>At least this is how I imagine the scene. I wasn\u2019t there to witness it. The first time I saw Tom was at the funeral home in a little Victorian town, hours away from Canberra, where we live. It was nearly midnight. Still in his board shorts, chest bare from swimming earlier in the day, the pads stuck on his chest where they\u2019d tried to shock him back to life. A bruise had formed on his cheek, stopped dead in that moment when he\u2019d obviously hit the ground.</p> <p>I was so shocked to see he\u2019d gone. He really wasn\u2019t there and it almost wasn\u2019t him.</p> <p>The funeral was a magnificent celebration of a life cut short. We returned to work and school, driven by a need to establish normality and routine in a world whose form and structure had just collapsed. Already it seemed that I was being encouraged to \u201cmove on\u201d, \u201cto focus on the remaining children\u201d even as I queried the post mortem result. Being unconvinced by a diagnosis of aortic valve disease, this wasn\u2019t the so-called bargaining of the bereaved, it was a matter I\u2019d spent some time pursuing, consulting medical colleagues at the university where I worked, reading as much literature as I could absorb, and talking through this diagnosis with several medical specialists. </p> <p>Two years on, we found our way to a cardiology team in Sydney, the leading Australian specialists in cardiac death in the young. What a relief to have our suspicions confirmed, to join up to a research team that could bring Tom\u2019s data into a bigger pool for analysis and to get some advice on routine screening for our other boys. This cardiologist had conducted the only Australian study of sudden death in the young.

      "bodyText": "Sitting in the cardiologist\u2019s rooms, awaiting the results of a genetic test that might explain the sudden death of my eldest child, I could not then have imagined the impact on my world of what was to come. It\u2019s 14 years since Tom died one sunny summer day, but my quest to find a plausible explanation never subsided and I never got used to not knowing why, as I had to get used to living without him. Sometimes it\u2019s as if the phone call that delivered the deathly news came only yesterday. I can still recall the sound of the hospital receptionist\u2019s voice, a thudding, lifeless voice that matched the tone of the news I was about to get. \u201cI have John on the phone\u201d. He told me in a whisper and with an anguish I still hear from time to time. Tom was gone \u2013 his words, not mine. Our precious, lovely, gentle 15 year old giant. Like the two to three other young Australians who die each week from an underlying cardiac condition, many of whom are undiagnosed, Tom had been in full flight. He was a teenage force with energy to burn, an active, happy boy with a future looking bright. He\u2019d been swimming in the river with his brothers, running up and down the bank, legging the stairs of the waterslide, enjoying the cool water on a summer\u2019s day. He\u2019d announced he was feeling sick, left the water and within an instant had collapsed a few steps along the bush track towards the family camp site where he\u2019d pitched his little tent. A bushwalker and several paramedics had tried to revive him as his brothers and father reeled in shock at what was unfolding before them. Tom\u2019s heart had given out. At least this is how I imagine the scene. I wasn\u2019t there to witness it. The first time I saw Tom was at the funeral home in a little Victorian town, hours away from Canberra, where we live. It was nearly midnight. Still in his board shorts, chest bare from swimming earlier in the day, the pads stuck on his chest where they\u2019d tried to shock him back to life. A bruise had formed on his cheek, stopped dead in that moment when he\u2019d obviously hit the ground. I was so shocked to see he\u2019d gone. He really wasn\u2019t there and it almost wasn\u2019t him. The funeral was a magnificent celebration of a life cut short. We returned to work and school, driven by a need to establish normality and routine in a world whose form and structure had just collapsed. Already it seemed that I was being encouraged to \u201cmove on\u201d, \u201cto focus on the remaining children\u201d even as I queried the post mortem result. Being unconvinced by a diagnosis of aortic valve disease, this wasn\u2019t the so-called bargaining of the bereaved, it was a matter I\u2019d spent some time pursuing, consulting medical colleagues at the university where I worked, reading as much literature as I could absorb, and talking through this diagnosis with several medical specialists. Two years on, we found our way to a cardiology team in Sydney, the leading Australian specialists in cardiac death in the young. What a relief to have our suspicions confirmed, to join up to a research team that could bring Tom\u2019s data into a bigger pool for analysis and to get some advice on routine screening for our other boys. This cardiologist had conducted the only Australian study of sudden death in the young. He invited us to join his research project and said he\u2019d screen my boys. But this was 2007, there were only 11 known genes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the tests returned false negatives at least 50% of the time. We agreed that the test was a waste of money as it wouldn\u2019t change any practical outcome, and so began the annual screening regime. It was harrowing but also comforting to have a routine that helped me to feel like I was doing everything I could to prevent this tragedy happening again.

I think they are privately quite happy to see Brexit happen, and it\u2019s born of a rather childlike revolutionary mindset that says if there is chaos it will drive people to the all-seeing, all-knowing leader\u201d.</p> <p>Leslie said he and his 10 allies in the Independent Group were not yet a formal political party but would meet on Monday to thrash out how they will function in parliament, and what role their supporters outside Westminster can play.</p> <p>\u201cI think that if we\u2019re saying that the public are fed up with the broken system, and they want an alternative in the centre-ground, that leaves us in a position where we have to start exploring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve said we\u2019re not a party yet, but I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve got to test out, and hear what the public appetite is.\u201d</p> <p>Leslie added: \u201cWe\u2019re moving on from a phase of heartache about leaving our respective parties, to think, we\u2019ve got to start honing our offer to the British public and think as what that might mean.\u201d</p> <p>He accused Labour of taking its long-time voters for granted: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get back to a culture where parties try and earn the votes of the public. I think a bit of healthy competition is needed, and a bit of competition is good for democracy generally.\u201d</p> <p>Leslie criticised the response of senior figures in the party, including Ian Lavery and Richard Burgon, who have strongly attacked the defectors and called for immediate byelections in their seats. Lavery used a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/21/labour-mps-independent-tories-labour-prevent-government\">Guardian article</a> to slam the new group as \u201ca rightwing establishment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/21/breakaway-mps-tribute-act-failed-politics-past\" title=\"\">tribute act</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have no time for the Conservative party obviously, and I completely oppose them, as I always have. But I think their reaction has been to show a little bit more grace towards the three Conservative MPs who left,\u201d Leslie said.</p> <p>Some senior Labour figures are concerned about the forthright response of Corbyn and his close allies to the Independent Group. Corbyn told Sky News on Friday that he rejected claims by his deputy, Tom Watson, that a culture of bullying has grown within the party.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I disagree with him, because I do not wish to be in a party where there\u2019s any bullying,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be speaking to Tom Watson in the very near future to talk about that.\u201d</p> <p>Leslie played down the prospect of a fresh wave of resignations in the coming days but said there were many MPs who were considering their future in Labour \u2013 and he encouraged them to take the leap.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many, many goodhearted people who really care about their country and are distraught about what\u2019s happened to the party, and are still hoping that somehow it can be saved. But I think, in life, sometimes letting go is the right thing to do, rather than clinging on.</p> <p>Leslie denied the group is being bankrolled by big corporate donors, and said the the Independent Group will publicise details of its finances, in compliance with Electoral Commission rules, despite not yet being a political party.</p> <p>He insisted the group is not allied to any of the other various attempts to form a new centrist political movement, but he said: \u201cI think we want to have a conversation with all of those who have been reaching this conclusion in the past year or so.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Chris Leslie, one of the seven MPs who quit Labour on Monday to join the fledgling Independent Group, says his former party has been \u201chijacked\u201d by a \u201cclique\u201d. The Nottingham East MP, who was briefly shadow chancellor in 2015 under Harriet Harman\u2019s caretaker leadership, told the Guardian he believed Jeremy Corbyn was promulgating \u201chard-left\u201d policies, which did not deserve the label of \u201cLabour\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a very well-organised clique of ideologically determined people inside the Labour party who have captured the leadership, and the national executive, and obviously tried to encourage those who weren\u2019t in the Labour party before 2015 to come in and take over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of classic, old political story of institutions being captured by an activist group, who can then, by hijacking it, masquerade that they are offering something that people thought was \u2018Labour\u2019 \u2013 but it\u2019s not Labour. \u201cIt\u2019s passing on to the public what are effectively hard-left policies under the guise of most people\u2019s familiarity with the Labour brand, which has of course traditionally been on the centre-left.\u201d Leslie said these \u201chard-left\u201d activists took over in the aftermath of the 2015 general election, \u201cwhen a lot of us had pulled over to the hard shoulder and had lifted the bonnet and were looking at the engine and scratching our heads\u201d. At that time, he warned that Ed Miliband\u2019s manifesto, with its energy cap and mansion tax, had been too statist and failed to appeal to \u201cthe Which? magazine strata of society\u201d. On Brexit, which most of the defectors have given as their central motivation for leaving their parties, Leslie claimed Labour MPs and activists had been \u201cplayed\u201d by the leadership, which had repeatedly suggested a second referendum was an \u201coption on the table\u201d without ever embracing it. \u201cI do feel as though we\u2019ve been played. I think they are privately quite happy to see Brexit happen, and it\u2019s born of a rather childlike revolutionary mindset that says if there is chaos it will drive people to the all-seeing, all-knowing leader\u201d. Leslie said he and his 10 allies in the Independent Group were not yet a formal political party but would meet on Monday to thrash out how they will function in parliament, and what role their supporters outside Westminster can play. \u201cI think that if we\u2019re saying that the public are fed up with the broken system, and they want an alternative in the centre-ground, that leaves us in a position where we have to start exploring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve said we\u2019re not a party yet, but I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve got to test out, and hear what the public appetite is.\u201d Leslie added: \u201cWe\u2019re moving on from a phase of heartache about leaving our respective parties, to think, we\u2019ve got to start honing our offer to the British public and think as what that might mean.\u201d He accused Labour of taking its long-time voters for granted: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get back to a culture where parties try and earn the votes of the public. I think a bit of healthy competition is needed, and a bit of competition is good for democracy generally.\u201d Leslie criticised the response of senior figures in the party, including Ian Lavery and Richard Burgon, who have strongly attacked the defectors and called for immediate byelections in their seats. Lavery used a Guardian article to slam the new group as \u201ca rightwing establishment tribute act\u201d. \u201cI have no time for the Conservative party obviously, and I completely oppose them, as I always have. But I think their reaction has been to show a little bit more grace towards the three Conservative MPs who left,\u201d Leslie said. Some senior Labour figures are concerned about the forthright response of Corbyn and his close allies to the Independent Group. Corbyn told Sky News on Friday that he rejected claims by his deputy, Tom Watson, that a culture of bullying has grown within the party. \u201cOf course I disagree with him, because I do not wish to be in a party where there\u2019s any bullying,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be speaking to Tom Watson in the very near future to talk about that.\u201d Leslie played down the prospect of a fresh wave of resignations in the coming days but said there were many MPs who were considering their future in Labour \u2013 and he encouraged them to take the leap. \u201cThere are many, many goodhearted people who really care about their country and are distraught about what\u2019s happened to the party, and are still hoping that somehow it can be saved. But I think, in life, sometimes letting go is the right thing to do, rather than clinging on. Leslie denied the group is being bankrolled by big corporate donors, and said the the Independent Group will publicise details of its finances, in compliance with Electoral Commission rules, despite not yet being a political party. He insisted the group is not allied to any of the other various attempts to form a new centrist political movement, but he said: \u201cI think we want to have a conversation with all of those who have been reaching this conclusion in the past year or so.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial plan to send thousands of inmates to a private prison on the US mainland has been in effect abandoned, the Guardian has learned. The US territory announced last year it intended to move 3,200 inmates, a third of its incarcerated population, to a private prison in Eloy, Arizona, in an attempt to save tens of millions of dollars as part of sweeping austerity measures. But now the government concedes it has yet to sign a contract for the transfers and has dramatically reduced the number of inmates it is aiming to move offshore. The plan met with forceful criticism by civil rights advocates, who argued it would separate families, interfere with inmate rehabilitation and lead to forced transfers. In August 2018, the Guardian was granted extensive access to Puerto Rico\u2019s prison system and identified a series of flaws in the plan, including failures to properly inform inmates of the transfers, significant resistance from the island\u2019s most powerful prison gang, Asociaci\u00f3n \u00d1eta, and a lack of clarity on a series of procedural issues. The Puerto Rican government had been due to sign a contract with the private prison operator CoreCivic that month, but the move was delayed. In October 2018 reports indicated that CoreCivic and the Puerto Rican government had agreed a new deal, this time to transfer inmates to a private prison in Tutwiler, Mississippi. But no inmates have been transferred there, as the government is yet to sign a contract with the private prison provider. The government is now attempting to negotiate a deal to transfer just 200 inmates to Mississippi, the Puerto Rico corrections under secretary, Ulrich Jim\u00e9nez, said on Friday. But Jim\u00e9nez said the plan had yet to be approved by Puerto Rico\u2019s oversight board, Promesa, which controls the island\u2019s economic affairs and manages its multibillion dollar debt repayments. \u201cWe are hoping they [Promesa] will approve it in the next day or so,\u201d Jimen\u00e9z told the Guardian. CoreCivic confirmed that no Puerto Rican inmates had been transferred to any of its facilities. It did not respond to further questions. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Puerto Rico had branded the plan \u201cstate-sponsored human trafficking\u201d and promised to sue the Puerto Rican government if the transfers went through. The government claimed all inmates moved to the US would leave voluntarily. William Ram\u00edrez, executive director of the ACLU of Puerto Rico, said the abandonment of the plan was \u201ca realization that they don\u2019t know how to proceed because it\u2019s more complex than they thought\u201d. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t have the consent of all the people they believed they had,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has emerged, battered but unbowed, from so many confrontations with one or other wing of her fractious party over the past two years that survival against the odds has become her best known political trait. But the dramatic departure of three MPs on Wednesday, to cross the floor and join eight ex-Labour colleagues on the opposition benches, sharpened the extraordinary risks she faces in the days and weeks ahead. Moderate Tory MPs have warned for some time that they are prepared to defy the whips \u2013 or even resign from their party \u2013 in order to ensure the risk of a no-deal Brexit is removed. The existence of the fledgling Independent Group makes those threats more credible, by creating a safe and welcoming place for these refuseniks to go, and amplifying their arguments about the risks of no deal and the rightward lurch of their party. May has repeatedly managed to survive potential crunch moments by winning a few more days or weeks\u2019 grace from her exasperated colleagues. Typically, she has done so by promising a bit more Brexit process: meetings, consultations with \u201csenior parliamentarians\u201d, technical talks. That is unlikely to wash this Wednesday, with scores of her own troops, including many ministers, saying their patience has been exhausted and they are minded to defy Tory whips and vote to delay Brexit if a deal has not been reached and ratified in time for 29 March. It looks highly likely that unless she promises to request an extension of Article 50 herself \u2013 which would enrage the Brexiters \u2013 parliament will force her to do so. She will then face a final frantic rush to secure changes to the Brexit deal that she can put before parliament, and present her party\u2019s rightwingers with the choice laid out by Olly Robbins in an unguarded late-night chat: back me, or your precious Brexit will be delayed, giving those pesky People\u2019s Vote campaigners even longer to get their act together. On that basis, she may finally \u2013 just \u2013 drag her deal over the line. But along the way, she has exasperated just about every Tory MP. Those who know May well say that holding together the party she loves has been her guiding principle as she has navigated Brexit. Over and again, she has flatly refused to seek the cross-party consensus the EU27 had hoped to see emerge. Instead, she has focused on containing the contending forces on her own backbenches, believing the public didn\u2019t vote for the \u201cpoliticians\u2019 Brexit\u201d that would result if she tacked towards a Norway-style deal to bring more Labour votes on board. After the general election of 2017, when her majority was wiped out and George Osborne described her as a \u201cdead woman walking\u201d, she could have succumbed to the logic of the newly hung parliament and announced a change of tack. Instead, she ploughed doggedly on. Her allies argue that she could not have trusted Jeremy Corbyn to consistently deliver the bloc of supportive votes she needed to get a deal through. But she could have given parliament some role in setting the parameters, in the way she is now promising to do for the next stage of the Brexit negotiations. Instead, she scrupulously balanced Brexiters and remainers in her cabinet, spent months on an ultimately doomed attempt to keep Boris Johnson and David Davis on board and infuriated Brussels by endlessly declining to set out what future relationship Britain actually wanted. At one point the cabinet were so divided, they were sent off into breakout groups to work on the two rival approaches to post-Brexit customs checks. Like Corbyn, May can be tantalisingly inscrutable. Just as some Labour supporters fervently hoped Corbyn\u2019s repeated professions of determination to honour the referendum result masked a secret desire to stop Brexit, a few moderate Tories continued to believe May was secretly a soft Brexiter, who would eventually succumb to the parliamentary logic and pivot to a customs union. But also like Corbyn, May is deeply tribal, and perhaps ultimately somewhat inflexible. The result has been a masterclass in ducking confrontation, changing the subject and running down the clock. Colleagues say the prime minister still retains a desire to leave her mark on domestic policy beyond Brexit, by returning to those \u201cburning injustices\u201d she spoke about in Downing Street. But even if the \u201cthree amigos\u201d are not joined by more colleagues, the mistrust sown by May\u2019s handling of Brexit, and her catastrophic campaign in 2017, means she\u2019s unlikely to be given the chance. And the sad irony of her approach is that far from containing the warring factions in her party over Europe, she has overseen what is at best a splintering, but if the next few days and weeks go badly, could ultimately become a much wider split, in her party.",

His muse, a white cat called Choupette, which exists largely on Twitter \u2013 a metaphor for his misanthropy so pure I thank him \u2013 was photographed in a mourning veil, thanking us for our words of condolence. That his best beloved was literally inhuman, and very small, is no surprise. (It is rumoured that, if she exists, she will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2019/feb/20/karl-lagerfeld-cat-choupette-most-pampered-animal-in-fashion-will\" title=\"\">inherit his fortune</a>, though that is illegal in France.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/19/karl-lagerfeld-obituary\">Karl Lagerfeld obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I do not think Lagerfeld really liked women. It is impossible to watch his work and think he did. It is impossible to watch his face \u2013 immobile, from surgery or not, I can\u2019t say \u2013 and think he liked himself. It is obvious, and often noted, that fashion doesn\u2019t have to be misogynistic and exclusionary; fashion is merely expression, and expression is morally neutral. But it certainly became those things in the era when Lagerfeld was dominant. In a world that is pure hierarchy, he had the power of a medieval pope, and he could have used it to make fashion less exclusionary, and more joyful. Consider the changes that Edward Enninful is making at British Vogue. He employs Paris Lees, a trans woman, as a columnist, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/07/enninful-fronts-up-to-diversity-debate-with-first-british-vogue-cover\" title=\"\">his first cover</a> featured Adwoa Aboah, a mixed-race woman. Lagerfeld was rarely so benevolent or brave: profit was his calling, and misogyny his method. At home, meanwhile, he preferred to idolise a cat.</p> <p>The couture shows in Paris, at which he excelled, power the global fashion machine and send it to the duller parts of Earth. He decided what was lovely and what was not, who should be noticed and who should be ignored. None of this would matter if it didn\u2019t have that power \u2013 fashion, when cornered, cites its triviality as a defence \u2013 except it did.

      "bodyText": "Karl Lagerfeld is dead, and the fashion industry he presided over from the house of Chanel rends its garments and calls itself heartbroken. His muse, a white cat called Choupette, which exists largely on Twitter \u2013 a metaphor for his misanthropy so pure I thank him \u2013 was photographed in a mourning veil, thanking us for our words of condolence. That his best beloved was literally inhuman, and very small, is no surprise. (It is rumoured that, if she exists, she will inherit his fortune, though that is illegal in France.) I do not think Lagerfeld really liked women. It is impossible to watch his work and think he did. It is impossible to watch his face \u2013 immobile, from surgery or not, I can\u2019t say \u2013 and think he liked himself. It is obvious, and often noted, that fashion doesn\u2019t have to be misogynistic and exclusionary; fashion is merely expression, and expression is morally neutral. But it certainly became those things in the era when Lagerfeld was dominant. In a world that is pure hierarchy, he had the power of a medieval pope, and he could have used it to make fashion less exclusionary, and more joyful. Consider the changes that Edward Enninful is making at British Vogue. He employs Paris Lees, a trans woman, as a columnist, and his first cover featured Adwoa Aboah, a mixed-race woman. Lagerfeld was rarely so benevolent or brave: profit was his calling, and misogyny his method. At home, meanwhile, he preferred to idolise a cat. The couture shows in Paris, at which he excelled, power the global fashion machine and send it to the duller parts of Earth. He decided what was lovely and what was not, who should be noticed and who should be ignored. None of this would matter if it didn\u2019t have that power \u2013 fashion, when cornered, cites its triviality as a defence \u2013 except it did. The machine sold perfumes and handbags (almost no one can afford couture, and that kind of money is a sickness in itself) by offering an ever-receding image of beauty that no normal woman could ever attain, let alone hold. The girls who wore his clothes, which were as insubstantial as a fleeting dream (he was an artist, and his works expressed his philosophy perfectly), were very young and tiny.

As anyone who witnessed his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/12/world-cup-opening-ceremony-music-dance\" title=\"\">set at the Brazil 2014 World Cup</a> will be aware, Pitbull gives great opening ceremony, a style of performance that doesn\u2019t really involve singing or rapping, but is more a matter of standing on a lighted plinth looking purposeful and occasionally pointing at things.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/22/england-india-womens-cricket-first-odi-match-report\">England Women in dramatic batting collapse as India win opening ODI</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sadly there would be no reprise this time. Pitbull had to cancel after the plane he was due to board fell apart on the runway. But he did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pitbull/status/1095813314678902784\" title=\"\">leave a message on social media</a> thanking everyone for everything.</p> \n<p>And while no one would ever want to place Pitbull in danger, or take any pleasure from the image of a white-suited Pitbull plunging, parachute fluttering, still glazed and baffled behind his tinted specs, into the jagged terrain of the remote Kashmir mountains, the good news is that things went pretty well in his absence.</p> \n<p>The opening ceremony was excellent. Boney M filled the gap as headliners. A marching band in gold-trimmed jackets played a muzak arrangement of Europe\u2019s The Final Countdown. And most important of all, the tournament has already found its first star, and in the best possible way.</p> \n<p>All hail Haris Rauf, sensation of the opening week of PSL3. Rauf had been a rumour until now, a raggedy 150km/h quick, a 23-year-old raised on tape-ball games and glimpsed briefly in the Abu Dhabi Cup doing horrible things to the toes of the South African Test player Heino Kuhn.</p> \n<p>We have been here before of course. It is a well-worn Pakistan cricket trope, the urban foundling wandering out of gully-cricket and straight on to our TV screens. We want this to be true, want Haris to be the real deal, a ready-made speed-demon blooming right up out of the soil, the kind of presence whose emergence chimes with so many things that are vital to Pakistan cricket and to our concept of sport generally.</p> \n<p>This is of course a bit of a myth in itself, and an unhelpful one, casting an air of noble primitivism on Pakistan cricket. In reality Rauf is hardly an urchin. He attended Islamabad University. But he fits the story in other ways. He\u2019s naturally quick (148-150km/h on the gun). He\u2019s also entirely self-taught, playing in the streets of Rawalpindi against the wishes of his strict-sounding family, walking the city whirling his arms, working out the mechanics of his own action.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We\u2019d soon have him working on being lined up and bowling like a fast-medium mass-production humanoid</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Eventually he turned up at the open \u201ctalent hunt\u201d trials, bowled 92mph in the nets and was snapped up immediately by Lahore Qalandars. The moment of ignition came this week with a breakneck four-for against the Karachi Kings in Dubai.</p> \n<p>He looked the part too, ambling in off an easy run and sending down a mix of yorkers and lifters. His arms cross over as he bowls. He doesn\u2019t really bound, but unwinds in a slingshot, pivoting his shoulders and then violently flexing his lower back.

      "bodyText": "Gutted for Pitbull. It has been a hard week for the Miami-based chart ace, sport\u2019s own king of the tournament opening ceremony. Pitbull was booked to perform at the opening of the Pakistan Super League at the Dubai Cricket Stadium last weekend. This was of course a hugely exciting prospect. As anyone who witnessed his set at the Brazil 2014 World Cup will be aware, Pitbull gives great opening ceremony, a style of performance that doesn\u2019t really involve singing or rapping, but is more a matter of standing on a lighted plinth looking purposeful and occasionally pointing at things. Sadly there would be no reprise this time. Pitbull had to cancel after the plane he was due to board fell apart on the runway. But he did leave a message on social media thanking everyone for everything. And while no one would ever want to place Pitbull in danger, or take any pleasure from the image of a white-suited Pitbull plunging, parachute fluttering, still glazed and baffled behind his tinted specs, into the jagged terrain of the remote Kashmir mountains, the good news is that things went pretty well in his absence. The opening ceremony was excellent. Boney M filled the gap as headliners. A marching band in gold-trimmed jackets played a muzak arrangement of Europe\u2019s The Final Countdown. And most important of all, the tournament has already found its first star, and in the best possible way. All hail Haris Rauf, sensation of the opening week of PSL3. Rauf had been a rumour until now, a raggedy 150km/h quick, a 23-year-old raised on tape-ball games and glimpsed briefly in the Abu Dhabi Cup doing horrible things to the toes of the South African Test player Heino Kuhn. We have been here before of course. It is a well-worn Pakistan cricket trope, the urban foundling wandering out of gully-cricket and straight on to our TV screens. We want this to be true, want Haris to be the real deal, a ready-made speed-demon blooming right up out of the soil, the kind of presence whose emergence chimes with so many things that are vital to Pakistan cricket and to our concept of sport generally. This is of course a bit of a myth in itself, and an unhelpful one, casting an air of noble primitivism on Pakistan cricket. In reality Rauf is hardly an urchin. He attended Islamabad University. But he fits the story in other ways. He\u2019s naturally quick (148-150km/h on the gun). He\u2019s also entirely self-taught, playing in the streets of Rawalpindi against the wishes of his strict-sounding family, walking the city whirling his arms, working out the mechanics of his own action. Eventually he turned up at the open \u201ctalent hunt\u201d trials, bowled 92mph in the nets and was snapped up immediately by Lahore Qalandars. The moment of ignition came this week with a breakneck four-for against the Karachi Kings in Dubai. He looked the part too, ambling in off an easy run and sending down a mix of yorkers and lifters. His arms cross over as he bowls. He doesn\u2019t really bound, but unwinds in a slingshot, pivoting his shoulders and then violently flexing his lower back. Let\u2019s face it, he probably wouldn\u2019t get through the Under-13s in this country bowling like that. We\u2019d soon have him working on being lined up, protecting his hinges and bowling like a fast-medium mass-production humanoid. For now Haris has been told he can put on another 5km/h with a little tinkering. And if he\u2019s still in one piece at the end of it he has an outside chance of making it to the World Cup in England, Pakistan\u2019s latest Cinderella man. At which point it is probably time to take a step back. A week in the life of a prodigy: these are excitable times. But then this is a story all sport loves to tell itself, a story about talent and opportunity and the health of nations. It\u2019s there in the mythology of American baseball and in Australian cricket, with its deep attachment to those fond, happy sandy-haired figures out there in all that lush Australian green. It was there in English sport too during its own much mythologised Golden Age of cobble-street urchins and mine shafts crammed with World Cup winning centre-halves. This is a story of social mobility too, of sport as dream factory, there to scoop up and transform whatever blooms out of the soil. It is from this perspective the ballad of Haris Rauf is interesting to an English cricket fan. Mainly because it just couldn\u2019t happen here. There are still exceptions.

The summer game has spent a generation walling itself up in its own shrinking square of green, a sport that is invisible in the inner cities, that exists among the pre-converted or those with the means to break in.

We know about this unremarkable incident because the Mail Online saw fit to publish a salacious article about \u201cunderage Malia\u201d drinking, consisting of 23 creepy photos of her in a swimsuit. They also threw in a video. The UK may no longer rule the world, but its tabloids remain global leaders in shamelessness.</p> <p>News that an Obama was enjoying herself predictably propelled a number of Trump supporters into fits of self-righteous outrage. Andrew Wilkow, the host of a conservative radio show, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilkowMajority/status/1097536633505746944\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cLiving like the 1%? Drinking underage? Let\u2019s see the #democrats and media scream about \u2018privilege\u2019 here.\u201d</p> <p>All right, Mr Wilkow, challenge accepted. I\u2019m going to scream about \u201cprivilege\u201d. More specifically, I\u2019m going to scream about \u201cdrinking privilege\u201d and how young women are judged more harshly than men when it comes to alcohol.</p> <p>Obama getting ros\u00e9-shamed by the Mail is not an isolated incident; the media loves moralising about women and booze. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/28/female-binge-drinkers-unfairly-stigmatised-by-media-says-study\" title=\"\">2016 study</a> by researchers at Glasgow University and Glasgow Caledonian University, for example, found women\u2019s binge drinking is given more media coverage despite the fact that men are more likely to drink to excess. The study, which analysed 308 articles published over two years in seven UK national newspapers, noted that portrayals of women drinking were also unfairly stigmatising. Chris Patterson, from the public health sciences unit at the University of Glasgow, explained: \u201cMedia coverage of women\u2019s binge drinking isn\u2019t just about health or public disorder; it also performs a moralising, paternalistic role, reflecting broader social expectations about women\u2019s public behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>While that study was about binge drinking, there is apparently no safe amount a woman can drink if she wants to avoid being judged. In 2016, for example, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/health/no-alcohol-for-sexually-active-women-without-birth-control-cdc-recommends.html?smid=tw-share\" title=\"\">the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> advised all women of childbearing age who weren\u2019t using birth control to completely avoid alcohol, in case they got pregnant. This condescending guidance was based on a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6504a6.htm\" title=\"\">CDC estimate</a> that \u201capproximately 3.3 million US women aged 15-44 years \u2026 were at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy during 2011-2013\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Malia Obama, a 20-year-old Harvard student who happens to be the daughter of a former US president, recently enjoyed a glass of poolside ros\u00e9 during a weekend with friends in Miami. We know about this unremarkable incident because the Mail Online saw fit to publish a salacious article about \u201cunderage Malia\u201d drinking, consisting of 23 creepy photos of her in a swimsuit. They also threw in a video. The UK may no longer rule the world, but its tabloids remain global leaders in shamelessness. News that an Obama was enjoying herself predictably propelled a number of Trump supporters into fits of self-righteous outrage. Andrew Wilkow, the host of a conservative radio show, tweeted: \u201cLiving like the 1%? Drinking underage? Let\u2019s see the #democrats and media scream about \u2018privilege\u2019 here.\u201d All right, Mr Wilkow, challenge accepted. I\u2019m going to scream about \u201cprivilege\u201d. More specifically, I\u2019m going to scream about \u201cdrinking privilege\u201d and how young women are judged more harshly than men when it comes to alcohol. Obama getting ros\u00e9-shamed by the Mail is not an isolated incident; the media loves moralising about women and booze. A 2016 study by researchers at Glasgow University and Glasgow Caledonian University, for example, found women\u2019s binge drinking is given more media coverage despite the fact that men are more likely to drink to excess. The study, which analysed 308 articles published over two years in seven UK national newspapers, noted that portrayals of women drinking were also unfairly stigmatising. Chris Patterson, from the public health sciences unit at the University of Glasgow, explained: \u201cMedia coverage of women\u2019s binge drinking isn\u2019t just about health or public disorder; it also performs a moralising, paternalistic role, reflecting broader social expectations about women\u2019s public behaviour.\u201d While that study was about binge drinking, there is apparently no safe amount a woman can drink if she wants to avoid being judged. In 2016, for example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised all women of childbearing age who weren\u2019t using birth control to completely avoid alcohol, in case they got pregnant. This condescending guidance was based on a CDC estimate that \u201capproximately 3.3 million US women aged 15-44 years \u2026 were at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy during 2011-2013\u201d. A study published last month in the journal Women\u2019s Health Issues argues this was a massive overestimate, and cautioned that exaggerating the problem \u201ccan contribute to moral panic about alcohol use during pregnancy\u201d. There is also, of course, no safe amount a woman can drink if she wants to avoid getting blamed for being raped. If you are a man, being drunk makes you somehow less culpable in society\u2019s eyes for sexually assaulting someone; it was the booze that did it, not you! If you are a woman, however, drinking means you were irresponsible; you should have been more careful! Indeed, we seem to expend more energy telling women not to get drunk than we do telling men not to rape. One of the most glaring examples of our double standards around drinking is sitting on the US supreme court. In his testimony to the Senate judiciary committee last year, Brett Kavanaugh talked at length about how much drinking he had done at high school. \u201cI liked beer,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cI still like beer.\u201d It\u2019s very hard to imagine a woman telling a room full of senators how much she loved boozing and then getting rewarded with one of the most powerful jobs in the world. Kavanaugh got a pass, however, because boys will be boys, after all. And girls will be publicly shamed.",

      "bodyText": "Westminster has a new parlour game. Since Monday, a conversation with anyone in or around politics will open with a round of \u201cSo what are the chances for this new Independent Group?\u201d Players are encouraged to produce ever smarter reasons why the cluster of 11 MPs who broke from their former parties \u2013 eight from Labour, three from the Tories \u2013 is doomed to fail. Bonus points are awarded for historical references or imaginative use of polling data. By way of a warm-up, there are the obvious early arguments. New or third parties do notoriously badly under our first-past-the-post electoral system: just look at the SDP. There are no heavyweight figures to match the Gang of Four, who broke from Labour in 1981. The Independents have no leader and no clear policy stance. What\u2019s more, within three hours of launching they were playing defence after one of their number, Angela Smith, seemingly referred to black and minority ethnic people as having a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d, a racism so crude it was bewildering. Notice too how they struggle to surmount the contradiction of demanding a people\u2019s vote on Brexit while refusing a people\u2019s vote on themselves by refusing to trigger byelections in their own seats. Next, players of the game move on to strategy. The focus on Brexit is a mistake, they\u2019ll say, because it will leave the group with no raison d\u2019etre once the Brexit deal is done and because it prevents leave-minded MPs from joining. Witness Ian Austin\u2019s move today, breaking from Labour but refusing to sit with the TIGgers because they want a second referendum while he is a backer of Theresa May\u2019s deal. Indeed, the Independents may well have located the wrong gap in the political market. Politics professor Matthew Goodwin makes a cogent case that there\u2019s a big, Blue-Labour-shaped pool of voters who tilt left on the economy but right on questions of migration and Europe. TIG\u2019s pro-European, socially liberal vibe might play well in \u201cOxford, Cambridge and London\u201d, says Goodwin, but won\u2019t travel much beyond. That nods to the analysis you get from those who formed the last Labour breakaway, nearly four decades ago.

      "bodyText": "Derek Hatton, George Galloway, Chris Williamson, Ken Livingstone: these guys may not physically sit together in public life, but I definitely think of them as \u201ca grouping\u201d. In fact, it is perfectly possible that over time they could be joined by \u201clike-minded individuals\u201d from the right. Galloway got on like a house on fire with Nigel Farage during the referendum. Unfortunately, both of them seem to have been pulled from the inferno unscathed. Yup, you can totally picture their independent minds dovetailing with disaffected #MeToo defendants or even defectors from the daytime schedules, such as Noel Edmonds. If things were different, they\u2019d hang out more with their brother-from-another-mother Julian Assange. Like I said, it\u2019s a mood; it\u2019s a feeling. They don\u2019t have to share every view. Most of them will have an objection to paying the licence fee, say, while only some of them will get slightly aroused when they think about Marine A. Quite a lot of them, actually. And not just the obvious ones. Anyway, Monday kicked off with seven Labour MPs quitting the party to form the Independent Group \u2013 followed by another on Tuesday, three Tories on Wednesday, and Ian Austin on Friday (though he\u2019s going it alone). So this week was always going to summon these bros-in-arms. It\u2019s as if Gotham City\u2019s Commissioner Gordon had sent up the Twatsignal. Deciding that the news meant Labour had finally done enough to warrant him rejoining the party, Galloway began doing the broadcast rounds in his black fedora. Not sure how up you are on your Galloway iconography, but the hat symbolises his troubadour spirit, and the fact he\u2019s definitely going to act like a penis on the news. Wherever he lays his hat, that\u2019s the place he\u2019s going to act like a penis. On Wednesday, the hat was on Sky News, where its wearer judged that accusations of antisemitism in Labour are \u201cpure Goebellian propaganda\u201d. Mmmm. I don\u2019t want to call bullshit on someone who wears his learning quite as heavily as Galloway, but falsely accusing people of antisemitism was arguably not one of the primary character notes of Joseph Goebbels. A notorious liar, yes. But picture the scene at the Berlin Sportpalast in 1943, when Goebbels made his most famous speech. Had Goebbels used the occasion to accuse anyone in the vicinity of antisemitism \u2013 falsely, I expect \u2013 I just don\u2019t reckon that many Germans would have gone \u201cyeah, classic Goebbels\u201d or \u201cman, that is such a totally Goebbels thing to do\u201d. Given her effective constructive dismissal from the Labour party, then, some will have dared to dream when Luciana Berger stood up to launch the new grouping. Others will have regarded fellow splitter Angela Smith\u2019s subsequent \u201cfunny tinge\u201d comment as a reminder that it is best not to have dreams during this era of British politics, because they will get clubbed to death mere seconds after you\u2019ve given birth to them. But many, many more will be able to enjoy this moment purely for the hilarious losing-of-the-shit it has inspired in hardcore Jeremy Corbyn tribalists. If this is what passes for playing it cool \u2026 I would recommend an intravenous course of Humphrey Bogart movies. Or some Katharine Hepburn. Just anyone, really, whose reaction to people doing what you\u2019ve been screaming at them to do for three years wouldn\u2019t have been to wet their pants in public while shrieking, \u201cLOL I AM SO RELAXED LOL.\u201d On the Tory side, similarly, who couldn\u2019t love the detail that classy David Cameron sent identical \u201cdon\u2019t go\u201d texts to each of those splitters on the eve of their departure? Like so many readers, I am dying more every day for Cameron\u2019s forthcoming book, believed to be a taut psychological thriller about a true-crime author who gradually begins to suspect himself of the grotesque acts he\u2019s writing about. As for Corbyn, it\u2019s good to see how fast the Labour leader can act when he genuinely minds about something. When it comes to all the Jew-hatred sloshing around, he\u2019s been the friendly neighbourhood allotment holder who won\u2019t be rushed. But when he\u2019s really angry about a thing, like the defection of the watsisnames, he goes full Magneto. Except Magneto was Jewish, so \u2026 not Magneto. In terms of statesmanlike outreach, Corbyn\u2019s pitch was a video in which he came off as peevish and irritated. The Labour leader\u2019s retro glasses make him look like the guy in the corner at Nasa who\u2019s going to say that the rescue mission can\u2019t be done, because he\u2019s got some charts that say it\u2019s impossible. At that point, you want to get behind the guy who sweeps all the charts off the table, and says, \u201cDamn the damn charts dammit \u2013 we are bringing Tom Hanks home.\u201d I would then vote for Tom Hanks. Alas, it must be said the shortage of Tom Hanks types in British politics is now somewhat acute. Instead of leading men or women, all we seem to have is fighty extras. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fight from within until I\u2019m the last one standing,\u201d announced Johnny Mercer. (Just like he did in \u2019Nam.) Or perhaps you prefer Steven Woolfe, most famous for being laid out in Strasbourg, allegedly after a scrap with one of his fellow Ukip MEPs. Woolfe wants to stand against Tory defector Anna Soubry in Broxtowe \u2013 which is exactly where Corbyn himself has decided to head for a rally this Saturday. As Woolfe put it: \u201cThe independence of this country now demands the most muscular force to protect it.\u201d Ooh! Diet Coke break, girls! If Brexit has long had the flavour of a fight in a pub car park, I guess this is what tipping-out time looks like. And yet, are all these self-styled hardmen the answer? As we head into Britain\u2019s latest crunch week, it feels old hat, if you will, to put out yet another APB for something better. But here we are again, and here goes \u2026 Hanks-types: wanted. Leading men and women: wanted. Heroes: WANTED. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

The babies\u2019 deaths, and the infection of a third premature baby, came to light in January but the rare strain was only named this week.</p> <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said no further cases had been detected since but opposition parties said the disclosure raised fresh questions about infection control in the board\u2019s hospitals.</p> <p>The HPS report was written after a spate of unusual infections at other GGC hospitals that have come to light over the last three months.</p> <p>In late January prosecutors disclosed they were investigating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/29/scotland-prosecutors-investigate-two-deaths-pigeon-droppings-infection-glasgow\">deaths of two patients</a>, a 10-year-old boy and a 73-year-old woman, who contracted an infection linked to pigeon droppings at Queen Elizabeth hospital.</p> <p>Two patients at that hospital also became seriously ill after contracting a separate fungal infection called mucor, while a patient at Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley died from a separate hospital-acquired infection in December.</p> <p>In light of the water contamination disclosures, HPS said it was essential every Scottish health board test the water at any hospitals built since 2013. The Scottish government launched a substantial hospital building strategy partly using public funds, in the case of the Queen Elizabeth, but also private financing.</p> <p>Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, said the HPS report would feed into a wider inquiry into the Queen Elizabeth hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/22/glasgow-hospital-design-to-be-reviewed-after-pigeon-infections\">ordered after the deaths came to light</a>. \u201cAs I have previously stated to parliament, it is vital that we all understand what the issues are, why they have arisen, and that the recommendations will be taken forward,\u201d Freeman said.</p> <p>Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour\u2019s health spokeswoman, criticised Freeman for releasing the report on a Friday, when Holyrood was not sitting. \u201cGiven the circumstances, the health board and the government should be inviting as much scrutiny and acting in as transparent a manner as possible,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cJeane Freeman and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both insisted last month that there was no infection control problem at the hospital \u2013 but 23 cases of blood stream infections in less than nine months tells a different story.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Health boards across Scotland have been ordered to carry out urgent tests on hospital water supplies after widespread contamination at two Glasgow hospitals. The investigation by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC), which is already dealing with a spate of other infection-related deaths and crises, revealed 23 cases of blood stream infection were detected at two recently built hospitals last year. The infections at the flagship Queen Elizabeth hospital and adjoining Royal hospital for children, in the first nine months of last year, were all \u201cpotentially linked to water contamination\u201d by 11 different organisms, it was found. The instruction from Health Protection Scotland (HPS), a government agency, came as it emerged two premature babies died in a third hospital in the city in January after being infected by a very rare antiobiotic-resistant bacteria. The babies were infected in a neonatal unit at Princess Royal maternity hospital by a strain of the staphylococcus aureus bacterium, type 11164, never before seen in the UK and only previously detected twice worldwide. It is highly resistant to the two most commonly used antibiotics, and the standard skin cleaning solution used by the NHS. The babies\u2019 deaths, and the infection of a third premature baby, came to light in January but the rare strain was only named this week. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said no further cases had been detected since but opposition parties said the disclosure raised fresh questions about infection control in the board\u2019s hospitals. The HPS report was written after a spate of unusual infections at other GGC hospitals that have come to light over the last three months. In late January prosecutors disclosed they were investigating the deaths of two patients, a 10-year-old boy and a 73-year-old woman, who contracted an infection linked to pigeon droppings at Queen Elizabeth hospital. Two patients at that hospital also became seriously ill after contracting a separate fungal infection called mucor, while a patient at Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley died from a separate hospital-acquired infection in December. In light of the water contamination disclosures, HPS said it was essential every Scottish health board test the water at any hospitals built since 2013. The Scottish government launched a substantial hospital building strategy partly using public funds, in the case of the Queen Elizabeth, but also private financing. Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, said the HPS report would feed into a wider inquiry into the Queen Elizabeth hospital ordered after the deaths came to light. \u201cAs I have previously stated to parliament, it is vital that we all understand what the issues are, why they have arisen, and that the recommendations will be taken forward,\u201d Freeman said. Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour\u2019s health spokeswoman, criticised Freeman for releasing the report on a Friday, when Holyrood was not sitting. \u201cGiven the circumstances, the health board and the government should be inviting as much scrutiny and acting in as transparent a manner as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cJeane Freeman and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both insisted last month that there was no infection control problem at the hospital \u2013 but 23 cases of blood stream infections in less than nine months tells a different story.\u201d",

Not only that, they also \u201ccommitted several other infringements\u201d which Fifa did not feel inclined to go into. This kind of shameless approach to wanton regulation-breaching, particularly in such a \u201cparamount\u201d corner of the Fifa regulatory framework, clearly merited swift and savage punishment, and on this occasion, as on so many others, football\u2019s global governing body has not let us down. Today they delivered their bombshell verdict, sentencing Chelsea to a short period of mild inconvenience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/22/sports-quiz-week-football-posing-dancing-trash-talking\">Sports quiz of the week: losing, posing, dancing and talking trash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They will, to be specific, be unable to register new players for two transfer windows, have to \u201cregularise the situation of the minor players concerned\u201d and pay a \u00a3460,000 fine. Chelsea swiftly issued a statement of their own, insisting they \u201ccategorically refute the findings\u201d and promising to \u201cshortly be submitting its appeal\u201d. Well, of course they will. Barcelona did the same when they were given a two-window ban for similar offences in 2014, and in the eight months it took for the appeal to wind its way gently through the system before being emphatically dismissed they gleefully replenished their player ranks, snaffling Luis Su\u00e1rez, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-Andre ter Stegen among others and collecting an almighty haul of trophies. </p> <p>In all likelihood, Chelsea will have ample opportunity to add to their 25 senior players, the 60 Under-21 players they currently have registered with the Premier League, youngsters who emerge through their youth system over the next two years, and the 42 players they currently have out on loan before any ban comes into force. And they\u2019ll still be able to sack their managers, so there\u2019s no need to completely change the culture of the club. Like the family who returns from holiday to an empty fridge and is thus forced to raid their cupboards for supper, Chelsea might occasionally have to make do with what they\u2019ve got. Though instead of tinned baked beans, dried chickpeas and a two-years-out-of-date packet of wholemeal fusilli they have Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Michy Batshuayi. And approximately 100 other footballers. </p> <p>In Chelsea\u2019s case, it was the way they went about stocking the larder that might eventually force them to actually use it. Though by now it is so absurdly overburdened that however hard Fifa tries to induce a famine, at Stamford Bridge they will still be able to feast.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Simon Burnton for pwopa nawty Friday night Lahn derby MBM coverage of West Ham 2-0 Fulham</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cWe had some land on our farm with maize to feed the pigs.

      "bodyText": "(BLUE IS) THE COLOUR OF MONEY \u201cThe protection of minors,\u201d Fifa wrote in a statement issued today regarding Chelsea\u2019s apparently repeated and flagrant flaunting of regulations concerning the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18, \u201cis a key element in Fifa\u2019s regulatory framework relating to the transfer of players and effective enforcement of these rules is paramount.\u201d Chelsea, it appears, breached these rules not in one case, not in two cases, not in three cases, not in four cases, not in five cases, not in six cases, not in seven cases, not in eight cases, not in nine cases, not in 10 cases, not in 11 cases [skip to the end \u2013 Fiver Ed] but in 29 cases. Not only that, they also \u201ccommitted several other infringements\u201d which Fifa did not feel inclined to go into. This kind of shameless approach to wanton regulation-breaching, particularly in such a \u201cparamount\u201d corner of the Fifa regulatory framework, clearly merited swift and savage punishment, and on this occasion, as on so many others, football\u2019s global governing body has not let us down. Today they delivered their bombshell verdict, sentencing Chelsea to a short period of mild inconvenience. They will, to be specific, be unable to register new players for two transfer windows, have to \u201cregularise the situation of the minor players concerned\u201d and pay a \u00a3460,000 fine. Chelsea swiftly issued a statement of their own, insisting they \u201ccategorically refute the findings\u201d and promising to \u201cshortly be submitting its appeal\u201d. Well, of course they will. Barcelona did the same when they were given a two-window ban for similar offences in 2014, and in the eight months it took for the appeal to wind its way gently through the system before being emphatically dismissed they gleefully replenished their player ranks, snaffling Luis Su\u00e1rez, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-Andre ter Stegen among others and collecting an almighty haul of trophies. In all likelihood, Chelsea will have ample opportunity to add to their 25 senior players, the 60 Under-21 players they currently have registered with the Premier League, youngsters who emerge through their youth system over the next two years, and the 42 players they currently have out on loan before any ban comes into force. And they\u2019ll still be able to sack their managers, so there\u2019s no need to completely change the culture of the club. Like the family who returns from holiday to an empty fridge and is thus forced to raid their cupboards for supper, Chelsea might occasionally have to make do with what they\u2019ve got. Though instead of tinned baked beans, dried chickpeas and a two-years-out-of-date packet of wholemeal fusilli they have Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Michy Batshuayi. And approximately 100 other footballers. In Chelsea\u2019s case, it was the way they went about stocking the larder that might eventually force them to actually use it. Though by now it is so absurdly overburdened that however hard Fifa tries to induce a famine, at Stamford Bridge they will still be able to feast. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Simon Burnton for pwopa nawty Friday night Lahn derby MBM coverage of West Ham 2-0 Fulham. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe had some land on our farm with maize to feed the pigs. My father made a small football pitch and me and my brothers would play there. People told my father he was crazy because he would lose a lot of corn. He said: \u2018I\u2019m doing it for my children.\u2019 We were there all day\u201d \u2013 Those pigs\u2019 loss is now Wolves\u2019 gain, as midfielder Leander Dendoncker tells Jacob Steinberg. FIVER LETTERS \u201cChelsea fans will be devastated to hear about their transfer ban, which leaves them with nothing except an endless stream of managers, 25 first team players, 42 players that are currently out on loan and 22 U-23 players. To make things worse, Fifa have given them a \u00a3460,000 fine. First-world problems and all that...\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cContinuing the theme of taking people to football (Fivers passim), on every trip to see my Bavaria-born wife\u2019s family, my father-in-law has very generously procured me tickets to accompany him to Bayern Munich games. On one of their trips over to the UK, I returned the favour by taking him to see my beloved Wycombe. The game was played in driving rain and the ball barely touched the ground for 90 minutes. Needless to say, when I\u2019ve offered him the opportunity of a return trip, he\u2019s politely declined\u201d \u2013 Ben Graham. \u201cMy wife\u2019s first ever football match was the legendary Jimmy Glass game, when the goalkeeper scored in the last minute of injury time to keep Carlisle United in the Football League. My wife and my 67-year-old mother joined me in the immediate pitch invasion, and the whole place went absolutely crazy. \u2018I love football, it\u2019s amazing!\u2019 cried my wife from the melee and she continued to say this for some time afterwards. The next game we got to was a 0-0 draw against Torquay in front of 2,000 fans. She hasn\u2019t been to another game since\u201d \u2013 Andy Park. \u201cYes, German fans do make a lot of noise as Peter Hehir has noted (Thursday\u2019s Fiver). The reason being that, unlike British fans who rely on spontaneity, they have \u2018conductors\u2019: cheerleaders who stand at the front with their backs to the match, telling the crowd what to sing, which way to wave their hands and scarves, how fast to beat the drums etc. Kind of impressive, but also naff and slightly sinister\u201d \u2013 John Caley.

BITS AND BOBS The 32-year-old Manchester City fan injured in an alleged assault in Gelsenkirchen has been placed in a medically induced coma. \u201cOur thoughts and best wishes are with his family,\u201d said Pep Guardiola. Chelsea have put England assistant Steve Holland at the top of their list of names to replace Maurizio Sarri, presumably written on a discarded packet of tabs. Not that it\u2019s top of their priorities at the moment, but Chelsea have been drawn against Dynamo Kyiv in the next round of the Europa League. Arsenal will play Rennes in what\u2019s already being known as the Kaba Diawara derby. If you wanted to put pressure on a newish manager, would you compare him to his club\u2019s greatest ever boss?

Quirke is married to her late husband\u2019s sister and helped with Lowry\u2019s farm and finances.</p> <p>Lowry said she felt vulnerable as a widow and sought comfort but found Quirke to be \u201coverpowering\u201d and \u201cintimidating\u201d. He badgered her for money and she was ashamed of the relationship, she said.</p> <p>She ended the relationship in the summer of 2010. Soon after she met and started dating Ryan, who helped her obtain tickets for an All-Ireland hurling final. He was a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d and she loved him, as did her children, she testified. \u201cWhat more would you want from a relationship?\u201d</p> <p>Quirke resented Ryan and confronted him, saying \u201cshe\u2019s mine\u201d, Lowry told the court.</p> <p>In February 2011 the Dear Patricia advice column in the Sunday Independent newspaper published an anonymous letter from Quirke complaining that he was a married man who had been ditched by his girlfriend.</p> <p>Ryan went missing on 3 June 2011 after leaving Lowry\u2019s home at about 6.30am. Lowry said she saw Quirke at her farm at about 8.30am and found it unusual he would be there so early.

      "bodyText": "Sex, blowflies and a lovelorn farmer who sought advice from a newspaper agony aunt before allegedly murdering his love rival: it is the murder case transfixing Ireland. Patrick Quirke, 50, is accused of killing Bobby Ryan, a DJ known as Mr Moonlight, in 2011 and hiding his body for two years in an underground tank on a farm in County Tipperary. The trial, which started last month, has at times eclipsed Brexit with banner headlines about Quirke\u2019s alleged plot to rekindle a \u201cseedy affair\u201d with Mary Lowry, who had left him and started a relationship with Ryan, 52. On Friday a jury of six men and six women at the central criminal court in Dublin heard that Ryan\u2019s body showed evidence of multiple injuries that could have been the result of a road collision or a serious assault. It was the latest revelation in a case that has focused on grisly forensic evidence and testimony about romantic rivals in Fawnagowan, a rural Tipperary townland 120 miles (190km) south-west of Dublin. Quirke denies murdering Ryan. Lowry, 52, has testified that she began an affair with Quirke in 2008, a year after her husband died of cancer. Quirke is married to her late husband\u2019s sister and helped with Lowry\u2019s farm and finances. Lowry said she felt vulnerable as a widow and sought comfort but found Quirke to be \u201coverpowering\u201d and \u201cintimidating\u201d. He badgered her for money and she was ashamed of the relationship, she said. She ended the relationship in the summer of 2010. Soon after she met and started dating Ryan, who helped her obtain tickets for an All-Ireland hurling final. He was a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d and she loved him, as did her children, she testified. \u201cWhat more would you want from a relationship?\u201d Quirke resented Ryan and confronted him, saying \u201cshe\u2019s mine\u201d, Lowry told the court. In February 2011 the Dear Patricia advice column in the Sunday Independent newspaper published an anonymous letter from Quirke complaining that he was a married man who had been ditched by his girlfriend. Ryan went missing on 3 June 2011 after leaving Lowry\u2019s home at about 6.30am. Lowry said she saw Quirke at her farm at about 8.30am and found it unusual he would be there so early. She said he seemed \u201chot and sweaty and bothered looking\u201d. Prosecutors allege Quirke killed the DJ and hid his body in an underground run-off tank on Lowry\u2019s farm, hoping to then rekindle his affair with her. Quirke told the court he had accepted Lowry\u2019s new relationship and was mystified by Ryan\u2019s disappearance. \u201cI asked questions and like everyone else I had a hunch what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone had notions he was attacked. Did he leave for Spain?\u201d On 30 April 2013 Quirke called police to say he had discovered a decomposing body in an underground tank. John Manlove, a forensic entomologist, told the court the presence of common blowfly larvae in the body\u2019s chest cavity suggested the tank had been opened several weeks earlier. The trial continues.",

      "bodyText": "New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with solicitation of prostitution as part of a sex trafficking sting operation in Florida, authorities said Friday. Kraft, the billionaire businessman whose Patriots won the Super Bowl earlier this month and who is one of the most powerful figures in American sports, was charged as a \u2018john\u2019 on two misdemeanor counts of soliciting another to commit prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, police said. The owner\u2019s implication in the sting was first reported by Treasure Coast Newspapers. Jupiter police chief Daniel Kerr said in a press conference on Friday morning that Kraft\u2019s two counts stem from two separate visits to the illicit strip-mall massage parlor \u201capproximately a month ago\u201d. Kerr said video evidence of the acts was captured by body-worn cameras and additional surveillance the department had been conducting during a months-long investigation into an international human trafficking ring involving multiple law enforcement agencies along the Florida coast. Police said Kraft\u2019s active warrant is being handled by the state attorney\u2019s office and his attorneys will be notified. While he primarily resides in Massachusetts, Kraft is a longtime seasonal resident of Palm Beach County, according to the Palm Beach Daily News. \u201cWe\u2019re as deeply stunned as anyone else,\u201d Kerr said. A statement from a spokesperson for Kraft obtained by the Guardian said: \u201cWe categorically deny that Mr Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.

An league spokesperson said they are \u201caware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments\u201d. Kraft is one of 25 individuals who will be charged according to a police handout. Andrew Sharp, the lead detective on the case, could not confirm the dollar amount Kraft spent at the spa pending the release of the probable cause affidavit, but said that the average fee was $59 for a half hour and $79 for an hour. \u201cDoes the video contain Mr Kraft inside receiving the alleged acts?

      "body": "<p>Teenagers in Britain may be putting their health and education at risk by spending too much time on social media at bedtime, according to a major study into adolescent sleep habits.</p> <p>More than a third of teenagers spent at least three hours a day on social media, with a fifth devoting at least five hours to the activity, researchers found. Those who were on social media for three hours or more daily were most likely to get to sleep late.</p> <p>Going to sleep late on school nights was a particular concern, researchers said, because it put teenagers at risk of \u201cpoorer academic and emotional outcomes\u201d. Insufficient sleep in adolescence has been linked to a range of mental health problems, obesity and <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/3/e921\">poor performance at school</a>.</p> <p>According to the study, the heaviest social media users also woke most in the night, a problem that may be driven, or exacerbated, by teenagers\u2019 sleep being disturbed by notifications and the temptation to continue online conversations into the early hours.</p> <p>Scientists at the University of Glasgow released the findings in a <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/z7kpf/\">preliminary report</a> that has yet to be peer reviewed and published in a journal. The report calls for support for young people to help them find a balance between social media and a good night\u2019s rest, particularly on school nights.</p> <p>\u201cWith the majority of adolescents reporting insufficient sleep to function properly or to meet recommended guidelines, there is growing concern that social media may be a contributing factor for today\u2019s teenagers,\u201d the researchers write.</p> <p>Heather Woods, a psychologist at Glasgow, analysed data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative survey that aims to explore the impact of home life on child and adolescent development. The study focused on data from nearly 12,000 children aged 13 to 15 from across the UK.</p> <p>According to the report, the average teenager spent one to three hours on social media every day. A third, mostly boys, spent less than an hour a day on the sites. Social media use was classed as \u201chigh\u201d for 14% who were on for three to five hours, and \u201cvery high\u201d for 21% who were on for five or more hours. Girls were far more likely than boys to be heavy users, with 28% in the five hours plus group compared with only 14% of boys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-22T13:50:31/embed.html\" data-alt=\"social media use girls boys graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-22T13:50:31/embed.html\">social media use girls boys graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The study does not blame social media for sleep deprivation in teenagers, but those in the \u201chigh\u201d and \u201cvery high\u201d use categories were 17% and 68% respectively more likely to fall asleep after 11pm on school nights than similar teenagers in the \u201caverage\u201d category. Both groups were more prone to rising late, after 8am, on school days.</p> <p>Those who hardly used social media were least likely to fall asleep late or oversleep in the morning, suggesting that minimal use was best for a good night\u2019s rest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/21/one-in-13-teenagers-has-experienced-ptsd-research-finds\">One in 13 teenagers has experienced PTSD, research finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Social media was also linked to poorer sleep quality, with the most avid users waking more in the night. Teenagers in the high and very high use groups were 7% and 28% more likely to report being awake at least \u201ca good bit of the time\u201d compared with average users. However, the study cannot rule out that broken sleep drives night-time social media use rather than the other way around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-22T15:04:54/embed.html\" data-alt=\"heavy social media use sleep graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-22T15:04:54/embed.html\">heavy social media use sleep graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Similarly, the trend for the heaviest social media users to go to sleep late may be down to teenagers who naturally fall asleep late using social media in bed until they feel tired. But the activity may also drive sleep loss, particularly on school nights, when it has to be crammed into night-time hours, and when routine tasks such as homework get done later because people are busy checking social media.</p> <p>Holly Scott of the University of Glasgow, first author of the study, said: \u201cWe found that teenagers who spent more time using social media were more likely to fall asleep late on school nights. Although they also tended to wake up later, school start times meant they still were unlikely to get the hours of sleep they need on school nights.\u201d</p> <p>Other experts also raised concerns. \u201cGiven that on school days, young people tend to wake up by 8am, those who fall asleep later are more likely to have experienced fewer hours of sleep, and there is clear evidence that lack of sleep is related to physical and psychological issues,\u201d said Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey. \u201cThe disturbed sleep experienced by those using social media for five or more hours a day will compound this further.\u201d</p> <p>But Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, said the findings did not justify new restrictions on social media use. \u201cThe effects aren\u2019t huge. A kid who is on Instagram for eight hours a day gets about half an hour less sleep than one who\u2019s not using it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis research is really good raw material for scientists to consider when we design studies, but it is not sufficient to change course.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Teenagers in Britain may be putting their health and education at risk by spending too much time on social media at bedtime, according to a major study into adolescent sleep habits. More than a third of teenagers spent at least three hours a day on social media, with a fifth devoting at least five hours to the activity, researchers found. Those who were on social media for three hours or more daily were most likely to get to sleep late. Going to sleep late on school nights was a particular concern, researchers said, because it put teenagers at risk of \u201cpoorer academic and emotional outcomes\u201d. Insufficient sleep in adolescence has been linked to a range of mental health problems, obesity and poor performance at school. According to the study, the heaviest social media users also woke most in the night, a problem that may be driven, or exacerbated, by teenagers\u2019 sleep being disturbed by notifications and the temptation to continue online conversations into the early hours. Scientists at the University of Glasgow released the findings in a preliminary report that has yet to be peer reviewed and published in a journal. The report calls for support for young people to help them find a balance between social media and a good night\u2019s rest, particularly on school nights. \u201cWith the majority of adolescents reporting insufficient sleep to function properly or to meet recommended guidelines, there is growing concern that social media may be a contributing factor for today\u2019s teenagers,\u201d the researchers write. Heather Woods, a psychologist at Glasgow, analysed data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative survey that aims to explore the impact of home life on child and adolescent development. The study focused on data from nearly 12,000 children aged 13 to 15 from across the UK. According to the report, the average teenager spent one to three hours on social media every day. A third, mostly boys, spent less than an hour a day on the sites. Social media use was classed as \u201chigh\u201d for 14% who were on for three to five hours, and \u201cvery high\u201d for 21% who were on for five or more hours. Girls were far more likely than boys to be heavy users, with 28% in the five hours plus group compared with only 14% of boys. The study does not blame social media for sleep deprivation in teenagers, but those in the \u201chigh\u201d and \u201cvery high\u201d use categories were 17% and 68% respectively more likely to fall asleep after 11pm on school nights than similar teenagers in the \u201caverage\u201d category. Both groups were more prone to rising late, after 8am, on school days. Those who hardly used social media were least likely to fall asleep late or oversleep in the morning, suggesting that minimal use was best for a good night\u2019s rest. Social media was also linked to poorer sleep quality, with the most avid users waking more in the night. Teenagers in the high and very high use groups were 7% and 28% more likely to report being awake at least \u201ca good bit of the time\u201d compared with average users. However, the study cannot rule out that broken sleep drives night-time social media use rather than the other way around. Similarly, the trend for the heaviest social media users to go to sleep late may be down to teenagers who naturally fall asleep late using social media in bed until they feel tired. But the activity may also drive sleep loss, particularly on school nights, when it has to be crammed into night-time hours, and when routine tasks such as homework get done later because people are busy checking social media. Holly Scott of the University of Glasgow, first author of the study, said: \u201cWe found that teenagers who spent more time using social media were more likely to fall asleep late on school nights. Although they also tended to wake up later, school start times meant they still were unlikely to get the hours of sleep they need on school nights.\u201d Other experts also raised concerns. \u201cGiven that on school days, young people tend to wake up by 8am, those who fall asleep later are more likely to have experienced fewer hours of sleep, and there is clear evidence that lack of sleep is related to physical and psychological issues,\u201d said Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey. \u201cThe disturbed sleep experienced by those using social media for five or more hours a day will compound this further.\u201d But Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, said the findings did not justify new restrictions on social media use. \u201cThe effects aren\u2019t huge. A kid who is on Instagram for eight hours a day gets about half an hour less sleep than one who\u2019s not using it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis research is really good raw material for scientists to consider when we design studies, but it is not sufficient to change course.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog today and for all of your comments. I\u2019m going to leave you with a summary of the afternoon\u2019s main developments. Theresa May is to be told by Cabinet ministers that she should step down after May\u2019s local elections and allow a new leader to deliver the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, the Guardian understands. Jeremy Corbyn has said he regrets the resignation from the Labour party of Ian Austin. The Labour leader said the MP for Dudley North should be campaigning on the manifesto he was elected on, tackling, poverty, injustice and inequality. The Labour leader faces a battle to stop other MPs leaving the party, according to reports, which say he must back a people\u2019s vote and take tougher action over antisemitism to prevent more quitting. Between 30 and 50 councillors are also quitting the party today, citing similar concerns to the MPs who have left, according to the Huffington Post. Margaret Hodge, who has also criticised Jeremy Corbyn over his handling of the antisemitism row, said the MPs\u2019 departures should be \u201ca wake-up call to the leadership\u201d. She said she wanted to continue calling out antisemitism in the Labour movement. Members of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet will make it clear that they believe she must go after the forthcoming local elections, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. She writes: Senior figures in government have suggested they want the prime minister to leave shortly after the first phase of the Brexit negotiations finishes \u2013 or risk being defeated in a vote of no confidence at the end of the year. You can read the story here. The Huffington Post is reporting the resignation of some Labour councillors, citing similar reasons as some of the MPs who quit. Read what you will into this tweet by Labour\u2019s deputy leader, at the end of a tough week for the party... Margaret Hodge, referenced by Ian Austin in the piece in which he said \u201cthe hard truth is that the party is tougher on the people complaining about antisemitism than it is on the antisemites\u201d, has said his exit should be a wake-up call for the leadership. But she gave no indication of planning to join the nine Labour MPs who resigned this week. Unsurprisingly, with Austin becoming the ninth MP to quit the Labour party this week, there is talk of more joining them. Jeremy Corbyn has said he is sorry Ian Austin has taken the decision to leave the Labour party but that he should be campaigning on the issues in the manifesto he was elected on, namely, tackling poverty, injustice and inequality. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator has said a week of talks with Theresa May and the British negotiators has left him more concerned than every about the prospect of an accidental no-deal Brexit in five weeks. My colleagues, Daniel Boffey, Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Jennifer Rankin, write: He [Barnier] told a French radio channel: \u201cToday I am more worried than before\u201d over the talks, adding that the UK needed to make decisions fast. The EU official also told ambassadors privately, after the negotiations with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and a visit by May to Brussels, that the chances of an \u201caccidental\u201d no-deal Brexit were high. Siobhan McDonagh, Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden, has spoken out about antisemitism in the and threatened to quit the party if it was not dealt with. She has said that she has received a \u201cwave of abuse\u201d in the wake of this week\u2019s resignations from the party. The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, has criticised Ian Austin\u2019s decision to leave the Labour party. The Irish government has today published a wide range of emergency laws that will be enacted if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The Omnibus Bill, which will be fast-tracked through the Oireachtas parliament in Dublin, is designed to support businesses and jobs impacted by a no-deal and secure ongoing access to essential services and products across the Irish border. The huge suite of proposed legislation, which will only become law if the UK leaves on 29 March 29 without a deal, was published as the EU Commission confirmed it was relaxing certain state aid regulations in preparation for Brexit - a move that will give the government in Dublin more latitude to offer support to farms and other affected businesses. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: Our focus remains on the UK ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement, which was concluded following intensive negotiations between the UK and the EU. However, for the last two years we have also been preparing for the possibility that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement. We are doing all we can to avoid a no-deal scenario, but we need to be ready in case it does happen. This special law enables us to mitigate against some of the worst effects of no deal by protecting citizens\u2019 rights, security, and facilitating extra supports for vulnerable businesses and employers. Deputy premier Simon Coveney unveiled the legislative package at Government Buildings in Dublin on Friday morning, but said he hoped the Bill would never need to be enacted. \u201cMy only desire is to see this legislation sit on the shelf,\u201d he said. Coveney said a no-deal Brexit would cause widespread damage: Let me be very clear in saying a disorderly Brexit will be a lose, lose, lose - for the UK, for the EU and for Ireland. We cannot offset all of the damage it will do, but we are doing everything we can through legislation, through preparation, through investment, through information and through support of the multiple sectors and the multiple numbers of people that will be impacted potentially by that worst-case scenario. John McDonnell has said Labour must be faster in tackling antisemitism. The shadow chancellor\u2019s remarks came as Ian Austin became the ninth MP to quit the party this week. Austin told his local paper that the party is \u201cbroken\u201d. He condemned a \u201cculture of extremism, antisemitism and intolerance\u201d in Labour and said he did not want Jeremy Corbyn to enter Downing Street Austin said he had no intention of joining the Independent Group, comprised of eight other former Labour MPs and three former Conservative MPs. His Dudley North constituency voted by 71.4% to leave in the EU referendum and he has urged Labour to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. The party expressed regret at Austin\u2019s decision but said he should put himself up for re-election. The MP, who has a majority of just 22, said he would not a byelection. The deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, called Austin\u2019s decision \u201cvery sad\u201d. He said it was \u201cpersonally hard to see a close friend take a decision of this magnitude\u201d. Some Corbyn supporters have argued that Austin\u2019s views meant that he was no longer credible as a member of the Labour party. He is generally viewed as having been on the right of the party. Some have taken issue with him citing racism as a reason for leaving the party when he has urged Labour to bring in tougher laws on immigration. The Mail reported in 2014 that Austin said \u201cthe Labour leadership should embrace tough policies including a ban on benefit payments to new migrants who have paid nothing into the system, fingerprinting at the Calais border, and up-front payments by foreigners for NHS care\u201d. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said Labour have been too slow to act on antisemitism. The nine MPs who have quit the party this week have, to varying degrees, cited the party\u2019s handling of the antisemitism vow as one of the reasons for doing so. In an interview with the Evening Standard published today, McDonnell said: We\u2019ve got to be quicker, and we\u2019ve got to be fiercer. I think there\u2019s been a lot of listening but not enough action. That\u2019s the problem. He also gave another indication that Labour is moving towards a people\u2019s vote. On the people\u2019s vote, we\u2019ve kept it on the table and we\u2019re moving towards that. More from the lobby briefing from the Press Association: The prime minister will have a bilateral meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk on Sunday when both leaders will be in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for an EU-League of Arab States summit, Downing Street said. May spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez by telephone on Thursday night regarding Brexit, a Number 10 spokesman said. The prime minister\u2019s official spokeswoman says Theresa May is determined to leave the EU on 29 March, despite pressure from many Tory MPs for a delay. Reporting from the lobby briefing, Reuters also says that May is considering no-deal tariffs carefully and a decision will be announced shortly but work is continuing to try to secure a deal. The spokeswoman said May will have further bilateral talks with EU leaders in Egypt on Sunday and Monday. More regret expressed at Austin\u2019s departure, this time by the Labour MP for Wolverhampton North East: Austin has said he will not call a byelection, despite Labour urging him and his eight other ex-colleagues who quit the party to do so. Labour leftwinger Chris Williamson, an ardent supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, has called Ian Austin \u201can embarrassment\u201d. Angela Smith and Mike Gapes, have joined other former Labour MPs who quit the party for the Independent Group in expressing their support for Ian Austin. Labour\u2019s deputy leader has described Ian Austin\u2019s decision to leave as \u201cvery sad\u201d. Here is Ian Austin talking about his decision to leave the Labour party: Ian Austin told the Express &amp; Star he had not spoken to the eight former Labour MPs and three former Tory MPs who make up the Independent Group. While he may share some of his ex-colleagues\u2019 views about the party - namely on its response to antisemitism in its ranks - he is far removed from them on Europe. His Dudley North constituency voted by 71.4% to leave in the EU referendum, one of the highest margins in the country. Writing for the Guardian in November, he suggested that Labour should back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said Ian Austin\u2019s decision to quit the party was \u201cvery sad\u201d. I have known Ian a long time, before we were MPs and he has been a good friend. It\u2019s regrettable that he\u2019s done this.\u201d But Mahmood said Labour was attempting to combat antisemitism. Unfortunately there are those associated with the party who make comments. But the party is doing its best and will continue to have zero tolerance against antisemitism. On that basis, we should move forward, together. We are a family - I have very high regard for Ian, but this is very sad. Ian Austin has received support from some of his fellow former Labour MPs. Labour have responded to Ian Austin quitting the party by calling for him to put himself up for re-election - the same message delivered to the other eight MPs who left earlier this week. It is worth pointing out that Austin\u2019s majority at the 2017 election was just 22. In his column for the paper, Ian Austin, an adopted child of Jewish refugees, refers to his own treatment when he was told he was being investigated after criticising the party\u2019s new code on antisemitism. He also condemns the treatment of Luciana Berger, who he says has been \u201cbullied\u201d out of the party and that of Margaret Hodge, who also spoke out about antisemitism. He says: The hard truth is that the party is tougher on the people complaining about anti-Semitism than it is on the anti-Semites. He is forthright in his criticism of the Labour leader, saying Jeremy Corbyn \u201cspent his entire political career working with and supporting all sorts of extremists, and in some cases terrorists and anti-Semites\u201d. He continues: I always thought he was unfit to lead the Labour Party and I certainly think he is unfit to lead our country. I think Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell cannot be trusted with our national security and would undermine our democratic institutions. They supported the IRA when they were planting bombs and murdering people in shopping centres, hotels and pubs. They back totalitarian dictatorships like Venezuela abroad and echoed the Kremlin when Putin tried to murder people here in Britain. This is the Express and Star front page today: Austin has penned a column for the paper entitled: \u201cI\u2019ve become ashamed of Labour under Corbyn\u201d Good morning, this is Haroon Siddique sitting in for Andrew Sparrow once more. I\u2019ll be covering all the significant political developments throughout the day. The best way to get my attention is to tweet me. Breaking news to begin with. Ian Austin has become the ninth MP to quit the party this week, telling his local paper that the party is \u201cbroken\u201d. Austin, who joined the party in 1984, faced an investigation - later dropped - last year over alleged abusive behaviour, after expressing anger about the party\u2019s handling of the antisemitism row. In an interview with the Express &amp; Star, he said: I could never ask local people to make Jeremy Corbyn Prime Minister,\u201d he said ...I am appalled at the offence and distress Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party have caused to Jewish people. It is terrible that a culture of extremism, antisemitism and intolerance is driving out good MPs and decent people who have committed their life to mainstream politics. He said that the party had been taken over by the hard left. Austin said he had not spoken to the Independent Group, which consists of eight former Labour MPs and three former Conservative MPs.",

      "body": "<p>Simon Norton, who has died of a heart attack aged 66, was a world-class mathematician sometimes mistaken for a homeless man.</p> <p>In the late 1960s he represented Britain at the International Mathematical Olympiads three times, scoring the top grade each time, once with 100%, another time with 99%, and winning a special prize for the elegance of his solutions. What made his work beautiful was not its complexity but its simplicity. Without drafts or false starts, he laid down his pellucid solutions to questions involving imaginary numbers, infinity and the distribution of primes with the grace of a ballerina unfolding her hands.</p> <p>Simon took his first mathematics degree at Imperial College, London, while still a schoolboy. But then came Cambridge University. Rather than allowing Simon to continue his ebullient race into mathematics and start on a PhD straight away, the Cambridge mathematics department insisted he retake the final year of his degree. For the first time, Simon faltered. Mathematics legend has it that he scored a historic 52 alphas in his finals (12 is all it takes to get a first); in fact, it was 13. Simon was not even the best in his class. Bored at having to repeat material he already knew, the next year he almost failed Part III Mathematics, necessary for anyone wanting to start research.</p> <p>Simon\u2019s fortunes revived when he started to work with the charismatic John Conway, a brilliant and playful mathematician at the university. Together they worked on the Atlas of Finite Groups. Group theory concerns the study of symmetries. Turn a triangle on its side and it will still look like a triangle: that is a group theory result. At its most complex \u2013 in the rarefied landscapes where Simon gambolled \u2013 group theory underpins our understanding of the universe.</p> <p>The job of the atlas was to catalogue all the fundamental types of symmetry: the atoms of the subject. Simon\u2019s attention was caught by one of these \u201catoms\u201d, known as \u201cthe Monster\u201d. You can turn a triangle three times, and it looks the same each time. For the Monster, the equivalent number is 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000.</p> <p>Simon became the world expert on an unearthly mathematical aspect of this group called Monstrous Moonshine. \u201cI can explain what Monstrous Moonshine is in one sentence,\u201d said Simon. \u201cIt is the voice of God.\u201d</p> <p>Simon was playful in daily life as well as abstract thought. Backgammon and making up anagrams were regular, often riotous pastimes in the faculty common room at Cambridge. Simon was the best at both. His instant solution to \u201cphoneboxes\u201d (shouted out before you can reach the end of this sentence) was remembered for decades: xenophobes. He was known not only for his good looks but for his modesty (a rare trait among mathematicians): what delighted Simon was the clever defeat of a puzzle, never of a person.</p> <p>One day, during the 15 years it took to write the atlas (which was published in 1985), Conway asked Simon a question. Simon gave the solution immediately, as usual, and Conway began writing the answer down \u2026 then stopped. \u201cNo,\u201d said Conway, \u201cyou\u2019ve got that wrong.\u201d Simon saw that he had, and blushed. \u201cThat,\u201d said Conway, \u201cis the beginning of the end.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc95794cf65cea461c38998357310576053a8cf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc95794cf65cea461c38998357310576053a8cf9/0_55_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Norton, a campaigner for public transport, enjoying a train ride in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Norton, a campaigner for public transport, enjoying a train ride in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Masters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was. Simon continued to publish excellent work and give outstanding talks at mathematics conferences around the world, but his days of eerie brilliance were over. It is impossible to say whether this was because his genius had diminished, or his focus. Never a tidy man, he became increasingly dishevelled. He wore battered clothing and mutton-chop whiskers, and always carried a greasy holdall that Conway suspected contained the solution to Monstrous Moonshine; in fact, it was filled with bus timetables.</p> <p>The youngest of three brothers, Simon was born in London. His father, Richard Norton, was a remote figure, eager for Victorian respectability, who ran SJ Phillips, the family jewellery business, and dreamed of eating supper with a tail-coated footman behind every chair.</p> <p>It was Simon\u2019s mother, Elaine (nee Manasseh), who spotted Simon\u2019s mathematical brilliance, when he was one and a half. Instead of flinging toy bricks around the room as his elder brothers had done, Simon sorted them into patterns. When he was three, Elaine arranged for an IQ test: Simon scored 178. He could count to 100 in 2s, 3s, 5s and 10s, read books and spell \u201cfire extinguisher\u201d.</p> <p>At five, he changed his name to 5, and sent sums to his mother, addressed \u201cMy darling 45, I cried when you went out \u2026\u201d All his life, he maintained that his mother embodied \u201cloveliness\u201d, even though he found her criticisms of his messy clothes and bumbling manners difficult. At 10, he sat the Eton entrance test. \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d asked a teacher during the examination. \u201cThat is Norton, doing his mathematics paper, singing for joy.\u201d Simon\u2019s answers were beyond words: the examiner wrote simply \u201c!!\u201d</p> <p>In later years, he owned a house in Cambridge and was famous for his generosity. He was the only landlord in the city to reduce his rent when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a> brought in the poll tax. Sometimes he would set potential tenants a mathematics puzzle. One was to replace the letters with the right numbers in the following multiplication: SIMON x P = NORTON. (There are two possible solutions.) I first met him in 1995, when I became one of his tenants, and in 2011 I published a biography of him: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/24/genius-in-my-basement-review\" title=\"\">Simon, The Genius in My Basement</a>.</p> <p>The other love of Simon\u2019s life was public transport. Even as a boy he would rush away to ride around the country on buses and trains. As an adult, he became a vehement campaigner against cars, wrote a regular, remarkably funny newsletter for the Campaign for Better Transport, and donated \u00a310,000 annually to fund a prize for transport activism (he was especially pleased when one of his winners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/25/gordonbrown.activists\" title=\"\">superglued himself</a> to Gordon Brown). Despite Simon\u2019s collapse into mathematical obscurity, he was a triumphant and inspiring figure: a person unburdened by rancour, jealousy or sense of loss.</p> <p>He is survived by his brothers, Michael and Francis.</p> <p> \u2022 Simon Phillips Norton, mathematician, born 25 February 1952; died 13 February 2019</p>",

Rather than allowing Simon to continue his ebullient race into mathematics and start on a PhD straight away, the Cambridge mathematics department insisted he retake the final year of his degree. For the first time, Simon faltered. Mathematics legend has it that he scored a historic 52 alphas in his finals (12 is all it takes to get a first); in fact, it was 13. Simon was not even the best in his class. Bored at having to repeat material he already knew, the next year he almost failed Part III Mathematics, necessary for anyone wanting to start research. Simon\u2019s fortunes revived when he started to work with the charismatic John Conway, a brilliant and playful mathematician at the university. Together they worked on the Atlas of Finite Groups. Group theory concerns the study of symmetries. Turn a triangle on its side and it will still look like a triangle: that is a group theory result. At its most complex \u2013 in the rarefied landscapes where Simon gambolled \u2013 group theory underpins our understanding of the universe. The job of the atlas was to catalogue all the fundamental types of symmetry: the atoms of the subject. Simon\u2019s attention was caught by one of these \u201catoms\u201d, known as \u201cthe Monster\u201d. You can turn a triangle three times, and it looks the same each time. For the Monster, the equivalent number is 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000. Simon became the world expert on an unearthly mathematical aspect of this group called Monstrous Moonshine. \u201cI can explain what Monstrous Moonshine is in one sentence,\u201d said Simon. \u201cIt is the voice of God.\u201d Simon was playful in daily life as well as abstract thought. Backgammon and making up anagrams were regular, often riotous pastimes in the faculty common room at Cambridge. Simon was the best at both. His instant solution to \u201cphoneboxes\u201d (shouted out before you can reach the end of this sentence) was remembered for decades: xenophobes. He was known not only for his good looks but for his modesty (a rare trait among mathematicians): what delighted Simon was the clever defeat of a puzzle, never of a person. One day, during the 15 years it took to write the atlas (which was published in 1985), Conway asked Simon a question. Simon gave the solution immediately, as usual, and Conway began writing the answer down \u2026 then stopped. \u201cNo,\u201d said Conway, \u201cyou\u2019ve got that wrong.\u201d Simon saw that he had, and blushed. \u201cThat,\u201d said Conway, \u201cis the beginning of the end.\u201d It was. Simon continued to publish excellent work and give outstanding talks at mathematics conferences around the world, but his days of eerie brilliance were over. It is impossible to say whether this was because his genius had diminished, or his focus. Never a tidy man, he became increasingly dishevelled. He wore battered clothing and mutton-chop whiskers, and always carried a greasy holdall that Conway suspected contained the solution to Monstrous Moonshine; in fact, it was filled with bus timetables. The youngest of three brothers, Simon was born in London. His father, Richard Norton, was a remote figure, eager for Victorian respectability, who ran SJ Phillips, the family jewellery business, and dreamed of eating supper with a tail-coated footman behind every chair. It was Simon\u2019s mother, Elaine (nee Manasseh), who spotted Simon\u2019s mathematical brilliance, when he was one and a half. Instead of flinging toy bricks around the room as his elder brothers had done, Simon sorted them into patterns. When he was three, Elaine arranged for an IQ test: Simon scored 178. He could count to 100 in 2s, 3s, 5s and 10s, read books and spell \u201cfire extinguisher\u201d. At five, he changed his name to 5, and sent sums to his mother, addressed \u201cMy darling 45, I cried when you went out \u2026\u201d All his life, he maintained that his mother embodied \u201cloveliness\u201d, even though he found her criticisms of his messy clothes and bumbling manners difficult. At 10, he sat the Eton entrance test. \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d asked a teacher during the examination. \u201cThat is Norton, doing his mathematics paper, singing for joy.\u201d Simon\u2019s answers were beyond words: the examiner wrote simply \u201c!!\u201d In later years, he owned a house in Cambridge and was famous for his generosity. He was the only landlord in the city to reduce his rent when Margaret Thatcher brought in the poll tax. Sometimes he would set potential tenants a mathematics puzzle. One was to replace the letters with the right numbers in the following multiplication: SIMON x P = NORTON. (There are two possible solutions.) I first met him in 1995, when I became one of his tenants, and in 2011 I published a biography of him: Simon, The Genius in My Basement. The other love of Simon\u2019s life was public transport. Even as a boy he would rush away to ride around the country on buses and trains. As an adult, he became a vehement campaigner against cars, wrote a regular, remarkably funny newsletter for the Campaign for Better Transport, and donated \u00a310,000 annually to fund a prize for transport activism (he was especially pleased when one of his winners superglued himself to Gordon Brown). Despite Simon\u2019s collapse into mathematical obscurity, he was a triumphant and inspiring figure: a person unburdened by rancour, jealousy or sense of loss. He is survived by his brothers, Michael and Francis. \u2022 Simon Phillips Norton, mathematician, born 25 February 1952; died 13 February 2019",

Brexiters in the cabinet are keen to see a new leader take over for the next stage of the negotiations with the EU, which May has already pledged will involve more active involvement for politicians rather than advisers. The hardening mood among cabinet ministers on the timeline for her departure will place further pressure on May before a critical week of Brexit talks and votes amid a febrile climate in Westminster. On Thursday the Guardian revealed that remainer ministers emboldened by the departure of three MPs to the Independent Group (TIG) were threatening to rebel against her leadership to prevent a no-deal outcome \u2013 daring her to sack them. And in a fresh blow to May, three cabinet ministers publicly say they would back moves to delay Brexit if she fails to get her deal through parliament. In a joint newspaper article, Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, the justice minister, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, say they want to ensure the UK does not crash out of the EU without a deal on 29 March.

If Glenn Close, as she is widely tipped to do, wins the best actress Oscar for her performance in The Wife at the 91st Academy Awards, it will mark the end of a 37-year wait for the industry\u2019s top honour.</p> <p>Close, who has been nominated six times previously, made a splash with her breakthrough role in 1982 in The World According to Garp, adapted from the John Irving novel. She was nominated for best supporting actress that year, but lost to Jessica Lange for Tootsie.</p> <p>If she does take the award, however, it will not be the longest wait in Oscar history. According to Guardian analysis, Henry Fonda had to wait for 43 years before finally winning the award for best actor, for On Golden Pond in 1982. Though Fonda secured his first film role in 1935\u2019s The Farmer Takes a Wife, his breakthrough role (and starting point for the Guardian\u2019s analysis) is considered to be the John Ford-directed Young Mr Lincoln, from 1939. The female actor with the longest wait is Helen Mirren: her Oscar for The Queen in 2007 was 38 years after her role in the Michael Powell-directed The Age of Consent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/win_wait/giv-3902zc1lKkSG0k3U/\" data-alt=\"oscar wait data\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/win_wait/giv-3902zc1lKkSG0k3U/\">oscar wait data</a> </figure>  <p>If she wins, Close would be the third woman over the age of 70 to win best actress, following Jessica Tandy (who won in 1990 for Driving Miss Daisy at the age of 80) and Katharine Hepburn, who is remarkable for winning three Oscars after her 60th birthday.</p> <p>Close would also be the eighth actor to win for a leading role more than 30 years after their breakthrough performance. Along with Fonda and Mirren, Jeff Bridges had a longer wait, with a 39-year gap between The Last Picture Show in 1971 and his 2010 Oscar win for Crazy Heart.</p> <p>The analysis, which looked at the 20 oldest winners in the best actor and best actress categories (excluding those who had won previously), found the average male actor had waited nearly 24 years after his breakthrough performance. For female actors, the average wait was significantly shorter at just under 18 years.</p> <p>The gap can be explained by the fact that women tend to be much younger when they win. All the oldest male winners were over the age of 50, while just over half of their female counterparts were in this age category. If we look at all past Oscar winners, the age gap between men and women is marked. The average age of the best actor winner was 44, while the average for best actress was 36.

      "bodyText": "How long is too long? If Glenn Close, as she is widely tipped to do, wins the best actress Oscar for her performance in The Wife at the 91st Academy Awards, it will mark the end of a 37-year wait for the industry\u2019s top honour. Close, who has been nominated six times previously, made a splash with her breakthrough role in 1982 in The World According to Garp, adapted from the John Irving novel. She was nominated for best supporting actress that year, but lost to Jessica Lange for Tootsie. If she does take the award, however, it will not be the longest wait in Oscar history. According to Guardian analysis, Henry Fonda had to wait for 43 years before finally winning the award for best actor, for On Golden Pond in 1982. Though Fonda secured his first film role in 1935\u2019s The Farmer Takes a Wife, his breakthrough role (and starting point for the Guardian\u2019s analysis) is considered to be the John Ford-directed Young Mr Lincoln, from 1939. The female actor with the longest wait is Helen Mirren: her Oscar for The Queen in 2007 was 38 years after her role in the Michael Powell-directed The Age of Consent. If she wins, Close would be the third woman over the age of 70 to win best actress, following Jessica Tandy (who won in 1990 for Driving Miss Daisy at the age of 80) and Katharine Hepburn, who is remarkable for winning three Oscars after her 60th birthday. Close would also be the eighth actor to win for a leading role more than 30 years after their breakthrough performance. Along with Fonda and Mirren, Jeff Bridges had a longer wait, with a 39-year gap between The Last Picture Show in 1971 and his 2010 Oscar win for Crazy Heart. The analysis, which looked at the 20 oldest winners in the best actor and best actress categories (excluding those who had won previously), found the average male actor had waited nearly 24 years after his breakthrough performance. For female actors, the average wait was significantly shorter at just under 18 years. The gap can be explained by the fact that women tend to be much younger when they win. All the oldest male winners were over the age of 50, while just over half of their female counterparts were in this age category. If we look at all past Oscar winners, the age gap between men and women is marked. The average age of the best actor winner was 44, while the average for best actress was 36. Adrien Brody is the only best actor under 30, winning for his role in The Pianist in 2002; by contrast, 32 actresses have won the equivalent prize in their 20s. Supporting actor winners tend to be older for both genders, but female winners are still younger. In this category, the male average is 49, while the average female winner is 40. However, as the Oscars age, so have the winners. Since 2010, best actresses had an average age of 41, up from 36 in the previous decade (2000-2009). The average age of best actors also saw a slight increase during this period, up to 45 from 43 in the previous decade. Methodology: The Guardian looked at the top 20 oldest best actor and best actress winners after 1950, excluding those who had won previously. The film team identified each actor\u2019s breakthrough role, and waiting times were calculated by subtracting the breakthrough year from the year award was received.",

      "bodyText": "Lenders to the outsourcing firm Interserve have lined up EY to manage its administration if they cannot reach agreement with shareholders on the terms of a financial restructuring plan. The emergence of EY as a potential administrator came as the largest shareholder in the company submitted new proposals, including a \u00a375m rights issue, as a counter-offer to the solution put forward by lenders, which it called \u201can obscenity\u201d. The debt-laden business is at the centre of a tense standoff between lenders and key shareholders that will determine the future of the company, which employs 45,000 people in the UK. Interserve, based in Reading, has thousands of government contracts. It is the largest provider of probation and offender rehabilitation services in England and Wales, and has contracts that range from hospital cleaning and school meals provision to maintaining military bases in the Falklands. Two months ago the Labour party called for a temporary ban on the firm bidding for public contracts amid mounting concern it was facing a Carillion-style collapse. Interserve shares, which traded at 685p five years ago, are now changing hands at 13.5p. Under the terms of a financial restructuring proposal, details of which are due to be published on Monday, lenders including hedge funds and the HSBC, RBS and BNP Paribas banks were expected to swap \u00a3480m of debt in exchange for all but 2.5% of the company\u2019s shares. The hedge funds Coltrane and Farringdon, which own about 34% of the firm, were expected to vote against the debt-for-equity swap, which would massively dilute their stakes. Their combined holdings are potentially sufficient to kill off the deal, which needs 50% support, depending on turnout and how other investors vote. The lenders, according to a report by Sky News, may be prepared to revise the plan to give shareholders up to 5% of the business. But the Guardian has obtained a counter-proposal sent by Coltrane to Interserve today. Coltrane\u2019s plan would hand only 65% of the company to creditors in exchange for \u00a3436m of debt, leaving shareholders with an improved 10% of the equity, plus the opportunity to participate in a 25% rights issue worth \u00a375m. Coltrane would underwrite the rights issue. According to the document containing the proposal, this would \u201creduce risk of further attempts by creditors to seize assets\u201d. The firm\u2019s net debt would be \u00a3243m, compared to \u00a3275m under lenders\u2019 proposals. A source close to Coltrane said: \u201cThe company is proposing to double the money of its hedge fund creditors whilst wiping out shareholders. This proposal stops that obscenity and brings borrowings below what the company has suggested with new money.\u201d Interserve said it was considering the proposal and was committed to a consensual solution. Another senior source familiar with discussionssaid a team led by EY\u2019s Hunter Kelly, who worked on the House of Fraser pre-pack administration, has been earmarked to reprise the role as a backup plan in case a deal cannot be reached. The lenders could then cite a missed \u00a367m debt repayment that fell due in February as a default trigger event, justifying a pre-pack administration \u2013 where a new owner is lined up to take control of the business immediately after it collapses.

The Kraft Heinz chief financial officer David Knopf said on Thursday the company was considering selling some brands that have \u201cno clear path to competitive advantage\u201d. Doing so could position Kraft Heinz to merge with another food-maker, Knopf said. On Friday, Kraft shares were trading at about $36.30, far below a 52-week low of $41.60 set in late December. Overall, the stock has fallen nearly 29% over the past year. Kraft Heinz said the impairment charge was related primarily to its US refrigerated foods and Canadian retail divisions, as well as trademarks for its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands. Kraft Heinz management, which said the company was cooperating fully with the SEC, claimed to be making progress reforming its product lines and taking the right strategic steps. But analysts have largely declined to put an optimistic spin on the company\u2019s prospects. \u201cWith respect to the depth, duration and general pro\ufb01tability e\ufb00ects \u2026 customer- and consumer-building into 2019 is less clear and lowers our conviction on the name,\u201d analyst Rob Dickerson said in a research note.",

      "bodyText": "Racecourses should do more to counter illegal drug use and fighting, according to on-course bookmakers who are well placed to witness bad behaviour among the crowds at British tracks. The Guardian spoke to several bookmakers this week in the aftermath of a nasty incident at Haydock last Saturday, when a mother and child found themselves surrounded by men throwing punches at each other. \u201cThe general consensus from bookmakers is that it is a drug issue. It is not alcohol,\u201d said Adam Swann, who, in common with most bookmakers, takes bets at several tracks. He was at Haydock on Saturday. \u201cRemember we are dealing with these people and we can tell if someone is a bit wired or not. I found a nearly empty bag of some substance behind my joint at York. One bookmaker found a bag in front of his joint at Aintree. They are just two examples out of many.\u201d Another bookmaker, Andy Geraghty, said: \u201cI have witnessed, first-hand, men snorting cocaine in front of my pitch on the racecourse. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\u201d A third bookmaker, James Lovell, said: \u201cI am hugely concerned about drug use at the races but it goes hand in hand with alcohol consumption for a large part of today\u2019s society and isn\u2019t a problem confined to racecourses. Whether it is indirectly and unwittingly encouraged by the racecourses\u2019 model of club DJs [to entertain after racing] as well as their desire to drive profits through alcohol consumption is another matter.\u201d That message was echoed by another bookmaker, based in the north, who asked to remain anonymous. He spoke of the risks that tracks run in seeking to attract \u201cpeople with little interest in racing but are going to spend money on alcohol. This coupled with cocaine leads to trouble.\u201d The Racecourse Association acknowledges that \u201cthe presence of illegal substances is a trend which continues to rise across all major spectator events\u201d but insisted racecourses were being robust in applying a \u201czero-tolerance approach\u201d. Sniffer dogs and amnesty boxes have been regular sights at busier fixtures in the past year. According to the bookmakers, these measures have been insufficient to keep drugs out of racecourses and more intervention is needed.

Before that, he was knee-deep in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/29/antony-beevor-the-greatest-war-movie-ever-and-the-ones-i-cant-bear\">Antony Beevor</a> as prep for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/18/the-aftermath-review-keira-knightley-alexander-skarsgard-jason-clarke\">The Aftermath</a>, a tragic romance set in Hamburg just after the second world war. He was particularly shocked by the Red Army\u2019s treatment of German women and girls, some of whom were raped \u201cnot just five or 10 times but 50 or 60 times,\u201d he reports. \u201cHoly moly. My <em>God</em>, the Germans suffered. But it\u2019s not talked about.\u201d</p> <p>The Aftermath aims to give it airtime, while foregrounding the story of two Brits \u2013 Lewis (Clarke), a soft-spoken colonel, and Rachael (Knightley) \u2013 who move into the mansion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/11/alexander-skarsgard-hollywood-is-very-silly-people-are-so-anxious\">Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd</a>\u2019s ominously hot German architect.</p> <p>Clarke was curveball casting for Lewis, concedes director James Kent. But he liked his \u201cprimal, peaceful realism\u201d and his \u201cprobably Australian quality of pure, uncluttered, unfussy truth. Lewis has been battered and bruised by five years of conflict,\u201d he says, \u201cturned into something rougher and tougher and dehumanised.

Especially the erotica \u2013 or, for his character, the lack of it. \u201cLewis is frightened,\u201d he says. \u201cI think a lot of these men were. The power of intimacy when you haven\u2019t had it. He\u2019s confident with a lot of other things but with his wife he\u2019s terrified. I love the way they showed that sexuality.\u201d</p> <p>For Knightley, the film is an exploration of \u201cthe way men and women communicate and grieve\u201d. She believes there\u2019s a key difference: women need to speak about the dead, while \u201cmen need to put their emotions into work\u201d.</p> <p>Clarke disagrees. \u201cIf we both watched somebody blown to bits, the trauma and empathy and fear and anger is going to be pretty shared.\u201d He looks pragmatic. Would he be a fighter? Of course, he says, though engagement today is \u201ca lot more complicated than it was during world war two, when there was a moral certitude\u201d.</p> <p>A dose of transparency is what Britain today needs, he thinks. America \u2013 where he now lives with his wife and their two children \u2013 may be shaky, but \u201cit\u2019s all coming out. A lot of it\u2019s tough and horrible but the debate is open, and the whole world comments. More so than on their own country.\u201d</p> <p>Snobbery? \u201cOf course. It\u2019s easy to point at a bad guy over there.\u201d Clarke loves his adopted homeland, calls it \u201ca problem-solving country\u201d to whom we owe an enduring debt. \u201cEurope has a big responsibility for war,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd a propensity for it, too.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke often plays if not actual soldiers then part of a quasi-military squad on a real-life mission: up the north face in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/02/everest-review-star-studded-adventure-proves-a-difficult-summit\">Everest</a>, to the moon in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/29/first-man-review-ryan-gosling-shoots-for-the-moon-in-neil-armstrong-biopic\">First Man</a>, round Afghanistan in search of Osama Bin Laden in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/zero-dark-thirty-review\">Zero Dark Thirty</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a highly intelligent alpha male,\u201d says Kent. \u201cIf you were on a mountain, he\u2019d really know which ropes to use.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34c9c780c4c72cbdb7d0ae7a1124c7ff7a2b0f47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34c9c780c4c72cbdb7d0ae7a1124c7ff7a2b0f47/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Clarke in Serenity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-awareness \u2026 Jason Clarke in Serenity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Bartholomew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it\u2019s this hearty machismo which makes it curious that in both The Aftermath and Clarke\u2019s other film out on Friday, he\u2019s the third wheel: a lumpen gooseberry in big steamy pudding. But unlike The Aftermath, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbrOMrjhyvI\">Serenity</a> is no credit to Clarke\u2019s \u2013 or anyone else\u2019s \u2013 CV. He plays Frank, a moneybags criminal who abuses his wife (Anne Hathaway), beats her son and still finds the energy to visit dockside child prostitutes. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking head up there tonight and grab myself some of that $10 ass,\u201d he informs Matthew McConaughey\u2019s usually-nude tuna fisherman.</p> <p>Reviewers have detected a self-awareness in Clarke\u2019s performance absent from the rest of this appalling trash, but it\u2019s still an odd choice for a project, however much he wants \u201ca pay cheque and an exciting life\u201d (Serenity was shot in Mauritius). </p> <p>Can some films feel thin, once you\u2019ve been gorging on the Romanoffs? He nods: especially if there\u2019s a lot of greenscreen. \u201cAll of a sudden you lose your confidence, if you\u2019ve got to talk to a bit of a string with a red dot on it for 10 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>The most CGI Clarke encountered was on what should have been his blockbuster breakthrough: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/terminator-genisys-review-arnies-back-in-a-cynical-franchisebot\">Terminator Genisys</a>. But rather than rebooting the franchise, the film essentially ended it. Scan back through Clarke\u2019s career and he starts seeming a bit unlucky. Projects that looked like Oscar dead certs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/29/first-man-review-ryan-gosling-shoots-for-the-moon-in-neil-armstrong-biopic\">First Man</a>, Everest, his Ted Kennedy film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/11/chappaquiddick-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff\">Chappaquiddick</a> \u2013 all failed to launch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1d22ce7b4a6a4b6dd207e88378029a5fadccacc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1d22ce7b4a6a4b6dd207e88378029a5fadccacc/372_116_2882_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarke at the world premiere of The Aftermath in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018And you\u2019re concerned about America?\u2019 \u2026 Clarke at the world premiere of The Aftermath in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vickie Flores/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plus, says Kent, he\u2019s different in all of them: a character actor who looks like a lead. \u201cHe gravitates to range. Maybe the public don\u2019t have an easy grasp of who he is in the same way they might with someone who slightly repeats roles.\u201d For instance, \u201cI think it\u2019s clear what Benedict Cumberbatch is. He\u2019s clearly somebody who plays offbeat outsiders, highly intelligent in a sort of Sherlocky way. Obviously he has much more range than that; but with The Imitation Game and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/brexit-the-uncivil-war-review-superficial-irresponsible-tv-cumberbatch\">Dominic Cummings</a>, there\u2019s a sort of pattern there.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke has little interest in such issues. He wants to know what the hell we\u2019re playing at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">leaving the EU</a>. \u201cLondon has been the capital of the world, more so than New York, for much of my lifetime.\u201d What he\u2019s seeing in the city today, he says, is \u201cpretty scary for everybody on a deeply ethical level about what democracy is\u201d.</p> <p>I jibber that the debate was full of confusion and obfuscation. That many leavers may have been more concerned about immigration than Brussels. \u201cThat\u2019s just weird,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019re going in for brain surgery when actually what you\u2019ve got is a bad ankle. Now what looked like a pothole has turned into the Grand Canyon. And you\u2019re concerned about <em>America</em>?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Aftermath and Serenity are out on 1 March</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2019. An earlier version included a reference saying that \u201c70% of German women were raped by the Red Army\u201d. That was said by Jason Clarke in error, and has been removed.</p>",

Before that, he was knee-deep in Antony Beevor as prep for The Aftermath, a tragic romance set in Hamburg just after the second world war. He was particularly shocked by the Red Army\u2019s treatment of German women and girls, some of whom were raped \u201cnot just five or 10 times but 50 or 60 times,\u201d he reports. \u201cHoly moly. My God, the Germans suffered. But it\u2019s not talked about.\u201d The Aftermath aims to give it airtime, while foregrounding the story of two Brits \u2013 Lewis (Clarke), a soft-spoken colonel, and Rachael (Knightley) \u2013 who move into the mansion of Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s ominously hot German architect. Clarke was curveball casting for Lewis, concedes director James Kent. But he liked his \u201cprimal, peaceful realism\u201d and his \u201cprobably Australian quality of pure, uncluttered, unfussy truth. Lewis has been battered and bruised by five years of conflict,\u201d he says, \u201cturned into something rougher and tougher and dehumanised. Jason loved all that.\u201d He did, Clarke confirms. Especially the erotica \u2013 or, for his character, the lack of it. \u201cLewis is frightened,\u201d he says. \u201cI think a lot of these men were. The power of intimacy when you haven\u2019t had it. He\u2019s confident with a lot of other things but with his wife he\u2019s terrified. I love the way they showed that sexuality.\u201d For Knightley, the film is an exploration of \u201cthe way men and women communicate and grieve\u201d. She believes there\u2019s a key difference: women need to speak about the dead, while \u201cmen need to put their emotions into work\u201d. Clarke disagrees. \u201cIf we both watched somebody blown to bits, the trauma and empathy and fear and anger is going to be pretty shared.\u201d He looks pragmatic. Would he be a fighter? Of course, he says, though engagement today is \u201ca lot more complicated than it was during world war two, when there was a moral certitude\u201d. A dose of transparency is what Britain today needs, he thinks. America \u2013 where he now lives with his wife and their two children \u2013 may be shaky, but \u201cit\u2019s all coming out. A lot of it\u2019s tough and horrible but the debate is open, and the whole world comments. More so than on their own country.\u201d Snobbery? \u201cOf course. It\u2019s easy to point at a bad guy over there.\u201d Clarke loves his adopted homeland, calls it \u201ca problem-solving country\u201d to whom we owe an enduring debt. \u201cEurope has a big responsibility for war,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd a propensity for it, too.\u201d Clarke often plays if not actual soldiers then part of a quasi-military squad on a real-life mission: up the north face in Everest, to the moon in First Man, round Afghanistan in search of Osama Bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty. \u201cHe\u2019s a highly intelligent alpha male,\u201d says Kent. \u201cIf you were on a mountain, he\u2019d really know which ropes to use.\u201d And it\u2019s this hearty machismo which makes it curious that in both The Aftermath and Clarke\u2019s other film out on Friday, he\u2019s the third wheel: a lumpen gooseberry in big steamy pudding. But unlike The Aftermath, Serenity is no credit to Clarke\u2019s \u2013 or anyone else\u2019s \u2013 CV. He plays Frank, a moneybags criminal who abuses his wife (Anne Hathaway), beats her son and still finds the energy to visit dockside child prostitutes. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking head up there tonight and grab myself some of that $10 ass,\u201d he informs Matthew McConaughey\u2019s usually-nude tuna fisherman. Reviewers have detected a self-awareness in Clarke\u2019s performance absent from the rest of this appalling trash, but it\u2019s still an odd choice for a project, however much he wants \u201ca pay cheque and an exciting life\u201d (Serenity was shot in Mauritius). Can some films feel thin, once you\u2019ve been gorging on the Romanoffs? He nods: especially if there\u2019s a lot of greenscreen. \u201cAll of a sudden you lose your confidence, if you\u2019ve got to talk to a bit of a string with a red dot on it for 10 minutes.\u201d The most CGI Clarke encountered was on what should have been his blockbuster breakthrough: Terminator Genisys. But rather than rebooting the franchise, the film essentially ended it. Scan back through Clarke\u2019s career and he starts seeming a bit unlucky. Projects that looked like Oscar dead certs \u2013 First Man, Everest, his Ted Kennedy film, Chappaquiddick \u2013 all failed to launch. Plus, says Kent, he\u2019s different in all of them: a character actor who looks like a lead. \u201cHe gravitates to range. Maybe the public don\u2019t have an easy grasp of who he is in the same way they might with someone who slightly repeats roles.\u201d For instance, \u201cI think it\u2019s clear what Benedict Cumberbatch is. He\u2019s clearly somebody who plays offbeat outsiders, highly intelligent in a sort of Sherlocky way. Obviously he has much more range than that; but with The Imitation Game and Dominic Cummings, there\u2019s a sort of pattern there.\u201d Clarke has little interest in such issues. He wants to know what the hell we\u2019re playing at leaving the EU. \u201cLondon has been the capital of the world, more so than New York, for much of my lifetime.\u201d What he\u2019s seeing in the city today, he says, is \u201cpretty scary for everybody on a deeply ethical level about what democracy is\u201d. I jibber that the debate was full of confusion and obfuscation. That many leavers may have been more concerned about immigration than Brussels. \u201cThat\u2019s just weird,\u201d he scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019re going in for brain surgery when actually what you\u2019ve got is a bad ankle. Now what looked like a pothole has turned into the Grand Canyon. And you\u2019re concerned about America?\u201d \u2022 The Aftermath and Serenity are out on 1 March \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2019. An earlier version included a reference saying that \u201c70% of German women were raped by the Red Army\u201d. That was said by Jason Clarke in error, and has been removed.",

When I joined Ford Motor Company straight from Oxford in 1964, the company employed around 60,000 in the UK and was investing in becoming the leader in commercial vehicle sales, with a new design centre at Dunton in Essex. Now it employs fewer than 6,000 directly, and the world-beating Fiesta is made in Spain and the Transit van in Turkey. The truck division where I worked was sold to Iveco, based in Italy, and the old plant went to India.</p> <p>European doubts about the reliability and quality of British products made it hard to break into European markets, while the UK lost out in the Commonwealth to Japanese firms that produced what the market wanted. There is little future in simply assembling products that are designed and specified elsewhere.</p> <p>Contrast that with Germany, where the major companies such as Mercedes and BMW have a network of suppliers close at hand, and the main manufacturers benefit from government-funded research and local authority-funded premises. Without the spirit of partnership and technical excellence that underlies Germany\u2019s resurgence, it is hard to see how the UK, as an isolated island, could ever reach the standards our politicians claim to want.</p> <p>Surely, we must use the current crises to rebuild our local economies, by making the most of the few treasures we have left, such as BMW in Oxford and Jaguar near Birmingham, and not chasing dreams?<br><strong>Dr Nicholas Falk</strong><br><em>Executive director, the Urbed Trust</em></p> <p>\u2022 We\u2019ve had many responses to Honda\u2019s announcement that it is to close its Swindon plant \u2013 sadness, dismay, anger and regret. All of these are understandable; it\u2019s a massive blow to the town and surrounding area. What\u2019s not understandable \u2013 and indicative of the depths to which our politics have sunk \u2013 is the desperate logic of arch-Brexiters like the ERG\u2019s Steve Baker almost glorying in the fact that Honda\u2019s official line is that the decision has nothing to do with Brexit and is down to \u201cglobal trends\u201d. A matter of tact over fact, some might say.</p> <p>However, \u201cglobal trends\u201d is still an indictment of Brexit by default; after all, it\u2019s the Steve Bakers of this world who are championing Britain\u2019s ability to thrive on the global stage, unchained from the burdensome EU. If this is a foretaste of how attractive we are as an investment location for firms looking to develop in the future, it doesn\u2019t bode well. Or are we to seriously believe that Brexit is an endeavour so special, noble and pure, it is both connected yet unconnected to the economic challenges of our changing world. The buck, in every sense, must stop somewhere. <br><strong>Colin Montgomery</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Honda announces it will leave Swindon in 2021, which is two years away; whereas Brexit is supposed to be five weeks away (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/fanciful-to-say-honda-didnt-consider-brexit-when-closing-swindon-sir-david-warren\" title=\"\">\u2018Fanciful\u2019 to say Honda didn\u2019t consider Brexit when closing Swindon</a>, 20 February).

      "bodyText": "Your editorial (20 February) and report with map of the remaining British car plants (\u2018Body blow\u2019 as Honda shuts plant in Swindon, 19 February) raises the question of what Britain should do for a good living. When I joined Ford Motor Company straight from Oxford in 1964, the company employed around 60,000 in the UK and was investing in becoming the leader in commercial vehicle sales, with a new design centre at Dunton in Essex. Now it employs fewer than 6,000 directly, and the world-beating Fiesta is made in Spain and the Transit van in Turkey. The truck division where I worked was sold to Iveco, based in Italy, and the old plant went to India. European doubts about the reliability and quality of British products made it hard to break into European markets, while the UK lost out in the Commonwealth to Japanese firms that produced what the market wanted. There is little future in simply assembling products that are designed and specified elsewhere. Contrast that with Germany, where the major companies such as Mercedes and BMW have a network of suppliers close at hand, and the main manufacturers benefit from government-funded research and local authority-funded premises. Without the spirit of partnership and technical excellence that underlies Germany\u2019s resurgence, it is hard to see how the UK, as an isolated island, could ever reach the standards our politicians claim to want. Surely, we must use the current crises to rebuild our local economies, by making the most of the few treasures we have left, such as BMW in Oxford and Jaguar near Birmingham, and not chasing dreams? Dr Nicholas Falk Executive director, the Urbed Trust \u2022 We\u2019ve had many responses to Honda\u2019s announcement that it is to close its Swindon plant \u2013 sadness, dismay, anger and regret. All of these are understandable; it\u2019s a massive blow to the town and surrounding area. What\u2019s not understandable \u2013 and indicative of the depths to which our politics have sunk \u2013 is the desperate logic of arch-Brexiters like the ERG\u2019s Steve Baker almost glorying in the fact that Honda\u2019s official line is that the decision has nothing to do with Brexit and is down to \u201cglobal trends\u201d. A matter of tact over fact, some might say. However, \u201cglobal trends\u201d is still an indictment of Brexit by default; after all, it\u2019s the Steve Bakers of this world who are championing Britain\u2019s ability to thrive on the global stage, unchained from the burdensome EU. If this is a foretaste of how attractive we are as an investment location for firms looking to develop in the future, it doesn\u2019t bode well. Or are we to seriously believe that Brexit is an endeavour so special, noble and pure, it is both connected yet unconnected to the economic challenges of our changing world. The buck, in every sense, must stop somewhere. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh \u2022 Honda announces it will leave Swindon in 2021, which is two years away; whereas Brexit is supposed to be five weeks away (\u2018Fanciful\u2019 to say Honda didn\u2019t consider Brexit when closing Swindon, 20 February). So for the sake of the workers in Swindon, and all other places where industries and investors are planning to leave the UK, and for the 48% who voted remain last time, plus the people who\u2019ve changed their minds, let\u2019s have a people\u2019s vote immediately. Time for Corbyn to step up and for Labour to honour its pledges. If there is then a clear majority to remain in the EU, we might stop destroying our nation and persuade Honda and others to stay. When voters ticked leave or remain in 2016, I don\u2019t suppose they thought \u201cleave\u201d might mean this at all.

He and his ilk alternatively want to tie nation states, and the EU, into international agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the EU-Canada trade agreement, which destroy national sovereignty by putting secretive corporation v nation state tribunals above national courts and the European court of justice. The motive is hardly secret: the unfettered reign of capitalist greed. Greg Brooks Sheffield \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de\u2019s reference to John Bolton\u2019s 2000 writings may not be familiar to today\u2019s readers. He was an architect of the 2000 report from the Project for the New American Century, Rebuilding America\u2019s Defenses. The project\u2019s stated aim was to ensure the continuing pre-eminence of US military power, even to the extent of creating a US space force to control space and cyberspace. That is the interest Bolton still sees as threatened by the EU. He never gives up. Lawrence Phillips Emeritus professor of decision sciences, London School of Economics \u2022 Mike Pence appears to have carefully chosen his words of praise for Donald Trump (Pence hails \u2018remarkable\u2019, \u2018extraordinary\u2019 Trump tenure in attack on US allies, theguardian.com, 16 February). The Oxford English Dictionary defines remarkable as \u201cworthy of attention\u201d and extraordinary as \u201cvery unusual\u201d. Pence was remarkably perspicacious. Everyone from Vladimir Putin to Nancy Pelosi could endorse his assessment of Trump\u2019s tenure. And even his boss wouldn\u2019t quibble.

As fate would have it, Segale walked into the room and into video game history. The mustachioed carpenter (he was only later employed as a plumber) got his name, and he has been stomping Goombas and racing go-karts ever since.

      "bodyText": "Last year, Mario died. The real Mario \u2013 the man after whom the character was named. Mario Segale was a real estate developer who rented space to Nintendo of America, headquartered in Seattle. The story goes that one day, a team at Nintendo was trying to figure out names for characters in Donkey Kong \u2013 including a certain small man wearing a red hat. As fate would have it, Segale walked into the room and into video game history. The mustachioed carpenter (he was only later employed as a plumber) got his name, and he has been stomping Goombas and racing go-karts ever since. While the character has acquired countless extra lives, Segale died last year at 84. And it seems he may have been the last thing standing in the way of dark times at Nintendo. Mere months after Mario\u2019s death, an ominous figure has come to power in Seattle. Yesterday, Nintendo of America\u2019s beloved boss, Reggie Fils-Aime, stepped down, to be replaced by a man named Bowser. As in Bowser, AKA King Koopa, Mario\u2019s nemesis: the fire-breathing dragon lizard thing constantly kidnapping Princess Peach (nee Toadstool; her English name has fluctuated over the years). He joins a slew of aptly named executives in the corporate world, including Zoe Hamburger, a marketing director at McDonald\u2019s, and the energy and sustainability manager at Tata Steel, Barry Rust. Laugh all you want, but to Nintendo fans, this is no joke. They quickly pointed out a disturbing photo on Twitter. The new president, Doug Bowser, had introduced himself to the world with a photo apparently taken in his office \u2013 in front of stuffed Mario and Luigi dolls who had been tied up like hostages. It\u2019s like if someone named Dave Vader took over Lucasfilm while waving Luke Skywalker\u2019s severed hand, or if Disney\u2019s next CEO were named Ursula \u201cthe Scar\u201d Jafar and tweeted a picture of Simba being trampled by wildebeests. But is it coincidence, or conspiracy? Before Bowser joined Nintendo, he was at the rival Electronic Arts, so he has every reason to want to take Nintendo down. Indeed, in the press release announcing his hiring, methinks he doth protest too much about not being evil. It specifically states that he is \u201cno relation to the King Koopa and Mario\u2019s longtime nemesis\u201d and tries to comfort gamers by saying he \u201cbrings decades of experience, not fire breath, to new role\u201d. It also claims he will play \u201ca key role in driving national sales strategies to generate demand and achieve revenue objectives across all of Nintendo\u2019s product lines\u201d, which sounds exactly like something King Koopa would do. With Mario\u2019s passing last year, what can be done to save Nintendo?

      "bodyText": "Richard E Grant\u2019s joyous Oscar campaign of celebrity selfies and exuberant videos has won over fans and PR experts alike \u2013 but is he a genuine ingenue or a crafty campaigner? The experts in the political machinations of the Academy Awards cannot quite decide. From the instant Grant was nominated for best supporting actor as the rogue Jack in Can You Ever Forgive Me?, he has transported social media followers on an excitable journey through Hollywood luncheons, industry awards ceremonies, and chat-show sofas, capturing it all in wide-eyed tweets and, sometimes, blurry photos. For an actor of three decades, with almost 100 films under his belt, Grant has, observed Esquire\u2019s Olivia Ovenden, been \u201crunning around like an unabashed golden ticket winner\u201d. So wide-eyed has this longstanding star\u2019s performance been that some have even asked if, in fact, it is simply the work of a wily old pro who knows exactly how to appeal to the Academy\u2019s love of a good Hollywood story. Charles Gant, the features editor at Screen International, admits he has never seen such a campaign \u201cthat has been so seemingly from an outsider and one so starstruck.\u201d But he sees Grant\u2019s joy as heartfelt \u2013 even if it has also been rather useful. \u201cI think it may have started off as his own exuberance. And, then, as people responded to it, he may have been encouraged down that path,\u201d he said. Grant\u2019s breathless video on Twitter outside his old apartment in Notting Hill, west London, harking back to where it all began, has been watched more than 3.5 million times. A tweeted photo of himself outside Barbra Streisand\u2019s home alongside a letter he had sent her when he was 14, received a response from the singer herself. Other videos and selfies have shown him starry-eyed and rubbing shoulders with celebrities Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Lady Gaga, Emily Blunt, Melissa McCarthy, to name but a few \u2013 \u201clike being granted temporary membership to the A-list fame club\u201d, he has enthused. For an Oscar campaign Grant has broken all the rules, says Charles McDonald, a film publicist. \u201cThat is the beauty of what he has done. He comes across as incredibly, unfashionably enthusiastic. He\u2019s embraced it. And I think people have been caught up with the joy of what he has been experiencing. \u201cWhether that has persuaded lots of members to vote for him, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, adding that \u2013 \u201ccall me naive\u201d \u2013 he did not believe it was a deliberate ploy. Actors never know how to handle awards attention \u201cbecause they don\u2019t want to appear to be wanting to win too much, and they want to maintain a slightly dignified position,\u201d McDonald said.

At least I am taking about the English players. Maybe there are other foreign players in big teams that are also playing well, like Fernandinho, but I repeat we are just starting to see what will be with Declan in the future. </p> <p>He is improving in a lot of different things in that position. Maybe he must improve more and have a better view of the pitch but he has such good technique that he never misses a pass. He is always keeping his position in the correct moment so as young player he will always be learning more things, but at this moment I think he is a complete player.</p> <p>It is difficult to compare different players in 20 years of management but Declan is a very good player. I worked with so many young players. I started with Javier Mascherano when he was 17 and he was similar to Declan in his mentality. The mentality when they are 17 or 19... it seemed they had the mentality of a 35-year-old. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da4e4809b2ac7fe9b1bce79139a397b7b9f61afe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da4e4809b2ac7fe9b1bce79139a397b7b9f61afe/0_40_3226_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Declan Rice and Ryan Fredericks in training this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Declan Rice (left) and Ryan Fredericks in training this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arfa Griffiths/West Ham United via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6ff080e4b0cc09362e143d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-22T13:00:47.760Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>David\u2019s not happy so I better oblige</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davethecabby49/status/1098927927289413633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/piercy360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@piercy360</a> So?

It\u2019s clearly far more crucial to Fulham in the context of their season.

Martin Dubravka has been having a bit of a difficult time for Newcastle of late with errors at Wolves and Tottenham which, if we were being particularly harsh and binary, have cost his side three points. The Slovakian is unlikely to be dropped for tomorrow\u2019s game against Huddersfield, though, and has Rafa Ben\u00edtez in his corner, as the manager explains ... After the Tottenham game, I was in contact with him and I was supporting him 100 per cent. After, still it\u2019s the same idea. He\u2019s a great keeper, he\u2019s a very good professional, and then every player in every position \u2013 like every manager \u2013 can make mistakes and it\u2019s how we react, the key. He is training harder, if it\u2019s possible, and he is fine. Here\u2019s your Burnley v Tottenham match preview. Maybe hold fire on drafting Harry Kane into your Fantasy Football team ... Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has an update on the fitness of Callum Wilson and David Brooks, and it\u2019s not wholly positive. Wilson has been absent for the last month with a knee problem, while Brooks has missed the last two games due to an ankle injury; 16 goals and nine assists between them. The Cherries have lost their last two games and host Wolves tomorrow at the Vitality Stadium. They\u2019re improving quickly. But this game has come too quickly for them, it\u2019s very difficult to know when they will return. We haven\u2019t seen them in training yet or on the grass yet so they\u2019re still a way away. ALMIR\u00d3N TO START FOR NEWCASTLE (probably)! Proper journalist David Conn is doing some proper good work here ... The intended Claudio Ranieri bump hasn\u2019t really happened for Fulham, and although his record in the Premier League \u2013 W3 D3 L8 \u2013 is marginally better than his predecessor Slavisa Jokanovic \u2013 W1 D2 L9 \u2013 in terms of win percentage across all competitions, it\u2019s exactly the same (20%). The Fulham fans are starting to turn a bit on the loveable Italian which means these quotes may not be viewed as good news, in terms of looking ahead to what increasingly appears a return to the Championship ... Look this question was a long time ago and I said if the chairman is happy, I am happy to stay. I used to work also in the Championship. I won the Championship in Italy, in France. I am ready to fight with the club, I love this club because it is a very, very good club. I am here if the owner wants me, I am ready. Neymar isn\u2019t a happy boy. Not because he remains out injured for Paris Saint-Germain but because he was surprisingly omitted from the top 10 of a Brasil ESPN poll to find the best Brazilian footballer post-Pele. \u201cThis business of naming the best Brazilian player post-Pele makes no sense to me,\u201d Neymar told DAZN. Here was the top 10, with 160,000 votes cast. Some fairly decent players in there: 1. Ronaldo 2. Ronaldinho 3. Rom\u00e1rio 4. Zico 5. Rivaldo 6. S\u00f3crates 7. Kak\u00e1 8. Cafu/Bebeto/Roberto Carlos 9. Falc\u00e3o 10. Careca Proof that Southampton manager Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl is firmly into the swing of things in terms of English football culture. His target for survival? That magic 40 points! With no FA Cup, Saints have spent the last week or so in Tenerife. They play Arsenal on Sunday. We have taken a lot of points until now but it\u2019s the same amount of points we need until the end of the season because we will maybe need 40 points this year to stay in the league. We all know 24 is not enough. Therefore it was important (for the players) to get a reminder and speak about things we have improved in our game and things that can be better in the future for all the different challenges we will face over the next few weeks against top teams or teams in our zone. We have shown we can take points against the big teams but also lose points against the small teams. It\u2019s important for the end of the season we have a plan for every game and that\u2019s what we tried to prepare in this week. Some previous Pep Guardiola jumper/knitwear highlights. He wears them well ... And great to see Glenn Hoddle looking well ... And just on that game below, as mentioned, Roy Hodgson will overtake Sir Bobby Robson to become the Premier League\u2019s oldest manager, at the age of 71 years and 199 days old. His inspiration? Why, Sir David Attenborough, of course. When you watch Sir David Attenborough working and see his documentaries on TV, you\u2019d have to be a very strange person to start saying \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very good because he\u2019s old\u2019. Most of us think he\u2019s very, very good, whatever age he happens to be. He was good when he first started doing them and he\u2019s still good today. That gives me the encouragement in football; why should it be any different to TV broadcasting, or documentary-making? Even people like Sir Bobby and Sir Alex, who started relatively young, were a little bit older than me when they started their careers. But it\u2019s an achievement I can be happy about - if you call getting old and still being in a job an achievement. I still very much enjoy this work, my day-to-day life - I\u2019m always looking forward to the next game - so it\u2019s nice to still be in a job like this at this high level. Vardy IN! Wan-Bissaka OUT! Get your Leicester v Palace preview here ... Jacob Steinberg has been speaking to the slow-burning success story that is Leander Dendoncker Chelsea could go Dutch again with an interim coach ... and it\u2019s not Guus In case you didn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t until this copy dropped on the newswires, Mohamed Salah is one goal away from scoring 49 in the league for Liverpool. Sunday will be his 63rd appearance in the top-flight for the club, meaning he has nine games to beat Fernando Torres\u2019 record of reaching 50 league goals for the Reds. Fernando Torres (2009) \u2013 72 matches Sam Raybould (1902) \u2013 80 matches Albert Stubbins (1949) \u2013 80 matches Roger Hunt (1961) \u2013 81 matches Jack Parkinson (1909) \u2013 83 matches John Aldridge (1989) \u2013 83 matches Thank you, Jacob.

On Sky Sports News, they\u2019ve just shown footage of some people having a tour of Old Trafford. Good, good. A classy touch. It\u2019s Friday afternoon. Squad sheet time! Here\u2019s Andy Hunter with the latest from Jurgen Klopp. Rafa Benitez was asked about his Newcastle future before tomorrow\u2019s home game against Huddersfield. \u201cThe priority is to stay up and focus on the team. If we have any conversations I\u2019m sure you will get the information. It\u2019s not the priority - the priority is Huddersfield and getting the points to stay up.\u201d Pep Guardiola says he does not know if John Stones, Benjamin Mendy and Gabriel Jesus will be fit for the final against Chelsea. City are training tomorrow. Pep, City beat Chelsea 6-0 last week. \u201cIn that moment I was so happy.\u201d Sweater watch: yellow Stone Island. Pep continues by dismissing a question about Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban. This is gold, people. Pep Guardiola calls Chelsea \u201ca top side\u201d. He keeps a straight face. Thanks, James. Off to Manchester... And with Pep Guardiola about to be peppered with tedious VAR-related questions, I shall bid farewell and pass you back to Jacob Steinberg. Danke. And some words from Gordon Taylor, via the Press Association In the light of recent media interest I wish to clarify the situation with regard to the proposed Independent Review of the PFA. On November 21st, I, as chief executive, informed my members that we would be recommending to the PFA Board of Trustees and the Management Committee that an independent QC conducts a full and open review into the structure and operation of the PFA as the trade union for professional footballers in England and Wales. Since that time there have been numerous meetings to organise the review and finalise the parameters and timeline. A decision has been made by the Trustees and the Management Committee to appoint Sport Resolutions as the appropriate body to conduct the review. Sport Resolutions are in the process of constituting the panel that will conduct the review and will finalise the Terms of Reference and scope of the review. Some sort-of news from PFA Towers with Chief Suit Gordon Taylor confirming a review of the organisation will be conducted by Sport Resolutions, whose previous work can be looked at here, and they will report back \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable\u201d (whatever that means). The review was first announced by Taylor in November following calls from the union\u2019s chairman Ben Purkiss to reform the organisation. As for Cardiff v Watford, back-to-back wins has the Bluebirds out of the bottom three and looking upwards for the first time this season. Another victory tonight will create some daylight on the bottom three and the good news they take on Watford without Jose Holebas aka the most creative left-back in the Premier League not called Andy Robertson or Lucas Digne. The Hornets have been beaten just once this year (2-1 at Spurs) are in a head-to-head battle with Wolves to finish seventh, which sounds kind of rubbish but really isn\u2019t, especially when you consider the investment made by Everton and West Ham last summer. Javi Gracia has done one hell of a job and they remain the best, least-talked about club in Europe. Pellegrini has also been talking up Declan Rice who the Chilean now rates as the best English holding midfielder in the country, ahead of Eric Dier and Jordan Henderson. The West Ham manager also compared him to Javier Mascherano I think we are just starting the development of him as a player, but at this moment his performances are better than every holding midfielder. At least I am taking about the English players. Maybe there are other foreign players in big teams that are also playing well, like Fernandinho, but I repeat we are just starting to see what will be with Declan in the future. He is improving in a lot of different things in that position. Maybe he must improve more and have a better view of the pitch but he has such good technique that he never misses a pass. He is always keeping his position in the correct moment so as young player he will always be learning more things, but at this moment I think he is a complete player. It is difficult to compare different players in 20 years of management but Declan is a very good player. I worked with so many young players. I started with Javier Mascherano when he was 17 and he was similar to Declan in his mentality. The mentality when they are 17 or 19... it seemed they had the mentality of a 35-year-old. David\u2019s not happy so I better oblige And, in fairness, there is quite a bit to chew over a game between two teams in pretty poor to diabolical form. It\u2019s clearly far more crucial to Fulham in the context of their season. If they lose, with Cardiff at home to Watford and Newcastle hosting Huddersfield, they could be 11 points from safety by the end of the weekend which then means next weekend\u2019s match against Southampton really is make-or-break. From a West Ham perspective, the Premier League\u2019s second weirdest team after Leicester do have Manuel Lanzini fit and likely to have some involvement, which is nice to see, and is exactly the sort of player who Manuel Pellegrini loves to work with and often gets the best out of. But the Hammers could really do with a win to get some semblance of energy back into a season that is drifting towards the inevitably of 10th place. Some good and bad news from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid today with various reports claiming Jan Oblak (aka THE BEST GOALKEEPER IN THE WORLD DON\u2019T @ ME) is poised to sign a new contract until 2022 while simultaneously telling PSG to do one. His prospective buyout clause of \u20ac150m, however, surely remains tempting to a few of Europe\u2019s elite. But one of the great pillars, quite literally, of Diego Simeone\u2019s side is almost certainly leaving at the end of the season with Diego Godin off to Inter. The Uruguayan colossus is out of contract at the end of the season and Inter general manager Beppe Marotta has told Sky Italia he hopes to make the transfer \u201cofficial\u201d very soon. J\u00fcrgen Klopp doesn\u2019t see anyone else managing Manchester United next season ... Calling all Bournemouth and Wolves\u2019 fans, you can get your match preview here ... Thanks Jacob. Been a busy ol\u2019 news day so far, which means this little nugget from Russia may have escaped attention. The Russian Football Union (RFU) has a new president and for fans of Gazprom! Gazprom! Gazprom! you\u2019ll be delighted to know it\u2019s the chief executive officer of their oil subsidiary Gazprom Neft, Alexander Dyukov. He also served as Zenit St Petersburg (sponsored by Gazprom, stadium called the Gazprom Stadium) president from 2008-2017 so does know a thing or two about football. Dyukov succeeds Vitaly Mutko, who had a bit of baggage. On that note, I\u2019m off to get some lunch. I\u2019ll leave you in the capable hands of James Piercy. Fun fact: former Watford and Milan legend M\u2019Baye Niang plays for Rennes. Chelsea have been drawn against Dynamo Kiev and Arsenal have been drawn against Rennes in the last 16 of the Europa League. The French club are 11th in Ligue 1, but they had a good win over Real Betis last night. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did some talking earlier. Jamie Jackson was there to hear the words fall out of the Norwegian\u2019s mouth. Jurgen Klopp has finished talking to the media. He said that Dejan Lovren and Joe Gomez remain out ahead of the trip to Manchester United, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain isn\u2019t ready yet. At least Virgil Van Dijk will be back after missing the Bayern Munich game through suspension. \u201cAs a Coventry City fan (8th match I attended was the 1987 FA Cup Final and all been downhill from there), I\u2019m now at the stage where I would accept being thrown out of the league if that gave us the opportunity to finally rid ourselves of our owners,\u201d Craig Foster says. \u201cIt surely can\u2019t be a surprise to them that Wasps are unwilling to negotiate with them.\u201d Chelsea have released a statement following today\u2019s news: Chelsea FC has today received a decision from the FIFA Disciplinary Committee concerning alleged breaches of the FIFA Regulations that relate to the international transfer of players under the age of 18. The decision imposes a transfer ban of two consecutive registration periods and a fine of 600k Swiss francs. Chelsea FC categorically refutes the findings of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee and will therefore be appealing the decision. The club wishes to emphasise that it respects the important work undertaken by FIFA in relation to the protection of minors and has fully cooperated with FIFA throughout its investigation. Initially, Chelsea FC was charged under Articles 19.1 and 19.3 in relation to 92 players. We welcome the fact that FIFA has accepted that there was no breach in relation to 63 of these players, but the club is extremely disappointed that FIFA has not accepted the club\u2019s submissions in relation to the remaining 29 players. Chelsea FC acted in accordance with the relevant regulations and will shortly be submitting its appeal to FIFA. Jurgen Klopp has been speaking ahead of Liverpool\u2019s trip to Manchester United. The Liverpool manager has been fined following his comments about referee Kevin Friend following the recent draw with West Ham. The Football Association plan to appeal the \u00a3391,000 fine imposed by Fifa following the investigation into Chelsea\u2019s dealings with regards to foreign players under the age of 18. Here\u2019s a story on Coventry\u2019s perilous stadium situation. A reminder here of just how many Chelsea players are out on loan. You won\u2019t have heard of some. Some, like Joao Rodriguez, aren\u2019t even included on the loan section on Chelsea\u2019s official site. Poor Joao! There are two Premier League matches tonight and they could have a big impact on the battle to stay up. Fulham will be after their first away win of the season when they visit West Ham, who could welcome Manuel Lanzini back from a serious knee injury, and Cardiff City can go four points clear of the bottom three when they host Watford. A Cardiff win seems likelier than one for Fulham, who were utterly useless against Manchester United a fortnight ago. \u201cChelsea has dozens and dozens of players send out on loan,\u201d Lars Bogegaard says. \u201cThey could bring back some of them - and perhaps even play them. This transfer ban actually should mean nothing.\u201d This could be a big chance for Baba Rahman, Michael Hector and Matt Miazga. Coventry City have issued a statement regarding the threat of expulsion from the Football League. They are desperate to do a deal with rugby union club Wasps to ensure they can continue to play at the Ricoh Arena. Coventry City Football Club has received a formal letter from the EFL Board with a final request for clarity regarding where the Club will play home matches in the 2019/20 season. Following receipt of the letter, we felt it was important to make Sky Blues fans and the wider community aware of this letter and the dates outlined in it. Coventry City has until Tuesday 5th March 2019 to provide a further update to the EFL Board. Should a satisfactory solution not be found over the next two months, an Extraordinary General Meeting of EFL Clubs will be convened to consider Coventry City\u2019s expulsion from the English Football League. This meeting would be held on Thursday 25th April \u2013 this is to provide clarity regarding Coventry City\u2019s future membership in advance of relegation and promotion issues being resolved during the run-in to the end of the season. These dates show how stark the situation facing the Football Club now is and that time is running out. Our only option is to continue to play at our home, the Ricoh Arena. Coventry City Football Club wants to do a deal with Wasps Rugby Club as soon as possible, to resolve this impasse so that the dates above are not encountered. All parties now need to work together for good of Coventry City Football Club, its supporters, the Ricoh Arena, the City of Coventry and our community \u2013 the continued future of the Football Club needs to be everyone\u2019s focus to prevent more heartache and worry. No one should be in any doubt of the significance of Coventry City to Coventry \u2013 not in the past, now or in the future. The Westminster meeting in early March called by the Minister of State for Culture, Media and Sport, inviting all of the key parties is an opportunity to resolve this issue. However, our offers to meet with both Coventry City Council, as freehold owner and the democratically elected local authority, and Wasps RFC, as landlord, still remain open - in the hope that a deal can be agreed before the Westminster meeting is necessary. IT REALLY IS ALL HAPPENING TODAY. It\u2019s all happening today. The EFL has sent Coventry City \u201ca final request for clarity\u201d over where it will play home matches next season. The club is at risk of being expelled from the Football League. A statement issued by the EFL read: \u201cThe EFL board has formally written to Coventry City with a final request for clarity in regard to where the Club will stage its home matches for the 2019/20 season. \u201cIn previous correspondence, the board has been very clear about the need for Coventry City to provide absolute confirmation early in the second half of the current season. The club will still be given every opportunity to develop and present an appropriate resolution throughout the process, but the EFL is yet to receive any indication of where Coventry City intend to play next season. \u201cThe club has until 5 March 2019 to provide a further update to the board, addressing the outstanding matter and should a satisfactory solution not be found over the next two months, an Extraordinary General Meeting of clubs will be convened to consider Coventry City\u2019s expulsion from the League. This would be held on the 25 April in order to provide clarity regarding the club\u2019s future membership in advance of relegation and promotion issues being resolved during the run-in to the end of the season. \u201cThe EFL considers it untenable for a member club to seek to continue competing in its league competition if it is unable to stage its home matches. However, it understands, that despite the complex challenges facing Coventry City at this current time, it is the club\u2019s preference to extend their stay at the Ricoh Arena for future seasons and the EFL would view this as a sensible and suitable solution to the matter.\u201d A view from a sports lawyer. There\u2019s plenty of talk that Chelsea will emulate Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid by appealing their transfer ban. Yet those deals for Higuain and Pulisic suggest they wanted to be prepared for any punishment. The news also raises serious questions over Eden Hazard\u2019s future - can Chelsea really afford to let the Belgian go to Real Madrid this summer? In other news, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is hinting that Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard could return from their injuries against Liverpool on Sunday. That would be huge for Manchester United, who will need pace in attack to hurt Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side. At least Chelsea managed to secure that loan deal for Gonzalo Higuain before being hit with this transfer ban. They\u2019ve also got Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Christian Pulisic on the way. Maybe this will persuade Chelsea to give more games to the likes of Ethan Ampadu and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Maurizio? Hello? Here is more from David Hytner on a huge blow for Chelsea. Chelsea have been banned from the transfer market for two windows after Fifa found them guilty of a serious and systemic breach of the rules regarding their dealings with foreign players under the age of 18. The governing body announced the sanction on Friday at the end of a lengthy investigation into the club and how they have registered players at their academy over a number of years. The Guardian revealed last month that Fifa had looked into more than 100 player cases at Chelsea. Fifa said that the club had been found guilty of 29 breaches of Article 19 \u2013 the most serious infringements relating to the registration of minors and several others. Chelsea have been fined 600,000 Swiss francs (\u00a3460,000) and given 90 days to \u201cregularise the situation of the minor players concerned\u201d, which could involve them being forced to move on anyone brought to the club in contravention of the regulations. Fifa has also sanctioned the Football Association for breaching the rules in connection with minors, imposing a fine of 510,000 Swiss francs (\u00a3391,000) and, according to the statement, allowing \u201ca period of six months to address the situation concerning the international transfer and first registration of minors in football\u201d. Chelsea have the right to appeal to Fifa and then to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas). It is possible they could delay their punishment until after this summer\u2019s window via appeals, which can be time-consuming, meaning they would be free to make signings between the beginning of June and the end of August. Here is Fifa\u2019s statement on Chelsea\u2019s two-window transfer ban. The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the English club Chelsea FC and The Football Association for breaches relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18. Chelsea was found to have breached art. 19 of the Regulations in the case of twenty-nine (29) minor players and to have committed several other infringements relating to registration requirements for players. The club also breached art. 18bis of the Regulations in connection with two agreements it concluded concerning minors and which allowed it to influence other clubs in transfer-related matters. The Disciplinary Committee sanctioned Chelsea with a ban on registering new players at both national and international level for the next two (2) complete and consecutive registration periods. This ban applies to the club as a whole - with the exception of the women\u2019s and futsal teams - and does not prevent the release of players. Additionally, the club was fined CHF 600,000 and given a period of 90 days to regularise the situation of the minor players concerned. The Football Association was also found to have breached the rules in connection with minors. It was fined CHF 510,000 and given a period of six months to address the situation concerning the international transfer and first registration of minors in football. The protection of minors is a key element in FIFA\u2019s overall regulatory framework relating to the transfer of players and effective enforcement of these rules is paramount, as also confirmed on various occasions by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The decisions issued by the Disciplinary Committee were notified today and can be contested before the FIFA Appeal Committee. Fifa have sanctioned Chelsea and the Football Association \u201cfor breaches relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18\u201d. Chelsea have been banned from signing players for the next two transfer windows and fined \u00a3460,000. The FA have been fined \u00a3391,000. The Guardian\u2019s David Hytner broke exclusive news of the investigation by Fifa last month. We will have more on the site soon. As for Arsenal, they weren\u2019t especially convincing against Bate Borisov, though a 3-0 win helped them through to the last 16 of the Europa League. Mesut Ozil was back in the starting line-up and it will be interesting to see if the German has done enough to keep his place when the Gunners host Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday. Chelsea head into Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final brimming with confidence after last night\u2019s thumping Europa League win over Malmo. Kidding! Yes, Chelsea beat the Swedes 3-0 to seal a 5-1 aggregate win, but they weren\u2019t particularly impressive during a ropey first half and only pulled away after their opponents had been reduced to 10 men near the end. Stamford Bridge booed Jorginho on to the pitch and it seems unlikely Chelsea will be capable of holding Manchester City on Sunday. City, remember, thumped them 6-0 a couple of weeks ago. Another setback could spell the end for Maurizio Sarri, though the Italian offered a defence of teacher\u2019s pet Jorginho after last night\u2019s game. Let\u2019s start with today\u2019s transfer rumours. Apparently Marcus Rashford is off to Barcelona. Good for him. Hello. A big weekend awaits us, with Manchester United hoping to derail Liverpool\u2019s title charge, Manchester City looking to hammer the final nail in Sarri-ball\u2019s coffin in the Carabao Cup final, and Bournemouth hosting Wolves in a match that could have huge ramifications in the race to finish seventh in the Premier League. Exciting! We\u2019ll have all the noise from the day\u2019s press conferences here, plus team news, plus links to Exclusive Guardian Content, plus LIVE AND EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE of the Europa League last-16 draw!!!!!!!",

The proposed Decree 349 required artists to get a permit from the Cuban ministry of culture if they wanted to perform or operate in public or private spaces.

      "bodyText": "If Tania Bruguera has her way then this year\u2019s Havana Biennial, which runs from 12 April to 19 May, will be an uncomfortable one for the Cuban government. Bruguera, one of Cuba\u2019s most prominent artists, is coordinating a protest against Decree 349, which was brought in by the country\u2019s communist regime to clamp down on artistic expression. Foreign artists at the biennial, a showcase for Cuban and Latin American art, will be asked to wear T-shirts showing their opposition to the measure and will be asked to mention it during their public appearances. Bruguera understands that the Cuban government is sensitive to bad press, especially at what should be its most important cultural event, which is why she hopes to subvert what she expects to be a \u201cwhitewashing\u201d of Decree 349. The protests are part of a campaign by a group of artists and Bruguera, whose work occupies the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern in London until Sunday, against the decree, which was condemned by Amnesty International as \u201cdystopian\u201d. The proposed Decree 349 required artists to get a permit from the Cuban ministry of culture if they wanted to perform or operate in public or private spaces. It also allowed the government to shut down anything that it decided contained \u201csexist, vulgar or obscene language\u201d. Bruguera says that since December when Decree 349 was due to be brought in \u2013 the government delayed it due to an international outcry \u2013 two Cuban rappers have since been detained along with a Cuban artist, Michael Osorno. She describes how Rafael Almanza, a writer who organises salon-style arts events in Camaguey, tried to hold a talk about Decree 349 but he was called at 4am by government agents and told he would be killed if he did so. Almanza confirmed to the Guardian that he has received more than a dozen such calls since then, but no longer answers his phone. Such harassment is nothing new for dissidents, but what is happening for the first time in Bruguera\u2019s lifetime is that the Cuban government is doing the same towards artists, she told the Guardian on the phone from New York. \u201cNow there is no way Cuba has independent art.\u201d She says. \u201cIf you cannot do anything unless the ministry of culture gives you a permit, where is the independent art? It\u2019s non-existent.\u201d An unintended effect of the law is that for the first time in 60 years artists from all different disciplines are united in one thing \u2013 their opposition to Decree 349. Bruguera says: \u201cPeople in Cuba are very savvy, they know the fact this new law is saying the government can enter into your house, there are no more private spaces at all in Cuba now. \u201cThe fact they can take your instrument, your goods, they know that all of these decision are not artistic, all of these decisions are completely political. What more do they want from us, how much more submissive do they want us to be? Before there was censorship, you could play around. Now you go to jail, now they take your house. It\u2019s not a joke. There are no more games to play.\u201d In the face of intense opposition, Cuba\u2019s vice minister of culture Fernando Rojas backed down and said that art would only be banned in extreme cases, such as obscenity or racist content. He also began a nationwide consultation, but Bruguera says it was a sham and Rojas was only speaking to state-licensed artists, not independent artists like her. Bruguera says: \u201cWhat we want is to eliminate the decree and work together to find regulations that are based on the needs of the artists and what will protect them, not only the government.\u201d Bruguera last visited Cuba in late November and had planned to stay for a week. She ended up staying for two months to help with the fight against Decree 349 and passed up the chance to attend the Kochi Biennial in India. During her visit she was detained five times, each time for about 24 hours. One incarceration ended shortly after Tate director Maria Balshaw mentioned Bruguera was behind bars during a speech at the Turner Prize award ceremony in London. Bruguera was constantly followed and harassed on the phone, including one call she recorded. She gave a copy of the recording to the Guardian and in it the interrogator tells her menacingly that she \u201cwould not want anything to happen to you\u201d. The artist has a gallows humour about it and says that woman who spoke with her was \u201cnicer than usual\u201d. She added that the Cuban government \u201creally want to look democratic and sound democratic but they have no idea what democracy is.\u201d As Bruguera sees it, Decree 349 is a desperate attempt by the Cuban government to wrest back control it has lost since the spread of internet access. Cuba finally got 3G access through mobile phones in December, though it is too costly for most, but there are dozens of public wifi hotspots in parks. The internet has enabled film-makers to get movies out of the country without the permission of the ministry of culture and musicians have set up their own recording studios. Journalists and authors are sending their writings out of Cuba on their own and Decree 349 will not change that, Bruguera says. What will change is that artists will start to be \u201cblackmailed\u201d by the government. \u201cPeople are going to continue doing things but they know it\u2019s illegal.\u201d She says. \u201cNow the government has more control of the artists.

Bruguera says the U-turn from Barack Obama\u2019s approach, which culminated in his visit to Havana in 2015 and led to former Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro passing a number of reforms, would lead to stagnation. Having an aggressive America was \u201cterrain the Cuban government knows\u201d, she says, and that they \u201cknow how to cultivate the victim role\u201d.

Dolores Steele, whose son Philip, 15, was one of the 96 people who died, was giving evidence on Friday at the prosecution of David Duckenfield, the former South Yorkshire police commander of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and the former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer Graham Mackrell. Statements were also read to the jury of five people who survived, recalling the horror of being trapped in \u201cpen\u201d three of the ground\u2019s Leppings Lane terraces. Steele told the trial at Preston crown court she had gone to the semi-final herself on 15 April 1989 to support Liverpool with her husband Les, Philip and his younger brother Brian, who was 13. The boys had tickets to stand on the Leppings Lane terraces, while their parents had seats in the West Stand above it. Questioned by Christine Agnew QC, for the prosecution, she said that at the 3pm kick-off time she was distracted by seeing the crush below. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t look right at all, it suddenly looked very crowded down there,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody was carried on to the pitch and then I saw a jacket being put over that person\u2019s face.\u201d She said she could hear people in the crowd below, shouting for the gates in the fences at the front of the pens to be opened, because people were dying. \u201cI seem to remember about four police officers standing looking in towards the pens, but nothing seemed to be getting done about it,\u201d she said. Then a gate was opened, she recalled, and people began to be carried out. \u201cSuddenly the football pitch looked like a battleground, there were so many people out there lying round,\u201d she said. The Steeles then walked down from the stand, and met Brian, who was looking for Philip.

The family were then taken back from the hospital to Hillsborough, to the gymnasium at the football ground which, the jury has heard, was by then being used to keep the bodies of people who had died. There, Les Steele was taken in to identify Philip.

      "body": "<p>Ladies, prepare to be inspired, empowered and generally wowed. You see, I did a courageous thing this morning: I left the house without makeup. Strangers stared as I passed by, moved by my bravery. Some even burst into tears.</p> <p>Actually, that\u2019s a barefaced lie. Nobody gave a damn that I wasn\u2019t wearing makeup, which felt like a slap in the face considering the rapturous reaction Jess Glynne got for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/20/brit-awards-2019-performances-pink-jess-glynne-calvin-harris\" title=\"\">taking off her makeup at the Brits</a>. If you missed this, Glynne removed her fake eyelashes and makeup at the award show while singing her hit single Thursday, which contains the lyrics: \u201cI won\u2019t wear makeup on Thursday / \u2019Cause who I am is enough.\u201d (Detail-oriented readers will recall the Brits were on a Wednesday, but we\u2019ll gloss over that.) Glynne was joined on stage by 70 women who also removed their makeup. According to a press release, the performance was \u201ca gesture to remind ourselves and everyone else that it\u2019s OK and we are enough as we are\u201d. One imagines it was also supposed to be a gesture that would get the singer lots of press, which it did: the act was described as <a href=\"https://www.today.com/series/love-your-body/jess-glynne-removes-her-makeup-inspiring-brit-awards-performance-t149207\" title=\"\">\u201cnothing short of inspirational\u201d</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/brit-awards-2019-feminist-moments-london-dua-lipa-matt-healy-jorja-smith-a8789376.html\" title=\"\">feminist moment</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s great that Glynne used her platform to promote self-acceptance. Nevertheless, this stunt made me roll my mascara-caked eyes. Saying something vacuous about beauty standards or posting #nomakeup selfies has become a go-to PR technique for celebrities hoping to seem relevant, and it is starting to feel trite. It also feels disingenuous to suggest a bare face is liberating considering we\u2019re in a cultural moment where conspicuous makeup is out, and the \u201cnatural\u201d look is in. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/21/is-there-dark-side-to-growing-obsession-with-skincare\" title=\"\">skincare market is booming</a> as women turn to expensive creams and serums in an exhausting effort to look effortless. So, while I commend Glynne for the sentiment, I reckon I\u2019ll avoid the skin-deep feminism and keep my makeup on, thanks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ladies, prepare to be inspired, empowered and generally wowed. You see, I did a courageous thing this morning: I left the house without makeup. Strangers stared as I passed by, moved by my bravery. Some even burst into tears. Actually, that\u2019s a barefaced lie. Nobody gave a damn that I wasn\u2019t wearing makeup, which felt like a slap in the face considering the rapturous reaction Jess Glynne got for taking off her makeup at the Brits. If you missed this, Glynne removed her fake eyelashes and makeup at the award show while singing her hit single Thursday, which contains the lyrics: \u201cI won\u2019t wear makeup on Thursday / \u2019Cause who I am is enough.\u201d (Detail-oriented readers will recall the Brits were on a Wednesday, but we\u2019ll gloss over that.) Glynne was joined on stage by 70 women who also removed their makeup. According to a press release, the performance was \u201ca gesture to remind ourselves and everyone else that it\u2019s OK and we are enough as we are\u201d. One imagines it was also supposed to be a gesture that would get the singer lots of press, which it did: the act was described as \u201cnothing short of inspirational\u201d and a feminist moment. It\u2019s great that Glynne used her platform to promote self-acceptance. Nevertheless, this stunt made me roll my mascara-caked eyes. Saying something vacuous about beauty standards or posting #nomakeup selfies has become a go-to PR technique for celebrities hoping to seem relevant, and it is starting to feel trite. It also feels disingenuous to suggest a bare face is liberating considering we\u2019re in a cultural moment where conspicuous makeup is out, and the \u201cnatural\u201d look is in. The skincare market is booming as women turn to expensive creams and serums in an exhausting effort to look effortless. So, while I commend Glynne for the sentiment, I reckon I\u2019ll avoid the skin-deep feminism and keep my makeup on, thanks.",

The left hand of the slave was removed, in a reference to a common punishment meted out to Congo\u2019s population during the Belgian monarch\u2019s reign in the late 19th century. The anonymous activist vandals, who called themselves De Stoeten Ostendenoare (\u201cthe bold Ostenders\u201d), subsequently offered to return the hand, but only if the royal family and the Belgian state apologised for their colonial history. The slave\u2019s bronze hand has not been seen since that day, despite a police investigation and even the arrest of a journalist who was wrongly suspected of involvement in the politically motivated crime. But in the wake of an \u201cintermediary\u201d report by a UN working group that visited last month, which concluded that the country\u2019s institutions remain racist and the state needs to apologise for the sins of its past, De Stoeten Ostendenoare have emerged again from the shadows.

      "bodyText": "Wild and rugged \u2013 though the link to Spielberg\u2019s similarly-named action hero ends there \u2013 Indiana Dunes has been designated America\u2019s newest national park, marking the end of a 103-year-long effort instigated by the US National Park Service\u2019s first director Stephen Mather. The first national park in the state of Indiana, the area is already popular with tourists and day trippers from Chicago, with more than two million visitors a year exploring the 50 miles of walking trails through one of the country\u2019s most biodiverse protected areas. Covering 15 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline, its vast sand dunes, forests, marshes and prairies are home to over 350 species of bird and 1,100 native plants. One of the park\u2019s most important natural habitats is the oak savannahs \u2013 with mature black oaks growing among wildflowers and grasslands \u2013 believed to have once spanned 50 million acres from Michigan to Nebraska. The dunes reach up to 200 feet high, with views of the Chicago skyline from several of the beaches. In summer visitors can kayak, wild swim, horse-ride and camp while winter activities include cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Formerly Indiana Dunes national lakeshore (designated in 1966), the name change takes effect immediately, and signs and literature at the park will be updated as soon as possible. Daily operations and funding are expected to remain unchanged. \u201cThis provides our shoreline with the recognition it deserves and I hope further builds momentum to improve open and public access to all of our region\u2019s environmental wonders,\u201d said Democrat congressman Pete Visclosky, who represents Indiana\u2019s first district. Celebrating in modest style, the park\u2019s rangers tweeted a photo showing one holding a piece of cardboard with \u201cpark\u201d written on it, obscuring the word \u201clakeshore\u201d on the entrance sign. The US National Park Service celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2016, famously called \u201cAmerica\u2019s best idea\u201d by novelist and historian Wallace Stegner. During the recent, and longest-ever, government shutdown, which ran for 35 days from 22 December, several parks were vandalised, including Joshua Tree in southern California and Death Valley, which straddles eastern California and Nevada. In order to prevent another shutdown, lawmakers signed a bill on Monday, which included partial funding of $1.4bn for President Trump\u2019s controversial US-Mexico border wall.

This time it had to do with hush money paid to women to silence them from speaking about alleged affairs they had with Donald Trump. According to a New York Times report published this week, Trump asked Matthew Whitaker, his controversial acting attorney general, if he could install a loyalist at the helm of the investigation into the hush money. Although Whitaker declined Trump\u2019s request, the story has raised fresh questions over whether the president was seeking to obstruct justice and how the reported move fits into a broad pattern of Trump attempting to interfere with an investigation concerning himself. Since taking office, Trump\u2019s fixation on the federal inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2013 and potential collusion between his campaign and Moscow \u2013 has spurred a series of actions that could now imperil his presidency and prospects of a second term. From high-level firings to public misstatements, Trump\u2019s repeated steps to undermine the investigations that have clouded his two years in office paint a picture of a president who is his own worst enemy, legal experts say. \u201cIt is quite clear from all the evidence that the president has had the intent to obstruct this investigation,\u201d said Andy Wright, a former associate counsel to Barack Obama and the founding editor of the legal blog Just Security. \u201cIt\u2019s been in plain sight.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental abuse of power for the president to be trying to shut down an investigation in which he has a personal stake \u2013 both as a potential target himself and his political allies and family members,\u201d he added. One of the very first deeds appeared to be the most alarming: in an abrupt move, Trump fired James Comey, the FBI director then at the helm of the Russia investigation. The White House initially claimed Comey\u2019s dismissal had to do with his own conduct during the 2016 election, but Trump publicly conceded \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d had been part of the calculus.

Although Trump did not face any meaningful punitive action from a Republican-led Congress in the wake of Comey\u2019s firing, the moment served as the impetus for appointing special counsel Robert Mueller to oversee the Russia investigation. In the time since, the president\u2019s frustration with the special counsel has routinely spilled into public view \u2013 be it through Trump\u2019s Twitter tirades deriding the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d or attempts to frame the narrative as a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy intent on taking him down. \u201cHe\u2019s a subject of these investigations and he should just keep his hands off,\u201d said Susan Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University.

Trump reportedly dispatched Don McGahn, then serving as his White House counsel, to persuade Sessions not to recuse himself from handling the Russia investigation after it was revealed that Sessions failed to disclose his own contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US. \u201cThis president has a \u2018you\u2019re with or against me\u2019 mindset,\u201d Wright said. Mueller is soon expected to conclude his investigation \u2013 perhaps as early as next week \u2013 and deliver a report on the special counsel\u2019s findings.

      "body": "<p>If you have ever been to the theatre with someone recently bereaved, you\u2019ll have noticed how often death crops up. It used to be an incidental detail but in recent years, from Jo Clifford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/23/every-one-review\">Every One</a> to Theatre Ad Infinitum\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/12/translunar-paradise-edinburgh-review\">Translunar Paradise</a>, grief has become one of theatre\u2019s central preoccupations. So it is with Vanishing Point\u2019s The Dark Carnival, an underworld cabaret about the yearning of the dead and the living to communicate with each other.</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://kenneth-macleod.com/\">Kenneth MacLeod</a>\u2019s set of tottering coffins tangled in the roots of graveyard trees, the deceased are portrayed as a bunch of depressed misfits, as frustrated by their demise as those they have left behind. Above them, at ground level, mourners include the lover of a gay man arrested for indecency in the 1950s and the family of a girl who has died in infancy. In a godless universe, the dead know how futile it is to make contact, but it seems worth the effort if it might bring some resolution.</p> <p>Writer and director Matthew Lenton appreciates that grief, despite being a heightened emotion, is dramatically inert.

      "bodyText": "If you have ever been to the theatre with someone recently bereaved, you\u2019ll have noticed how often death crops up. It used to be an incidental detail but in recent years, from Jo Clifford\u2019s Every One to Theatre Ad Infinitum\u2019s Translunar Paradise, grief has become one of theatre\u2019s central preoccupations. So it is with Vanishing Point\u2019s The Dark Carnival, an underworld cabaret about the yearning of the dead and the living to communicate with each other. On Kenneth MacLeod\u2019s set of tottering coffins tangled in the roots of graveyard trees, the deceased are portrayed as a bunch of depressed misfits, as frustrated by their demise as those they have left behind. Above them, at ground level, mourners include the lover of a gay man arrested for indecency in the 1950s and the family of a girl who has died in infancy. In a godless universe, the dead know how futile it is to make contact, but it seems worth the effort if it might bring some resolution. Writer and director Matthew Lenton appreciates that grief, despite being a heightened emotion, is dramatically inert. He duly brings a healthy irreverence to a script that rhymes like a gothic fairy story and is able to laugh at itself. What it can\u2019t do is bring closure, offering only a fuzzy philosophy about making the most of being alive. Narrative uncertainty aside, it\u2019s a gorgeous looking and sounding production. Leading the cast, the excellent Elicia Daly reprises her deadpan narrator role from the company\u2019s Interiors, while Biff Smith and the eight-piece A New International perform a brooding set of tuneful songs that evoke Kurt Weill, Neil Hannon and Paul McCartney. At Tramway, Glasgow, until 2 March. Then touring until 16 March.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a summary before we close up for the day: German data confirmed a sluggish period for Europe\u2019s largest economy, which failed to grow in the final quarter of 2018 but escaped recession because the figure was 0% and not negative. Eurozone inflation dipped to 1.4% in January from 1.5% in December, reflecting a sharp deceleration in energy price growth. In the UK, there were two pieces of major M&amp;A news. First, Canadian dairy giant Saputo is to buy Dairy Crest in a near \u00a31bn recommended offer. In a second approach, doorstep lender Provident Financial has received a \u00a31.3bn offer from smaller rival Non-Standard Finance. The pound fell against the euro and the dollar after an EU official said there would be \u2018no Brexit deal in the desert\u2019 when leaders meet at a summit in Egypt next week. The latest survey from the CBI showed UK high street sales were flat in February, with the worst hit retailers selling footwear, DIY, and furniture and carpets. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic are higher, boosted in part by hopes that the US and China will make progress in trade talks. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for all the comments and please join us again on Monday. AM The opening bell has rung and here is how it\u2019s looking: Dow Jones: +95 points or 0.4% at 25,945 S&amp;P 500: +8 points or 0.3% at 2,783 Nasdaq: +22 points or 0.3% at 7,482 Hopes of a breakthrough in US-China trade talk appear to be lifting sentiment (despite no discernible progress as yet). Unite, the union, says it is seeking an urgent meeting with Saputo, the Canadian dairy giant which is hoping to buy Britain\u2019s Dairy Crest for almost \u00a31bn. Unite represents workers across Dairy Crest\u2019s UK operations, with the biggest concentration of members at the Davidstow cheese plant in Cornwall. Sue Pollard, Unite\u2019s national officer for the food industry, says: Unite is cautiously optimistic that Saputo is seeking to develop Dairy Crest\u2019s operation in the UK over the long-term. Unite is now seeking an urgent meeting with the senior management at Saputo to receive detailed information about the company\u2019s plans and secure assurances about employment levels and a commitment to maintaining existing plants. The pound has just dipped below $1.30, down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.2997. It is down 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.1469. European markets are up across the board, with US futures pointing to a higher open for Wall Street. Connor Campbell, analyst at the spread betting firm Spreadex, gives his take: The markets perked up as Friday went on, hopeful that a meeting between Donald Trump and China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He will yield some kind of trade war solution. Once again crossing 7200, the FTSE climbed more than half a percent, aided in part by a slight dip from sterling. Cold water has been poured on the hopes of Theresa May reaching a new Brexit agreement at this Sunday\u2019s summit in Egypt, dragging the pound down 0.2% against both the euro and the dollar. Looking to the US and the Dow Jones is aiming for a 100 point increase after the bell. That\u2019d take the Dow back to 25,950, having fallen from 26,000 on Thursday. Trump isn\u2019t set to meet Liu He until 2.30pm US time, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if the markets can maintain their positive attitude. More on inflation now, with the price of a first class stamp to rise 3p to 70p from 25 March. The price of a second class stamp will also increase by 3p, to 61p. Buy now! It\u2019s been a slow start to the year for Britain\u2019s retailers, according to the latest survey from the CBI. Retail sales were flat in February, following zero growth in January, the lobby group said in its latest distributive trades survey of 100 firms. The worst hit were retailers selling footwear, DIY, and furniture and carpets, where sales volumes fell. Food stores, clothing retailers and online retailers fared better. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, commented: The high street has seen a slow start to the year, with year-on-year sales volumes unchanged again this month. Although real earnings growth is higher, consumer confidence has been ebbing away, keeping a lid on demand. Retail investment plans have taken a hit this quarter, falling to their weakest since 2012. Until politicians can agree a deal that commands a majority in parliament, is acceptable to the EU and protects our economy, business despair will deepen. A deal must be negotiated, and no-deal averted. The pound is under some pressure this morning after EU sources poured cold water on the idea that Brexit progress would be made at a meeting in Egypt next week. Reuters is reporting than an unnamed official in Brussels said EU leaders would not clinch a deal with Theresa May during an EU summit with the League of Arab States in Sharm el-Sheikh, scheduled for Sunday and Monday. \u201cThere will be no deal in the desert,\u201d the official said. However, the UK prime minister is expected to meet European council president Donald Tusk on the sidelines of the summit. The pound is down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3009, and down 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1474. Here is how inflation compares across Europe, with the lowest rate at 0.5% in Greece, and the highest rate at 3.2% in Romania: Inflation in the eurozone slowed slightly in January as energy price growth slowed sharply. The headline annual rate fell to 1.4% in January, from 1.5% in December. Energy prices were 2.7% higher in the year to January, compared with 5.5% in the year to December. However so-called core inflation \u2013 which strips out energy prices and unprocessed food - edged higher to 1.2% in January from 1.1% in December. The FTSE 250, which is a more UK-focused index than the FTSE 100, is also up 0.3% this morning, at 19,297. This morning\u2019s takeover targets - Dairy Crest and Provident Financial - are both among the top risers, up 13% and 4% respectively. Investors across Europe are in a fairly upbeat mood this morning, unfazed by weak data from Germany. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,179 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 11,442 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,210 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 20,245 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 9,208 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 371 And here is a chart tracking the performance of Dairy Crest shares in February: Here is our full story on the Dairy Crest deal: Confidence among German firms fell for the sixth month in February, as business leaders expect only sluggish growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The closely-watched Ifo business climate index fell to 98.5 from 99.3 in January. It was the weakest since December 2014, and lower than the 99 predicted by economists. Ifo economists said: The German economy is experiencing a downturn. There was hope that the weak period we experienced in the second half of 2018 was only temporary but it looks like it will continue. The institute said the latest survey, combined with other data, suggested the German economy was on course to grow 0.2% in the first quarter. More M&amp;A news this morning after subprime lender Provident Financial received a \u00a31.3bn offer from its smaller rival, Non-Standard Finance. If the all-share reverse takeover goes ahead, John van Kuffeler, the founder and chief executive of NSF, would once again be at the helm of Provident - a firm he ran for 22 years until the end of 2013. The deal values Provident shares at 511p and is backed by Neil Woodford\u2019s Woodford Investment Management, Invesco and Marathon, which together own more than half of Provident and are also major shareholders in NSF. Last month Provident issued a profits warning, blaming an increase in bad debts at its Vanquis credit card unit. Announcing the offer, Van Kuffeler said: This transaction will create a market leader in the non-standard finance sector with a strong position in all four main segments. We have recognised the strong logic and value creation potential of a combination with Provident for some time and hence approached the Provident Board with a proposal in January last year. That approach was rebuffed and since then Provident has further lost its way. However, NSF has extensive management expertise and experience, and the correct strategy to turn Provident around and release significant value by combining it with our own fast-growing businesses for the benefit of customers, employees and investors. I\u2019m delighted that holders of over 50 per cent. of Provident\u2019s shares have given their support to our proposal today. Some major corporate news this morning as Dairy Crest, the UK cheese and butter manufacturer, announced it is recommending a \u00a3975m offer from Canadian dairy conglomerate Saputo. Saputo is offering 620p a share in cash ... anyone who bought shares on Friday will be feeling lucky after shares closed at just 476.2p at the end of last week, making the offer price a hefty 30% premium. Shares closed at 555p last night, and are now up 13% at 625p. Saputo was founded in 1954, employs about 15,000, and is based in Montreal. We\u2019ll have a full story soon. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany\u2019s economy came to a standstill in the final quarter of 2018, figures published this morning. Quarterly growth of 0% was confirmed in a second estimate of GDP from the Federal Statistics Office. Europe\u2019s largest economy narrowly avoided recession after the economy shrank by 0.2% in the third quarter. In the final three months of 2018, higher government spending just about offset a sluggish trade picture. However, the second estimate provides greater detail and Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING in Germany, says that delays to car production caused by tougher emissions testing are masking greater underlying strength. The GDP components provide interesting insights: the German economy is in a better shape than its current reputation. In our view, there are two main takeaways from this morning\u2019s data. First, the temporary problems in the car industry mask solid fundamentals across the entire economy and second, the sharp inventory reduction suggests that it will still take some time but eventually the car-related problems should disappear. It is often said that many Germans can get sidetracked by fast cars. This time around, cars have sidetracked the entire economy. However, in a couple of months, the German economy should be able again to show its true colours. Later this morning the closely watched German Ifo business climate index and eurozone inflation data will provide the latest clues on the state of the bloc\u2019s economy.

      "body": "<p><strong>I\u2019m 25 years old. I\u2019ve been having a really hard time in the past month due to a break</strong><strong>up. I met this girl when I was 18 and she was 17</strong><strong>. We lived in different cities, </strong><strong>more than three hours from each other (we still do), so we </strong><strong>started </strong><strong>long-distance dating. I loved </strong><strong>her</strong><strong> but</strong><strong> always felt </strong><strong>as if I was missing out on my life by being with someone while I was so young</strong><strong>. Years passed and we had tons of break</strong><strong>ups, mostly me breaking up with her.</strong></p> <p><strong>We broke up last year and stayed away from each other for </strong><strong>10 months</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Now I feel </strong><strong>as if I\u2019ve lost her for good. Ironically, I feel that she is the love of my life and I want to settle down, live with her and start a family. She tells me that she suffered a lot </strong><strong>because of my decisions and now she\u2019s not sure she even loves me any more.</strong></p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve been trying to fill a hole </strong><strong>that she made in my heart when I left her (yes, my own fault) by getting to know other people, </strong><strong>and I keep looking for her in other girls. I\u2019m really miserable </strong><strong>and I don\u2019t know what to do.</strong></p> <p>I get letters like this from people of all ages, so you are not alone. I think it\u2019s great you are looking at this with an analytical eye, and well done for taking responsibility for your part in it. It is very easy to look back at situations and relationships and to idealise them; but the fact is, you broke up with this girl many times and that must have been for a reason. What I think you need to really look at is the difference between the reality of this relationship, and how you now recall it (which is probably tinged with fantasy).</p> <p>I consulted <a href=\"https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Pamela Gawler-Wright</a>, a UKCP-accredited contemporary psychotherapist (psychotherapy.org.uk), who had some valuable insights. She thought it was great that, \u201cAt a relatively young age you have already found that relationships matter deeply to you and that emotions, even the uncomfortable ones, are important messengers of what you might really want in life.\u201d But she also wondered if perhaps you \u201cfeel trapped or smothered by intimacy with another person, even while you also want the security and affirmation [that a relationship brings]. Could this also have something to do with how your most important romantic relationship to date has been long-distance?\u201d</p> <p>Many people in long-distance relationships really like the bits in between meeting up: safe in the knowledge they have someone, but far away as a romanticised ideal, so they can become whomever they want in the meantime.</p> <p>I think this is what may have happened with your girlfriend and why, now that she is finally gone, you are convinced she is the one. Honestly, I don\u2019t think she is the one, and that\u2019s OK. You are 25, you have lots of years of getting to know yourself better. Instead of trying to fix the pain with going back, you need to face it: look at what it\u2019s telling you about who you are and then fold this experience into your life.</p> <p>\u201cYour ex has communicated that this painful limbo is not acceptable to her,\u201d Gawler-Wright said, \u201cand it\u2019s important you respect that \u2013 let her and you move on. Letting go will also give you a chance to process the pain that you are avoiding by trying to keep your fantasy open of being together for ever.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/01/my-partner-has-turned-vegan-and-i-am-seething-about-it\">My partner has turned vegan and I am seething about it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gawler-Wright also wanted you to think about what qualities your ex had that you think are lacking in others you meet. Sometimes, she explained, other people reflect what may be lacking \u2013 but that we want \u2013 in ourselves, and it\u2019s only by addressing that hole you talk of, that people can really commit to a successful relationship, based in reality and all that goes with it.</p> <p>One of the scariest things I found as a single person was thinking I might never meet that special someone. I used to think that, if only I could absolutely know I would meet someone one day, I could actually enjoy my single time. Of course there are no guarantees, but this is what I would like you to try to do: be on your own for a while and learn who you are.</p> <p>Gawler-Wright said: \u201cDo not wish away your time as a single person out of an avoidance of loneliness. Your future probably holds a long-term relationship that will be all the richer for the work you are doing now, so savour this opportunity to grow.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Send your problem to <a href=\"mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m 25 years old. I\u2019ve been having a really hard time in the past month due to a breakup. I met this girl when I was 18 and she was 17. We lived in different cities, more than three hours from each other (we still do), so we started long-distance dating. I loved her but always felt as if I was missing out on my life by being with someone while I was so young. Years passed and we had tons of breakups, mostly me breaking up with her. We broke up last year and stayed away from each other for 10 months. Now I feel as if I\u2019ve lost her for good. Ironically, I feel that she is the love of my life and I want to settle down, live with her and start a family. She tells me that she suffered a lot because of my decisions and now she\u2019s not sure she even loves me any more. I\u2019ve been trying to fill a hole that she made in my heart when I left her (yes, my own fault) by getting to know other people, and I keep looking for her in other girls. I\u2019m really miserable and I don\u2019t know what to do. I get letters like this from people of all ages, so you are not alone. I think it\u2019s great you are looking at this with an analytical eye, and well done for taking responsibility for your part in it. It is very easy to look back at situations and relationships and to idealise them; but the fact is, you broke up with this girl many times and that must have been for a reason. What I think you need to really look at is the difference between the reality of this relationship, and how you now recall it (which is probably tinged with fantasy). I consulted Pamela Gawler-Wright, a UKCP-accredited contemporary psychotherapist (psychotherapy.org.uk), who had some valuable insights. She thought it was great that, \u201cAt a relatively young age you have already found that relationships matter deeply to you and that emotions, even the uncomfortable ones, are important messengers of what you might really want in life.\u201d But she also wondered if perhaps you \u201cfeel trapped or smothered by intimacy with another person, even while you also want the security and affirmation [that a relationship brings]. Could this also have something to do with how your most important romantic relationship to date has been long-distance?\u201d Many people in long-distance relationships really like the bits in between meeting up: safe in the knowledge they have someone, but far away as a romanticised ideal, so they can become whomever they want in the meantime. I think this is what may have happened with your girlfriend and why, now that she is finally gone, you are convinced she is the one. Honestly, I don\u2019t think she is the one, and that\u2019s OK. You are 25, you have lots of years of getting to know yourself better. Instead of trying to fix the pain with going back, you need to face it: look at what it\u2019s telling you about who you are and then fold this experience into your life. \u201cYour ex has communicated that this painful limbo is not acceptable to her,\u201d Gawler-Wright said, \u201cand it\u2019s important you respect that \u2013 let her and you move on. Letting go will also give you a chance to process the pain that you are avoiding by trying to keep your fantasy open of being together for ever.\u201d Gawler-Wright also wanted you to think about what qualities your ex had that you think are lacking in others you meet. Sometimes, she explained, other people reflect what may be lacking \u2013 but that we want \u2013 in ourselves, and it\u2019s only by addressing that hole you talk of, that people can really commit to a successful relationship, based in reality and all that goes with it. One of the scariest things I found as a single person was thinking I might never meet that special someone. I used to think that, if only I could absolutely know I would meet someone one day, I could actually enjoy my single time. Of course there are no guarantees, but this is what I would like you to try to do: be on your own for a while and learn who you are. Gawler-Wright said: \u201cDo not wish away your time as a single person out of an avoidance of loneliness. Your future probably holds a long-term relationship that will be all the richer for the work you are doing now, so savour this opportunity to grow.\u201d \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

The 46-year-old woman, who has not been named, died in the early hours of Sunday after having a meal with her husband and son at the Riff restaurant in the eastern city of Valencia. Regional health authorities say 30 people \u2013 including the woman, her husband and son \u2013 fell ill with food poisoning after eating at Riff between 13 and 16 February. The woman\u2019s husband and son are recovering. A judge in Valencia has opened an inquiry into the death and is awaiting the results of a postmortem and an analysis of samples taken from the restaurant. The regional high court told the Europa Press news agency that no individuals were currently under investigation. In a statement on Thursday, the Valencia health department said food safety officers visited the restaurant on 18 February and did not find any obvious explanation for the poisonings. Samples of dishes served as a part of a tasting menu are being analysed by the National Toxicology Institute. A spokeswoman for the regional health ministry declined to comment on reports that a species of mushroom might have been the source of the outbreak, saying the analysis was still being carried out. Bernd H Kn\u00f6ller, the head chef and owner of Riff, has closed the restaurant, offered his deepest condolences and is collaborating with the regional health authorities to determine what happened. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the decision to close the restaurant until we know the precise causes and can reopen with the necessary guarantees for the safety of both staff and customers,\u201d Kn\u00f6ller said.

      "bodyText": "When I look at Kyle Sinckler and how he is performing I see someone who typifies this current England team. Abrasive, dynamic and full of energy and enthusiasm. He may have what I would call his \u201codd moments\u201d every now and again but I can live with that if you get the rest of the package and that is what we are now seeing. If you\u2019re Wales you will probably look at Kyle and maybe Ellis Genge and think you can rough them up. But I also think Kyle and Ellis both know that. If you know you\u2019re going to be targeted you should be able to deal with it. Wales will be targeting all of England\u2019s key players or leaders for different reasons all across the park. Warren Gatland has come out and called Kyle a \u201ctimebomb\u201d but Warren is someone who knows Kyle pretty well from the Lions tour and he is someone who has never let him down. I remember speaking to the England coaches a few years ago and their concern about Kyle was his scrummaging. It was almost a case of hopefully he can survive in the scrum and then bring everything else that he brings around the pitch. He\u2019s not just surviving in the scrums any more, he\u2019s causing huge problems for opponents there and really importantly it is not sapping his legs, it is not detracting from all the other stuff he loves doing. I saw him the other day and told him I\u2019ve never seen him looking so big. His response was: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to get any taller \u2026\u201d That appetite for improvement sums him up.

On Tuesday, thousands took to the streets to demonstrate against antisemitic hate in one of the largest rallies against antisemitism since the death of Ilan Halimi, a young Jewish man who was brutally murdered in 2006. These attacks may be horrifying, but they are not surprising to observers of French society. Over the last few years, antisemitic groups and individuals have thrived during a period of social polarisation, economic grievances and concerns around French identity. They have spread their narratives through every channel available, including social media and online platforms. Antisemitism pervades large sections of the French fachosph\u00e8re \u2013 a nebulous group of websites, blogs and influencers affiliated with the far right. French far-right ideologue Alain Soral, who has multiple convictions for antisemitic incitement, is running one of the most visited political websites in France (Egalit\u00e9 et R\u00e9conciliation). Every video released by Dieudonn\u00e9 has hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. The roots of French antisemitism run deep and there is no quick fix. The French government has shown signs it is serious about cracking down on antisemitism. The country is set to adopt a new law against hate speech online in the next few months, which will put pressure on tech companies to tackle hate speech. And on Wednesday, Macron announced that France would adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. But these tackle the symptoms, not the cause of racism. More soul-searching and longer-term solutions are needed. \u2022 C\u00e9cile Guerin is a French journalist based in London",

He is overwhelmingly projected to be the No 1 pick in June\u2019s NBA draft. There are no sure things, but pick someone else and you risk a revolt from your fanbase.</p> \n<p>Wednesday night\u2019s incident has re-ignited the never-ending debate of whether top basketball stars should skip college, and why the NBA forces them to wait a year before turning pro.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why is this a big deal?</strong></h2> \n<p>College basketball doesn\u2019t get bigger than Duke v North Carolina, particularly with two of the top three players in the country on show.</p> \n<p>Tickets cost $2,500 on the resale market. The salaries for the two coaches are combined $11 million. It\u2019s the crown jewel of an Atlantic Coast Conference broadcast rights package that ESPN shells out nine figures for.</p> \n<p>Yet the young stars who drew the eyeballs of millions are amateurs paid in room, board, and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ncaa-ruling-in-north-carolina-academic-investigation-no-penalties-for-unc/\">\u201ceducation\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, Williamson\u2019s injury isn\u2019t as grave as first feared. Duke confirmed the star has a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DukeMBB/status/1098718681557798913\">Grade 1 right knee sprain</a> and is considered day-to-day. Whether or not he suits up again for Duke this season remains in doubt.</p> \n<h2><strong>What did Nike say?</strong></h2> \n<p>Nike, Duke\u2019s shoe partner, called the explosion an \u201cisolated incident\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery,\u201d a Nike statement said. \u201cThe quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance. While this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue.\u201d</p> \n<p>As odd as it looked, this isn\u2019t the first time Nike\u2019s have been known to <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2019/2/21/18234581/zion-williamson-nike-blowout-2014-nba-history\">spontaneously blow</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How much money </strong><em><strong>could </strong></em><strong>a serious injury cost Williamson?</strong></h2> \n<p>The presumptive No 1 overall pick will earn close to $42m over the lifespan of his rookie deal, with approximately $19m fully guaranteed in the first two years.</p> \n<p>Williamson has an $8m loss of value insurance policy, according to <a href=\"https://www.actionnetwork.com/ncaab/zion-williamson-insurance-policy-injury-duke-unc-2019?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=darrenrovell\">the Action Network\u2019s Darren Rovell</a>.

It works well for both sides, at least in theory: the NBA gets more time to evaluate young talent before sinking millions of dollars into an asset; the NCAA gets stars to help showcase its billion-dollar March Madness product.</p> \n<p>In reality, it hasn\u2019t quite worked that way. One-and-done culture has made a mockery of the so-called student-athlete experience. Top stars can spend as little as six months enrolled in school, only extended if their team makes a deep tournament run \u2013 time that\u2019s spent away from campus. And as a greater divide develops between the college game and the pros \u2013 the pace, the style, the rules \u2013 NBA teams are evaluating prospects based on their \u201ctools\u201d more so than college production.</p> \n<p>Lesser players can furnish their brands, sure. But in the information/viral age, top high school players have the same individual pulling power as they do in college. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNc3Af8j0Xo\">mini-documentary</a> following a day in Williamson\u2019s life as a high school star has eclipsed 4.9m views.</p> \n<p>The NCAA needs Williamson\u2019s star wattage more than he needs them.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, the NBA\u2019s players\u2019 union formally proposed dropping the age requirement from 19 to 18. That would allow players to go straight from high school to the NBA. The timing is not related to Williamson\u2019s injury, according to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/02/21/nba-draft-eligible-age-limit-proposal-18-years-old/2942228002/\">USA Today</a>.</p> \n<p>The NBA has been hesitant to strike a deal that didn\u2019t include requirements for all players to release their pre-draft medical records to all teams (something agents use to leverage where their clients may or may not end up).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Should Williamson stop playing for Duke immediately and prepare for the draft?</strong></p> \n<p>If Williamson wanted to chase money, he should drop out of school now, call Morant and put on a pay-per-view one-on-one game or dunk contest, similar to The Match staged by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/25357918/phil-mickelson-defeats-tiger-woods-match\">Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson</a> in November. Each would stand to make millions outside of the NCAA system while taking on less physical risk.</p> \n<p>But perhaps that\u2019s not what drives Williamson. Perhaps he likes being around his teammates. Perhaps he really, <em>really</em> wants to chase a Final Four spot and a championship. Perhaps the college experience \u2013 regardless of the fact it\u2019s unique to him and not a <em>true </em>representation of college \u2013 is more valuable than the cash that he will make down the road.</p> \n<p>If not, and Williamson\u2019s goal is to maximize his earning potential, his gap year in college<em><strong> </strong></em>serves only to create problems and potentially cost him millions<em><strong>.</strong></em></p>",

That\u2019s the thing about Zion. His game translates globally. You don\u2019t have to understand the nuances of the pick and roll. There\u2019s no need to discuss hedging on defense. Just watch him leap and bounce and slam and you\u2019re awed by the ferocity of his play. He is a basketball savant and marketer\u2019s dream. He is overwhelmingly projected to be the No 1 pick in June\u2019s NBA draft. There are no sure things, but pick someone else and you risk a revolt from your fanbase. Wednesday night\u2019s incident has re-ignited the never-ending debate of whether top basketball stars should skip college, and why the NBA forces them to wait a year before turning pro. Why is this a big deal? College basketball doesn\u2019t get bigger than Duke v North Carolina, particularly with two of the top three players in the country on show. Tickets cost $2,500 on the resale market. The salaries for the two coaches are combined $11 million. It\u2019s the crown jewel of an Atlantic Coast Conference broadcast rights package that ESPN shells out nine figures for. Yet the young stars who drew the eyeballs of millions are amateurs paid in room, board, and \u201ceducation\u201d. Fortunately, Williamson\u2019s injury isn\u2019t as grave as first feared. Duke confirmed the star has a Grade 1 right knee sprain and is considered day-to-day. Whether or not he suits up again for Duke this season remains in doubt. What did Nike say? Nike, Duke\u2019s shoe partner, called the explosion an \u201cisolated incident\u201d. \u201cWe are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery,\u201d a Nike statement said. \u201cThe quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance. While this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue.\u201d As odd as it looked, this isn\u2019t the first time Nike\u2019s have been known to spontaneously blow. How much money could a serious injury cost Williamson? The presumptive No 1 overall pick will earn close to $42m over the lifespan of his rookie deal, with approximately $19m fully guaranteed in the first two years. Williamson has an $8m loss of value insurance policy, according to the Action Network\u2019s Darren Rovell. But the policy only pays out if he slips past the 16th pick in the draft, which wouldn\u2019t happen regardless of how bad his injury turned out to be. Is there anything the NBA or NCAA can do to change the rules that keep star athletes in school? It\u2019s important to note here that the age requirement that forces high schools\u2019 top basketball stars to spend a year in college or explore outposts in Europe or China, is the NBA\u2019s rule, not the NCAAs. But it would be intellectually dishonest to claim the NCAA had no role in the decision. It works well for both sides, at least in theory: the NBA gets more time to evaluate young talent before sinking millions of dollars into an asset; the NCAA gets stars to help showcase its billion-dollar March Madness product. In reality, it hasn\u2019t quite worked that way. One-and-done culture has made a mockery of the so-called student-athlete experience. Top stars can spend as little as six months enrolled in school, only extended if their team makes a deep tournament run \u2013 time that\u2019s spent away from campus. And as a greater divide develops between the college game and the pros \u2013 the pace, the style, the rules \u2013 NBA teams are evaluating prospects based on their \u201ctools\u201d more so than college production. Lesser players can furnish their brands, sure. But in the information/viral age, top high school players have the same individual pulling power as they do in college. A mini-documentary following a day in Williamson\u2019s life as a high school star has eclipsed 4.9m views. The NCAA needs Williamson\u2019s star wattage more than he needs them. On Thursday, the NBA\u2019s players\u2019 union formally proposed dropping the age requirement from 19 to 18. That would allow players to go straight from high school to the NBA. The timing is not related to Williamson\u2019s injury, according to USA Today. The NBA has been hesitant to strike a deal that didn\u2019t include requirements for all players to release their pre-draft medical records to all teams (something agents use to leverage where their clients may or may not end up). Should Williamson stop playing for Duke immediately and prepare for the draft? If Williamson wanted to chase money, he should drop out of school now, call Morant and put on a pay-per-view one-on-one game or dunk contest, similar to The Match staged by Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in November. Each would stand to make millions outside of the NCAA system while taking on less physical risk. But perhaps that\u2019s not what drives Williamson. Perhaps he likes being around his teammates. Perhaps he really, really wants to chase a Final Four spot and a championship. Perhaps the college experience \u2013 regardless of the fact it\u2019s unique to him and not a true representation of college \u2013 is more valuable than the cash that he will make down the road. If not, and Williamson\u2019s goal is to maximize his earning potential, his gap year in college serves only to create problems and potentially cost him millions.",

It was such an amazing piece. So then, I suppose I was like, what do I say? I\u2019m not doing anything like that to be a woke king, or to earn brownie points, it\u2019s just that it was the best thing that I\u2019d read. It didn\u2019t read to me as an opinion, it read to me as a truth. It was all I was thinking about that day, so I just thought that everybody else should think about it. Laura had said it better than I think I ever could, and I think it\u2019s important that we hear a woman\u2019s voice over a man\u2019s voice. It felt like the right thing to do. So thank you so much for the words.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> I kinda looked at it almost as if you were using your platform as a vessel to get a wider message, a bigger message across.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/14/the-ryan-adams-allegations-are-the-tip-of-an-indie-music-iceberg\">The Ryan Adams allegations are the tip of an indie-music iceberg | Laura Snapes</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>MH:</strong> Of course, yeah. And it is frustrating, being in that room \u2013 if I was to speak about it, I wouldn\u2019t be speaking from ideology, I\u2019d be speaking from experience. Every man in that room knows a woman in that industry who has been at one time subject to misogynistic behaviour by a man when professionalism should have been at play. End of story. You have one of those anecdotes, I have one, I\u2019m sure everybody here has one, and it still happens. So that\u2019s a question that surely everyone, all men have to ask ourselves in our industry: why? It must be [because it\u2019s] permitted, somehow.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> Do you guys think, and I wanna bring all of you in here, that we\u2019re heading towards a bit of a snowball moment in music and we might be seeing what happened with #MeToo in film finally happening in music?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"487ec9a6610a62f3b67811e7311bc42d6748c795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/487ec9a6610a62f3b67811e7311bc42d6748c795/0_368_1433_860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(L-R) Guardian deputy music editor Laura Snapes, 1975 frontman Matthew Healy and Chris of Christine and the Queens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(L-R) Guardian deputy music editor Laura Snapes, 1975 frontman Matthew Healy and Chris of Christine and the Queens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beats</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>LS:</strong> I\u2019d like to think that it might start happening. I had a Damascene moment the day after the Ryan Adams news. When people say, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t #MeToo happened for music?\u201d, I think it\u2019s reasons like power isn\u2019t concentrated in individuals like Harvey Weinstein \u2013 there\u2019s not a big power broker like that \u2013 and also, as I wrote in the Ryan Adams piece, the myth of male genius props up music, and people are loth to pull that down.</p> <p><strong>MH:</strong> It\u2019s so true, man.</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> But then I realised, I work at a national newspaper. We\u2019re in a position to do something about this. And I spoke to Joe Coscarelli, who was one of the authors of the New York Times\u2019s Ryan Adams report, and he said that, they sometimes lack the resources to do that kind of story, and most mainstream newspapers don\u2019t consider music a news item. I thought, we have to be the people who consider these stories a news item and go after them.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> What you\u2019re saying, Laura, is exactly right. People slag off music journalism and say it\u2019s not as good as it used to be, but for me, it\u2019s better than it\u2019s ever been and it\u2019s getting to more people than ever before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d461da903e21533d897d29701d4d4236ab6602c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d461da903e21533d897d29701d4d4236ab6602c3/559_37_4854_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris of Christine and the Queens arrives at the Brit awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris of Christine and the Queens arrives at the Brit awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Baron/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>MH:</strong> Our relationship, for example \u2013 there was a time when I said something wrong, just outright misinformed. I apologised for it publicly because I just said something that was a bit ignorant. Laura called me out on it and we had a dialogue behind closed doors about it. It seems that there\u2019s part of this relationship where if you accept that if you\u2019ve not done anything wrong, you\u2019ve not got anything to be scared of, and you shouldn\u2019t avoid criticism from those who have objectively different experiences than you do in things that probably you\u2019ll be less informed on. What\u2019s cool is that we\u2019ve established this dialogue where we\u2019re kinda like mates, but we\u2019d hold each other accountable for stuff.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> The other important thing that I wanted to say to you guys, Chris and Matty, is I think we need more musicians taking a stand and using their platform to get this message across. That doesn\u2019t really happen enough, in my opinion.</p> <p><strong>MH:</strong> Chris is the ultimate example of it.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> Also you\u2019re so eloquent when you talk, you have great ideas. They\u2019re normal ideas that everybody really should have, but you put them across very, very openly. As do you, Matty.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMcDpHcXRiQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OMcDpHcXRiQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The 1975 performing Sincerity Is Scary at the 2019 Brit awards.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think also the violence is systemic. As a musician myself, I encountered many, many, many moments of misogyny, also because some of the key technical places were occupied by men who couldn\u2019t see me, for example, as a producer. My whole career is made of moments where I had to fight five times more than maybe a man to say, \u201cActually, I can use my own computer, actually I am writing the tracks and I can produce them.\u201d I think it\u2019s really exhausting when you\u2019re a female trying to navigate in that reality, and I think sometimes it can be scary to take a stand, especially at first, when there were very few women talking about that, because then you\u2019re immediately pinpointed as, \u201cUgh, she\u2019s going to be the bitchy one who always opens her mouth.\u201d And then you\u2019re reduced again and you\u2019re made to maybe shut up more. So I think that the great thing is that with more allies that can actually help make this a problem for everybody in the industry, not just women, it gets more and more comfortable to speak about those things because it becomes more a safe space for everybody to express themselves.</p> <p><strong>MW:</strong> This is what I mean by the #MeToo thing happening in music \u2013 even if I look back to your original article, Laura, in 2015 that came out, that was a different world back then. Things have moved on, it seems like we\u2019re in a better place now. We\u2019re not there.</p> <p><strong>C:</strong> Not really.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"082cd53e65020463bce14de8bed912517fdb0068\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/082cd53e65020463bce14de8bed912517fdb0068/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine and the Queens performing at Hammersmith Apollo, 21 November 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine and the Queens performing at Hammersmith Apollo, 21 November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gaelle Beri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>MW:</strong> But it feels like [we\u2019ve taken] one step in the right direction?</p> <p><strong>MH:</strong> It so speaks volumes, doesn\u2019t it, that everybody, woke Twitter, everybody gets together on this statement that\u2019s very now and part of hopefully propping up some movement. But you\u2019ve been saying this for four years!</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> I\u2019ve been saying this for 10 years. Something I wrote about in that Ryan Adams piece: on one hand you\u2019ve got #MeToo-related issues and you\u2019ve got sexual harassment and direct examples of misogyny in the industry, but then you\u2019ve got all the systems that prop it up. I was saying these things nine years ago in my first job, and they didn\u2019t make me popular. You would point out that a bloke that we were potentially going to cover had a dodgy reputation, and you\u2019d be the person in trouble. We would still continue to cover the guy, and you\u2019d be more than in trouble.</p> <p><strong>C:</strong> That\u2019s the problem, also.</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> And the thing that I really worry about at the moment is, the Brits is patting itself on the back over the fact that it\u2019s got 50-50 gender representation in its nominations and they seem to think that\u2019s enough. But it\u2019s not. If you look at the Brits last night, most of the women who were nominated, especially in singles categories, were guest vocalists on male producers\u2019 songs. And you have Calvin Harris who\u2019s winning best producer \u2013 in the entire 27-year history of that prize, only two women have ever been nominated for it and, obviously, they\u2019ve never won. It\u2019s great that we have representation and gender equality but we have to think about the behind-the-scenes roles and how women are actually being allowed to use their voices. Spotify has made it so that this trope of the male producer track with the female guest vocalist on it \u2013 that\u2019s what pop music is now, and so it\u2019s refashioned A&amp;R, and that\u2019s what people want, it\u2019s what labels want, it\u2019s what female artists are being forced to do and it means that their voices are being heard, but they\u2019re only ever an adjunct to men. It stifles creativity, and it\u2019s demoralising, I think. For artists, I\u2019m sure, as well as listeners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69f0b2eee4435121989ce1a5d585c4fc55b46d26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69f0b2eee4435121989ce1a5d585c4fc55b46d26/983_0_2656_3320/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris accept the Brit award for best British single.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris accept the Brit award for best British single.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>MW:</strong> It\u2019s systemic, it\u2019s exactly what you said as well, Chris \u2013 it goes through the whole of music, and it has done for the last 50 years. It was a good moment last night that Matty, you used your platform, to actually say, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m not gonna go up and just say, \u2018Thanks to the label, thanks to whoever\u2019. I\u2019m gonna say this, I\u2019m gonna walk away and leave everybody who\u2019s watching to make their own decisions [and think:] \u2018Wow, what was that, where did that come from?\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>LS:</strong> Especially as, at last year\u2019s awards season, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/14/brit-awards-ask-guests-to-wear-white-rose-pins-to-support-metoo\">Time\u2019s Up and the white roses</a>, women have been making these comments at awards ceremonies \u2013 which is great, and I never want to underestimate that. But when women talk about misogyny, people don\u2019t listen, and so, like Chris was saying, having a powerful male ally who is willing to do that is important. It depresses me that that\u2019s the point [at which] people listen, but it\u2019s important that it happens.</p> <p><strong>C:</strong> It\u2019s useful, definitely.</p> <p><strong>MH:</strong> And my point, also, is that women need to be listened to. If it requires men to say it outright, that that behaviour is not tolerated, then there you go. It\u2019s not alright.</p> <p><strong>C:</strong> It becomes everybody\u2019s problem. It was great yesterday because of that. It was a real subject for everybody in the room, which was perfect, and the fact that you quoted the exact words of Laura was also respecting the original source of the voice, so it was the right thing. I think it felt right for many women in the room.</p> <p>\u2022 This conversation has been edited and abridged.</p> <p>\u2022 With thanks to Matt Wilkinson on Beats 1 on Apple\u2019s Beats 1.

      "bodyText": "When the 1975 won the best British group award at the Brits on Wednesday, singer Matty Healy used his acceptance speech to quote from an article by the Guardian\u2019s Laura Snapes about misogyny in the music industry. The next day, the two of them sat down with Chris of Christine and the Queens on Matt Wilkinson\u2019s Beats 1 radio show to talk about their personal experiences of sexism in the business, the need for male allies, where the industry should go from here and how soon we can expect its #MeToo movement.

So thank you so much for the words. MW: I kinda looked at it almost as if you were using your platform as a vessel to get a wider message, a bigger message across. MH: Of course, yeah. And it is frustrating, being in that room \u2013 if I was to speak about it, I wouldn\u2019t be speaking from ideology, I\u2019d be speaking from experience. Every man in that room knows a woman in that industry who has been at one time subject to misogynistic behaviour by a man when professionalism should have been at play. End of story. You have one of those anecdotes, I have one, I\u2019m sure everybody here has one, and it still happens. So that\u2019s a question that surely everyone, all men have to ask ourselves in our industry: why? It must be [because it\u2019s] permitted, somehow. MW: Do you guys think, and I wanna bring all of you in here, that we\u2019re heading towards a bit of a snowball moment in music and we might be seeing what happened with #MeToo in film finally happening in music? LS: I\u2019d like to think that it might start happening. I had a Damascene moment the day after the Ryan Adams news. When people say, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t #MeToo happened for music?\u201d, I think it\u2019s reasons like power isn\u2019t concentrated in individuals like Harvey Weinstein \u2013 there\u2019s not a big power broker like that \u2013 and also, as I wrote in the Ryan Adams piece, the myth of male genius props up music, and people are loth to pull that down. MH: It\u2019s so true, man. LS: But then I realised, I work at a national newspaper. We\u2019re in a position to do something about this. And I spoke to Joe Coscarelli, who was one of the authors of the New York Times\u2019s Ryan Adams report, and he said that, they sometimes lack the resources to do that kind of story, and most mainstream newspapers don\u2019t consider music a news item. I thought, we have to be the people who consider these stories a news item and go after them. MW: What you\u2019re saying, Laura, is exactly right. People slag off music journalism and say it\u2019s not as good as it used to be, but for me, it\u2019s better than it\u2019s ever been and it\u2019s getting to more people than ever before. MH: Our relationship, for example \u2013 there was a time when I said something wrong, just outright misinformed. I apologised for it publicly because I just said something that was a bit ignorant. Laura called me out on it and we had a dialogue behind closed doors about it. It seems that there\u2019s part of this relationship where if you accept that if you\u2019ve not done anything wrong, you\u2019ve not got anything to be scared of, and you shouldn\u2019t avoid criticism from those who have objectively different experiences than you do in things that probably you\u2019ll be less informed on. What\u2019s cool is that we\u2019ve established this dialogue where we\u2019re kinda like mates, but we\u2019d hold each other accountable for stuff. MW: The other important thing that I wanted to say to you guys, Chris and Matty, is I think we need more musicians taking a stand and using their platform to get this message across. That doesn\u2019t really happen enough, in my opinion. MH: Chris is the ultimate example of it. MW: Also you\u2019re so eloquent when you talk, you have great ideas. They\u2019re normal ideas that everybody really should have, but you put them across very, very openly. As do you, Matty. Chris: I think also the violence is systemic. As a musician myself, I encountered many, many, many moments of misogyny, also because some of the key technical places were occupied by men who couldn\u2019t see me, for example, as a producer. My whole career is made of moments where I had to fight five times more than maybe a man to say, \u201cActually, I can use my own computer, actually I am writing the tracks and I can produce them.\u201d I think it\u2019s really exhausting when you\u2019re a female trying to navigate in that reality, and I think sometimes it can be scary to take a stand, especially at first, when there were very few women talking about that, because then you\u2019re immediately pinpointed as, \u201cUgh, she\u2019s going to be the bitchy one who always opens her mouth.\u201d And then you\u2019re reduced again and you\u2019re made to maybe shut up more. So I think that the great thing is that with more allies that can actually help make this a problem for everybody in the industry, not just women, it gets more and more comfortable to speak about those things because it becomes more a safe space for everybody to express themselves. MW: This is what I mean by the #MeToo thing happening in music \u2013 even if I look back to your original article, Laura, in 2015 that came out, that was a different world back then. Things have moved on, it seems like we\u2019re in a better place now. We\u2019re not there. C: Not really. MW: But it feels like [we\u2019ve taken] one step in the right direction? MH: It so speaks volumes, doesn\u2019t it, that everybody, woke Twitter, everybody gets together on this statement that\u2019s very now and part of hopefully propping up some movement. But you\u2019ve been saying this for four years! LS: I\u2019ve been saying this for 10 years. Something I wrote about in that Ryan Adams piece: on one hand you\u2019ve got #MeToo-related issues and you\u2019ve got sexual harassment and direct examples of misogyny in the industry, but then you\u2019ve got all the systems that prop it up. I was saying these things nine years ago in my first job, and they didn\u2019t make me popular. You would point out that a bloke that we were potentially going to cover had a dodgy reputation, and you\u2019d be the person in trouble. We would still continue to cover the guy, and you\u2019d be more than in trouble. C: That\u2019s the problem, also. LS: And the thing that I really worry about at the moment is, the Brits is patting itself on the back over the fact that it\u2019s got 50-50 gender representation in its nominations and they seem to think that\u2019s enough. But it\u2019s not. If you look at the Brits last night, most of the women who were nominated, especially in singles categories, were guest vocalists on male producers\u2019 songs. And you have Calvin Harris who\u2019s winning best producer \u2013 in the entire 27-year history of that prize, only two women have ever been nominated for it and, obviously, they\u2019ve never won. It\u2019s great that we have representation and gender equality but we have to think about the behind-the-scenes roles and how women are actually being allowed to use their voices. Spotify has made it so that this trope of the male producer track with the female guest vocalist on it \u2013 that\u2019s what pop music is now, and so it\u2019s refashioned A&amp;R, and that\u2019s what people want, it\u2019s what labels want, it\u2019s what female artists are being forced to do and it means that their voices are being heard, but they\u2019re only ever an adjunct to men. It stifles creativity, and it\u2019s demoralising, I think. For artists, I\u2019m sure, as well as listeners. MW: It\u2019s systemic, it\u2019s exactly what you said as well, Chris \u2013 it goes through the whole of music, and it has done for the last 50 years. It was a good moment last night that Matty, you used your platform, to actually say, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m not gonna go up and just say, \u2018Thanks to the label, thanks to whoever\u2019. I\u2019m gonna say this, I\u2019m gonna walk away and leave everybody who\u2019s watching to make their own decisions [and think:] \u2018Wow, what was that, where did that come from?\u2019\u201d LS: Especially as, at last year\u2019s awards season, with Time\u2019s Up and the white roses, women have been making these comments at awards ceremonies \u2013 which is great, and I never want to underestimate that. But when women talk about misogyny, people don\u2019t listen, and so, like Chris was saying, having a powerful male ally who is willing to do that is important. It depresses me that that\u2019s the point [at which] people listen, but it\u2019s important that it happens. C: It\u2019s useful, definitely. MH: And my point, also, is that women need to be listened to. If it requires men to say it outright, that that behaviour is not tolerated, then there you go. It\u2019s not alright. C: It becomes everybody\u2019s problem. It was great yesterday because of that. It was a real subject for everybody in the room, which was perfect, and the fact that you quoted the exact words of Laura was also respecting the original source of the voice, so it was the right thing. I think it felt right for many women in the room. \u2022 This conversation has been edited and abridged. \u2022 With thanks to Matt Wilkinson on Beats 1 on Apple\u2019s Beats 1.

Chelsea may still be free to sign new players this summer, but their bargaining position would be weakened.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>What were the outcomes of similar appeals?&nbsp;</b>In 2014, Barcelona signed Luis Su\u00e1rez, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen while awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a similar ban, which was eventually upheld by Cas, leaving the Catalan club unable to buy players during 2015. The following year Real Madrid got a ban reduced by Cas to one transfer window. In 2017, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s two-window ban was confirmed by Cas. Chelsea have previously appealed successfully against a Fifa ban when, in 2009, Cas ruled that they were not guilty of wrongdoing when bringing Ga\u00ebl Kakuta from Rennes.</p>\n    <p><b>What does this mean for Chelsea\u2019s current squad?&nbsp;</b>If players such as Eden Hazard and Callum Hudson-Odi wish to leave this summer, they may find the exit blocked if the club is not allowed to sign new players. That, however, would allow them to leave for free the following summer when their contracts, like those of Willian and Pedro, expire. Players currently on loan at other clubs, such as Dujon Sterling, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham, could find more opportunities at Stamford Bridge.</p>\n    <p><b>Are any other Premier League likely to face similar punishment?&nbsp;</b>Fifa is investigating four Premier League clubs.

It wasn\u2019t that piercing sound.\u201d</p> <p>Davis said the hospital experimented with the new siren on four emergency vehicles in 2017. Drivers reported that people on the streets were just as responsive to the new sirens. \u201cWe said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we just change the whole fleet?\u2019 So we did.\u201d</p> <p>The hospital\u2019s 24 emergency vehicles zipped around the city with their new sirens, and many welcomed the change.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been better than it was.

      "bodyText": "With just the flip of a switch, the sound of New York\u2019s streets could change forever. New Yorkers are accustomed to hearing the rapid, pulsating \u201cwail\u201d and \u201cyelp\u201d sirens that echo around town. But for those who live near fire stations, police stations and hospitals, the sirens can seem like torture, and battles to keep stations out of an area are common. Now a fresh campaign is under way to introduce softer, two-tone, European-style sirens. A bill introduced in the New York city council this month would require all emergency vehicles to adopt the two-tone siren. \u201cPeople are very passionate about this issue,\u201d said Helen Rosenthal, the council member who introduced the bill. Rosenthal said she was inspired to take action after receiving positive feedback about one prominent network of hospitals that had found success with two-tone, high-low ambulance sirens. After numerous complaints about their ambulances, Mount Sinai sought to make its sirens less shrill but maintain their effectiveness. They called the manufacturers and were told they could switch things up \u2013 literally. \u201cApparently, by flipping some switches in the back of the siren, there are other tones available,\u201d said Joseph Davis, the senior director of Mount Sinai\u2019s emergency medical services in New York. \u201cHigh-low seemed to be more pleasing. It wasn\u2019t that piercing sound.\u201d Davis said the hospital experimented with the new siren on four emergency vehicles in 2017. Drivers reported that people on the streets were just as responsive to the new sirens. \u201cWe said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we just change the whole fleet?\u2019 So we did.\u201d The hospital\u2019s 24 emergency vehicles zipped around the city with their new sirens, and many welcomed the change. \u201cIt\u2019s been better than it was. It was really horrific for a while,\u201d said Roberta Semer, the chair of the Upper West Side\u2019s community advisory board. With the wail or yelp, she said, \u201cpeople are losing sleep, they can\u2019t go back to sleep, and they\u2019re obviously annoyed\u201d. Richard Neitzel, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan, said that loud sirens can have serious health effects. A build up of unpredictable and uncontrollable noises a person can lead to stress, anxiety and even cardiovascular disease. \u201cCities should be very concerned about the soundscape of the environment they\u2019re creating,\u201d Neitzel said. \u201cSirens are a piece of it.\u201d People likely find two-tone sirens more pleasing because they spread sound frequency across a longer time period than other sirens, Neitzel said. Comparatively, wail and yelp sirens produce a louder sound frequency at once. Not everyone agrees using two-tone sirens is the solution to New York\u2019s problem with noise. Some critics say that the volume of sirens, no matter the type, represents the biggest headache. Semer said: \u201cIf there\u2019s no traffic, there\u2019s no reason for a loud wail.\u201d Mount Sinai\u2019s emergency vehicles are so far the only ones in the city to switch to a two-tone siren. The fire and police department use classic American sirens in addition to a low-frequency siren called \u201cthe rumbler\u201d. That siren produces a bass-like sound that causes a slight vibration \u2013 the sensation is designed to capture people\u2019s attention just like a high-frequency siren would, but without the noise \u2013 as another way for police officers to get attention. In 2011, the NYPD rolled out the Rumbler sirens on all its police cars, to mixed reactions. A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said the mayor\u2019s office was considering the two-tone siren legislation. He said: \u201cOur city has always been ahead of the curve on transitioning our sirens to models that better protect New Yorkers\u2019 hearing.

It is, in effect, a tiny city. Across the globe, these mini metropolises are increasingly opting for a smart city approach. This is a tech-driven model that\u2019s used in places such as Barcelona, where street lamps react intelligently to surroundings to save energy; Seattle, where smart traffic lights respond to the conditions on the road; and even Milton Keynes, which has a real-time \u201cdata hub\u201d sharing information about the town\u2019s energy and water consumption, transport, weather and pollution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/14/universities-stamp-out-creativity-are-graduates-ready-for-work\">'Universities stamp out creativity': are graduates ready for work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Universities are taking notice. The US is leading the way, with on-campus innovations around energy (<a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/23/ut-austin-keeps-getting-bigger-its-energy-bills-an/\">the University of Texas at Austin has a fully independent grid</a> that provides all its energy), transport (the University of Michigan has introduced a <a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/u-of-michigan-to-implement-self-driving-shuttle-system/447560/\">self-driving shuttle system</a>) and information (<a href=\"https://www.commercialintegrator.com/digital_signage/digital_signage_software/university-of-minnesota-carousel-7-0-digital-signage-displays/\">the University of Minnesota has installed 300 digital signage boards</a>, updated with real-time data).</p> <p>UK institutions are following suit. The University of Glasgow has been working with innovation centre Future Cities Catapult on a strategy to <a href=\"https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/project/smart-campus-university-of-glasgow/\">bring smart tech to the campus</a> as it expands. The vision includes intelligent campus AI, an on-demand bus service and a data centre powered by renewable energy. It\u2019s not yet confirmed if all of these will be implemented, but according to Gemmy Ginty, one of the designers who worked on the strategy, universities are uniquely well placed to experiment.</p> <p>\u201cSmart cities are kind of slow-moving,\u201d she says. \u201cCities are so big, and there are so many players and stakeholders, it can be difficult. But universities have control over their estates. They own all the buildings, they own all the networks and they have a captive audience in terms of the students, so they can become like a living lab.\u201d</p> <p>Many UK universities are doing fascinating things with tech, she says, but are often operating in a siloed way, department by department, rather than in unison. It\u2019s something that Manchester Metropolitan University is attempting to address with its own smart campus plan, which unites six projects including engagement monitoring, digital wayfinding, lecture capture and cloud access.</p> <p>\u201cThe smart campus idea was first floated in spring 2016,\u201d says Tori Brown, the university\u2019s IT portfolio manager. \u201cAs more projects and initiatives kept coming to light, it felt right to bring these together to tell a story around student engagement and how we can use technology to support this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a continually evolving plan,\u201d she continues. \u201cThere are possibilities around smart kiosks with personalised information, true cross-campus digital and personalised wayfinding. These include wearable tech like smart watches and phones.

      "bodyText": "Think of a university campus: it has its own roads, shops, residential areas, banks and transport links. It may be visited by tens of thousands of people each day. It is, in effect, a tiny city. Across the globe, these mini metropolises are increasingly opting for a smart city approach. This is a tech-driven model that\u2019s used in places such as Barcelona, where street lamps react intelligently to surroundings to save energy; Seattle, where smart traffic lights respond to the conditions on the road; and even Milton Keynes, which has a real-time \u201cdata hub\u201d sharing information about the town\u2019s energy and water consumption, transport, weather and pollution. Universities are taking notice. The US is leading the way, with on-campus innovations around energy (the University of Texas at Austin has a fully independent grid that provides all its energy), transport (the University of Michigan has introduced a self-driving shuttle system) and information (the University of Minnesota has installed 300 digital signage boards, updated with real-time data). UK institutions are following suit. The University of Glasgow has been working with innovation centre Future Cities Catapult on a strategy to bring smart tech to the campus as it expands. The vision includes intelligent campus AI, an on-demand bus service and a data centre powered by renewable energy. It\u2019s not yet confirmed if all of these will be implemented, but according to Gemmy Ginty, one of the designers who worked on the strategy, universities are uniquely well placed to experiment. \u201cSmart cities are kind of slow-moving,\u201d she says. \u201cCities are so big, and there are so many players and stakeholders, it can be difficult. But universities have control over their estates. They own all the buildings, they own all the networks and they have a captive audience in terms of the students, so they can become like a living lab.\u201d Many UK universities are doing fascinating things with tech, she says, but are often operating in a siloed way, department by department, rather than in unison. It\u2019s something that Manchester Metropolitan University is attempting to address with its own smart campus plan, which unites six projects including engagement monitoring, digital wayfinding, lecture capture and cloud access. \u201cThe smart campus idea was first floated in spring 2016,\u201d says Tori Brown, the university\u2019s IT portfolio manager. \u201cAs more projects and initiatives kept coming to light, it felt right to bring these together to tell a story around student engagement and how we can use technology to support this.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a continually evolving plan,\u201d she continues. \u201cThere are possibilities around smart kiosks with personalised information, true cross-campus digital and personalised wayfinding. These include wearable tech like smart watches and phones. For example: \u2018You have a lecture in 10 minutes in Room X in Building Y, here\u2019s a map and directions\u2019; \u2018Have you remembered your assignment due in this class?\u2019; \u2018As you\u2019ve got time, if you leave now you can also take back that library book that\u2019s due for return tomorrow\u2019.\u201d Deakin University in Victoria, Australia has built and implemented a similar system, named Genie.

It probably doesn\u2019t count as a spoiler to tell you that Dr Guntram Shatterhand is a known alias of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, cropping up in You Only Live Twice. Although Blofeld escapes justice in that film, he dies at the end of the book on which it\u2019s based. Bond strangles him, and then blows up his castle for good measure.</p> <p>From this we can infer that Shatterhand could well see the return of Christoph Waltz\u2019s moodily underplayed Blofeld. It\u2019ll be a man-on-man fight to the death, like Holmes and Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. It will be an epic, satisfying conclusion that draws on decades of character knowledge. It will be everything any Bond fan has ever wanted.</p> <p>Then again, Shatterhand was also the name of a 1991 Nintendo game about a robot policeman who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1VCf_pDSKY\">goes around punching stuff</a> until it explodes, so maybe it will be about that. The title also borrows from the Old Shatterhand series of German cowboy novels from the 1800s. So, putting everything together, it would seem to suggest that Shatterhand will be about James Bond lassoing Blofeld with a lederhosen and punching him until he pops. Which would make it a thousand times better than Spectre.</p> <p>Even if that isn\u2019t the exact plot \u2013 in which case, more fool you, Sony \u2013 it\u2019ll still be better than Spectre. Ever since GoldenEye in 1995, the Bond series has only been able to make one good film every two attempts. This has never been more pronounced than with Daniel Craig in tow; of his four outings as Bond, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/10/jamesbond.danielcraig\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review\">third</a> were tremendous but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/18/jamesbond1\">second</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/21/spectre-review-james-bond-is-back-stylish-camp-and-sexily-pro-snowden\">fourth</a> might qualify as some of the series\u2019 very worst. So Shatterhand could feature Craig rollerskating downhill with a bucketload of glass hands and still rank in the top half of his output.</p> <p>Better yet, we know that Eon, the production company behind the series, sticks to a winning formula when it comes to titles. Two decades ago, for example, it found some success with Bond films whose titles were bizarre death-fixated gibberish: Die Another Day and Tomorrow Never Dies. In the 80s it went similarly murder-mad with A View to a Kill and Licence to Kill.</p> <p>So if Shatterhand is a success, then we know what the next few Bond films will be; they\u2019ll be named after a synonym for destruction and a part of the body. Perhaps next it\u2019ll be Trashtoe, or Crackback, or Smashmouth. If this is the case, may I humbly suggest Batterbum.</p>",

The title also borrows from the Old Shatterhand series of German cowboy novels from the 1800s. So, putting everything together, it would seem to suggest that Shatterhand will be about James Bond lassoing Blofeld with a lederhosen and punching him until he pops. Which would make it a thousand times better than Spectre. Even if that isn\u2019t the exact plot \u2013 in which case, more fool you, Sony \u2013 it\u2019ll still be better than Spectre. Ever since GoldenEye in 1995, the Bond series has only been able to make one good film every two attempts. This has never been more pronounced than with Daniel Craig in tow; of his four outings as Bond, the first and third were tremendous but the second and fourth might qualify as some of the series\u2019 very worst. So Shatterhand could feature Craig rollerskating downhill with a bucketload of glass hands and still rank in the top half of his output. Better yet, we know that Eon, the production company behind the series, sticks to a winning formula when it comes to titles. Two decades ago, for example, it found some success with Bond films whose titles were bizarre death-fixated gibberish: Die Another Day and Tomorrow Never Dies. In the 80s it went similarly murder-mad with A View to a Kill and Licence to Kill. So if Shatterhand is a success, then we know what the next few Bond films will be; they\u2019ll be named after a synonym for destruction and a part of the body. Perhaps next it\u2019ll be Trashtoe, or Crackback, or Smashmouth. If this is the case, may I humbly suggest Batterbum.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>There had been so much speculation that had come to nothing in recent weeks about Labour and Tory MPs resigning the whip to form a new party that I was rather wrong-footed to get an email at 8am saying it was actually happening on the Labour side and I needed to be in central London in the next hour. The launch was a curious affair at a rented office space in Etc Venues \u2013 not quite the gravitas of the Social Democratic party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jan/21/labour.liberaldemocrats\">Limehouse Declaration</a> \u2013 and felt more funereal than celebratory. Still, it was definitely a result for Gavin Williamson and Chris Grayling, as the press attention on the Independent Group (TIG) meant everyone missed their latest embarrassments in the Commons. At defence questions, Private Pike couldn\u2019t stop himself from doubling down on his threat to go to war with China \u2013 to the embarrassment of everyone on his own benches \u2013 and then appeared to be totally unaware that by voting for the Brady amendment he had actually voted against the prime minister\u2019s own deal. Grayling couldn\u2019t even bring himself to face his latest humiliation and just stayed silent while a junior minister tried to explain why Flybmi was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/16/flybmi-collapses-blaming-brexit-uncertainty\">the latest airline</a> to go out of business. Presumably Grayling couldn\u2019t quite believe there was a sector of the transport sector that had failed without his active intervention.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Full disclosure. The Bafta-winning documentary director Olivia Lichtenstein is a good friend of mine; even so, I can\u2019t recommend her new film highly enough. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/22/teddy-pendergrass-if-you-dont-know-me-review-documentary\">Teddy Pendergrass: If You Don\u2019t Know Me</a> had its UK premiere at the British Film Institute this week. Like all the best films about musicians, this was about so much more than the music. Pendergrass is a soul enigma. Despite selling countless platinum albums, he remains something of a cult figure. And those who thought they knew him often found later that they didn\u2019t. Told through family, friends, band members and archive footage, the film takes you from the segregation and gang culture of the early 1960s in Philadelphia to the corruption of the music industry, the excesses of the 1970s and the tragedy of the car accident that left him paralysed as he was poised to become one of the US\u2019s biggest crossover stars. His life was full of many unanswered questions. How he slipped under the radar despite being the distinctive voice of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. The unexplained murder of his first manager and the mystery of his car crash: some believe his brakes were tampered with, others that his green Rolls-Royce was faulty. The most poignant scene was the interview with the singer\u2019s shrink \u2013 \u201cI wasn\u2019t the best therapist, but I was the only quadriplegic therapist\u201d \u2013 who, after Pendergrass repeatedly voiced his determination to kill himself, persuaded him to hold a funeral for himself first. When Teddy felt the love \u2013 and anger \u2013 of those around him, he chose to live instead. Please do see the movie. You will love it.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m feeling my age. My parents brought me up to believe a mattress was supposed to last you a lifetime. Or thereabouts. I think they both slept on the same one for most of the 50 years they were married, and as far as I can remember I have only had three. The first was the one I had as a child. The second was a distinctly unpleasant one that came with the cheap double bed I got when I left home. The third I bought with the money my father left me when he died 20 years ago. I kept quiet about it because both my wife and I thought \u00a3900 was a ludicrous amount to spend on a mattress. Almost from the off, my wife complained about it, insisting it made her back worse, but I bullishly insisted it was the world\u2019s best \u2013 even though I too didn\u2019t find it that wonderful \u2013 because I didn\u2019t want to take the blame for having wasted so much money. Eventually, two decades on, even I cracked and we now have a new mattress that actually gives us both a half-decent night\u2019s sleep, even if it hasn\u2019t eradicated my anxiety dreams. But I now realise I\u2019ve been living in an unnecessary state of self-deprivation, because I\u2019ve discovered most other people these days seem to change their mattresses every 10 years or so. I\u2019ve been living an old person\u2019s life. I am my mother, who refused to engage with the internet and then complained she could never talk to her grandchildren.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>On slow days in parliament \u2013 and they don\u2019t come much slower than the Thursday of a recess that has been cancelled to make it look like the government is doing something, but for which no meaningful business has been scheduled \u2013 I often pass the time by looking around the backbenches and seeing how many MPs I can name. There are a surprising number I can\u2019t remember having ever seen before. In the five years I have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/the-politics-sketch\">the Guardian\u2019s sketchwriter</a> they have done nothing to attract attention. It rather makes me wonder how they ever became MPs. Most constituencies \u2013 especially those that are safe seats \u2013 have highly competitive selection procedures, but it is hard to imagine these MPs having been impressive at the various rounds of interviews. Maybe the other candidates were even worse. I was reminded of this when Labour\u2019s newly selected candidate to become the North of Tyne mayor, Jamie Driscoll, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joepike/status/1098250673035071490\">gave a TV interview</a> in which he couldn\u2019t manage a coherent sentence. Asked about Brexit, his best guess was that \u201cwe need a Brexit\u201d. When the interviewer said he sounded confused, he only became more confused and was unable to answer whether he was for or against Brexit. The one-minute clip has already become a classic. Still, if Driscoll doesn\u2019t make it as mayor, he has potential as a standup comedian.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>When the treasures of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb were first on show in the UK in 1972 \u2013 the 50th anniversary of their discovery \u2013 I was 15 and my school organised a coach trip to see the exhibition at the British Museum. I\u2019ve retained a fascination with ancient Egypt ever since. Twelve years ago we went on a family holiday to Luxor to see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/09/mummies-tomb-ancient-egypt-valley-of-the-kings\">Valley of the Kings</a> \u2013 during which I was forced to take a terrifying hot-air balloon trip over the Nile (among many other neuroses, I also suffer from vertigo) with my 11-year-old son \u2013 and visited all the open tombs. Even though Tutankhamun\u2019s is only an exact replica \u2013 the original is sealed to preserve it from being destroyed by exposure to light and contact with tourists \u2013 I still felt a sense of wonder at the achievements of a civilisation more than 3,300 years old. But in many ways the highlight of our holiday was a trip to the main museum in Cairo. Alongside the golden death masks, there was just so much other stuff that artefacts that in many other museums would have a room to themselves were crammed in next to each other. Mummies were literally piled up in every corner. The sense of history as a living connection to the past, rather than as a series of carefully curated artefacts, was incredibly powerful. So I\u2019m thrilled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/21/largest-ever-tutankhamun-display-coming-to-london\">it\u2019s just been announced</a> that the Tutankhamun exhibition will be coming back to the UK next year. I\u2019m ready to be amazed all over again.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: </strong>TIG-ers don\u2019t jump.

The launch was a curious affair at a rented office space in Etc Venues \u2013 not quite the gravitas of the Social Democratic party\u2019s Limehouse Declaration \u2013 and felt more funereal than celebratory. Still, it was definitely a result for Gavin Williamson and Chris Grayling, as the press attention on the Independent Group (TIG) meant everyone missed their latest embarrassments in the Commons. At defence questions, Private Pike couldn\u2019t stop himself from doubling down on his threat to go to war with China \u2013 to the embarrassment of everyone on his own benches \u2013 and then appeared to be totally unaware that by voting for the Brady amendment he had actually voted against the prime minister\u2019s own deal. Grayling couldn\u2019t even bring himself to face his latest humiliation and just stayed silent while a junior minister tried to explain why Flybmi was the latest airline to go out of business. Presumably Grayling couldn\u2019t quite believe there was a sector of the transport sector that had failed without his active intervention. Tuesday Full disclosure. The Bafta-winning documentary director Olivia Lichtenstein is a good friend of mine; even so, I can\u2019t recommend her new film highly enough. Teddy Pendergrass: If You Don\u2019t Know Me had its UK premiere at the British Film Institute this week. Like all the best films about musicians, this was about so much more than the music. Pendergrass is a soul enigma. Despite selling countless platinum albums, he remains something of a cult figure. And those who thought they knew him often found later that they didn\u2019t. Told through family, friends, band members and archive footage, the film takes you from the segregation and gang culture of the early 1960s in Philadelphia to the corruption of the music industry, the excesses of the 1970s and the tragedy of the car accident that left him paralysed as he was poised to become one of the US\u2019s biggest crossover stars. His life was full of many unanswered questions. How he slipped under the radar despite being the distinctive voice of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. The unexplained murder of his first manager and the mystery of his car crash: some believe his brakes were tampered with, others that his green Rolls-Royce was faulty. The most poignant scene was the interview with the singer\u2019s shrink \u2013 \u201cI wasn\u2019t the best therapist, but I was the only quadriplegic therapist\u201d \u2013 who, after Pendergrass repeatedly voiced his determination to kill himself, persuaded him to hold a funeral for himself first. When Teddy felt the love \u2013 and anger \u2013 of those around him, he chose to live instead. Please do see the movie. You will love it. Wednesday I\u2019m feeling my age. My parents brought me up to believe a mattress was supposed to last you a lifetime. Or thereabouts. I think they both slept on the same one for most of the 50 years they were married, and as far as I can remember I have only had three. The first was the one I had as a child. The second was a distinctly unpleasant one that came with the cheap double bed I got when I left home. The third I bought with the money my father left me when he died 20 years ago. I kept quiet about it because both my wife and I thought \u00a3900 was a ludicrous amount to spend on a mattress. Almost from the off, my wife complained about it, insisting it made her back worse, but I bullishly insisted it was the world\u2019s best \u2013 even though I too didn\u2019t find it that wonderful \u2013 because I didn\u2019t want to take the blame for having wasted so much money. Eventually, two decades on, even I cracked and we now have a new mattress that actually gives us both a half-decent night\u2019s sleep, even if it hasn\u2019t eradicated my anxiety dreams. But I now realise I\u2019ve been living in an unnecessary state of self-deprivation, because I\u2019ve discovered most other people these days seem to change their mattresses every 10 years or so. I\u2019ve been living an old person\u2019s life. I am my mother, who refused to engage with the internet and then complained she could never talk to her grandchildren. Thursday On slow days in parliament \u2013 and they don\u2019t come much slower than the Thursday of a recess that has been cancelled to make it look like the government is doing something, but for which no meaningful business has been scheduled \u2013 I often pass the time by looking around the backbenches and seeing how many MPs I can name. There are a surprising number I can\u2019t remember having ever seen before. In the five years I have been the Guardian\u2019s sketchwriter they have done nothing to attract attention. It rather makes me wonder how they ever became MPs. Most constituencies \u2013 especially those that are safe seats \u2013 have highly competitive selection procedures, but it is hard to imagine these MPs having been impressive at the various rounds of interviews. Maybe the other candidates were even worse. I was reminded of this when Labour\u2019s newly selected candidate to become the North of Tyne mayor, Jamie Driscoll, gave a TV interview in which he couldn\u2019t manage a coherent sentence. Asked about Brexit, his best guess was that \u201cwe need a Brexit\u201d. When the interviewer said he sounded confused, he only became more confused and was unable to answer whether he was for or against Brexit. The one-minute clip has already become a classic. Still, if Driscoll doesn\u2019t make it as mayor, he has potential as a standup comedian. Friday When the treasures of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb were first on show in the UK in 1972 \u2013 the 50th anniversary of their discovery \u2013 I was 15 and my school organised a coach trip to see the exhibition at the British Museum. I\u2019ve retained a fascination with ancient Egypt ever since. Twelve years ago we went on a family holiday to Luxor to see the Valley of the Kings \u2013 during which I was forced to take a terrifying hot-air balloon trip over the Nile (among many other neuroses, I also suffer from vertigo) with my 11-year-old son \u2013 and visited all the open tombs. Even though Tutankhamun\u2019s is only an exact replica \u2013 the original is sealed to preserve it from being destroyed by exposure to light and contact with tourists \u2013 I still felt a sense of wonder at the achievements of a civilisation more than 3,300 years old. But in many ways the highlight of our holiday was a trip to the main museum in Cairo. Alongside the golden death masks, there was just so much other stuff that artefacts that in many other museums would have a room to themselves were crammed in next to each other. Mummies were literally piled up in every corner. The sense of history as a living connection to the past, rather than as a series of carefully curated artefacts, was incredibly powerful. So I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s just been announced that the Tutankhamun exhibition will be coming back to the UK next year. I\u2019m ready to be amazed all over again. Digested week, digested: TIG-ers don\u2019t jump. They bounce.",

      "body": "<p>Fairtrade coffee, tea, chocolate and bananas are familiar to us all \u2013 those commodities from developing countries where farmers and workers are often treated poorly by global traders. The Fairtrade label reassures us that growers receive a fair price for their crops, and that pickers and packers are paid living wages, and have their rights protected. </p> <p>The Fairtrade logo also appears on some wines, but here its use is less straightforward. Wine is made in at least 50 countries around the world, but only four subscribe to Fairtrade labelling: South Africa, Argentina, Chile and Lebanon. Apartheid in South Africa left a legacy of shocking conditions, low wages and inadequate housing among the black population working in the wine industry, as well as grossly unequal land distribution, and the Fairtrade stamp here guarantees decent working conditions and wages, as well as prohibiting child labour and gender discrimination. Often, the Fairtrade premium funds educational and community projects as well.</p> <p>Chile and Argentina\u2019s wine regions, meanwhile, have long histories of cooperatives, many of which are struggling to survive. Low market prices mean many small-scale farmers live in great poverty and are at the mercy of unscrupulous employers and buyers, and Fairtrade standards ensure a reasonable minimum price for grapes, as well as investment in farming practices, education and healthcare.</p> <p>Lebanon has only one Fairtrade wine \u2013 <strong>C\u00f4teaux les C\u00e8dres du Liban</strong>, from the Bekaa valley (\u00a312 Co-Op, \u00a315.77 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coteaux-Cedres-Liban-2013-Wine/dp/B00KQHUGL0\" title=\"\">Amazon</a>, 13.5%). In a region better known for cannabis cultivation, this project encourages farmers to switch to grapes, so offering them a more sustainable and stable future.</p> <p>While all this is laudable, it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.

      "bodyText": "Fairtrade coffee, tea, chocolate and bananas are familiar to us all \u2013 those commodities from developing countries where farmers and workers are often treated poorly by global traders. The Fairtrade label reassures us that growers receive a fair price for their crops, and that pickers and packers are paid living wages, and have their rights protected. The Fairtrade logo also appears on some wines, but here its use is less straightforward. Wine is made in at least 50 countries around the world, but only four subscribe to Fairtrade labelling: South Africa, Argentina, Chile and Lebanon. Apartheid in South Africa left a legacy of shocking conditions, low wages and inadequate housing among the black population working in the wine industry, as well as grossly unequal land distribution, and the Fairtrade stamp here guarantees decent working conditions and wages, as well as prohibiting child labour and gender discrimination. Often, the Fairtrade premium funds educational and community projects as well. Chile and Argentina\u2019s wine regions, meanwhile, have long histories of cooperatives, many of which are struggling to survive. Low market prices mean many small-scale farmers live in great poverty and are at the mercy of unscrupulous employers and buyers, and Fairtrade standards ensure a reasonable minimum price for grapes, as well as investment in farming practices, education and healthcare. Lebanon has only one Fairtrade wine \u2013 C\u00f4teaux les C\u00e8dres du Liban, from the Bekaa valley (\u00a312 Co-Op, \u00a315.77 Amazon, 13.5%). In a region better known for cannabis cultivation, this project encourages farmers to switch to grapes, so offering them a more sustainable and stable future. While all this is laudable, it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. While brands of, say, tea or chocolate that don\u2019t display the badge implicitly fail to meet Fairtrade standards, the same cannot be said for wine producers. Most wine-making countries have such legislation in place anyway \u2013 certainly those in the EU, the Antipodes and North America \u2013 so to suggest their wines fail to meet Fairtrade standards because they don\u2019t wear the label is simply wrong. Similarly, there are non-Fairtrade producers in Chile, Argentina, South Africa and Lebanon that operate to standards above and beyond those required for certification. As with all ethical labelling, Fairtrade is no indicator of quality, but Fairtrade Fortnight, which starts on 25 February, is as good a reason as any to explore new wines from the moral high ground. Four to try for Fairtrade Fortnight Don David Malbec \u00a39 Co-op, 14%. From Argentina\u2019s high Calchaqu\u00ed Valley, meaty but not too muscly; eat with steak. Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Azana White Blend \u00a39, Sainsbury, 13.5%. Like a tropical fruit salad with a spritz of lime; great value from this well-respected South-African producer. Co-op Irresistible Sauvignon Blanc \u00a36, Co-op 12%. Perfectly serviceable; profits go to funding local after-school clubs. Cape Original Moscato Ros\u00e9 \u00a34.49 Aldi, 5.5%. Strawberries, cream and candyfloss, and only 5.5% abv; sweet, fluffy \u2013 and great with Asian spices. \u2022 Kate Hawkings is a drinks writer.

In a post on social media, Time\u2019s Up said: \u201cOn Friday, Lisa Borders informed members of Time\u2019s Up leadership that sexual assault allegations had been made against her son in a private forum. Within 24 hours, Lisa made the decision to resign as president and CEO of Time\u2019s Up and we agreed that it was the right decision for all parties involved.\u201d The Los Angeles Times reports a woman claimed Borders\u2019 son touched her inappropriately during a \u201chealing session\u201d.

This intense fantasy scene was painted after Manet and the impressionists had brought a new urban realism to French art. Is it a backward step? On the contrary. Moreau is the artist par excellence of the inward turn in late 19th-century art. Similarly to his contemporaries Edvard Munch and Aubrey Beardsley, he creates introspective symbolic dreamscapes. His luscious paint tumbles in sensual cascades and fades into abstract reveries.

Also showing Facing Out Sensitive portraits by Lucy Burscough of people who have had facial cancer, created during a residency at the Christie Hospital. \u2022 Whitworth, Manchester until 2 June. John Bellany and Alan Davie Two contrasting painters, Bellany, a figurative artist, and Davie, a follower of abstract expressionism, add up to an interesting take on modern British art. \u2022 Newport Street Gallery, 27 February-1 September. Spare Parts Artists and scientists explore what it means to replace parts of the human body. \u2022 Science Gallery, London, 28 February-12 May. Boilly: Scenes of Parisian Life Paintings of French society in the age of Napoleon and the Romantic movement. \u2022 National Gallery, London, 28 February-19 May. Masterpiece of the Week St George and the Dragon, 1889-90, by Gustave Moreau A knight in glistening metallic-blue armour spears a reptilian monster in a dreamlike landscape ... but hang on. This intense fantasy scene was painted after Manet and the impressionists had brought a new urban realism to French art. Is it a backward step? On the contrary. Moreau is the artist par excellence of the inward turn in late 19th-century art. Similarly to his contemporaries Edvard Munch and Aubrey Beardsley, he creates introspective symbolic dreamscapes. His luscious paint tumbles in sensual cascades and fades into abstract reveries. This is a surrealist painting before surrealism. \u2022 National Gallery, London. Image of the week Fen Court, a new office block in the City of London which opened last week, is one of the most well-crafted buildings the City has seen for some time, writes Oliver Wainwright. Designed by Eric Parry Architects, its free-to-enter roof garden offers one of the most exhilarating vantage points in central London.

Riffing on characters from Norse mythology, it tells the story of Hel, illegitimate daughter of the mischievous Loki, who is born with a normal human torso but with legs that are dead and decaying.</p> <p>Hel narrates her tale: she is rejected at birth by her parents and banished to the underworld by Odin, king of the gods, where she rules over the dead. There she grows up, nurturing her resentment and brooding on her unrequited love for Baldr, Odin\u2019s son. But when Baldr is killed and enters Hel\u2019s realm, she gains her revenge, refusing Odin\u2019s pleas to return his son to the living and so ensuring the destruction of the gods \u2013 yet offering the possibility of a new beginning for the world.</p> <p>It\u2019s a plot dense with detail but Simon\u2019s tight, wittily macabre text conveys it clearly. The opera lasts just two hours, including interval; nothing is extraneous \u2013 only the ending seems a bit soggy. Higgins\u2019 score is equally taut, never overloading the telling vocal lines with instrumental writing and generating huge power from the 10-piece ensemble (the Aurora Orchestra under <a href=\"https://www.jessicacottis.com/\">Jessica Cottis</a>) in the interludes. <a href=\"https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/timothy-sheader\">Timothy Sheader</a>\u2019s production, designed by Paul Wills, is equally lucid, using puppets to depict Hel\u2019s birth and the monstrous child\u2019s early years, but it becomes more conventionally operatic and straightforward as the work goes on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6243e900e46175b1e4fde903a5cffe0775ac481e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6243e900e46175b1e4fde903a5cffe0775ac481e/0_0_6437_4472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosie Aldridge as Angrboda in The Monstrous Child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosie Aldridge as Angrboda in The Monstrous Child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As an operatic debut for Higgins, it is tremendously accomplished, and there are some hugely impressive individual stage performances, especially from the mezzo <a href=\"https://www.martafontanals.com/\">Marta Fontanals-Simmons</a>, who is on stage throughout as Hel. She dominates, though Lucy Schaufer also makes a real character out of Modgud, the giant who guards the bridge into the realm of the dead. There are vivid cameos from Rosie Aldridge and Tom Randle as Hel\u2019s parents, Angrboda and Loki, and from Graeme Broadbent as Odin and Dan Shelvey as Baldr. But it\u2019s Fontanals-Simmons\u2019s show, and very much Higgins\u2019s too.</p> <p>\u2022 The Monstrous Child is at Linbury theatre, London, <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-monstrous-child-by-timothy-sheader\">until 3 March.</a> Box office: 020-7304 4000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first opera to open in the Royal Opera House\u2019s refurbished and much improved studio space is a world premiere. Gavin Higgins\u2019 The Monstrous Child is based upon the book by Francesca Simon, who extracted the libretto from her bestselling teen novel. Riffing on characters from Norse mythology, it tells the story of Hel, illegitimate daughter of the mischievous Loki, who is born with a normal human torso but with legs that are dead and decaying. Hel narrates her tale: she is rejected at birth by her parents and banished to the underworld by Odin, king of the gods, where she rules over the dead. There she grows up, nurturing her resentment and brooding on her unrequited love for Baldr, Odin\u2019s son. But when Baldr is killed and enters Hel\u2019s realm, she gains her revenge, refusing Odin\u2019s pleas to return his son to the living and so ensuring the destruction of the gods \u2013 yet offering the possibility of a new beginning for the world. It\u2019s a plot dense with detail but Simon\u2019s tight, wittily macabre text conveys it clearly. The opera lasts just two hours, including interval; nothing is extraneous \u2013 only the ending seems a bit soggy. Higgins\u2019 score is equally taut, never overloading the telling vocal lines with instrumental writing and generating huge power from the 10-piece ensemble (the Aurora Orchestra under Jessica Cottis) in the interludes. Timothy Sheader\u2019s production, designed by Paul Wills, is equally lucid, using puppets to depict Hel\u2019s birth and the monstrous child\u2019s early years, but it becomes more conventionally operatic and straightforward as the work goes on. As an operatic debut for Higgins, it is tremendously accomplished, and there are some hugely impressive individual stage performances, especially from the mezzo Marta Fontanals-Simmons, who is on stage throughout as Hel. She dominates, though Lucy Schaufer also makes a real character out of Modgud, the giant who guards the bridge into the realm of the dead. There are vivid cameos from Rosie Aldridge and Tom Randle as Hel\u2019s parents, Angrboda and Loki, and from Graeme Broadbent as Odin and Dan Shelvey as Baldr. But it\u2019s Fontanals-Simmons\u2019s show, and very much Higgins\u2019s too. \u2022 The Monstrous Child is at Linbury theatre, London, until 3 March. Box office: 020-7304 4000.",

      "body": "<p>Journalism has joined the list of endangered professions: teaching it appears to be more lucrative than doing it. A great deal of brilliant and high-quality journalism is still being pursued around the world every day, but the news industry is steadily shrinking. Why is that?</p> <p>Let\u2019s make a distinction here between journalism and news. News is only one of the many kinds of journalistic output. News as a standardised, non-fiction literary form was invented more than 200 years ago in response to very specific social and cultural conditions, and was ignited by a new technology called the telegraph. The invention of the electric telegraph in the 1830s allowed the fast and international transmission of bursts of information in short, staccato messages, which were, ironically, not unlike tweets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Without the institutions of democracy, journalists are reduced to propagandists or entertainers</p> <footer> <cite>James W Carey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The telegraph brought news of elections, wars, disasters, crimes, weddings and deaths to people\u2019s kitchen tables; it was how the world found out about the assassination of president Abraham Lincoln in 1865. The arrival of instant news transported the middle class from a local perspective to a global one, from a generalised view of the world to one full of specifics, and from a world centred on fiction to one grounded in fact. News became how the middle class positioned itself in the expanding wider world and claimed a distinct cultural identity. This hunger for news was a cultural response to a prevailing sociopolitical environment.</p> <p>Today, nearly every one of those cultural conditions has changed. So, if the context of what we called \u201cnews\u201d for nearly two centuries has radically altered, is news still functioning as it should? What is its role supposed to be, and what purpose is it fulfilling? Is news still relevant at all?</p> <p>We all know that today the news industry is in trouble. Weekday circulation for US daily newspapers, print and digital combined, fell to 35 million in 2016, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/01/circulation-and-revenue-fall-for-newspaper-industry/\" title=\"\">according to the Pew Research Center </a>\u2013 the lowest circulation since 1945, despite the population nearly tripling during those 70-plus years. This year began with a thousand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/26/huffpost-buzzfeed-layoffs-digital-journalism\" title=\"\">job losses</a> at once-burgeoning digital journalism ventures BuzzFeed and Huffington Post. News businesses have been grappling with imploding business models for more than a decade. New internet technologies empowered new players \u2013 mainly Google and Facebook \u2013 that have claimed control of distribution and the advertising revenue that goes with it. </p> <p>Meanwhile, inspired partly by Donald Trump, politicians from Myanmar to Libya and from Syria to Spain now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/12/bbc-cameraman-shoved-and-abused-at-trump-rally-in-el-paso\" title=\"\">openly attack reporters</a>, calling them \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cbiased\u201d, accusing them of twisting reality. The public, meanwhile, sees journalists as too soft on power or too close to the wealthy and don\u2019t trust what they perceive as conflicts of interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b310cc660a7079da08974bb947faa6b68335cec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b310cc660a7079da08974bb947faa6b68335cec9/0_128_3432_2609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds gather at the entrance to the Daily Express building, Fleet Street, London, to greet English aviator Amy Johnson in December 1932.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds gather at the entrance to the Daily Express building, Fleet Street, London, to greet English aviator Amy Johnson in December 1932.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: London Express/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is true that some serious news organisations have recently seen increases in paid subscription services. The New York Times recently claimed to have nearly doubled its number of subscribers to 3.5 million. And, thanks to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/nov/12/katharine-viner-guardian-million-reader-funding\" title=\"\">reader funding model</a>, the Guardian has now received financial support from more than a million readers around the world. </p> <p>Subscriptions don\u2019t directly equate to readership, however; it\u2019s valuable regular income, but how many stories do subscribers read beyond the headline news? And how many renew their subscriptions? And is it, in the US at any rate, a temporary anomaly, a \u201cTrump bump\u201d of people who regard the cost as a monthly fee of the anti-Trump resistance?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/16/a-mission-for-journalism-in-a-time-of-crisis\">A mission for journalism in a time of crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d rhetoric coincides with a turning away from globalisation and the faltering of global institutions and geopolitical aspirations, the closing of borders and the rise of nationalism.</p> <p>News, both as a commodity and as a cultural invention, has also been affected by \u201cdeglobalisation\u201d, as evidenced by the declining coverage of international news. By 2010, the frequency of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2010/nov/01/world-news-foreign\" title=\"\">foreign coverage in four British newspapers</a> and the number of <a href=\"http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=3409\" title=\"\">foreign news stories in the United States</a> had nearly halved over three decades. Foreign reporting now tends to be limited to issues directly tied to national interests, such as war or terrorism. \u201cIn 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell, ABC, CBS, and NBC devoted a combined 4,828 minutes to international news,\u201d <a href=\"http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=4985\" title=\"\">reported the American Journalism Review </a>in 2011. \u201cBy 2000, after more than a decade of steady decline, the three networks aired only 2,127 minutes of international news during newscasts.\u201d A decline that became noticeable with the end of the cold war continued even after the 9/11 attacks and the consequent global war on terror.</p> <p>But this shift away from a global outlook is both geopolitical and social. It is a move inward, manifesting itself in many ways, including technology. I\u2019ve written before about the <a href=\"https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426\" title=\"\">decline of hyperlinks</a>, and how consequently the web reflects a cultural shift from outward to inward, from the global to the local.</p> <p>Yet despite this trend toward all things local, there has been no apparent surge of support for local politics or local newspapers. A recent report commissioned by the UK government warns about the coming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/11/public-funds-should-be-used-to-rescue-local-journalism-says-report\" title=\"\">demise of local news</a> without direct public funding. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-cairncross-review-a-sustainable-future-for-journalism\" title=\"\">Cairncross Review</a> acknowledges that \u201cthe stories people want to read may not always be the ones that they ought to read\u201d, referring to the scrutiny of the local public servants. In the US, local newspapers have consistently shrunk and, as Margaret Sullivan <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2flifestyle%2fstyle%2ftension-between-trump-and-the-media-thats-nothing-compared-to-journalisms-worst-crisis%2f2017%2f09%2f29%2f0589a8ea-a50e-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html%3f&amp;utm_term=.15938bb1a161\" title=\"\">wrote</a> in the Washington Post in 2017, are now on the verge of \u201cextinction\u201d, implying a lack of wider interest in local elections \u2013 and even in the process of participatory democracy itself.</p> <p>If you asked me how the appetite for the \u201clocal\u201d is manifesting itself in news, I would have a surprising answer: friends and family. Facebook\u2019s decision to prioritise updates from friends and family in the news feed was both a reaction to political pressure over the spread of disinformation, and a hint at what its gigantic global audience regards as the most valuable news. Updates about births, deaths, marriages, babies and other family life events are what constitute local news for many people. The popularity of Instagram or Snapchat stories is built around these interpersonal audiovisual diaries about people\u2019s lives. Celebrity news is another way this \u201clocal\u201d interest is manifesting itself. Perhaps we regard celebrities as cousins we don\u2019t see any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8b1e7cc7a0a9760ea86a29bc33e12f83a366224b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b1e7cc7a0a9760ea86a29bc33e12f83a366224b/398_206_2396_3535/678.jpg\" alt=\"A London news vendor, carrying news of the Hindenburg disaster Fleet Street, London, May 1937.\" width=\"678\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A London news vendor, carrying news of the Hindenburg disaster Fleet Street, London, May 1937.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>News was never just about transmitting information. When we read news about climate change, or corrupt politicians, we not only become aware of the details of what has happened, but feel ourselves caught up in the drama. We take sides, and we want our side to win.</p> <p>As scholars like <a href=\"https://books.wwnorton.com/books/webad.aspx?id=23170\" title=\"\">Michael Schudson</a> and John Fiske explored, news is by nature a drama with a calm beginning, a disruption at its core, and the prospect of a resolution at its end.</p> <p>Journalists want their readers to ask their partners or colleagues, \u201cDid you hear \u2026?\u201d They want to be the reason people talk.</p> <p>But that function is now in serious decline. Consumption of information has become a very individual act thanks to mobile devices. The days when you sat down to read a morning paper or watched an evening news bulletin have, for many people, passed. Cinema, TV and, more recently, binge-watching on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon have slowly come to dominate the market demand for drama. Just as in the 1830s, when the telegraph made reporting independent of time and space and the production of news possible from anywhere, it was the shift to mobile internet and smartphones that freed the <em>distribution</em> of news from the tyranny of location and time. Now anyone can receive news at any time and in almost any place.</p> <p>This has led to a bifurcation. On one side, we have notifications \u2013 short blasts of information often directly from the newsmakers themselves. Think of tweets by fire or police departments, politicians, or big companies. They are bypassing news organisations. On the other side, we have long, collaborative, detailed and expensively produced reporting and investigations that can take months or years. This longform journalism is far more expensive and in-depth than the news stories that have dominated journalism for a long time, functioning more like non-fiction literature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2caa1823357ec7f8f6e36998a567ecac406f78af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2caa1823357ec7f8f6e36998a567ecac406f78af/0_43_2834_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A South Wales Argus newsstand in Newport, south Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A South Wales Argus newsstand in Newport, south Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Morgan 02/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is left in the space between these two is an increasingly less viable form of news. Many newsrooms have spent the past decade pouring time and journalistic resources into churning out <a href=\"https://medium.com/bbc-news-labs/beyond-800-words-new-digital-story-formats-for-news-ab9b2a2d0e0d\" title=\"\">800-word duplicate versions of news</a> reports already available on other news sites. It makes little strategic, or financial, sense any more. Mid-length articles that are making money for some publishers are not news stories, but opinion pieces.</p> <p>But if buffeted by the twin forces of entertainment and propaganda, news is dying, how can journalism \u2013 and thereby democracy \u2013 survive?</p> <p>I see hope in three narrative formats: audio (including documentary podcasting), video and non-fiction \u201cliterature\u201d.</p> <p>Radio, and the podcast in particular, is a hybrid medium. Word-based and therefore capable of empowering rational arguments and elevating serious conversations, it can also convey depth of emotion. Spotify recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/06/spotify-buys-podcast-firms-gimlet-and-anchor-streaming-profits-music\" title=\"\">acquired two podcast firms</a> and is planning to spend up to $500m (\u00a3385m) on further acquisitions. The New York Times\u2019s The Daily podcast has gained 6.5 million monthly listeners and increasingly follows a documentary dramatic structure. No wonder The Guardian has launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/todayinfocus\" title=\"\">Today in Focus</a>, its own weekday podcast, produced by a former BBC documentary maker. Serious, in-depth podcasts and audiobooks <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/audio-books/article/73521-audio-publishing-s-internet-boom.html\" title=\"\">are growing in popularity</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/11/public-funds-should-be-used-to-rescue-local-journalism-says-report\">Public funds should be used to rescue local journalism, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Video documentary is also gaining momentum. The combination of serious investigative reporting, opinion and dramatic structure is a promising sign for the future of journalism. Just look at how many documentaries video-streaming services are buying or commissioning. Non-fiction literature is also doing well globally.

      "bodyText": "Journalism has joined the list of endangered professions: teaching it appears to be more lucrative than doing it. A great deal of brilliant and high-quality journalism is still being pursued around the world every day, but the news industry is steadily shrinking. Why is that? Let\u2019s make a distinction here between journalism and news. News is only one of the many kinds of journalistic output. News as a standardised, non-fiction literary form was invented more than 200 years ago in response to very specific social and cultural conditions, and was ignited by a new technology called the telegraph. The invention of the electric telegraph in the 1830s allowed the fast and international transmission of bursts of information in short, staccato messages, which were, ironically, not unlike tweets. The telegraph brought news of elections, wars, disasters, crimes, weddings and deaths to people\u2019s kitchen tables; it was how the world found out about the assassination of president Abraham Lincoln in 1865. The arrival of instant news transported the middle class from a local perspective to a global one, from a generalised view of the world to one full of specifics, and from a world centred on fiction to one grounded in fact. News became how the middle class positioned itself in the expanding wider world and claimed a distinct cultural identity. This hunger for news was a cultural response to a prevailing sociopolitical environment. Today, nearly every one of those cultural conditions has changed. So, if the context of what we called \u201cnews\u201d for nearly two centuries has radically altered, is news still functioning as it should? What is its role supposed to be, and what purpose is it fulfilling? Is news still relevant at all? We all know that today the news industry is in trouble. Weekday circulation for US daily newspapers, print and digital combined, fell to 35 million in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center \u2013 the lowest circulation since 1945, despite the population nearly tripling during those 70-plus years. This year began with a thousand job losses at once-burgeoning digital journalism ventures BuzzFeed and Huffington Post. News businesses have been grappling with imploding business models for more than a decade. New internet technologies empowered new players \u2013 mainly Google and Facebook \u2013 that have claimed control of distribution and the advertising revenue that goes with it. Meanwhile, inspired partly by Donald Trump, politicians from Myanmar to Libya and from Syria to Spain now openly attack reporters, calling them \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cbiased\u201d, accusing them of twisting reality. The public, meanwhile, sees journalists as too soft on power or too close to the wealthy and don\u2019t trust what they perceive as conflicts of interest. It is true that some serious news organisations have recently seen increases in paid subscription services. The New York Times recently claimed to have nearly doubled its number of subscribers to 3.5 million. And, thanks to its reader funding model, the Guardian has now received financial support from more than a million readers around the world. Subscriptions don\u2019t directly equate to readership, however; it\u2019s valuable regular income, but how many stories do subscribers read beyond the headline news? And how many renew their subscriptions? And is it, in the US at any rate, a temporary anomaly, a \u201cTrump bump\u201d of people who regard the cost as a monthly fee of the anti-Trump resistance? Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d rhetoric coincides with a turning away from globalisation and the faltering of global institutions and geopolitical aspirations, the closing of borders and the rise of nationalism. News, both as a commodity and as a cultural invention, has also been affected by \u201cdeglobalisation\u201d, as evidenced by the declining coverage of international news. By 2010, the frequency of foreign coverage in four British newspapers and the number of foreign news stories in the United States had nearly halved over three decades. Foreign reporting now tends to be limited to issues directly tied to national interests, such as war or terrorism. \u201cIn 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell, ABC, CBS, and NBC devoted a combined 4,828 minutes to international news,\u201d reported the American Journalism Review in 2011. \u201cBy 2000, after more than a decade of steady decline, the three networks aired only 2,127 minutes of international news during newscasts.\u201d A decline that became noticeable with the end of the cold war continued even after the 9/11 attacks and the consequent global war on terror. But this shift away from a global outlook is both geopolitical and social. It is a move inward, manifesting itself in many ways, including technology. I\u2019ve written before about the decline of hyperlinks, and how consequently the web reflects a cultural shift from outward to inward, from the global to the local. Yet despite this trend toward all things local, there has been no apparent surge of support for local politics or local newspapers. A recent report commissioned by the UK government warns about the coming demise of local news without direct public funding. The Cairncross Review acknowledges that \u201cthe stories people want to read may not always be the ones that they ought to read\u201d, referring to the scrutiny of the local public servants. In the US, local newspapers have consistently shrunk and, as Margaret Sullivan wrote in the Washington Post in 2017, are now on the verge of \u201cextinction\u201d, implying a lack of wider interest in local elections \u2013 and even in the process of participatory democracy itself. If you asked me how the appetite for the \u201clocal\u201d is manifesting itself in news, I would have a surprising answer: friends and family. Facebook\u2019s decision to prioritise updates from friends and family in the news feed was both a reaction to political pressure over the spread of disinformation, and a hint at what its gigantic global audience regards as the most valuable news. Updates about births, deaths, marriages, babies and other family life events are what constitute local news for many people. The popularity of Instagram or Snapchat stories is built around these interpersonal audiovisual diaries about people\u2019s lives. Celebrity news is another way this \u201clocal\u201d interest is manifesting itself. Perhaps we regard celebrities as cousins we don\u2019t see any more. News was never just about transmitting information. When we read news about climate change, or corrupt politicians, we not only become aware of the details of what has happened, but feel ourselves caught up in the drama. We take sides, and we want our side to win. As scholars like Michael Schudson and John Fiske explored, news is by nature a drama with a calm beginning, a disruption at its core, and the prospect of a resolution at its end. Journalists want their readers to ask their partners or colleagues, \u201cDid you hear \u2026?\u201d They want to be the reason people talk. But that function is now in serious decline. Consumption of information has become a very individual act thanks to mobile devices. The days when you sat down to read a morning paper or watched an evening news bulletin have, for many people, passed. Cinema, TV and, more recently, binge-watching on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon have slowly come to dominate the market demand for drama. Just as in the 1830s, when the telegraph made reporting independent of time and space and the production of news possible from anywhere, it was the shift to mobile internet and smartphones that freed the distribution of news from the tyranny of location and time. Now anyone can receive news at any time and in almost any place. This has led to a bifurcation. On one side, we have notifications \u2013 short blasts of information often directly from the newsmakers themselves. Think of tweets by fire or police departments, politicians, or big companies. They are bypassing news organisations. On the other side, we have long, collaborative, detailed and expensively produced reporting and investigations that can take months or years. This longform journalism is far more expensive and in-depth than the news stories that have dominated journalism for a long time, functioning more like non-fiction literature. What is left in the space between these two is an increasingly less viable form of news. Many newsrooms have spent the past decade pouring time and journalistic resources into churning out 800-word duplicate versions of news reports already available on other news sites. It makes little strategic, or financial, sense any more. Mid-length articles that are making money for some publishers are not news stories, but opinion pieces. But if buffeted by the twin forces of entertainment and propaganda, news is dying, how can journalism \u2013 and thereby democracy \u2013 survive? I see hope in three narrative formats: audio (including documentary podcasting), video and non-fiction \u201cliterature\u201d. Radio, and the podcast in particular, is a hybrid medium. Word-based and therefore capable of empowering rational arguments and elevating serious conversations, it can also convey depth of emotion. Spotify recently acquired two podcast firms and is planning to spend up to $500m (\u00a3385m) on further acquisitions. The New York Times\u2019s The Daily podcast has gained 6.5 million monthly listeners and increasingly follows a documentary dramatic structure. No wonder The Guardian has launched Today in Focus, its own weekday podcast, produced by a former BBC documentary maker. Serious, in-depth podcasts and audiobooks are growing in popularity. Video documentary is also gaining momentum. The combination of serious investigative reporting, opinion and dramatic structure is a promising sign for the future of journalism. Just look at how many documentaries video-streaming services are buying or commissioning. Non-fiction literature is also doing well globally. Just in the US, revenues for adult non-fiction have rapidly risen every year since 2013 and has surpassed fiction. The wider context, however, is bleak. Human civilisation seems to be entering a new phase we could call the \u201cpost-Enlightenment\u201d, where rationality and the written word are being structurally replaced by images and emotions. Faith is replacing facts; like buttons kill links. Television is making a comeback, dominating every aspect of our lives and reducing it all to entertainment. Journalism is not only seeing the news at its very heart taken out, but at a time when democracy is outsmarted by entertainment, it is at risk of losing its entire purpose. The late media scholar James W Carey had a line for this: \u201cWithout the institutions of democracy, journalists are reduced to propagandists or entertainers.\u201d If, as Carey suggested, democracy not only needs journalism but is the same thing as journalism, it should not surprise us to see both in deep trouble these days. We can only save democracy by saving journalism \u2013 or vice versa. \u2022 Hossein Derakhshan is a media researcher at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center and MIT Media Lab.

She has said she is willing to face prosecution over her incendiary propaganda on behalf of the ruthless but dwindling group. On Thursday, a day after Donald Trump declared on Twitter that he had issued orders to bar Muthana from the US, her father filed an emergency lawsuit asking a federal court to affirm that his daughter is a US citizen and let her return along with her son. Ahmed Ali Muthana said in court documents he had attempted to send money to his daughter and grandson, but had been told by the FBI if he did so he would be considered to be providing material support to Isis. \u201cI do not want to support Isis,\u201d he said. \u201cI do want to help my daughter and grandson get to the United States.\u201d The brewing legal battle hinges on a murky timeline of bureaucratic paperwork filed in 1994, when Muthana was born and her father left a position at Yemen\u2019s mission to the United Nations.

Of the team\u2019s key quartet, only the captain, Greig Laidlaw, is in the squad, Finn Russell having joined Stuart Hogg and Willem Nel on the injury list this week.</p> <p>Factor in other absentees such as Huw Jones,, Ryan Wilson and Hamish Watson, and it may seem that this game is France\u2019s to lose. But that also appeared to be the case at half-time in their last home game, before they went on to surrender a 16-0 lead to Wales. Given such an ignominious collapse was followed by a heavy defeat at Twickenham, it is evident self-belief is in short supply in the French ranks, as Jacques Brunel implied when asked if, by naming his team two days early, he were not giving the Scots an advantage. \u201cAfter seeing our performance against England, Scotland must be pretty confident anyway,\u201d the head coach said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/21/scotland-france-six-nations-peter-horne-fly-half\">Gregor Townsend bullish over Scotland chances but hails \u2018outstanding\u2019 France</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPretty confident\u201d would be overstating the mood in the visitors\u2019 camp ahead of this third Six Nations outing of the season, but there is a belief that, if they can avoid the handful of glaring errors that cost them heavily against Ireland and the late lapse that marred an otherwise comfortable win over Italy, they are in with a decent shout of pulling off a first victory in the French capital since 1999. The Scottish players are braced for an early onslaught from France, and think if they can withstand that they will be able to put in a more composed performance.</p> <p>Should that materialise, the chief orchestrator will be stand-off Peter Horne, who deputised so ably for Russell in this fixture at Murrayfield in 2016, and has been chosen in preference to Adam Hastings. Like his opposite number Romain Ntamack, Horne can switch between 10 and 12. Gregor Townsend, formerly his coach at Glasgow Warriors, has long been an admirer of his meticulous approach to the game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s shown everyone he can play very well at 10 at international level,\u201d the Scotland coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably our most organised and best prepared player in the squad. He\u2019ll know everything about the French \u2013 what they\u2019ve been doing, their individual players. He\u2019ll be able to talk through our game plan in minute detail.\u201d</p> <p>Horne\u2019s better recent form may have given him the nod over Hastings in any case, but his greater dependability and experience sealed the debate given Townsend\u2019s choice of the relatively untried Sam Johnson and Nick Grigg at centre. Johnson has looked entirely at home at this level in his two caps to date, while the diminutive Grigg, who has six, is set for a compelling catchweight contest with Mathieu Bastareaud, his opposite number.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/21/wing-commanders-six-nations-england-wales-the-breakdown\">Wing commanders: why Six Nations quicks are rolling back the years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like Grigg, substitute Darcy Graham is a small man who packs a big punch, and although nominally a wing or full-back, he has proved effective at club level by coming into midfield and acting as first receiver, particularly late in the game against tiring defences. It would therefore be no great surprise if Graham were to come off the bench in the final quarter and quickly score, although whether the contest is still undecided at that time is another matter.</p> <p>Townsend is aware of how dangerous France can be at their best, and believes that the new half-back pairing of Antoine Dupont and Ntamack can be just as great a threat as the more seasoned duo they replaced, Morgan Parra and Camille Lopez. \u201cYou go from cohesion with half-backs who have real experience in Parra and Lopez, to then going for cohesion with Toulouse half-backs, so they are very logical selections based on form,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00d26976d8c74f216183e4418e952e798c269734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00d26976d8c74f216183e4418e952e798c269734/0_105_4265_2559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antoine Dupont starts at scrum-half for France after impressing off the bench against England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antoine Dupont starts at scrum-half for France after impressing off the bench against England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Khachfe/JMP/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen Dupont came on against England, he showed his spirit and his ability when the team was losing. He tried to take the game to the opposition and that\u2019s what you want in your players. He\u2019s such an exciting talent.</p> <p>\u201cNtamack is playing with a team, Toulouse, that\u2019s playing really exciting rugby. So they\u2019re as much of a danger as playing against experienced half-backs. It\u2019s a dangerous French side with some young players coming through very quickly, and with some experience right through the spine.

      "bodyText": "Having failed to win in Paris so far this century, Scotland will attempt to end that trend on Saturday with something akin to a second-string side. Of the team\u2019s key quartet, only the captain, Greig Laidlaw, is in the squad, Finn Russell having joined Stuart Hogg and Willem Nel on the injury list this week. Factor in other absentees such as Huw Jones,, Ryan Wilson and Hamish Watson, and it may seem that this game is France\u2019s to lose. But that also appeared to be the case at half-time in their last home game, before they went on to surrender a 16-0 lead to Wales. Given such an ignominious collapse was followed by a heavy defeat at Twickenham, it is evident self-belief is in short supply in the French ranks, as Jacques Brunel implied when asked if, by naming his team two days early, he were not giving the Scots an advantage. \u201cAfter seeing our performance against England, Scotland must be pretty confident anyway,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cPretty confident\u201d would be overstating the mood in the visitors\u2019 camp ahead of this third Six Nations outing of the season, but there is a belief that, if they can avoid the handful of glaring errors that cost them heavily against Ireland and the late lapse that marred an otherwise comfortable win over Italy, they are in with a decent shout of pulling off a first victory in the French capital since 1999. The Scottish players are braced for an early onslaught from France, and think if they can withstand that they will be able to put in a more composed performance. Should that materialise, the chief orchestrator will be stand-off Peter Horne, who deputised so ably for Russell in this fixture at Murrayfield in 2016, and has been chosen in preference to Adam Hastings. Like his opposite number Romain Ntamack, Horne can switch between 10 and 12. Gregor Townsend, formerly his coach at Glasgow Warriors, has long been an admirer of his meticulous approach to the game. \u201cHe\u2019s shown everyone he can play very well at 10 at international level,\u201d the Scotland coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably our most organised and best prepared player in the squad. He\u2019ll know everything about the French \u2013 what they\u2019ve been doing, their individual players. He\u2019ll be able to talk through our game plan in minute detail.\u201d Horne\u2019s better recent form may have given him the nod over Hastings in any case, but his greater dependability and experience sealed the debate given Townsend\u2019s choice of the relatively untried Sam Johnson and Nick Grigg at centre. Johnson has looked entirely at home at this level in his two caps to date, while the diminutive Grigg, who has six, is set for a compelling catchweight contest with Mathieu Bastareaud, his opposite number. Like Grigg, substitute Darcy Graham is a small man who packs a big punch, and although nominally a wing or full-back, he has proved effective at club level by coming into midfield and acting as first receiver, particularly late in the game against tiring defences. It would therefore be no great surprise if Graham were to come off the bench in the final quarter and quickly score, although whether the contest is still undecided at that time is another matter. Townsend is aware of how dangerous France can be at their best, and believes that the new half-back pairing of Antoine Dupont and Ntamack can be just as great a threat as the more seasoned duo they replaced, Morgan Parra and Camille Lopez. \u201cYou go from cohesion with half-backs who have real experience in Parra and Lopez, to then going for cohesion with Toulouse half-backs, so they are very logical selections based on form,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Dupont came on against England, he showed his spirit and his ability when the team was losing. He tried to take the game to the opposition and that\u2019s what you want in your players. He\u2019s such an exciting talent. \u201cNtamack is playing with a team, Toulouse, that\u2019s playing really exciting rugby. So they\u2019re as much of a danger as playing against experienced half-backs. It\u2019s a dangerous French side with some young players coming through very quickly, and with some experience right through the spine. I think their pack is more mobile than the pack they picked against Wales, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll change the way they play, which is high off-loads, ambitious rugby. We\u2019re expecting a really dangerous attacking team.\u201d Brunel probably does not know what to expect, but he does know what he hopes to see. \u201cWe have to turn things around and show the real face of the France team,\u201d he said. In reality, no one face of the French team, the inept or the inspired, is any more \u201creal\u201d than the other. But which one predominates will determine the outcome of the most unpredictable fixture so far in this year\u2019s Championship.",

      "bodyText": "Woody Allen will return to film-making with backing from Spanish producers and is likely to make his next film in Spain. Variety magazine reports that Spanish production outfit Mediapro has confirmed it has signed a development deal with Allen. Mediapro previously worked with Allen on the Spain-set romcom Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which starred Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Javier Bardem, and Midnight in Paris, Allen\u2019s highest grossing film to date. No details of any project have been released, but Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reports that Allen\u2019s producers have been scouting locations in the Basque city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, and are due to meet local officials. The reports arrive two weeks after Allen launched legal action against Amazon, claiming the tech giant had broken a four-film deal it had signed in 2017. After making a TV series with Allen and the feature film Wonder Wheel, Amazon have not released A Rainy Day in New York, the first in the projected four-film agreement. Jennifer Salke, CEO of Amazon Studios, subsequently said in an interview with the New York Times: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans to release any Woody Allen movies.\u201d A Rainy Day in New York, which stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Elle Fanning and Jude Law, became engulfed in controversy after an article by Allen\u2019s adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow titled \u201cWhy has the #MeToo revolution spared Woody Allen?\u201d appeared in the LA Times in December 2017. A number of Allen collaborators, including Chalamet, Rebecca Hall, Greta Gerwig and Colin Firth publicly disassociated themselves from the director. Chalamet donated his salary to charity, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to profit from my work on the film.\u201d Allen has been defended by others, including Bardem, who said in 2018: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the public lynching that he\u2019s been receiving, and if Woody Allen called me to work with him again I\u2019d be there tomorrow morning. He\u2019s a genius.\u201d In a statement to the New York Times, Mediapro said: \u201cWe have a 10-year relationship with Mr Allen and, like all projects we produce, we judge the creator by its work.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea will face a trip to Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine in the last 16 of the Europa League, where Arsenal take on French club Rennes. Friday\u2019s draw in Nyon was not protected by any seeding but teams from Russia and Ukraine were kept apart. Dynamo Kyiv were first out against Chelsea. The first legs of the last-16 ties are set for March 7, when both Premier League teams will be at home. The returns will taking place on March 14 as the London clubs look to stay on course for the final in Baku. Arsenal progressed from the round of 32 with a 3-1 aggregate win over BATE Borisov, overturning a first-leg loss in Belarus after victory at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday night. Chelsea, meanwhile, defeated Malmo, winning the second leg 3-0 at Stamford Bridge to add to a 2-1 away victory in Sweden. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany were paired with Serie A side Inter Milan and Dinamo Zagreb will play Portuguese outfit Benfica. Napoli tackle Austrian side Salzburg, while Valencia, who knocked out Celtic, have been paired against Russian club Krasnodar. Former winners Sevilla face Slavia Prague and Zenit St Petersburg play Villarreal. Full draw: Chelsea v Dynamo Kyiv Eintracht Frankfurt v Internazionale Dinamo Zagreb v Benfica Napoli v Red Bull Salzburg Valencia v Krasnodar Sevilla v Slavia Prague Arsenal v Rennes Zenit v Villarreal Charles Antaki wanted a nice story, but alas, we cannot always have nice things: \u201cShame that Arsenal didn\u2019t draw Villareal, to give fans a sight of the much-loved Santi Cazorla; even sadder that it looks like Villareal won\u2019t even be in the top division net year\u2026\u201d The exact schedules are yet to be finalised, but just like in the previous rounds the games will be played at 5.55pm and 8pm, the former being a hearty ballache for anyone who has to get from something as insignificant as \u2018work\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the obvious thing to say, but I\u2019m saying it anyway,\u201d writes Agnello Figueiredo, knowing very well that we\u2019re never afraid of the obvious. \u201cChelsea vs Dynamo Kyiv is basically Russia vs Ukraine.\u201d So with little respect for narrative, and also for Chelsea fans wishing to travel to see their team play, there\u2019s the draw. A little underwhelming perhaps? There aren\u2019t any super duper huge clashes: Chelsea v Dynamo, Eintracht Frankfurt v Inter and Napoli v RB Salzburg are probably the pick of the ties. Chelsea v Dynamo Kyiv Eintracht Frankfurt v Inter Dinamo Zagreb v Benfica Napoli v RB Salzburg Valencia v Krasnodar Sevilla v Slavia Prague Arsenal v Rennes Zenit St Petersburg v Villarreal Ties will be played on March 7 and March 14, with the team listed first playing at home first. Zenit St Petersburg v Villarreal There you go... Sevilla v Slavia Prague Valencia v Krasnodar Napoli v Salzburg Dinamo Zagreb v Benfica Eintracht Frankfurt v Inter Of course it is. Here we go. We\u2019ll just put out each tie in a different entry... There\u2019s another item on the table: it\u2019s the tupperware box with Zenit and Krasnodar\u2019s balls in it. A reminder that they will draw Dynamo Kyiv out first, pairing them with one of the other 13 non-Russian teams. The celebrity former player on hand to help with the draw is...former Valencia and Sevilla keeper and thrice winner of the tournament Andres Palop. Pedro says the magic words \u201cwithout further ado\u201d and brings out Giorgio Marchetti, our favourite Claudio Ranieri lookalike. The draw is v imminent. Our old friend Pedro Pinto, who used to be UEFA\u2019s head of communications but now appears to be a consultant/smoothie for hire, is the presenter. Happy to report the set-up seems decidedly lo-fi. Just a plinth with the trophy on it, then what looks like a breakfast bar with two bowls, presumably for the balls but let\u2019s not rule out the scrambling of some eggs. The draw is just minutes away. Mumbling dignitaries are assembled in a Swiss lecture theatre. The excitement is entirely bearable. To anyone who draws Zenit just...be prepared... Apologies for being excessively Anglo-centric, but here\u2019s how the Premier League boyz got to this stage of the tournament. Arsenal beat BATE through the natural, obvious goalscorers of...*checks notes*...Shkodran Mustafi and Sokratis Papastathopoulos. Chelsea through against Malmo as Narrative seals a 3-0 (5-1 on agg) victory... ...while Maurizio Sarri continues to be stubborn and insist his footballing son Jorginho is not to blame for anything. Just a small amend to the intro: there is one restriction to the draw, in that teams from Russia and Ukraine cannot be drawn together, for obvious geopolitical reasons. So first out of the hat will be Dynamo Kyiv, who\u2019ll be kept well away from Krasnodar and Zenit, and then we can get on with the rest of it. The teams Arsenal Benfica Chelsea Dinamo Zagreb Dynamo Kyiv Eintracht Frankfurt Inter Krasnodar Napoli Rennes RB Salzburg Sevilla Slavia Prague Valencia Villarreal Zenit St Petersburg I\u2019ll be honest, the Europa League draw is probably a little way down Chelsea\u2019s priority list this morning. But still, nice to find out who they\u2019ll be playing in a few weeks, eh? Arsenal don\u2019t have quite as much on, admin-wise, so they can give this one their full attention. There are some potentially pretty spicy ties in the offing. With Valencia, Villarreal, Inter, Napoli and Benfica all left in, as well as Sevilla, who are there because of course they\u2019re always there. Plus, because the draw is unseeded/unrestricted, there\u2019s always the slightly tedious prospect of Chelsea and Arsenal drawing each other. In travel terms, stating the obvious to say that both sides will be hoping not to get Krasnodar, and Kyiv won\u2019t be popular either. St Petersburg is a mild logistical ballache for fans but won\u2019t be too onerous, time-wise. But there could be some fun ties in here. Stay tuned. Draw kick-off time: 12.00 GMT",

      "bodyText": "A couple of young flautists are practising scales in a small windowless room at Tlaxiaco\u2019s Casa de Cultura. The rest of the town band are rehearsing a competition routine with a troop of young folkloric dancers \u2013 including Yalitza Aparicio\u2019s two younger brothers \u2013 in the grand courtyard, decorated with murals depicting the town\u2019s pre-Hispanic Mixtec warriors and artists. Aparicio is nominated for best actress at the Oscars, taking place on Sunday, for her astonishing portrayal of a nanny in Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s acclaimed film Roma. If successful, the 25-year-old Mexican, who worked as a teacher before she was discovered almost by accident at a casting call held at the cultural centre, will be the first indigenous winner of the award. The novice actor is up against established stars including Glenn Close and Lady Gaga. But in her home town, known formally as the Heroic City of Tlaxiaco in honour of a battle waged there during the 1862\u201367 French invasion of Mexico, Aparicio is already a hero. \u201cYalitza from Tlaxiaco in Hollywood, that\u2019s just wow! She\u2019s such an inspiration to me,\u201d says 16-year-old Arleth Velasco, who was very excited about watching the Oscars ceremony on a big screen in the main square this weekend. Tlaxiaco is a bustling city of 60,000 people in the mountainous south-west state of Oaxaca, surrounded by small indigenous villages where Spanish is normally the second language. Aparicio is of mixed ancestry: her mother is Triqui and her father Mixteco. She had to learn Mixtec to play the role of Cleo, whose character is based on Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s nanny. \u201cThe film shows everyday life of our community, it is a reality that Mexicans who criticise Roma don\u2019t want to accept,\u201d says Velasco, referring to a racial slur used by a soap opera star to denigrate Aparicio. \u201cYalitza\u2019s triumph shows that people like me with few resources, us \u2018indios\u2019, can be someone.\u201d Aparicio\u2019s unprecedented success has generated an outpouring of pride and joy in Mexico\u2019s indigenous communities, which continue to suffer endemic rates of poverty and exclusion. Aparicio\u2019s mother was employed as a domestic worker, her father a street vendor selling CDs. The modest family home, located up a hilly dirt road on the southern edge of town, is constructed of metal sheets, rocks and concrete blocks. \u201cTo see a Triqui sister in a film at this level gives pride and dignity to my ethnic group,\u201d says Eduardo Gonzalez, a 42-year-old shoeshiner who said he had experienced racism. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that\u2019s she nominated. It doesn\u2019t matter if she wins, Yalitza\u2019s where she\u2019s meant to be.\u201d Aparicio is the latest in a long line of artists to emerge from Tlaxiaco, including the Grammy winner Lila Downs and the cartoonist H\u00e9ctor Ram\u00edrez Bola\u00f1os. \u201cArt, music and dance is part of the community\u2019s history,\u201d says Miguel Angel Martinez, the cultural centre\u2019s director. \u201cLook at the murals of our ancestors, it\u2019s in our genes. Now, Yalitza\u2019s success has woken up an interest in young people for acting.\u201d Martinez was approached in early 2016 by the film\u2019s casting director, who was scouring communities looking for a young woman with dark eyes, black hair and dark brown skin. The casting agents came to Tlaxiaco because of the town\u2019s participation in the famous Guelaguetza indigenous dance and cultural festival, held in the state capital, Oaxaca. A hundred or so young women turned up, and after three days the casting agents had 28 earmarked for a callback, but wanted two more. Martinez persuaded Edith Aparicio, a locally renowned singer, to audition. She in turn persuaded her sister, Yalitza, to join her. Yalitza, who had no intention of becoming an actor, wowed the casting agents. After three more auditions, she was offered the role. Cuar\u00f3n has said it took a couple of weeks to persuade her to take it. Some in Mexico have argued that Aparicio\u2019s success was down to luck, but her brothers\u2019 dance teacher disagrees. \u201cThis is a rare family, which without having any contact with the arts through their parents, has produced four artists,\u201d says Uriel Aguilar. \u201cAll have natural born talent.\u201d In a telephone interview with the local radio station La Poderosa on Wednesday, Aparicio said her success demonstrated the importance of trying things outside one\u2019s comfort zone. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what people say, if you want something, you should fight for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about winning [the Oscar], I\u2019m still trying to assimilate the nomination.\u201d Javier Guerrero, the radio presenter who conducted the interview, thinks winning is a long shot against such stiff competition. \u201cIn our hearts we hope she wins, but whether they give or don\u2019t give her the statue, to see her name and image on the screen is a huge success for her and this community.

She always stops by for a chicharr\u00f3n fix, say the husband and wife vendors Jeronimo Ortiz and Rocio Reyes. They first met Aparicio when she was selling Christmas pi\u00f1atas with her sister in the market. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t changed at all, she\u2019s a simple person,\u201d says Reyes.

The bag, whose value is estimated to be in the six-figure range, is, as usual, dominated by beauty serums and treatments \u2013 with many of this year\u2019s marked by marijuana content following a broad legalisation of the drug in California last year. Cannabis-infused skincare products feature, as does a gift box featuring cannabis edibles and lotions, as well as membership to a pot-friendly Hollywood social club. Other presents include a wearable silent breast pump, which retails at \u00a3250 and allows nursing mothers to \u201cditch the hours spent hidden in cupboards, tethered to a wall or cleaning tubes\u201d, a grip-free dog leash and a spy pen donated by the Peta. The organisation hopes recipients will pop the pen in their breast pocket and activate it in the vicinity of animal abuse. Reflecting the creative nature of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, an original painting by Reian Williams, a portrait artist who specialises in dogs and big cats, is also included. The representative image shared by Distinctive Assets, the marketing company that puts together the bags, shows two women lightly wrapped in sheets, one in an apparent state of ecstasy, as a tiger prowls at their feet and a butterfly flutters above. Enormous daubs of blue paint are smeared over the wallpaper in the background. Perhaps the most valuable present is a small-ship luxury break to Iceland or the Galapagos islands, one of four holidays on offer. At the other end of the glamour spectrum is a glow-in-the-dark toilet plunger featuring a huge poo emoji as its sucker. Named Mister Poop, the antimicrobial bathroom accessory is, according to its manufacturers, is a \u201ccrappy product that really works\u201d. The lucky-dip nature of the bag\u2019s contents reflects the lack of certainty over what this year\u2019s ceremony will actually include. Hostless for only the second time in its history, a rolling roster of high-profile presenters, including the cast of the forthcoming Avengers movie, will unveil the winners and introduce performances of the five nominated original songs. Following a U-turn last weekend, the telecast producers are committed to airing all 24 awards \u2013 including cinematography and editing \u2013 within the three-hour running time. The ceremony will open with a performance by ageing rockers Queen, with Adam Lambert standing in for Freddie Mercury. Mercury\u2019s biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody, is in the running for best picture but sexual assault allegations against its director, Bryan Singer, may prove its undoing when it comes to clinching the prize. The current favourite is Roma, the black and white semi-autobiographical story of an upper-middle class family in 70s Mexico City and their beloved housekeeper. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n also seems likely to take best director. Other best picture nominees include Bradley Cooper\u2019s directorial debut, A Star Is Born, period romp The Favourite, superhero movie Black Panther, Spike Lee\u2019s real-life crime story BlacKkKlansman, road movie Green Book and Dick Cheney biopic Vice. The acting categories are slightly more open to upset, with Vice star Christian Bale the main contender to Rami Malek, whose portrayal of Mercury has won him many fans.

I buy them in bulk bags, use some to make a seed butter (quickly roasted then blitzed - sometimes mixed with some nuts too - for a spread worthy of toast); I roast them with maple syrup, chilli and rosemary for these snacking seeds, perfect for sprinkling on salads, roast roots or simply for eating by the handful.

The planet January is tidally locked to its star, one side scorched by constant sunlight and the other a frozen wilderness of endless night, with human settlement confined to the narrow twilight zone between the two.

Punishment is extreme: Sophie is thrown to the night-side to die. She survives by connecting with the alien \u201ccrocodiles\u201d, telepathic creatures whose compassionate intelligence belies their giant pincers and tentacled hideousness.</p> <p>The main narrative is about the possibility of rapprochement between humans and aliens. Humans loathe the alien Gelets, and to the Gelets we are \u201cpiles of hot meat, giving off fear chemicals\u201d.

Anders\u2019s plotting isn\u2019t thin, exactly; it\u2019s just that storyline isn\u2019t what she finds most interesting. Instead she draws the reader into the socio-political detail of her imagined world: \u201cCircadianism\u201d, the governing system of Sophie\u2019s home city, creating artificial \u2018Timefulness\u2019 to regulate its citizenry; or the Argelan language, which lacks tenses, qualifiers or distinctions, but has \u201ca million different terms for relationships: lovers, parent/child, teacher/student, friend\u201d.</p> <p>This is a millennial\u2019s novel, featuring young people trying to make their way through an uncaring, corrupt and intermittently violent world. If this middle-aged reviewer found it sometimes hard to like the dramatis personae, that doubtless says more about the gap between real-world generations than about the novel. Though sometimes judgmental and self-righteous, Anders\u2019s characters are also emotionally sophisticated and passionate, and this is heartfelt and absorbing fiction.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The City in the Middle of the Night</em> is published by Titan (\u00a314.99).

Anders\u2019s plotting isn\u2019t thin, exactly; it\u2019s just that storyline isn\u2019t what she finds most interesting. Instead she draws the reader into the socio-political detail of her imagined world: \u201cCircadianism\u201d, the governing system of Sophie\u2019s home city, creating artificial \u2018Timefulness\u2019 to regulate its citizenry; or the Argelan language, which lacks tenses, qualifiers or distinctions, but has \u201ca million different terms for relationships: lovers, parent/child, teacher/student, friend\u201d. This is a millennial\u2019s novel, featuring young people trying to make their way through an uncaring, corrupt and intermittently violent world. If this middle-aged reviewer found it sometimes hard to like the dramatis personae, that doubtless says more about the gap between real-world generations than about the novel. Though sometimes judgmental and self-righteous, Anders\u2019s characters are also emotionally sophisticated and passionate, and this is heartfelt and absorbing fiction. \u2022 The City in the Middle of the Night is published by Titan (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>\u201cA culture of lying, the outrageous failures of our political system, Westminster being so corrupt, so chaotic ... \u201d Max Porter is talking about public life in the UK today, about which he finds almost everything \u201crevolting\u201d. Porter\u2019s debut, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/18/grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers-by-max-porter-review-ted-hughes\" title=\"\">Grief Is the Thing With Feathers</a></em>, a novella-cum-prose poem about a bereaved dad bringing up two boys, based on the death of his father when he was six, was one of the stand-out books of 2015. He was hailed as \u201ca writer bursting with originality\u201d, but he was reluctant to write a second novel without feeling the same sense of urgency. Now, four years later, this despair at the state of the nation, combined with his \u201cobsessive\u201d fears for the environment, has sent him back to his desk for <em>Lanny</em>, an inventive take on the \u201cmissing child\u201d narrative and a meditation on Englishness, made strange by the otherworldliness that distinguished his earlier novel.</p> <p>Porter didn\u2019t want \u201cjust to write angry stuff about tabloid poisoning\u201d, a straightforward anti-Brexit or eco-crisis novel. \u201cThis isn\u2019t stuff I want to write about explicitly.\u201d Instead, he hoped \u201cto have a kind of philosophical reckoning\u201d with all these issues. \u201cThe question was \u2018How do I write about England?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His first attempts were \u201crather unhealthy, because various political feelings collapsed into the effort. It was not a nice place I was writing about\u201d; and, despite all these anxieties, he longed \u201cto write about how strange life is, and beautiful\u201d. Indeed, such gloominess seems at odds with the ebullient novelist (not yet 40), who shrugs off his parka and begins talking with infectious passion about everything from poetry (\u201cI\u2019m never not thinking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/emilydickinson\" title=\"\">Emily Dickinson</a>\u201d) to his worship of trees. He insists that he is not the whimsical, nature-loving Lanny at the heart of his new novel \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a bit more worldly than that\u201d \u2013 but his boyish enthusiasm does bring a blast of energy into the hush of Faber\u2019s Bloomsbury offices. Starting out in a bookshop (he won the Bookseller of the Year award in 2009), he was, until recently, editorial director at Granta, where he looked after writers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/02/the-white-book-by-hang-kang-review\" title=\"\">Han Kang</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/15/eleanor-cattons-new-novel-pre-apocalyptic-drama-new-zealand\" title=\"\">Eleanor Catton </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebeccasolnit\" title=\"\">Rebecca Solnit</a>. \u201cEditing is wonderful, but you are soulmate, analyst, bloody torturer, exploiter all rolled into one,\u201d he says. He wrote <em>Lanny</em> on his Fridays at home, by which time he was desperate not to have \u201cother people\u2019s words in [my] head\u201d.</p> <p>Porter has found his own voice, combining the domestic and the mythic, the realist and the poetic, and <em>Lanny</em> is as playfully polyphonic and experimental as his first novel, made clear by the spidery italics crawling off the page. The omniscient, fable-like figure of Dead Papa Toothwort, \u201ca sort of voyeur\u201d who roams below the earth and eavesdrops on the villagers, fulfils a similar function to the cranky Ted Hughes-inspired Crow in <em>Grief Is the Thing With Feathers</em>. \u201cIs he a metaphor? Is he real or not real?\u201d Porter intended this novel to be even more ambiguous. And it was only once he had Dead Papa Toothwort, he says, that it really came together: \u201cAll second novel syndrome just disappeared. I remember shouting to my wife: \u2018I <em>love</em> this. I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2476a7176d7bc511adec692e905cd833421a2cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2476a7176d7bc511adec692e905cd833421a2cb/0_267_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cillian Murphy in Grief Is the Thing with Feathers by Max Porter, adapted and directed by Enda Walsh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cillian Murphy in <em>Grief Is the Thing With Feathers</em> by Max Porter, adapted and directed by Enda Walsh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colm Hogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some ways <em>Lanny</em> was \u201can escape\u201d from the acutely personal material of <em>Grief Is the Thing With Feathers</em>. He describes his first novel as almost \u201caccidental\u201d, its success completely unexpected; he certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for seeing his childhood recreated on stage in Enda Walsh\u2019s adaptation starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/22/grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers-review-black-box-galway-cillian-murphy-enda-walsh\" title=\"\">Cillian Murphy</a>, which he went to see with his brother last year. \u201cThere\u2019s me going: \u2018No, it\u2019s not autobiographical,\u2019 and then sobbing because there\u2019s my bunk bed. Extraordinary,\u201d he laughs now.</p> <p>He worried that people would assume <em>Lanny</em> was also autobiographical, given that, like the characters in the book, Porter and his family have recently moved out of London to just outside Bath; but no, the novel predates the move, although \u201ca number of relatively odd echoes occurred\u201d. Robert (a City banker) and Jolie (an actor-turned-gruesome-thriller writer) and their charming but troublesome son Lanny are new arrivals in the unnamed commuter village.</p> <p>The novel was finished while travelling up to London: \u201cIt was like having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/may/16/take-the-kids-bekonscot-model-village-buckinghamshire\" title=\"\">Bekonscot model village</a> in my head with me while I\u2019m going about my day.\u201d He would imagine seeing characters such as Robert on station platforms. With his Apple Watch and porn habit, Robert is Porter\u2019s attempt to \u201cwrite honestly about men these days\u201d in a way, he feels, is rarely found in modern fiction, where he would typically be \u201cmore of a hero, or more flawed. Usually when you get a character like Robert he\u2019s killing people. I wanted him to be likable and understandable. He\u2019s just a completely straight-up bloke and therefore he has to fail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"36c415d8574efa592e12b2defe9ca08a79e0fcb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36c415d8574efa592e12b2defe9ca08a79e0fcb3/0_304_5023_3013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bekonscot Model Village, Buckinghamshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bekonscot Model Village, Buckinghamshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jolie befriends Peter Blythe, known locally as \u201cmad Pete\u201d, a controversial artist once famous for his explicit erotic work, and asks him to give Lanny art lessons. Then Lanny goes missing. The germ of the novel goes back nearly a decade to a poem Porter wrote when he was working as a bookseller and still trying to find his form. Beginning with the line \u201cThere\u2019s a tree up there where this thing happened\u201d, it was about a friendship between an old man and a boy, written around the time of Operation Yewtree, in response to \u201cthis sense that children couldn\u2019t be left in the company of adults, and who could we trust\u201d. But he was also reacting against an atmosphere of hysteria and assumption, and in the relationship between Lanny and Pete he wanted to explore ideas of creativity and innocence, to show the huge influence \u201cspecial inexplicable friendships\u201d can have on young people, based on his own with his godfather, who loved making things, or his next-door neighbour Pam, a prison art teacher, who gave him drawing lessons as a boy.</p> <p>What makes <em>Lanny</em> more than another twist on the missing-child genre of so much crime fiction as well as TV shows such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/29/the-missing-james-nesbitt-review\" title=\"\">The Missing</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/29/the-missing-james-nesbitt-review\" title=\"\"> </a>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/18/broadchurch-bafta-television-awards\" title=\"\">Broadchurch</a></em>? Porter says he didn\u2019t see those dramas, but was keenly aware of a crossover with Jon McGregor\u2019s acclaimed 2017 novel<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/reservoir-13-by-jon-mcgregor-review\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/reservoir-13-by-jon-mcgregor-review\" title=\"\">Reservoir 13</a></em>, which also subverts expectations by focusing not on solving the mystery of a young girl\u2019s disappearance but its impact on the Peak District village where it happened. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh no, I can\u2019t write that any more\u2019,\u201d but he was relieved to find it was \u201cnot remotely similar\u201d. However he agrees they both address the same question: \u201cFrom a literary point of view, now we\u2019ve had all these books that fixate on missing children or dead children, or brutalised women or serial killers, all this stuff that people love to read \u2013 what do you do afterwards?\u201d His answer was \u201cto take out all the bumf of the realist novel \u2013 what does the policeman look like, do you see so-and-so drinking his coffee \u2013 and just have the comments that seem to really shine a light on a community left in\u201d.</p> <p>The result is a cacophony of voices, what Porter calls a \u201csoundscape\u201d, of snatched conversations from the village. \u201cI love everyday language,\u201d he says. \u201cI love slang, I love children\u2019s language, I love hip-hop, I love the proper use of language. If you are a lover of language there is no hierarchy between low and high or anything like that.\u201d He plundered \u201call sorts of brilliant books\u201d for the random phrases that Dead Papa Toothwort overhears from his subterranean hiding place \u2013 \u201cfresh out of Silk Cut\u201d; \u201cwhat next, Polish adverts in the parish mag\u201d; \u201cDave has bucket-loads of dahlias\u201d. The visual effect is a sort of root-like concrete poetry tangled between the main narrative, a device he painstakingly worked on with a production editor at Faber. \u201cIt\u2019s not bound by the printed conventions of the book. It\u2019s coming from somewhere else.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4f5e98ad62ff23c22993de9a2a0e435d0d7336a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4f5e98ad62ff23c22993de9a2a0e435d0d7336a/0_0_3189_4819/662.jpg\" alt=\"A page from Lanny\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from<em> Lanny</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Faber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The novel makes great play with poetic or theatrical borrowings \u2013 little crosses scattered throughout the text, for example, \u201care breaths, like a dash in Dickinson, or a silence on the stage\u201d. (All, according to literary prejudice, either inspired eclecticism or infuriatingly tricksy.) He describes himself as \u201ca compulsive maker of not very good things: collages, little boxes, with toys and bits of cut out paper.\u201d The novel began as drawings on his wall, and he will always draw before he writes, sketching scenes if he gets stuck. \u201cSome people like to walk, or go birdwatching.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA culture of lying, the outrageous failures of our political system, Westminster being so corrupt, so chaotic ... \u201d Max Porter is talking about public life in the UK today, about which he finds almost everything \u201crevolting\u201d. Porter\u2019s debut, Grief Is the Thing With Feathers, a novella-cum-prose poem about a bereaved dad bringing up two boys, based on the death of his father when he was six, was one of the stand-out books of 2015. He was hailed as \u201ca writer bursting with originality\u201d, but he was reluctant to write a second novel without feeling the same sense of urgency. Now, four years later, this despair at the state of the nation, combined with his \u201cobsessive\u201d fears for the environment, has sent him back to his desk for Lanny, an inventive take on the \u201cmissing child\u201d narrative and a meditation on Englishness, made strange by the otherworldliness that distinguished his earlier novel. Porter didn\u2019t want \u201cjust to write angry stuff about tabloid poisoning\u201d, a straightforward anti-Brexit or eco-crisis novel. \u201cThis isn\u2019t stuff I want to write about explicitly.\u201d Instead, he hoped \u201cto have a kind of philosophical reckoning\u201d with all these issues. \u201cThe question was \u2018How do I write about England?\u2019\u201d His first attempts were \u201crather unhealthy, because various political feelings collapsed into the effort. It was not a nice place I was writing about\u201d; and, despite all these anxieties, he longed \u201cto write about how strange life is, and beautiful\u201d. Indeed, such gloominess seems at odds with the ebullient novelist (not yet 40), who shrugs off his parka and begins talking with infectious passion about everything from poetry (\u201cI\u2019m never not thinking about Emily Dickinson\u201d) to his worship of trees. He insists that he is not the whimsical, nature-loving Lanny at the heart of his new novel \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a bit more worldly than that\u201d \u2013 but his boyish enthusiasm does bring a blast of energy into the hush of Faber\u2019s Bloomsbury offices. Starting out in a bookshop (he won the Bookseller of the Year award in 2009), he was, until recently, editorial director at Granta, where he looked after writers including Han Kang, Eleanor Catton and Rebecca Solnit. \u201cEditing is wonderful, but you are soulmate, analyst, bloody torturer, exploiter all rolled into one,\u201d he says. He wrote Lanny on his Fridays at home, by which time he was desperate not to have \u201cother people\u2019s words in [my] head\u201d. Porter has found his own voice, combining the domestic and the mythic, the realist and the poetic, and Lanny is as playfully polyphonic and experimental as his first novel, made clear by the spidery italics crawling off the page. The omniscient, fable-like figure of Dead Papa Toothwort, \u201ca sort of voyeur\u201d who roams below the earth and eavesdrops on the villagers, fulfils a similar function to the cranky Ted Hughes-inspired Crow in Grief Is the Thing With Feathers. \u201cIs he a metaphor? Is he real or not real?\u201d Porter intended this novel to be even more ambiguous. And it was only once he had Dead Papa Toothwort, he says, that it really came together: \u201cAll second novel syndrome just disappeared. I remember shouting to my wife: \u2018I love this. I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019\u201d In some ways Lanny was \u201can escape\u201d from the acutely personal material of Grief Is the Thing With Feathers. He describes his first novel as almost \u201caccidental\u201d, its success completely unexpected; he certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for seeing his childhood recreated on stage in Enda Walsh\u2019s adaptation starring Cillian Murphy, which he went to see with his brother last year. \u201cThere\u2019s me going: \u2018No, it\u2019s not autobiographical,\u2019 and then sobbing because there\u2019s my bunk bed. Extraordinary,\u201d he laughs now. He worried that people would assume Lanny was also autobiographical, given that, like the characters in the book, Porter and his family have recently moved out of London to just outside Bath; but no, the novel predates the move, although \u201ca number of relatively odd echoes occurred\u201d. Robert (a City banker) and Jolie (an actor-turned-gruesome-thriller writer) and their charming but troublesome son Lanny are new arrivals in the unnamed commuter village. The novel was finished while travelling up to London: \u201cIt was like having Bekonscot model village in my head with me while I\u2019m going about my day.\u201d He would imagine seeing characters such as Robert on station platforms. With his Apple Watch and porn habit, Robert is Porter\u2019s attempt to \u201cwrite honestly about men these days\u201d in a way, he feels, is rarely found in modern fiction, where he would typically be \u201cmore of a hero, or more flawed. Usually when you get a character like Robert he\u2019s killing people. I wanted him to be likable and understandable. He\u2019s just a completely straight-up bloke and therefore he has to fail.\u201d Jolie befriends Peter Blythe, known locally as \u201cmad Pete\u201d, a controversial artist once famous for his explicit erotic work, and asks him to give Lanny art lessons. Then Lanny goes missing. The germ of the novel goes back nearly a decade to a poem Porter wrote when he was working as a bookseller and still trying to find his form. Beginning with the line \u201cThere\u2019s a tree up there where this thing happened\u201d, it was about a friendship between an old man and a boy, written around the time of Operation Yewtree, in response to \u201cthis sense that children couldn\u2019t be left in the company of adults, and who could we trust\u201d. But he was also reacting against an atmosphere of hysteria and assumption, and in the relationship between Lanny and Pete he wanted to explore ideas of creativity and innocence, to show the huge influence \u201cspecial inexplicable friendships\u201d can have on young people, based on his own with his godfather, who loved making things, or his next-door neighbour Pam, a prison art teacher, who gave him drawing lessons as a boy. What makes Lanny more than another twist on the missing-child genre of so much crime fiction as well as TV shows such as The Missing and Broadchurch? Porter says he didn\u2019t see those dramas, but was keenly aware of a crossover with Jon McGregor\u2019s acclaimed 2017 novel Reservoir 13, which also subverts expectations by focusing not on solving the mystery of a young girl\u2019s disappearance but its impact on the Peak District village where it happened. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh no, I can\u2019t write that any more\u2019,\u201d but he was relieved to find it was \u201cnot remotely similar\u201d. However he agrees they both address the same question: \u201cFrom a literary point of view, now we\u2019ve had all these books that fixate on missing children or dead children, or brutalised women or serial killers, all this stuff that people love to read \u2013 what do you do afterwards?\u201d His answer was \u201cto take out all the bumf of the realist novel \u2013 what does the policeman look like, do you see so-and-so drinking his coffee \u2013 and just have the comments that seem to really shine a light on a community left in\u201d. The result is a cacophony of voices, what Porter calls a \u201csoundscape\u201d, of snatched conversations from the village. \u201cI love everyday language,\u201d he says. \u201cI love slang, I love children\u2019s language, I love hip-hop, I love the proper use of language. If you are a lover of language there is no hierarchy between low and high or anything like that.\u201d He plundered \u201call sorts of brilliant books\u201d for the random phrases that Dead Papa Toothwort overhears from his subterranean hiding place \u2013 \u201cfresh out of Silk Cut\u201d; \u201cwhat next, Polish adverts in the parish mag\u201d; \u201cDave has bucket-loads of dahlias\u201d. The visual effect is a sort of root-like concrete poetry tangled between the main narrative, a device he painstakingly worked on with a production editor at Faber. \u201cIt\u2019s not bound by the printed conventions of the book. It\u2019s coming from somewhere else.\u201d The novel makes great play with poetic or theatrical borrowings \u2013 little crosses scattered throughout the text, for example, \u201care breaths, like a dash in Dickinson, or a silence on the stage\u201d. (All, according to literary prejudice, either inspired eclecticism or infuriatingly tricksy.) He describes himself as \u201ca compulsive maker of not very good things: collages, little boxes, with toys and bits of cut out paper.\u201d The novel began as drawings on his wall, and he will always draw before he writes, sketching scenes if he gets stuck. \u201cSome people like to walk, or go birdwatching. I like to sit and draw,\u201d he says, showing me a pretty line-drawing he doodled across the novel\u2019s title page on the train this morning. \u201cThe idea that I would only ever have a laptop screen and have to write straight on to it is intimidating for me because it happens elsewhere.\u201d His childhood home in High Wycombe was always very creative: \u201cEveryone would have a sketchbook in their bag on holiday.\u201d His mother is a photographer and his Welsh father, who didn\u2019t live with them, was \u201carty in sensibility, but never really got his act together\u201d. His brother is now \u201ca radical ambient drone musician\u201d and carpenter. Porter studied history of art at the Courtauld Institute in London, followed by an MA in radical performance art, psychoanalysis and feminism. While he knows he may have to return to publishing or try teaching at some point, for \u201cthis little moment\u201d he is enjoying being at home \u201cthinking about literature, playing games, drawing\u201d and finds \u201cthe chatter\u201d of his three boys, aged nine, seven and three, an inspiration: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of school run, a bit of cooking, then it\u2019s football \u2013 that\u2019s where I\u2019m getting the energy from.\u201d He often works alongside his wife, his \u201cchildhood sweetheart\u201d, now a freelance proofreader: \u201cWe sit next to each other and we break for coffee.

      "bodyText": "History is crowding in on James DeGale, whose long boxing career has been garlanded with titles and cursed by ill-health, and he will be driven by the spectre of retirement to overcome Chris Eubank Jr at the O2 Arena in south-east London on Saturday night. The most obvious prize is the IBO\u2019s vacant super-middleweight belt, a minor trinket, but the bigger achievement for both fighters is to remain employed in the industry when the lights are lowered. It is a classic contest between the gnarled veteran and the hustling younger man \u2013 although only by four years and, quirkily, Eubank has squeezed in one more bout in eight years as a pro \u2013 29 \u2013 than DeGale\u2019s 28 over nine years. DeGale\u2019s long-time friend and trainer, Jim McDonnell, conceded that \u201cdown the line\u201d his fighter might be vulnerable against a quality opponent but added: \u201cRight now James DeGale is at a different level to Chris Eubank Jr. Boxing is a skill, and James has got it. Chris has got all the willpower, but he hasn\u2019t got the skill James DeGale has got.\u201d That is a fair call. They share a common conqueror, George Groves, who retired after Callum Smith stopped him in seven rounds last September, and who is uniquely placed to judge their strengths and weaknesses. He was intrigued, for instance, to hear Eubank say he got the better of DeGale in training when they sparred several years ago. DeGale, who weighed in at 166lbs, one below his opponent, naturally denies Eubank\u2019s claims that he \u201cschooled him\u201d, and Groves would seem to take the side of a fighter from whom he never had much affection, even when sharing facilities at the Dale Youth boxing club as teenage amateurs. He remembers Eubank from other sparring sessions. As Groves told Boxing News: \u201cEubank had really built up this thing that had gone on [in sparring] but he must have had a lot of arguments when I wasn\u2019t there, when I\u2019d left the gym. He never spoke once when we used to spar. We\u2019d have sparring sessions and he\u2019d be good work but he was a paid sparring partner. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t show up, he\u2019d swarm me and I\u2019d have a bad spar. Then the next week I\u2019d have breakfast on time, get to the gym on time and switch on and he wouldn\u2019t lay a glove on me and I\u2019d punch him from pillar to post. That happened a few times. He was riding a wave of his own hype.\u201d As for DeGale, there is no chance of Groves coming out of retirement for a rematch with the fighter he beat in 2011. \u201cHe has taken the Eubank fight thinking he can fight me next, and he can\u2019t; that ship has sailed. That fight was never going to happen because he was such a nightmare to deal with. The goalposts were always moving. I\u2019m happy to miss out on the payday \u2013 as long as he loses it as well.\u201d There\u2019s always a pay-off punch in this business; the hostility between them never properly waned. Theirs was a clash of personality: the analytical and detached approach of Groves rubbing up against the more emotional psyche of DeGale. DeGale was in similarly edgy mood at the final press conference this week, probing for weak points in Eubank\u2019s makeup, with his adversary giving as good as he got. As should be the case in the fight, there was nothing in it. All three thrive on the psychology of boxing. It\u2019s done for Groves now, but there is life left in the business for the winner on Saturday night, including a world title to parlay into more money, but the assertion by both of them that defeat will lead to the exit door is less nailed on. If DeGale loses, certainly he will wonder, at 33, if he can ever get back to the level that delivered him an Olympic gold medal in Beijing and two world titles. Indeed, his co-opted assistant, Paulie Malignaggi, was honest enough to admit this. And McDonnell, himself a former European champion, was adamant he would advise him to retire if he lost. Then again, if the fight is a thrilling affair with the result disputed, the temptation to have a rematch will be considerable. Defeat for Eubank, who is four years younger, would be a setback but not, as he is selling it, the time to walk away. He is young in terms of energy expended and punishment taken, and there are places for him to go. It is, after all, his job. If he looks at the alternatives, he might easily be persuaded to change his mind.",

How Jussie Smollett\u2019s story unravelled The Empire star Jussie Smollett was arrested by Chicago police on Thursday, accused of faking a racist, homophobic attack to earn sympathy and improve his salary. Jamiles Lartey traces the twists and turns in a plotline too implausible for television drama. Opinion Mike Pompeo and John Bolton have led the Trump administration\u2019s charge against multilateralism. The US should be wary of flouting the rules-based international system, writes Mark Medish. If we pursue lawless self-help, others will too. Multilateralism is a strategic bet on normative advances based on mutuality. The converse is certainly true: self-help will accelerate a collapse of shared legal standards. Sport After Duke\u2019s NBA prospect Zion Williamson suffered a scary injury on the court this week, the Golden State Warriors center DeMarcus Cousins has sharply criticised the college basketball system, which provides little safety net for players while tickets sell for thousands of dollars. The \u201cwhole NCAA business\u201d is \u201ccrooked\u201d, Cousins said. The clash between Manchester United and Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday could be momentous for both teams, and a win for Liverpool would seriously improve their title chances.

(\u201cSunglasses are camp,\u201d noted Bolton.) \u201cWe go from sun kings to drag queens,\u201d said Anna Wintour, speaking in her capacity as trustee of the Met Museum rather than in what she referred to as her \u201cday job\u201d as editor-in-chief at American Vogue. Inspired by Sontag\u2019s 1964 essay Notes on Camp, the show\u2019s 125 exhibits will include catwalk pieces by exhibition sponsor Gucci and by conceptual Dutch duo Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren of Viktor&amp;Rolf, alongside artworks including a full-length portrait of Oscar Wilde in a frock coat. It will tell the story of camp\u2019s origins in Louis XIV\u2019s court at Versailles, through the legendary drag queens of Victorian London, to the 1930s Berlin nightclub scene. Wintour gave an uncharacteristically emotional tribute to the late Karl Lagerfeld, pieces from whose 1987 Chanel collection inspired by Versailles are included in the exhibition. He was \u201cthe very best benefactor and collaborator, as erudite as he was generous,\u201d she said. \u201cBearing in mind Karl\u2019s wicked and wonderful sense of humour, I know he would have loved this exhibition.\u201d The exhibition may be controversial among members of the LGBT community who feel that defining camp primarily as an aesthetic belittles its significance. This issue of the \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019 of camp was addressed by Bolton, who acknowledged the grievance felt by those who believe Sontag downplayed their connection to camp. \u201cCamp began as a private code in the gay community,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped to engage with this debate in a nuanced way. \u201cThere is a generosity to camp, as well as a great sophistication,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "In an unprecedented move, Nigel Scullion has used his powers under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act to compel the Northern Land Council to meet to resolve a perceived conflict of interest involving some of its senior executives. It\u2019s the first time since the Land Rights Act was introduced in 1976 that a minister for Indigenous affairs has used his powers in this way. The NLC\u2019s interim chief executive, Jak ah Kit, described the move as \u201cgung-ho, irresponsible and not showing common sense\u201d. \u201cSenator Scullion has politicised, and given credibility to, baseless allegations,\u201d Ah Kit said. The NLC\u2019s full council is the major decision-making body within the organisation, and has 78 members elected from across the NLC\u2019s seven regions. In December, members of the council wrote to Scullion, asking him to launch a full investigation into the NLC, as bitter tensions continued after the abrupt sacking of its chief executive, Joe Morrison, in November. As well as questioning Morrison\u2019s termination, members alleged there was a perceived conflict of interest between the NLC executive and the board of another organisation, the Aboriginal Investment Group (AIG). The AIG is described as \u201ca not-for-profit Aboriginal organisation, dedicated to creating Aboriginal prosperity through innovative investment\u201d. It says it is \u201c100% Aboriginal owned and self-funded\u201d. The AIG owns the building in Darwin which the NLC rents for $1m a year. There have been protracted negotiations over the rent since the 10-year lease expired in April 2017. Members claim the rental negotiations were made more complicated by the fact that NLC executive members are also the board of the AIG. Scullion told the Senate on Friday he had invoked his powers after receiving an audit report on the perceived conflict. However, Ah Kit said the NLC had just completed six of its seven regular regional meetings, with the seventh due on Monday. Ah Kit said in all six meetings \u201cmembers said they don\u2019t see conflict of interest with the chair and the deputy chair\u201d and were concerned that the audit was \u201crushed and unfair\u201d. Ah Kit said a full council meeting would cost more than $200,000 to hold, and one was already scheduled for May. He said legal advice provided to the NLC was that the report \u201cdoes not comply with accepted auditing standards. It contains no recommendations or findings. It lists some, but not all, of the evidence, but makes no attempt to evaluate the evidence, or make findings of fact.\u201d Nevertheless, he said the full council meeting would go ahead on 8 March, as demanded by Scullion, because \u201cwe want to defend our reputation and our integrity, and show our good will\u201d. \u201cWe are not going to be taken to with a big stick by a minister of the crown because he thinks he\u2019s right.\u201d The former chief executive, Joe Morrison, was appointed in 2014, after an external review of the NLC identified a \u201cfundamental breakdown in the governance framework\u201d resulting in \u201cserious failings in almost all aspects of the council\u2019s administration\u201d. In 2015, the Australian National Audit Office found weaknesses in the NLC\u2019s financial management and reporting, but by the following year reported \u201cthere was a notable energy and commitment from staff and managers to achieve the aims of the reforms over the longer term\u201d. But midway through November, Morrison suddenly announced he was resigning for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d, although he would stay on in the role until March 2019. Eight of the nine-member executive of the NLC met two weeks later and resolved to terminate his employment immediately, a move that angered other NLC members, who claim they were not consulted on the decision and questioned the motivation for it, in an open letter. \u201cThis letter, and the request to the Minister to intervene, were not the members\u2019 preference in dealing with internal business of the land council\u201d but they felt \u201cthis is the only approach left available that may result in answers to the allegations against the executive\u201d. \u201cPlease provide us (your members) the evidence and motivation that resulted in Mr Morrison\u2019s automatic dismissal and public humiliation was not based on our (full council) resolution to obtain an approximate 25% reduction in the lease agreement on the property owned by the Aboriginal Investment Group (AIG), which interestingly you and the other NLC Executive members are directors of,\u201d the letter says. At the time of Morrison\u2019s dismissal, the NLC was two years into a wide-ranging reform agenda covering almost all aspects of the governance and administration of the council.",

So it is good to know that they still make tracks that sound as if they arrived at the studio in a violently shaking box, were let out in a storm of nails, teeth, two-note synths and guitar squeals, and got chased around with a control pole as the band tried to get a chorus muzzle on them before they mauled any babies.

Several county governments have also passed local resolutions officially opposing enforcement of the laws. The moves may pose a significant threat to Washington\u2019s ambitious agenda on firearms reform, and some activists say it is beginning to resemble a full-scale \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d revolt against gun control. A growing number of sheriffs, almost all in rural counties, have publicly stated that they will not, or believe they cannot, enforce the provisions of I1639, a ballot measure passed by popular vote last November which aims to restrict access to and use of assault weapons. Their positions \u2013 outlined in written statements, local media reports, and Facebook posts \u2013 occupy varying points on a spectrum of resistance. A few, like the Klickitat county sheriff, Bob Songer, say that they would not only not enforce the laws, but would consider preventing other agencies from doing so in their counties. Others, like Sheriff Brad Thurman in Cowlitz county, have cited a continuing legal challenge from the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment Foundation as evidence that the laws may not be constitutional, and are proposing to hold off enforcement until that case is resolved. Another group, including the Spokane county sheriff, Ozzie Knezovich, have argued that the law as it stands is so vague that there is \u201cnothing to enforce\u201d. But all of these positions add up to a refusal to enforce I1639 in the form in which it was passed by Washington voters. Only four county sheriffs so far have publicly committed to enforcing the laws. Meanwhile, several rural county governments \u2013 including Cowlitz, Franklin and Stevens Counties \u2013 have now passed resolutions opposing enforcement of I1639. Gray\u2019s Harbor county is considering a similar resolution. County commissioners passing resolutions in opposition to the laws have electoral incentives for doing so in parts of the state where gun reform is not popular with voters, but they have also been subject to intense lobbying efforts by rightwing second amendment activists. Joey Gibson, the leader of the Portland-area Patriot Prayer group, which has been involved in several violent protests in the city, and Matt Marshall, president of the rightwing Washington Three Percenters group, have addressed several county meetings urging commissioners and voters to adopt so-called \u201cSecond Amendment Sanctuary\u201d ordinances. In a video of a speech in Island county, Gibson urged locals \u201cto bring the power back to a local level\u201d by refusing laws which he described as unconstitutional. Gibson did not respond to questions seeking to clarify his views on the constitution. So-called \u201cCounty Supremacy\u201d and related ideas originated in far-right and white supremacist movements like the Posse Comitatus, who asserted that county sheriffs were the highest constitutional authority. The researcher Spencer Sunshine wrote in a report for Political Research Associates that ideas of county supremacy in the Pacific north-west had been \u201cmainstreamed into local and state governments, aided by a lurch to the right inside the Republican Party\u201d. Groups like the Washington State Firearms Coalition have been promoting the idea of \u201cnullification\u201d \u2013 that lower levels of government can void unconstitutional laws passed at higher levels \u2013 even though such doctrines have been repeatedly rejected by the supreme court. Resistance to the law also reflects a deep divide between rural and urban Washingtonians. I1639 was passed overwhelmingly by urban voters west of the Cascades, in areas like Seattle and its suburbs, but was rejected in smaller rural counties, especially in the state\u2019s east and south. The law mostly targets semi-automatic rifles. Purchasers of these weapons must now be over 21, undergo an enhanced background check, have completed a safety course, and wait nine days to take possession of their weapon. Also, gun owners who fail to store their weapons safely risk felony \u201ccommunity endangerment\u201d charges. Ahead of the vote last year, the Washington State Sheriffs Association voiced public opposition to law along with the Washington State Patrol Troopers Association, the Washington Fraternal Order of Police, and the Washington Council of Police &amp; Sheriffs. The battle over guns is now intertwined with other rightwing political projects in Washington. On Friday, outside the state Capitol in Olympia, a joint rally will take place advocating both second amendment rights and the breaking off of eastern Washington into a separate state. The rally will be addressed by a Spokane Valley-based state representative, Matt Shea. Recently, Shea made a video in which he boasted of carrying a concealed firearm into Washington\u2019s state house. The Washington state attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has admonished law enforcement officers in an open letter. Ferguson said he was \u201cdeeply concerned that the failure of local law enforcement to perform Initiative 1639\u2019s background check requirement will jeopardize public safety in our state\u201d. He pointed to his own defense of Washington\u2019s death penalty, despite personal disagreement with the law, and wrote: \u201cAs public officers, our duty is to abide by the will of the people we serve, and implement and enforce the laws they adopt\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The University of Farmington website described a college that would prepare students to succeed in an \u201cever-globalizing economy\u201d. Students would show up at campus wearing backpacks and asking questions about classes. The US government listed Farmington as eligible to enroll foreign students. The school president, whose LinkedIn page is still online, sent emails to students describing his institution as \u201ca nationally accredited institution authorized to enroll international students\u201d. But it was all a sham to snare immigrants. Court documents unsealed last month unveiled a stunning scheme by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create a fake university \u2013 with no classes or professors, just a staff of undercover agents who went on to build a case that has seen 161 foreign nationals arrested. \u201cThese are students who are trying to make their lives better, these are not criminals, these are not people who are here leeching off the system,\u201d said Amer Zahr, an adjunct professor of law at the University of Detroit-Mercy and a spokesman for Najlaa Krim Musarsa, one of the students arrested. Musarsa, a 29-year-old woman from Palestine, was one of those arrested without trial for civil immigration violations because she enrolled in the university, located just outside of Detroit in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Eight other people were charged with criminal violations and are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks and tuition credits from February 2017 to January 2019. Attorneys and civil rights advocates emphasize there is a stark line between the eight indicted on criminal charges and the students arrested on civil charges. \u201cEveryone was taken completely by surprise,\u201d Zahr said. \u201cThere was no warning of this action. There was no notice given to her [Musarsa] that she was out of status, that this university was fake.\u201d Most of the students were Indian and the country\u2019s government issued a rare \u201cd\u00e9marche\u201d to the US embassy in New Delhi stating the government needed immediate access to the detainees. As of 5 February, India consular officials had visited 36 different detention centers across the US and created a 24/7 hotline for impacted students. Since the indictment was unsealed on 30 January, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has maintained each of the more than 600 people enrolled at the University of Farmington knew they would not attend real classes or earn credits. \u201cTheir intent was to fraudulently maintain their student visa status and to obtain work authorization,\u201d the indictment said. Faiza Patel, the codirector of the liberty and national security program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, said it was not 100% clear that every student knew what they were getting into. \u201cNormally, we would like our law enforcement agencies to be investigating crimes that are already occurring as opposed to spending time and resources in creating elaborate sting operations,\u201d said Patel. Patel noted Ice has been under fire in recent years for its aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which target criminals and people who have civil immigration violations in equal measure. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question as to whether this is the best use of Ice\u2019s resources,\u201d Patel said. \u201cI think these days we have a lot of open questions about whether the way Ice is responding is a logical response to the problems this country faces.\u201d At the University of Farmington, federal agents posed as school officials in emails and registered the school with the state of Michigan, according to emails obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Workers at the building listed as University of Farmington\u2019s location told local news channel WXYZ that students would come in asking what time the school opened and closed and complained they had trouble getting in touch with school representatives. The undercover operation was led by the nation\u2019s second largest investigative agency, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is one of the three branches of Ice. A 2008 Ice handbook leaked last year showed that while undercover agents are advised not to induce people to commit crimes, exceptions can be made and are internally regulated.

He cautioned that creating a sham university was in line with other tactics used by Ice, such as its habit also revealed last month of creating fake court dates for immigration hearings. Guisado said: \u201cThis is not the first fake university that DHS created and I don\u2019t think it will be the last.\u201d",

The <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/heres-how-much-money-american-women-earn-at-every-age.html\">average American woman</a> between the ages of 25 and 34 makes $37,804 per year. That goes up to $45,604 for women 35-44, but either way, the math just doesn\u2019t add up \u2013 especially considering that <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/10/facts-about-u-s-mothers/\">one in four</a> American mothers are raising their children alone.</p> \n<p>American women have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/04/11/the-u-s-used-to-be-a-world-leader-in-women-working-not-anymore/?utm_term=.09db575692e4\">significantly lower workplace participation rates</a> than women in economically comparable nations, including most of western Europe, Canada, the UK, Australia, and Japan. This was not always true \u2013 American women used to be toward the front of the pack in workplace participation \u2013 and so the explanation for our lagging behind isn\u2019t culture; it\u2019s policy. Most of the rest of the economically prosperous world offers paid parental leave as well as some mechanism for affordable childcare. The US doesn\u2019t, and it\u2019s American women, our families, and the national economy that all pay the price.</p> \n<p>This isn\u2019t new. But the focus on it is \u2013 and that\u2019s almost entirely a result of having more women at the table, whether that\u2019s in political office, on campaigns and as staff members, as thinktank employees and policy experts, as dedicated educators, or on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/opinion/sunday/child-care-daycare-democrats-progressive.html\">influential newspaper op-ed pages</a>. Policy makers and those who influence them don\u2019t tend to see what our family structures and economic choices have rendered invisible, and female labor leads the list. A great many men haven\u2019t given much thought to childcare, either because their wives stayed home and did it or because it was considered more of a mother\u2019s problem than a couple\u2019s. This is still true: how many times have you heard heterosexual couples say that she decided to stay home because childcare cost as much as her salary \u2013 with the assumption that childcare is primarily her responsibility, not a whole-family investment?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"19d8a6ba-012d-4330-b83f-c73336f07427\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jmtuGDMvpSg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The men who stay in the workforce simply don\u2019t see what women lose when we drop out of it to raise kids, even for a few years. It\u2019s not such a simple calculus as her salary v childcare costs; it\u2019s also about experience, the ability to move up the ladder, and the fact that the prime building-block years of one\u2019s career often come right around the same time women are having and raising children. Dropping out of the workforce for years doesn\u2019t mean you hit pause; often, it means you have to totally rewind, or can never get back to where you were \u2013 and certainly will never get to where you could have been.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It\u2019s not just Warren\u2019s policy itself \u2013 it\u2019s the emphasis she is putting on it</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>All of this is sold to women as \u201cchoice\u201d. But there isn\u2019t much of a choice for women who have invited small, vulnerable and beloved human beings in the world and have no way to both work and care for them. For men, the answer to this problem as always been \u201cwomen\u201d. For women, at least in America, it\u2019s long been: \u201cJust figure it out.\u201d And when we choose the least bad of a series of inadequate options and pay some significant cost, either professional or personal, we are told that was our choice.</p> \n<p>Because women have just handled it, men in power have been able to ignore what a problem this is for millions upon millions of American families. Which is why it\u2019s so crucial that women have the power to dictate both policy <em>and</em> priorities. Warren isn\u2019t the first candidate to put childcare at the forefront of her campaign \u2013 credit goes to Hillary Clinton for that. Warren built on Clinton\u2019s proposal, making her own even <a href=\"https://prospect.org/article/baby-overdue\">more extensive</a>. That\u2019s another example of why having women run matters: One woman isn\u2019t going to bring about an overnight feminist revolution, but as more join, change trends in the right direction.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/09/elizabeth-warren-rigged-system-2020-launch-massachusetts\">'Rigged system': will Warren's rage against the rich win over 2020 voters?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And it\u2019s not just Warren\u2019s policy itself \u2013 it\u2019s the emphasis she is putting on it, which stands in sharp contrast to the other contenders in the field, and what progressive male politicians have tended to highlight. While Bernie Sanders also supports affordable childcare, it did not get the kind of top billing from his campaign that free college saw in 2016 (given that Sanders just announced his 2020 bid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/20/bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-campaign-fundraising\">a few days ago</a>, it\u2019s a bit too premature to fairly assess his priorities this time around, and childcare may still top the list). Most Democratic candidates will put forward a slew of policies on everything from the environment to the family to taxes to guns to immigration. But watch what they feature most prominently and focus on first \u2013 that tells you a lot about what they will do in office, whom they\u2019re speaking to, and what perspective they are speaking from.</p> \n<p>Warren\u2019s childcare proposal <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153131/glaring-hole-elizabeth-warrens-childcare-plan\">isn\u2019t perfect</a>, but luckily it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 it\u2019s a starting point for a broader discussion of what families need now, and the more we dig into it, the more we can nudge it in a more comprehensive direction. The fact that it\u2019s not just on the table but the centerpiece of Warren\u2019s bid is the most exciting and necessary event of the primaries thus far.</p> \n<p>Democrats made incredible gains in the midterms thanks to the female voters who turned out by the masses to vote in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/record-number-of-women-appear-headed-for-congress/2018/11/06/76a9e60a-e1eb-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html?utm_term=.c351526651a8\">record number</a> of congresswomen. By putting childcare first in her campaign, Warren sends a crucial message: that she sees them, hears them, has been them. And that robust, affordable childcare is a key to making America great, especially for American women.</p> \n<p><br></p>",

Dropping out of the workforce for years doesn\u2019t mean you hit pause; often, it means you have to totally rewind, or can never get back to where you were \u2013 and certainly will never get to where you could have been. All of this is sold to women as \u201cchoice\u201d. But there isn\u2019t much of a choice for women who have invited small, vulnerable and beloved human beings in the world and have no way to both work and care for them. For men, the answer to this problem as always been \u201cwomen\u201d. For women, at least in America, it\u2019s long been: \u201cJust figure it out.\u201d And when we choose the least bad of a series of inadequate options and pay some significant cost, either professional or personal, we are told that was our choice. Because women have just handled it, men in power have been able to ignore what a problem this is for millions upon millions of American families. Which is why it\u2019s so crucial that women have the power to dictate both policy and priorities. Warren isn\u2019t the first candidate to put childcare at the forefront of her campaign \u2013 credit goes to Hillary Clinton for that. Warren built on Clinton\u2019s proposal, making her own even more extensive. That\u2019s another example of why having women run matters: One woman isn\u2019t going to bring about an overnight feminist revolution, but as more join, change trends in the right direction. And it\u2019s not just Warren\u2019s policy itself \u2013 it\u2019s the emphasis she is putting on it, which stands in sharp contrast to the other contenders in the field, and what progressive male politicians have tended to highlight. While Bernie Sanders also supports affordable childcare, it did not get the kind of top billing from his campaign that free college saw in 2016 (given that Sanders just announced his 2020 bid a few days ago, it\u2019s a bit too premature to fairly assess his priorities this time around, and childcare may still top the list). Most Democratic candidates will put forward a slew of policies on everything from the environment to the family to taxes to guns to immigration. But watch what they feature most prominently and focus on first \u2013 that tells you a lot about what they will do in office, whom they\u2019re speaking to, and what perspective they are speaking from. Warren\u2019s childcare proposal isn\u2019t perfect, but luckily it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 it\u2019s a starting point for a broader discussion of what families need now, and the more we dig into it, the more we can nudge it in a more comprehensive direction. The fact that it\u2019s not just on the table but the centerpiece of Warren\u2019s bid is the most exciting and necessary event of the primaries thus far. Democrats made incredible gains in the midterms thanks to the female voters who turned out by the masses to vote in a record number of congresswomen. By putting childcare first in her campaign, Warren sends a crucial message: that she sees them, hears them, has been them. And that robust, affordable childcare is a key to making America great, especially for American women.",

      "body": "<p>A whole match could be summed up by Sophie Devine\u2019s groan as she hit the ball. Ellyse Perry\u2019s first of the day. Short, wide. Devine slapped it in the air straight to point, and even as it left her bat she knew she\u2019d made a mess of it.</p> <p>And with that first wicket of their run chase, it already felt like New Zealand would again be unable to defy history and unable to make the most of a chance they\u2019d created.</p> <p>The last time the New Zealand women\u2019s team beat Australia in a one-day international series to claim the Rose Bowl, we still had almost a year left to solve the Y2K bug. The Offspring had just won the Hottest 100 with Pretty Fly for a White Guy, and Rangana Herath was six months away from his Test debut. Belinda Clark, who captained Australia\u2019s loss, now has her name on the player of the year medal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/12/alyssa-healy-and-pat-cummins-land-major-australian-cricket-honours\">awarded last week to Alyssa Healy</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/18/danni-wyatt-horrible-thoughts-england-india-tour\">Danni Wyatt: \u2018It\u2019s about getting those horrible thoughts out of your head\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That streak is unlikely to change after the Kiwis went down by five runs to start a new series. Twice they had their chance. From having Australia 187 for 7 when the big-hitting Ash Gardner holed out, the score should never have got as far as 241. Then as New Zealand captain Amy Satterthwaite approached a century in the chase it looked like she might steer her team home, but Australia\u2019s bowling options proved too many.</p> <p>Devine has played eons of cricket against Perry. A quarter of the New Zealander\u2019s 100 career ODIs and almost a quarter of her international Twenty20s have been up against her opposing all-rounder, not to mention four seasons of the Women\u2019s Big Bash. Devine has just finished up a monster WBBL worth 556 runs. Yet Perry\u2019s loosener, the seventh delivery of the match, did in New Zealand\u2019s most destructive player for just three.</p> <p>It seemed to confirm the spurning of an opportunity. It wasn\u2019t like New Zealand smashed through Australia\u2019s batting; in Waca conditions offering swing and bounce it was more a steady erosion. But while the newly promoted Rachael Haynes kept the scoring going, Australia\u2019s run-gluttons in Healy, Perry and Meg Lanning were prised out for single figures. Lea Tahuhu straightened a ball to clip Healy\u2019s off stump, debut seamer Rosemary Mair got the dream first wicket of Lanning thanks to Satterthwaite\u2019s insouciant one-handed stunner at slip, and Devine drew Perry\u2019s edge to the keeper.</p> <p>Leg-spinner Amelia Kerr produced a brilliant googly to have the left-handed Beth Mooney nick behind on 13, then Elyse Villani caught for 18 at backward point. Haynes had holed out in the meantime to give Mair a second, having held more than half the innings together with 67.</p> <p>But despite being bowled out in the final over, Australia\u2019s bottom four were able to gather 64 runs to push the total from comfortable to challenging, Jess Jonassen leading the way with 36. Nor did New Zealand help themselves in the field. Tahuhu on the boundary conceded a six and a four when better positioning would have yielded catches. Ground fielding mistakes conceded a dozen runs, while 16 wides further inflated the total.</p> <p>Devine\u2019s dismissal was compounded by Suzie Bates getting a shocker: batting yards out of her crease, with Megan Schutt bowling wide on hers to send down booming in-swingers, commentator Dirk Nannes spent several minutes explaining how it was impossible for Bates to be given out leg-before when every ball would angle down leg or strike outside the line. The umpire immediately decided to get creative.</p> <p>Perry set up Lauren Down with a pair of outswingers before angling one in to nail the stumps, before leg-spinner Wareham turned one back to bowl Katey Martin around her legs on the sweep. Satterthwaite and Katie Perkins caused some worry for Australia with a 99-run partnership that took the score to 188, but 54 required at a run a ball was still a fair buffer.</p> <p>Enter Jonassen, who caught Perkins off her own delivery, then returned in the 47th over to bowl Kerr and Leigh Kasperek. Satterthwaite did her best but her 92 was never entirely convincing: Healy had dropped her off Lauren Cheatle on the pace ace\u2019s return from injury, then had missed a stumping off Gardner, while later Satterthwaite was almost certainly run out but the cameras in use didn\u2019t have a high enough frame rate to prove it.</p> <p>When Satterthwaite was forced to skew a high catch with 19 needed from nine balls, Jonassen had four wickets and the White Ferns had blown it. Having dipped to 1-0, the chance for a first Rose Bowl win in the 21st century looks remote. The singer Lorde, who often booms out of PA speakers at matches in this country, was again the most successful New Zealander at an Australian cricket ground. </p>",

      "bodyText": "A whole match could be summed up by Sophie Devine\u2019s groan as she hit the ball. Ellyse Perry\u2019s first of the day. Short, wide. Devine slapped it in the air straight to point, and even as it left her bat she knew she\u2019d made a mess of it. And with that first wicket of their run chase, it already felt like New Zealand would again be unable to defy history and unable to make the most of a chance they\u2019d created. The last time the New Zealand women\u2019s team beat Australia in a one-day international series to claim the Rose Bowl, we still had almost a year left to solve the Y2K bug. The Offspring had just won the Hottest 100 with Pretty Fly for a White Guy, and Rangana Herath was six months away from his Test debut. Belinda Clark, who captained Australia\u2019s loss, now has her name on the player of the year medal awarded last week to Alyssa Healy. That streak is unlikely to change after the Kiwis went down by five runs to start a new series. Twice they had their chance. From having Australia 187 for 7 when the big-hitting Ash Gardner holed out, the score should never have got as far as 241. Then as New Zealand captain Amy Satterthwaite approached a century in the chase it looked like she might steer her team home, but Australia\u2019s bowling options proved too many. Devine has played eons of cricket against Perry. A quarter of the New Zealander\u2019s 100 career ODIs and almost a quarter of her international Twenty20s have been up against her opposing all-rounder, not to mention four seasons of the Women\u2019s Big Bash. Devine has just finished up a monster WBBL worth 556 runs. Yet Perry\u2019s loosener, the seventh delivery of the match, did in New Zealand\u2019s most destructive player for just three. It seemed to confirm the spurning of an opportunity. It wasn\u2019t like New Zealand smashed through Australia\u2019s batting; in Waca conditions offering swing and bounce it was more a steady erosion. But while the newly promoted Rachael Haynes kept the scoring going, Australia\u2019s run-gluttons in Healy, Perry and Meg Lanning were prised out for single figures. Lea Tahuhu straightened a ball to clip Healy\u2019s off stump, debut seamer Rosemary Mair got the dream first wicket of Lanning thanks to Satterthwaite\u2019s insouciant one-handed stunner at slip, and Devine drew Perry\u2019s edge to the keeper. Leg-spinner Amelia Kerr produced a brilliant googly to have the left-handed Beth Mooney nick behind on 13, then Elyse Villani caught for 18 at backward point. Haynes had holed out in the meantime to give Mair a second, having held more than half the innings together with 67. But despite being bowled out in the final over, Australia\u2019s bottom four were able to gather 64 runs to push the total from comfortable to challenging, Jess Jonassen leading the way with 36. Nor did New Zealand help themselves in the field. Tahuhu on the boundary conceded a six and a four when better positioning would have yielded catches. Ground fielding mistakes conceded a dozen runs, while 16 wides further inflated the total. Devine\u2019s dismissal was compounded by Suzie Bates getting a shocker: batting yards out of her crease, with Megan Schutt bowling wide on hers to send down booming in-swingers, commentator Dirk Nannes spent several minutes explaining how it was impossible for Bates to be given out leg-before when every ball would angle down leg or strike outside the line. The umpire immediately decided to get creative. Perry set up Lauren Down with a pair of outswingers before angling one in to nail the stumps, before leg-spinner Wareham turned one back to bowl Katey Martin around her legs on the sweep. Satterthwaite and Katie Perkins caused some worry for Australia with a 99-run partnership that took the score to 188, but 54 required at a run a ball was still a fair buffer. Enter Jonassen, who caught Perkins off her own delivery, then returned in the 47th over to bowl Kerr and Leigh Kasperek. Satterthwaite did her best but her 92 was never entirely convincing: Healy had dropped her off Lauren Cheatle on the pace ace\u2019s return from injury, then had missed a stumping off Gardner, while later Satterthwaite was almost certainly run out but the cameras in use didn\u2019t have a high enough frame rate to prove it. When Satterthwaite was forced to skew a high catch with 19 needed from nine balls, Jonassen had four wickets and the White Ferns had blown it. Having dipped to 1-0, the chance for a first Rose Bowl win in the 21st century looks remote. The singer Lorde, who often booms out of PA speakers at matches in this country, was again the most successful New Zealander at an Australian cricket ground.",

      "bodyText": "The book I am currently reading Isabella Hammad\u2019s forthcoming debut The Parisian. It\u2019s a big family novel like Vikram Seth\u2019s A Suitable Boy but it charts the history of Palestine, and starts off on a ship to Marseille. The prose is impeccable. The book I wish I\u2019d written Home by Marilynne Robinson. Racial politics, family and faith \u2013 the perfect combination of spiritual insight and human failings. The book that influenced my writing Voyage in the Dark by Jean Rhys. The young woman from a warmer climate pushing her way through a baffling Britain, the wretchedness and vulnerability of being an outsider written simply and transparently \u2013 it haunts everything I write. The book that is most underrated Tayeb Salih\u2019s Season of Migration to the North and Ayi Kwei Armah\u2019s The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born are just as powerful as Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart, if not more. They deserve the same readership. The book that changed my life When I first moved from Sudan to Scotland in my mid-20s, I was homesick and troubled. Mercy Oceans Book Two by Mevlana Sheikh Nazim Adil Al\u2011Haqqani An-Naqshband made me understand what I was yearning for. The book that changed my mind In successive stages Alan Spence\u2019s The Magic Flute, Robin Jenkins\u2019s The Cone-Gatherers and James Robertson\u2019s And the Land Lay Still convinced me that I could connect to Scotland as a place, that I could love it and write about it. The last book that made me laugh Mimi by Lucy Ellmann. There is a fight scene involving bagels which still makes me laugh just thinking about it. The book I couldn\u2019t finish I had to force myself to stop reading A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. It was gripping but that feast of heartbreak and cruelty was releasing toxins into my system.

What makes these endurance athletes different from others who pursue similar challenges as part of a team, or while competing against fellow athletes? Are they simply made of tougher stuff?</p> <p>Across the spectrum of athletic pursuits, people have accomplished staggering feats solo. <a href=\"http://www.alexhonnold.com/\">Alex Honnold</a> was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/10/climbing-el-capitan-alex-honnold-yosemite\">first climber to \u201cfree solo\u201d Yosemite\u2019s 3,000-foot El Capitan</a> wall \u2014 climbing without ropes or harnesses.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.jessicawatson.com.au/\">Jessica Watson </a>was 16, she became the youngest person to sail around the world solo and nonstop. She wanted to challenge people\u2019s expectations of what young girls could do. <a href=\"http://diananyad.com/\">Diana Nyad </a>was the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage \u2014 on her fifth attempt, at age 64.</p> <p>In August, <a href=\"https://www.brycerows.com/\">Bryce Carlson </a>broke the world record for the fastest west-to-east unsupported row across the north Atlantic Ocean. The previous record belonged to a boat of four people. Carlson set off solo from Newfoundland in a custom-made boat and landed at the Isles of Scilly a little more than 38 days later. He\u2019s the first American to row this route solo and unsupported.</p> <p>Endurance sports are not new to Carlson, who rowed at the University of Michigan, ran ultramarathons and then ran across the US, from California to Maryland, with 11 other runners. On that run, Carlson always had other runners and support staff around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"box\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;body style=&quot;padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;base href=&quot;.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\t&lt;script src=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/libs/iframe-messenger/iframeMessenger.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; iframeMessenger.enableAutoResize(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt; &lt;link href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/gia/fonts/v1/fonts.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; &lt;link href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/assets/stylesheets/factbox3.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; &lt;style&gt;.wrapper{padding: 0 6px;}h1{font-family: 'Guardian Egyptian Web', Georgia, serif; font-weight: 900; color: #333;}.boxout-primary-content{padding-top: 3px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 24px; font-family: 'Guardian Text Sans Web', sans-serif;}.button{color: white; font-size: 14px; padding: 9px 36px 7px 12px; border-radius: 24px; display: table; margin-bottom: 4px; border: 0; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right 4px center;}.button:hover{text-decoration: none; opacity: 0.9; border: none;}.button--newsletter{background-color: #333; background-image: url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml; utf8, &lt;svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='30' height='30' viewBox='0 0 30 30'&gt;&lt;path fill='#fff' d='M22.8 14.6l-7.6-7.6-.7.7 5.5 6.6h-14v1.5h14l-5.5 6.6.7.7 7.6-7.6v-.9'/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&quot;);}.button--facebook{background-color: #3067a3; background-image: url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml; utf8, &lt;svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='32' height='32' viewBox='-2 -2 32 32'&gt;&lt;path fill='#ffffff' d='M17.9 14h-3v8h-2.9v-8h-2v-2.9h2v-2.4c0-1.9 1.1-3.7 4-3.7 1.2 0 2 .1 2 .1v3h-1.8c-1 0-1.2.5-1.2 1.3v1.8h3l-.1 2.8z'/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&quot;);}.button--twitter{background-color: #03b3ee; background-image: url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml; utf8, &lt;svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='32' height='32' viewBox='-2 -2 32 32'&gt;&lt;path fill='#ffffff' d='M21.3 10.5v.5c0 4.7-3.5 10.1-9.9 10.1-2 0-3.8-.6-5.3-1.6.3 0 .6.1.8.1 1.6 0 3.1-.6 4.3-1.5-1.5 0-2.8-1-3.3-2.4.2 0 .4.1.7.1l.9-.1c-1.6-.3-2.8-1.8-2.8-3.5.5.3 1 .4 1.6.4-.9-.6-1.6-1.7-1.6-2.9 0-.6.2-1.3.5-1.8 1.7 2.1 4.3 3.6 7.2 3.7-.1-.3-.1-.5-.1-.8 0-2 1.6-3.5 3.5-3.5 1 0 1.9.4 2.5 1.1.8-.1 1.5-.4 2.2-.8-.3.8-.8 1.5-1.5 1.9.7-.1 1.4-.3 2-.5-.4.4-1 1-1.7 1.5z'/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&quot;);}&lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/02/21/Global_Sport.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;boxout-primary-content&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;This story was originally published on GlobalSportMatters.com.

Carlson said he wondered, \u201cCan I live in my own head without being accountable to someone else and their standards?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/10/rich-alati-poker-player-bet-dark-room-isolation\">Hallucinations and $100,000: the poker player who shut himself in a pitch-black room for weeks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Carlson\u2019s boat capsized about a dozen times, and he got caught in bad weather and currents that took him in the wrong direction. He learned \u201cto remain patient with things I couldn\u2019t change, and to remain focused on things I had control over,\u201d he said. He was able to avoid getting upset, which he attributes to a decade of ultra running.</p> <p>Kevin Alschuler, PhD, is a psychologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine who led the psychology portion of a study that followed Carlson\u2019s team\u2019s run across the US, and he also gathered data from Carlson on his row. He had Carlson complete a daily questionnaire while on the Atlantic, along with a brief diary response asking him to describe the biggest challenge he faced that day and how he responded to it. The 15 questions asked about effort, physical symptoms (pain, fatigue) and psychological variables (confidence, anxiety, frustration).</p> <p>Alschuler and his team followed along in real time.</p> <p>\u201cWe were looking at things that we think are positive and helpful, as well as those that we think are negative or hurtful. In general, he was higher on the positive or helpful factors consistently, and he was lower on the negative or unhelpful,\u201d he said. They also asked Carlson to rate these factors, and his ratings showed \u201che really had the full range of experiences,\u201d even though he exhibited more positive than negative variables. From a psychologist\u2019s perspective, Alschuler said, \u201cWe\u2019re really interested in athletes\u2019 abilities to be mindful or fully present in the moment \u2014 what\u2019s happening in their competition or their event.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efb561af36fbe1d214f0928217e7bdf4083c3acd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efb561af36fbe1d214f0928217e7bdf4083c3acd/0_0_1200_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sun rises on another day of rowing for Bryce Carlson, who set a record for solo rowing across the Atlantic Ocean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sun rises on another day of rowing for Bryce Carlson, who set a record for solo rowing across the Atlantic Ocean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryce Carlson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carlson said staying in the moment and getting the most out of that moment had been a big challenge. On some days, he was less focused and more easily distracted.</p> <p>\u201cModern sport psychology thought is that you want athletes who are driven by these goals and these outcomes\u201d but who can set the goals aside and \u201creally immerse themselves in whatever step they\u2019re on,\u201d Alschuler said.

      "bodyText": "Few people have the will and the stamina needed to run across a continent or row across an ocean \u2014 and even fewer opt to do so alone and unsupported. What makes these endurance athletes different from others who pursue similar challenges as part of a team, or while competing against fellow athletes? Are they simply made of tougher stuff? Across the spectrum of athletic pursuits, people have accomplished staggering feats solo. Alex Honnold was the first climber to \u201cfree solo\u201d Yosemite\u2019s 3,000-foot El Capitan wall \u2014 climbing without ropes or harnesses. When Jessica Watson was 16, she became the youngest person to sail around the world solo and nonstop. She wanted to challenge people\u2019s expectations of what young girls could do. Diana Nyad was the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage \u2014 on her fifth attempt, at age 64. In August, Bryce Carlson broke the world record for the fastest west-to-east unsupported row across the north Atlantic Ocean. The previous record belonged to a boat of four people. Carlson set off solo from Newfoundland in a custom-made boat and landed at the Isles of Scilly a little more than 38 days later. He\u2019s the first American to row this route solo and unsupported. Endurance sports are not new to Carlson, who rowed at the University of Michigan, ran ultramarathons and then ran across the US, from California to Maryland, with 11 other runners. On that run, Carlson always had other runners and support staff around. \u201cI felt I did not really have the opportunity to sit with my own thoughts as much as I would have liked,\u201d and he looked forward to that in his transatlantic row, he explained. \u201cIt became a challenge, as well as an opportunity to explore myself and my psyche in ways that previous challenges of mine have not.\u201d Carlson, a high school biology teacher who holds a doctorate in biological anthropology, noted that many ocean rowers are \u201cathletes who have taken on challenges such as climbing Mount Everest, and this adventure is an extension of that kind of wanderlust and desire for challenge.\u201d And going solo makes it a different type of challenge. Carlson said he wondered, \u201cCan I live in my own head without being accountable to someone else and their standards?\u201d Carlson\u2019s boat capsized about a dozen times, and he got caught in bad weather and currents that took him in the wrong direction. He learned \u201cto remain patient with things I couldn\u2019t change, and to remain focused on things I had control over,\u201d he said. He was able to avoid getting upset, which he attributes to a decade of ultra running. Kevin Alschuler, PhD, is a psychologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine who led the psychology portion of a study that followed Carlson\u2019s team\u2019s run across the US, and he also gathered data from Carlson on his row. He had Carlson complete a daily questionnaire while on the Atlantic, along with a brief diary response asking him to describe the biggest challenge he faced that day and how he responded to it. The 15 questions asked about effort, physical symptoms (pain, fatigue) and psychological variables (confidence, anxiety, frustration). Alschuler and his team followed along in real time. \u201cWe were looking at things that we think are positive and helpful, as well as those that we think are negative or hurtful. In general, he was higher on the positive or helpful factors consistently, and he was lower on the negative or unhelpful,\u201d he said. They also asked Carlson to rate these factors, and his ratings showed \u201che really had the full range of experiences,\u201d even though he exhibited more positive than negative variables. From a psychologist\u2019s perspective, Alschuler said, \u201cWe\u2019re really interested in athletes\u2019 abilities to be mindful or fully present in the moment \u2014 what\u2019s happening in their competition or their event.\u201d Carlson said staying in the moment and getting the most out of that moment had been a big challenge. On some days, he was less focused and more easily distracted. \u201cModern sport psychology thought is that you want athletes who are driven by these goals and these outcomes\u201d but who can set the goals aside and \u201creally immerse themselves in whatever step they\u2019re on,\u201d Alschuler said. Carlson \u201cwanted to get across as quickly and as safely as he could, and there was a record out there that he might be able to break, but each day was a day of rowing,\u201d Alschuler explained. \u201cHe focused on what could he do to make the most of that day.\u201d When Carlson was positioning himself to avoid the worst of a hurricane, he landed in an adverse current that pulled him in the wrong direction. To cope, Carlson explained in his diary response, \u201cI focused on what was near at hand and controllable, navigated my boat as best I could.

Coordinator Tatiana Rezvaya-Crutchlow said many rowers quit on the first day, when they lose sight of the land, and \u201cyou have 360 degrees of just horizon.\u201d Some people celebrate their \u201cfreedom at last,\u201d but for others, fear sets in. \u201cIt\u2019s willpower over willpower,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>I was 14 when I got into following slimers such as Karina Garcia on YouTube. I was watching her videos all the time. For fun, I made an Instagram called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slimeglitterz/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Slimeglitterz</a> where I started learning how to make it for myself from YouTube tutorials. I loved it: it just felt good.</p> <p>You make slime by mixing together PVA glue, borax solution and sometimes glycerin to make it stretchy. At first I couldn\u2019t find borax so I was making it with contact-lens solution, baking soda, PVA glue from Poundland and body lotion (now I use online wholesalers who also supply schools). I was just trying lots of things and experimenting. My slimes were bad at first \u2013 just, like, jiggly. Jiggly is bad. You want it to be thick.</p> <p>When I started, two years ago, I had about 500 followers. Then, in May 2017, I had my first viral video, which got more than 300,000 views overnight. I think it was just the colours and shapes I was making, and the way I was handling it. There\u2019s a specific style that is eye-catching. You can always tell people who aren\u2019t used to touching slime: they poke it. Slime wasn\u2019t particularly big at my school, but there\u2019s a big online community who \u201cget\u201d it. I think people like seeing something pushed into something else and making a new texture. It\u2019s soothing and helps with anxiety. A mum emailed me the other week saying that her son had just lost his father, and my products helped keep them calm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have my own slime room at my parents\u2019 house. I sell my slimes on a Saturday at 6pm and sell out in 20 minutes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now I have 760,000 followers and I\u2019m the biggest UK slime shop. I have my own slime room at my parents\u2019 house where I make everything, film it and ship it for my store. I sell my slime on a Saturday at 6pm. Always the same time. I make hundreds of individual slimes a week, which are 8oz each for about \u00a310, and they sell out in about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Slimers have a huge international community where everyone connects. People buy from Saudi Arabia, China, Dubai and we get a lot of snow packet orders from Russia and Ukraine. Snow packets are instant snow \u2013 one of the key ingredients for a certain type of slime. My most viewed video is one with instant snow, which has about 3m views. It\u2019s just me pouring water into instant snow, and it\u2019s mesmerising.</p> <p>There are loads of different kinds of slime: butter slime, icy slime (which is velvety), cloud slime, which uses instant snow and has a coldish feel. I also add fragrances, jelly cubes which are like sponges, and chunks of foam called croutons, because texture is just as important as smell and look. My bestseller is a thick slime called grape soda pop. I tend not to use much glitter any more; I\u2019ve passed that phase of my life.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think my parents really got it until I started to going to conventions and they saw how popular my slimes were. They were supportive, though. </p> <p>Last May I was invited to my first convention, Slime Bash in Connecticut, where there were about 1,000 attendees.

      "bodyText": "I was 14 when I got into following slimers such as Karina Garcia on YouTube. I was watching her videos all the time. For fun, I made an Instagram called Slimeglitterz where I started learning how to make it for myself from YouTube tutorials. I loved it: it just felt good. You make slime by mixing together PVA glue, borax solution and sometimes glycerin to make it stretchy. At first I couldn\u2019t find borax so I was making it with contact-lens solution, baking soda, PVA glue from Poundland and body lotion (now I use online wholesalers who also supply schools). I was just trying lots of things and experimenting. My slimes were bad at first \u2013 just, like, jiggly. Jiggly is bad. You want it to be thick. When I started, two years ago, I had about 500 followers. Then, in May 2017, I had my first viral video, which got more than 300,000 views overnight. I think it was just the colours and shapes I was making, and the way I was handling it. There\u2019s a specific style that is eye-catching. You can always tell people who aren\u2019t used to touching slime: they poke it. Slime wasn\u2019t particularly big at my school, but there\u2019s a big online community who \u201cget\u201d it. I think people like seeing something pushed into something else and making a new texture. It\u2019s soothing and helps with anxiety. A mum emailed me the other week saying that her son had just lost his father, and my products helped keep them calm. Now I have 760,000 followers and I\u2019m the biggest UK slime shop. I have my own slime room at my parents\u2019 house where I make everything, film it and ship it for my store. I sell my slime on a Saturday at 6pm. Always the same time. I make hundreds of individual slimes a week, which are 8oz each for about \u00a310, and they sell out in about 20 minutes. Slimers have a huge international community where everyone connects. People buy from Saudi Arabia, China, Dubai and we get a lot of snow packet orders from Russia and Ukraine. Snow packets are instant snow \u2013 one of the key ingredients for a certain type of slime. My most viewed video is one with instant snow, which has about 3m views. It\u2019s just me pouring water into instant snow, and it\u2019s mesmerising. There are loads of different kinds of slime: butter slime, icy slime (which is velvety), cloud slime, which uses instant snow and has a coldish feel. I also add fragrances, jelly cubes which are like sponges, and chunks of foam called croutons, because texture is just as important as smell and look. My bestseller is a thick slime called grape soda pop. I tend not to use much glitter any more; I\u2019ve passed that phase of my life. I don\u2019t think my parents really got it until I started to going to conventions and they saw how popular my slimes were. They were supportive, though. Last May I was invited to my first convention, Slime Bash in Connecticut, where there were about 1,000 attendees. Mum and I took as much as we could carry, about 100 slimes, and we sold out in an hour. Now there\u2019s at least one every month \u2013 I\u2019ve even been invited to Brazil.

The act gives forest dwelling people the right to their ancestral lands, including those in specially \u201cprotected\u201d areas that contain sanctuaries and wildlife parks to conserve wild life. The groups told the court that \u201ctribal\u201d people in 20 states had encroached illegally on these protected areas, jeopardising efforts to protect wildlife and forests.</p> <p>The conservation groups said state governments should see if families could prove their claim under the act and, if they could, they should be allowed to live and work on the land. If they failed to prove their claim, they should be evicted by the state government.</p> <p>The supreme court has ordered the 20 state governments \u2013 where claims were considered by special committees \u2013 to act on about 1.1m claims now rejected as bogus and evict the families. Depending on the size of the families, more than 1m claims could translate to about 5-7 million people being evicted by 27 July.</p> <p>Survival International\u2019s director, Stephen Corry, said: \u201cThis judgment is a death sentence for millions of tribal people in India, land theft on an epic scale and a monumental injustice. It will lead to wholesale misery, impoverishment, disease and death, an urgent humanitarian crisis, and it will do nothing to save the forests which these tribespeople have protected for generations.\u201d</p> <p>Groups campaigning for the tribal people \u2013 among the poorest, most neglected and marginalised of India\u2019s communities \u2013 say that many of them would not have understood the need to produce the relevant documents proving their right to the land to the assessing committees.</p> <p>That claim has been rejected by wildlife groups who said that, given that millions of claims were filed on this issue (of which about 1.2m were accepted), there was widespread grassroots awareness of the need to stake their claim and how to do it.</p> <p>For wildlife protection groups, the issue is of India\u2019s forests being relentlessly eroded by humans encroaching on animal habitats. There have been innumerable cases of villagers illegally living on protected forests meant exclusively for animals.</p> <p>Debi Goenka, the head of the Conservation Action Trust, said that human rights activists and other groups who opposed the court order seemed to think that India could live without its forests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/exiles-human-cost-of-conservation-indigenous-peoples-eco-tourism\">The tribes paying the brutal price of conservation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said: \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realise is that, barring two, all of India\u2019s rivers are forest-dependent. Satellite imagery has shown tribal encroachments into protected forests. Can a country survive without forests? If they think India can survive without forests and without water, so be it.\u201d</p> <p>The issue is expected to become more heated in the coming weeks. Wildlife groups insist that all the court has done is tell state governments to recover forest land from people who made bogus claims which, after due process, were rejected. Those with genuine claims will be given title deeds to the land.</p> <p>On the other side of the debate are politicians such as the Communist party leader, Brinda Karat, who has written to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, in protest against the court\u2019s decision. She said: \u201cIt will be highly unjust to \u2026 traditional forest dwellers if an ordinance is not passed immediately to protect them from eviction \u2026 It will be a virtual declaration of war.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Millions of Indians face eviction after the country\u2019s supreme court ruled that indigenous people illegally living on forest land should move. Campaigners for the rights of tribal and forest-dwelling people have called the court\u2019s decision on Wednesday \u201can unprecedented disaster\u201d and \u201cthe biggest mass eviction in the name of conservation, ever\u201d. The ruling came in response to petitions filed by various wildlife conservation groups, which wanted the court to declare the 2006 Forest Rights Act invalid. The act gives forest dwelling people the right to their ancestral lands, including those in specially \u201cprotected\u201d areas that contain sanctuaries and wildlife parks to conserve wild life. The groups told the court that \u201ctribal\u201d people in 20 states had encroached illegally on these protected areas, jeopardising efforts to protect wildlife and forests. The conservation groups said state governments should see if families could prove their claim under the act and, if they could, they should be allowed to live and work on the land. If they failed to prove their claim, they should be evicted by the state government. The supreme court has ordered the 20 state governments \u2013 where claims were considered by special committees \u2013 to act on about 1.1m claims now rejected as bogus and evict the families. Depending on the size of the families, more than 1m claims could translate to about 5-7 million people being evicted by 27 July. Survival International\u2019s director, Stephen Corry, said: \u201cThis judgment is a death sentence for millions of tribal people in India, land theft on an epic scale and a monumental injustice. It will lead to wholesale misery, impoverishment, disease and death, an urgent humanitarian crisis, and it will do nothing to save the forests which these tribespeople have protected for generations.\u201d Groups campaigning for the tribal people \u2013 among the poorest, most neglected and marginalised of India\u2019s communities \u2013 say that many of them would not have understood the need to produce the relevant documents proving their right to the land to the assessing committees. That claim has been rejected by wildlife groups who said that, given that millions of claims were filed on this issue (of which about 1.2m were accepted), there was widespread grassroots awareness of the need to stake their claim and how to do it. For wildlife protection groups, the issue is of India\u2019s forests being relentlessly eroded by humans encroaching on animal habitats. There have been innumerable cases of villagers illegally living on protected forests meant exclusively for animals. Debi Goenka, the head of the Conservation Action Trust, said that human rights activists and other groups who opposed the court order seemed to think that India could live without its forests. He said: \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realise is that, barring two, all of India\u2019s rivers are forest-dependent. Satellite imagery has shown tribal encroachments into protected forests. Can a country survive without forests? If they think India can survive without forests and without water, so be it.\u201d The issue is expected to become more heated in the coming weeks. Wildlife groups insist that all the court has done is tell state governments to recover forest land from people who made bogus claims which, after due process, were rejected. Those with genuine claims will be given title deeds to the land. On the other side of the debate are politicians such as the Communist party leader, Brinda Karat, who has written to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, in protest against the court\u2019s decision. She said: \u201cIt will be highly unjust to \u2026 traditional forest dwellers if an ordinance is not passed immediately to protect them from eviction \u2026 It will be a virtual declaration of war.\u201d",

It is not clear whether they will submit new evidence or simply ask the committee to re-examine information already provided. In the event of Fifa\u2019s appeal committee upholding the ban, Chelsea could file a further appeal with the court of arbitration for sport.</p>\n    <p><b>Will Chelsea definitely be banned from the summer transfer window?&nbsp;</b>No. Any ban would take effect only upon completion of the appeal process, which has taken a long time before \u2013 although Fifa are expecting to consider Chelsea's appeal before the summer window opens. Chelsea may still be free to sign new players this summer, but their bargaining position would be weakened.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>What were the outcomes of similar appeals?&nbsp;</b>In 2014, Barcelona signed Luis Su\u00e1rez, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen while awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a similar ban, which was eventually upheld by Cas, leaving the Catalan club unable to buy players during 2015. The following year Real Madrid got a ban reduced by Cas to one transfer window. In 2017, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s two-window ban was confirmed by Cas. Chelsea have previously appealed successfully against a Fifa ban when, in 2009, Cas ruled that they were not guilty of wrongdoing when bringing Ga\u00ebl Kakuta from Rennes.</p>\n    <p><b>What does this mean for Chelsea\u2019s current squad?&nbsp;</b>If players such as Eden Hazard and Callum Hudson-Odi wish to leave this summer, they may find the exit blocked if the club is not allowed to sign new players. That, however, would allow them to leave for free the following summer when their contracts, like those of Willian and Pedro, expire. Players currently on loan at other clubs, such as Dujon Sterling, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham, could find more opportunities at Stamford Bridge.</p>\n    <p><b>Are any other Premier League likely to face similar punishment?&nbsp;</b>Fifa is investigating four Premier League clubs.

The terrific <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uN3n-NjLHc\">Kebab Spiders</a> is powered by two alternate basslines: one sounds like the sort of thing the great <a href=\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/james-jamerson-bass-motown-sound/\">James Jamerson</a> used to lay down for Motown and the other is clubbier, almost Belgian new beat. The brooding OBCT could be Depeche Mode or the Cure, until Williamson comes in and it includes, of all things, a kazoo solo. The highly melodic When You Come Up to Me, meanwhile, would be a lost 80s new romantic synth ballad were it delivered in any other voice. As ever, though, it\u2019s Williamson\u2019s trademark bark \u2013 a caustic, observant, irritant, unforgiving mix of John Cooper Clarke and Mark E Smith \u2013 which renders the Mods instantly recognisable. They are increasingly, as John Peel said of the Fall: \u201cAlways different, always the same.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uN3n-NjLHc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5uN3n-NjLHc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2019/feb/11/sleaford-mods-webchat-post-your-questions-now\">'Life is chaotic!' Sleaford Mods' Jason Williamson answers your questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite its title, Eton Alive isn\u2019t a grand statement on the health of the nation or the ever-powerful English ruling class. It prefers to critique this troubled isle through the minutiae of daily life, which is perhaps even more effective and damning. The songs offer snapshots of a society fraying at the edges, from Top It Up\u2019s drug use at a drug-user\u2019s funeral, to Kebab Spiders\u2019 \u201cindie documentarists, highlighting pain\u201d of reality TV\u2019s class-voyeurism-as-entertainment. Williamson\u2019s ire is scattergun and bleakly funny, careering from \u201cwhite dog shit\u201d to Flipside\u2019s swipes at the realities of modern pop success (\u201cHammer of the Gods, my arse\u201d) and Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon (\u201clooks like a leftwing Boris Johnson\u201d). Only the xylophone-led Discourse, which Williamson sings as much as narrates, could be seen as a national address, but it could just as equally apply to the crumbling of human emotional connections as offer a way out of Brexit (\u201cthere\u2019s only one course, discourse\u201d).

      "bodyText": "Sleaford Mods\u2019 frontman Jason Williamson recently revealed that lately he\u2019s been listening to Alexander O\u2019Neal, Chaka Khan and Luther Vandross, although the Nottinghamshire duo haven\u2019t suddenly gone soul or R&amp;B. However, Andrew Fearn\u2019s backing tracks are forever evolving and are a fair distance from 2013\u2019s breakthrough, Austerity Dogs. The terrific Kebab Spiders is powered by two alternate basslines: one sounds like the sort of thing the great James Jamerson used to lay down for Motown and the other is clubbier, almost Belgian new beat. The brooding OBCT could be Depeche Mode or the Cure, until Williamson comes in and it includes, of all things, a kazoo solo. The highly melodic When You Come Up to Me, meanwhile, would be a lost 80s new romantic synth ballad were it delivered in any other voice. As ever, though, it\u2019s Williamson\u2019s trademark bark \u2013 a caustic, observant, irritant, unforgiving mix of John Cooper Clarke and Mark E Smith \u2013 which renders the Mods instantly recognisable. They are increasingly, as John Peel said of the Fall: \u201cAlways different, always the same.\u201d Despite its title, Eton Alive isn\u2019t a grand statement on the health of the nation or the ever-powerful English ruling class. It prefers to critique this troubled isle through the minutiae of daily life, which is perhaps even more effective and damning. The songs offer snapshots of a society fraying at the edges, from Top It Up\u2019s drug use at a drug-user\u2019s funeral, to Kebab Spiders\u2019 \u201cindie documentarists, highlighting pain\u201d of reality TV\u2019s class-voyeurism-as-entertainment. Williamson\u2019s ire is scattergun and bleakly funny, careering from \u201cwhite dog shit\u201d to Flipside\u2019s swipes at the realities of modern pop success (\u201cHammer of the Gods, my arse\u201d) and Blur\u2019s Graham Coxon (\u201clooks like a leftwing Boris Johnson\u201d). Only the xylophone-led Discourse, which Williamson sings as much as narrates, could be seen as a national address, but it could just as equally apply to the crumbling of human emotional connections as offer a way out of Brexit (\u201cthere\u2019s only one course, discourse\u201d). As ever, Sleaford Mods are a voice that must be heard.",

The warning to Theresa May was delivered on Friday by Andrew Percy of the Brexit delivery group \u2013 regarded in the party as a moderate band of remain and Brexit-supporting MPs \u2013 who said many wanted to act if the \u201cintransigence\u201d of hardline Brexiters led again to the prime minister\u2019s own deal being rejected by parliament. Percy, who voted to leave the EU, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme \u201cSome of my colleagues have got to recognise that the game they have thus far been playing with regards to this whole process is not going to end well for them and could potentially end with the delaying of \u2013 perhaps even no Brexit \u2013 which some of us have spent a lot of our parliamentary and political careers campaigning for.\u201d The threat, which was also contained in a letter from the leaders of the group to the party whip, leaves May facing the most serious cabinet revolt of her premiership next week as at least four cabinet ministers and almost a dozen junior ones are understood to be prepared to back a motion to delay Brexit. Amid expectations that Tory MPs from the hardline European Research Group (ERG) would continue to oppose the prime minister\u2019s package even if she returns from Brussels with changes to the backstop arrangements on the Irish border question, Percy said dozens of his colleagues were saying they would support such motions as the one proposed by the Tory MP Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, which is due to be debated on Wednesday. A senior source close to those plotting the rebellion said there was no way the members of the government would resign voluntarily and May would have to sack them. In what would effectively result in parliament taking control of the Brexit process, the amendment would require May to extend the article 50 deadline rather than allow the UK to leave the EU without a deal. \u201cA lot of colleagues have compromised from their positions,\u201d Percy added. \u201cWe are a group that has brought together leavers and remainers and I think people are seeing intransigence in other colleagues, people who are perhaps in denial about what the parliamentary arithmetic actually is on some of these matters and people are just growing increasingly frustrated that whilst we are prepared to make compromises other are not.\u201d While he accepted that the government could choose not to hold a meaningful vote next week, he said it was inevitable that this would happen at some point and that fellow Tory MPs would \u201cnaturally decamp\u201d. A letter sent by Percy and the other co-leader of the Brexit delivery group, Simon Hart, to the government chief whip, Julian Smith, said the reputation for competence of both the party and the government depended on their ability to delivery an orderly exit from the EU. \u201cWhilst we fully expect some changes to the backstop arrangements to be made by ministers in Brussels this week, there remains a chance that these will not satisfy some colleagues.\u201d",

The words vivid and vituperative (see: The Motherfucker With the Hat) spring to mind. This typically dark comedy is set in the lockdown wing of a New York prison, where faith and futility jostle for position. It is staged by former JMK young director award winner Kate Hewitt. Young Vic, SE1, to 30 March The Remains of the Day Everyone remembers the classic 90s film, brimming with wistful glances between Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Now, Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s novel is being adapted for the stage by Barney Norris, with help from Ishiguro himself. Norris is brilliant at channelling older characters, so should bring Ishiguro\u2019s regretful butler, here played by Stephen Boxer, and lovesick housekeeper bursting into life. Royal &amp; Derngate: The Royal, Northampton, Saturday 23 February to 16 March Alys, Always Nicholas Hytner is directing his first play written by a woman; great that it\u2019s finally happening, shocking that it took this long. Hytner helms Lucinda Coxon\u2019s adaptation of Harriet Lane\u2019s popular novel: a psychological thriller about a woman who stumbles across a car crash and finds herself thrust into a privileged world she cannot bear to leave. It stars Joanna Froggatt, of Downton Abbey fame, and Robert Glenister. Bridge Theatre, SE1, Monday 25 February to 30 March Mother Courage and Her Children Last chance to catch this collaboration between the Royal Exchange Theatre and those ever playful theatre-makers Headlong, known for People, Places &amp; Things. Apparently, Anna Jordan wrote her adaptation of Brecht\u2019s masterpiece with lead actor Julie Hesmondhalgh specifically in mind. The show is set in a dystopian 2080, with the Reds and Blues at war, and Mother Courage in the middle of the action. Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, to 2 March MG Three of the best ... dance shows Tesseract Inspired by science fiction and time travel, Tesseract offers new perspectives on the human body using dance, 3D film and live video feed to create some beautiful and compelling effects. Its creators are all former collaborators of Merce Cunningham: dancers Rashaun Mitchell and Silas Riener and the film-maker Charles Atlas. Barbican Theatre, EC2, Thursday 28 February to 2 March Vincent Dance Theatre Charlotte Vincent\u2019s Shut Down, a rigorous but witty exploration of masculinity, starts a national tour, while a film of her Virgin Territory, which examines our hypersexualised digital world, premieres in Eastbourne. Shut Down: Farnham, Tuesday 26; Bournemouth, Thursday 28 February; touring to 4 April; Virgin Territory: Eastbourne, Wednesday 27 February to 10 March Rachael Young: Nightclubbing Afrofuturism, the mighty Grace Jones and the story of three black women refused entry to a nightclub are Young\u2019s inspirations in this defiant show about the demonisation and celebration of black women\u2019s bodies. Part of a double bill with spoken word-drag-dance artist Es Morgan. The Place, WC1, Thursday 28 February LW Main composite image: Annapurna; Bristol Culture; Warner Bros",

Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said Labor had outlined \u201ca better way of achieving the objectives\u201d Hayne had laid out. \u201cIn relation to mortgage brokers, Commissioner Hayne found in effect two problems \u2013 he found that conflicted remuneration was changing the products that were recommended to customers and also leading to bigger loans and he recommended that conflicted remuneration be abolished by customers paying upfront,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve been consulting with mortgage brokers, with mortgage broker groups, with small banks and credit unions as well as financial services industry more broadly about how to achieve the objective that Commissioner Hayne set out and we do have a slightly different way of achieving that objective. \u201cWe do want to see conflicted remuneration taken out of mortgage broking but we do recognise that upfront commissions will play a role to take the financial pressure off customers.\u201d Labor had immediately accused the government of not accepting all the commission\u2019s recommendations in its own response, saying it would implement all the recommendations. In response to Labor\u2019s policy switch, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the change in policy was \u201cone of the most humiliating back-downs in recent memory\u201d. In announcing Labor\u2019s formal response, Bowen acknowledged the party had fallen one short of adopting all 76 recommendations, but said the government had only accepted 60. He said Labor\u2019s decision to set a fixed-rate commission balanced the concerns of the mortgage broking industry \u2013 which said a user pay system would result in many brokers shutting up shop, limiting competition to the big banks \u2013 with Hayne\u2019s conflict of interest concerns. \u201cWe have a different way of fixing that problem and we do so very openly and transparently waiting for an election to give the Australian people plenty of notice of our intentions and the mortgage broking sector the clear transparency of our approach,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the time to consult, to talk to mortgage brokers, to the banks and the smaller banks in particular who rely on mortgage broking for the channel to ensure competition. \u201cI think we have a very good product offering here in relation to our policy.\u201d In producing its response, which built on the three private members bills Labor announced earlier this week, Labor also committed to a new compensation scheme which would allow some victims of banking misconduct to reopen their cases, as well as lifting the current cap on claims to $2m.",

There has been opposition from church groups who claimed homosexuality was a \u201cperversion\u201d and \u201cunAfrican\u201d. LGBT people face systematic harassment and discrimination in a number of African countries, in many of which gay acts are illegal. \u201cDecriminalisation is just one percent of the struggle. Society is really homophobic. Being legal is not enough. We have to be safe too,\u201d said Marylise Biubwa, a social justice activist. Frank Mugisha, a campaigner for gay rights in Uganda, said before the ruling that a positive result would encourage other countries to follow Kenya\u2019s path. Angola recently decriminalised homosexual sex and courts in Botswana will decide on the issue next month.",

There\u2019s no graphic violence,\u201d says Lambe. But there is enough in what Lambe has dramatised from the boys\u2019 interviews to haunt any viewer. Robert and Jon, each being questioned in different police stations, blame the other for hitting James with a brick. In another of the film\u2019s most unbearable moments, two women are standing outside a corner shop when they see the two boys walking the toddler. One asks where they are taking him. To Walton Street police station, the boys lie. She asks the other woman to keep an eye on her daughter while she takes them to the station. But the other woman says she can\u2019t because her dog doesn\u2019t like children. And so the two 10-year-olds head off with the boy they will soon kill. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13587a8e9ac846bc773b781fe1a0275a3e12f46f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13587a8e9ac846bc773b781fe1a0275a3e12f46f/434_0_1978_1187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ely Solan as Jon Venables in Detainment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ely Solan as Jon Venables in Detainment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Twelve Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why did he want to make a film about James\u2019s murder? \u201cI was 12 when James was murdered and I was absolutely haunted by it \u2013 just like everyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I asked why they did it, I was told they were evil.

It must seem to them that we are playing one huge game of Simon Says, where the object is to do the exact opposite of what we tell children to do. On a societal level we seem to be saying: do as I say, not as I do. So ask yourself: if you were a young person, would you really have much faith in adults to deal with the greatest challenge facing humanity when those selfsame adults \u2013 even teachers, such as me \u2013 are such blatant hypocrites? </p> <p>We tell children to treat each other how they wish to be treated themselves, yet the House of Commons regularly resembles a playground fight, with the different sides <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/01/mps-barracking-territorialism-house-of-commons\" title=\"\">jeering and sneering at each other</a>. In the streets, we blare our horns and shout obscenities at other drivers. We hurl abuse at the opposition during the football and scream angrily at powerless call-centre workers when we are unhappy about something. All the while, our children watch.</p> <p>Just the other day, I took the children in my class to task for laughing too forcefully at the misfortune of one of their classmates. We talked about how they didn\u2019t have the right to make another person feel worse about themselves, and I asked them to imagine how they would feel if they were in that child\u2019s shoes. Fast-forward only a few hours, and I sat laughing as Jeremy Corbyn mocked the transport minister for yet another mistake. MPs, and indeed all of us, relish this sort of thing. Many a standup\u2019s career is made from perfecting the pithy putdown.</p> <p>Our hypocrisy doesn\u2019t stop there.

      "bodyText": "The children\u2019s climate strike has become another lightning rod in the never-ending culture war. Those on the left applauded them for their brave moral stand. Jonathan Freedland \u2013 not without basis \u2013 pointed to the strike as evidence that children were acting more like adults than the adults. But on the right the focus seemed to be on chiding them and telling them to get back to school \u2013 from the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson to Toby Young, who saw the children\u2019s behaviour as an argument for raising the voting age to 21. So far, so predictable. And then came the waves of abusive comments and tweets in response. Teachers who \u201csupport this strike should have their assets confiscated and [be] sent to work down the salt mines\u201d. \u201cOh do shut up you total fucking arse\u201d the actor James Purefoy tweeted at Young to his 107,000 followers. With all this discord you wouldn\u2019t blame any child, unsure of what they think about the strike, for wishing that the adults would all stop fighting and just play nicely. Who can blame young people for having little faith in adults when they see the chasm that separates what adults tell them and what they actually do themselves. It must seem to them that we are playing one huge game of Simon Says, where the object is to do the exact opposite of what we tell children to do. On a societal level we seem to be saying: do as I say, not as I do. So ask yourself: if you were a young person, would you really have much faith in adults to deal with the greatest challenge facing humanity when those selfsame adults \u2013 even teachers, such as me \u2013 are such blatant hypocrites? We tell children to treat each other how they wish to be treated themselves, yet the House of Commons regularly resembles a playground fight, with the different sides jeering and sneering at each other. In the streets, we blare our horns and shout obscenities at other drivers. We hurl abuse at the opposition during the football and scream angrily at powerless call-centre workers when we are unhappy about something. All the while, our children watch. Just the other day, I took the children in my class to task for laughing too forcefully at the misfortune of one of their classmates. We talked about how they didn\u2019t have the right to make another person feel worse about themselves, and I asked them to imagine how they would feel if they were in that child\u2019s shoes. Fast-forward only a few hours, and I sat laughing as Jeremy Corbyn mocked the transport minister for yet another mistake. MPs, and indeed all of us, relish this sort of thing. Many a standup\u2019s career is made from perfecting the pithy putdown. Our hypocrisy doesn\u2019t stop there. As parents, families and teachers we tell children that mistakes are a good thing and that they are proof you are trying, a chance to learn. And yet we are far less forgiving when we are asked to put this in to practice as adults. Errors \u2013 true or perceived \u2013 by politicians, business leaders, sports people and co-workers are pounced on as evidence of their incompetence, unsuitability and negligence.

Over and over, with Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk and Doctor Strange (check out his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR9Q0uQcnMQ\">pre-MCU outing</a> for proof), it\u2019s been proven that Marvel characters do better when Marvel has the highest level of direct control. So when the Defenders eventually make their way to Disney+, they should be even better than they already were. With this in mind, here are all the improvements I\u2019d like to see come to their revival.</p> <h2>Luke Cage</h2> <p>Fewer episodes. This, by the way is going to be a theme. Almost all the Netflix shows were bloated beyond words, with an inevitable four-episode chasm in the middle of each season where the characters all just stood around twiddling their thumbs. However, Luke Cage\u2019s was one of the most pronounced; its first series almost had to regain steam from a standing start halfway through the run. Tighter and better next time, please.</p> <h2>The Punisher</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b2cb52d6b97bce6bf41175cdc0897a0e7da868c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b2cb52d6b97bce6bf41175cdc0897a0e7da868c/0_0_2926_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Bernthal as The Punisher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Bernthal as the Punisher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Miglio/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plus side is that Jon Bernthal is already the Punisher, and Disney+ will be hard pushed to find anyone more suited to the role. However, he plays a character called the Punisher, for crying out loud. When he\u2019s revived, could we actually see him punishing some people in anger? This would be more expensive to make, because full-gore, high-velocity action scenes cost more money than directionless mumblefests, but they\u2019re also much more entertaining. Also, the Punisher is a violent, revenge-obsessed jerk. If Disney+ could stop trying to make him so much of a relatable hero, that\u2019d be great too.</p> <h2>Jessica Jones</h2> <p>Well, this one\u2019s easy. Compare season one of Jessica Jones, which was thrilling and fun and heartbreaking all at the same time, with the sluggish nothingness of season two. What was missing? David Tennant\u2019s Kilgrave. Kilgrave was a villain for the ages, managing to be truly monstrous and also kind of fun. He did terrible, terrible things to people, but the glee that Tennant took in the role was so evident that you could easily understand why people fell under his character\u2019s spell. Second time around, Jones was left twisting in the wind without him. Bring Kilgrave back and, while you\u2019re at it, make fewer episodes.</p> <h2>Daredevil</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"391b12717a0e1ade6be9eba7bd569c6418efa68e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/391b12717a0e1ade6be9eba7bd569c6418efa68e/0_0_4500_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Cox as Daredevil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Cox as Daredevil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Rivelli/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019d suggest a similar approach for Daredevil. Two of its seasons were truly great, and one of them stank like a blocked toilet. The difference, again, was Vincent D\u2019Onofrio\u2019s Kingpin; not just a great villain, but arguably an even more compelling character than Daredevil himself. I\u2019d even be tempted to reframe the series as Daredevil v Kingpin and make the whole thing a sprawling cat-and-mouse two-hander, with the characters as intertwined and codependent as Batman and the Joker. Also, if Foggy got murdered somehow, that\u2019d also be wonderful. Fewer episodes too, please.</p> <h2>Iron Fist</h2> <p>Fewer episodes. Many fewer episodes. Like, zero episodes. Is it possible to make fewer than zero episodes? If Disney+ gains the capacity to not only not make any new episodes of Iron Fist, but also to erase the idea of Iron Fist from all of history, the world would be a much happier place.</p>",

There is nothing left to know.\u201d Even that much information may be too revealing: \u201cI hear there is a queen in the south who kills the man who brings her bad news. So when I give words of the boy\u2019s death, do I write my own death with it?\u201d Voicing these anxieties under interrogation is Tracker. He\u2019s a hunter, a mercenary, and it\u2019s his journey in pursuit of that young boy that drives the hulking, exhausting first volume in Marlon James\u2019s Dark Star trilogy. The setting is a heady, fever-fabulated version of precolonial Africa, but who is the child? Some kind of a prince? Tracker is just one of a group of mercenaries vying with each other to recover him. He\u2019s a fearsome fighter, vicious, endowed with a phenomenal nose that lets him sniff out poisoned drinks and enemies lurking miles away.

Its journey data would provide \u201c<a href=\"https://mobike.com/global/public/Mobike-Ealing%20Announcement.pdf\">invaluable insights\u201d</a> for local planning departments.</p> <p>But in January, ofo followed oBike and Urbo to become the third dockless operator to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/10/ofo-cycle-hire-firm-pulls-out-of-london\">withdraw from Britain</a> in just over a year.</p> <p>New data gathered by Oliver O\u2019Brien, an academic at UCL\u2019s Consumer Data Research Centre, shows that the four major dockless operators covered an area of 617 sq km during the peak competition period in July 2018. Of those four, only Mobike remains, and its operating areas have shrunk, to a total of around 37sq km. Yobike operates a smaller dockless scheme in Bristol and Southampton which is not captured in the data.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/archive-zip/giv-3902CGum0c4VH19q/\" data-alt=\"England dockless new\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/archive-zip/giv-3902CGum0c4VH19q/\">England dockless new</a> </figure>  <p>The most dramatic boom and bust was oBike, which put 1,300 bikes in London in July 2017, and withdrew them four months later. Wandsworth council impounded hundreds, complaining the bikes had appeared \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bikebiz.com/landscape/dockless-bikes-impounded-by-council-for-blocking-parking-spaces\">without any warning</a>\u201d. In the absence of regulation, operators don\u2019t need to consult councils before launching.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible to know the exact number of bikes on the streets. Operators are cagey because of high losses to vandalism and theft. In London, O\u2019Brien\u2019s latest count shows just over 2,100 bikes at the end of January, down from a peak of 5,800.</p> <p>But Joe Seal-Driver, a Trustee of CoMo UK, a trade body which represents shared mobility firms, says dockless isn\u2019t dead.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry\u2019s taken a breath, there\u2019s been a pause in the expansion of bike services. But you\u2019ve got new operators coming through. The fact that we\u2019ve not seen a model with hundreds of thousands of bikes running for years in the UK yet doesn\u2019t testify to [failure].\u201d</p> <p>Steve Milton, Mobike\u2019s head of growth and PR in Europe, said the company had learned to pick its battles. \u201cMany cities across Europe want bike sharing, while others just put the shutters down.</p> <p>\u201cDo we really want to fight that?

Milton claims some European cities have already met a break-even target, but will not reveal which ones. Meanwhile Mobike is downsizing its fleets to \u201cavoid an oversupply,\u201d according to Chen Shaohui, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/23/meituan-scale-back-ride-hailing-and-bike-sharing/\">chief financial officer of parent company Meituan</a>, which bought Mobike last April.</p> <p>Ofo shut its international division last month, and has laid off thousands of staff. It is estimated to owe more than 1bn yuan (\u00a3114m) in deposits in East Asian markets.</p> <p>When ofo arrived in Sheffield this time last year, Douglas Johnson, a Green councillor, decided he was going to learn to cycle. \u201cI never had a bike when I was a kid, so I thought it was a chance to get to grips with it\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a lot excitement about ofo. The bikes were simple to use, there was no cost to the taxpayer at all.\u201d</p> <p>But with the excitement came the slew of <a href=\"https://www.thestar.co.uk/news/scan-and-go-bike-left-high-and-dry-in-sheffield-hedge-1-9002483\">local news reports</a> about bikes dangling from trees and set alight for fun. Just six months later, ofo had removed all 2,000 bikes.</p> <p>\u201cI was sad to see them go. But as I found out a bit more, it wasn\u2019t simply because of the selfishness and destructiveness of Sheffield people, it was part of a bigger global restructure.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ofo was a big thing in Sheffield, despite the hills, despite the weather. People were raring for it</p> <footer> <cite>Adam Rose, former operations manager</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a result of the restructure, Adam Rose, ofo\u2019s former operations manager in Sheffield, was made redundant.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really exciting at the start,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt was was all about bringing other cities in, all about land grab.</p> <p>\u201cBut then suddenly that all changed. Bikes weren\u2019t being delivered, there were cashflow issues, suppliers weren\u2019t being paid\u201d. Rose himself is still owed \u00a36,000 in expenses and remains unemployed.</p> <p>Sheffield saw the most dizzying success and the most difficult setbacks. \u201cIt took all of London a year to hit the rider figures we got by our third week\u201d, Rose said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a big thing in Sheffield, despite the hills, despite the weather. People were raring for it.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately we also had the highest vandalism and theft rates. I couldn\u2019t say exactly how many bikes we lost, but it was certainly in the hundreds.\u201d</p> <p>Rose can\u2019t explain the exact reasons for the termination. \u201cWe just got told what to do by China, never why. We had to come up with our own assumptions and give our own stories to the staff on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>Sheffield used to have a dock-based bike share system funded by the university and the council. When ofo arrived, that was no longer considered financially viable. The council and the university have no immediate plans to restart the system.</p> <p>In a number of London boroughs, dockless and dock-based bikeshare coexisted. Islington councillor Paul Convery said ofo and Mobike were able to cater to demand that wasn\u2019t met by Transport for London\u2019s Santander Cycles scheme, which is concentrated in the south of the borough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/archive-zip/giv-3902nwEZKQETcx76/\" data-alt=\"London dockless\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/archive-zip/giv-3902nwEZKQETcx76/\">London dockless</a> </figure>  <p>He believes there\u2019s a happy medium. \u201cMobike and ofo had a crazy, buccaneering venture-capital ethos.

      "bodyText": "Not so long ago, Chinese bike-sharing company ofo was planning to put 150,000 of its distinctive yellow bikes on London streets. Buoyed by $2bn of venture capital funding, ofo was going to \u201coptimise city resources\u201d and \u201csave public space\u201d. Mobike, another Chinese start-up and ofo\u2019s main competitor, was also apparently in the business of tech-altruism. Its journey data would provide \u201cinvaluable insights\u201d for local planning departments. But in January, ofo followed oBike and Urbo to become the third dockless operator to withdraw from Britain in just over a year. New data gathered by Oliver O\u2019Brien, an academic at UCL\u2019s Consumer Data Research Centre, shows that the four major dockless operators covered an area of 617 sq km during the peak competition period in July 2018. Of those four, only Mobike remains, and its operating areas have shrunk, to a total of around 37sq km. Yobike operates a smaller dockless scheme in Bristol and Southampton which is not captured in the data. The most dramatic boom and bust was oBike, which put 1,300 bikes in London in July 2017, and withdrew them four months later. Wandsworth council impounded hundreds, complaining the bikes had appeared \u201cwithout any warning\u201d. In the absence of regulation, operators don\u2019t need to consult councils before launching. It\u2019s impossible to know the exact number of bikes on the streets. Operators are cagey because of high losses to vandalism and theft. In London, O\u2019Brien\u2019s latest count shows just over 2,100 bikes at the end of January, down from a peak of 5,800. But Joe Seal-Driver, a Trustee of CoMo UK, a trade body which represents shared mobility firms, says dockless isn\u2019t dead. \u201cThe industry\u2019s taken a breath, there\u2019s been a pause in the expansion of bike services. But you\u2019ve got new operators coming through. The fact that we\u2019ve not seen a model with hundreds of thousands of bikes running for years in the UK yet doesn\u2019t testify to [failure].\u201d Steve Milton, Mobike\u2019s head of growth and PR in Europe, said the company had learned to pick its battles. \u201cMany cities across Europe want bike sharing, while others just put the shutters down. \u201cDo we really want to fight that? Or do we just want to go where people actually want us? For 2019, our focus is building a sustainable business.\u201d Can dockless ever be profitable and sustainable? Milton claims some European cities have already met a break-even target, but will not reveal which ones. Meanwhile Mobike is downsizing its fleets to \u201cavoid an oversupply,\u201d according to Chen Shaohui, the chief financial officer of parent company Meituan, which bought Mobike last April. Ofo shut its international division last month, and has laid off thousands of staff. It is estimated to owe more than 1bn yuan (\u00a3114m) in deposits in East Asian markets. When ofo arrived in Sheffield this time last year, Douglas Johnson, a Green councillor, decided he was going to learn to cycle. \u201cI never had a bike when I was a kid, so I thought it was a chance to get to grips with it\u201d, he said. \u201cThere was a lot excitement about ofo. The bikes were simple to use, there was no cost to the taxpayer at all.\u201d But with the excitement came the slew of local news reports about bikes dangling from trees and set alight for fun. Just six months later, ofo had removed all 2,000 bikes. \u201cI was sad to see them go. But as I found out a bit more, it wasn\u2019t simply because of the selfishness and destructiveness of Sheffield people, it was part of a bigger global restructure.\u201d As a result of the restructure, Adam Rose, ofo\u2019s former operations manager in Sheffield, was made redundant. \u201cIt was really exciting at the start,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt was was all about bringing other cities in, all about land grab. \u201cBut then suddenly that all changed. Bikes weren\u2019t being delivered, there were cashflow issues, suppliers weren\u2019t being paid\u201d. Rose himself is still owed \u00a36,000 in expenses and remains unemployed. Sheffield saw the most dizzying success and the most difficult setbacks. \u201cIt took all of London a year to hit the rider figures we got by our third week\u201d, Rose said. \u201cIt was a big thing in Sheffield, despite the hills, despite the weather. People were raring for it. \u201cUnfortunately we also had the highest vandalism and theft rates. I couldn\u2019t say exactly how many bikes we lost, but it was certainly in the hundreds.\u201d Rose can\u2019t explain the exact reasons for the termination. \u201cWe just got told what to do by China, never why. We had to come up with our own assumptions and give our own stories to the staff on the ground.\u201d Sheffield used to have a dock-based bike share system funded by the university and the council. When ofo arrived, that was no longer considered financially viable. The council and the university have no immediate plans to restart the system. In a number of London boroughs, dockless and dock-based bikeshare coexisted. Islington councillor Paul Convery said ofo and Mobike were able to cater to demand that wasn\u2019t met by Transport for London\u2019s Santander Cycles scheme, which is concentrated in the south of the borough. He believes there\u2019s a happy medium. \u201cMobike and ofo had a crazy, buccaneering venture-capital ethos. They were burning through millions in start-up money. \u201cTfL is the exact opposite, hugely over-cautious about spending, and it really suffers from that. That said, it is meticulously managed and has very high user satisfaction.\u201d For now, Santander\u2019s coverage in Islington remains limited. Ofo has withdrawn, and Mobike\u2019s future is uncertain after its Memorandum of Understanding with the council has expired. Meanwhile, new dockless operators continue to enter the market. Lime, which has put electric bikes in US cities and across Europe, has just launched in Brent and Ealing, while Uber is considering launching its Jump e-bikes in the UK. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to be the Amazon of mobility\u201d, said Katharine Butler, co-founder of bike start-up Freebike, in an interview with Yahoo. Mobike\u2019s CTO Joe Xia has talked about the company\u2019s ambitions to cover longer journeys, and even get into \u201cflying cars\u201d. But if the endgame of dockless bike companies is to become \u201cmulti-modal\u201d platforms covering a range of different transport types, they\u2019ve hit a bump in the road. Unlike Airbnb and Uber, who outsource costs by minimising fixed assets, the production and maintenance of a dockless bike fleet has proved hugely \u2013 often fatally \u2013 expensive. Nicole Badstuber, a researcher in urban transport governance at UCL, believes there is a future for dockless, but only if cities take the lead. \u201cThe current regulation is not fit for purpose.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, I was sitting on the New York subway when a voice popped into my head. A sarcastic, teenage, yeah whatever, eye-rolling voice. She said, \u201cYou\u2019d think after my brother the snake was born they\u2019d have stopped at one.\u201d I knew who was speaking. It was Hel, the Norse goddess of the dead, half-human, half-corpse, daughter of a god and a giantess, who Odin hurls into the Underworld and forces to rule the dead.</p> <p>The whole plot of my novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/31/fiction-for-older-children-reviews-horrid-henry-francesca-simon-frank-cottrell-boyce\" title=\"\">The Monstrous Child</a></em> came to me in that moment. I\u2019ve always loved mythology, and Hel\u2019s story seemed a great way to write about dysfunctional families and the turbulence and passion of adolescence. It was the first time I\u2019d written a novel in the first person. While writing it, I knew it could be turned into an opera. Opera is so heightened, the perfect way to express the epic sweep of gods and giants, love and hate, jealousy and vengeance, as well as a young girl\u2019s journey towards creating her own life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She\u2019s banished to Niflheim to spend eternity with rotting corpses. Without her flippant asides, it could be unbearable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, believing I\u2019d written an operatic book was one thing. Imagining that it would actually become an opera was quite another. It all started in 2013 (it\u2019s true, opera takes for ever) when I was introduced to John Fulljames, then associate director of the Royal Opera House, at the interval of <em>Die Fledermaus</em> at the ENO. My beloved dog had died that day, and I was not feeling sociable. But I am forever grateful I did decide to go out that night, because John liked my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/17/how-we-made-horrid-henry\" title=\"\">Horrid Henry</a> books and said I should contact him if I ever had an idea for an opera. I remember thinking, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d I knew almost nothing about opera, and wasn\u2019t a fan. Another bit of luck was that I knew the composer, Gavin Higgins, through a mutual friend. I loved his music, its harshness and energy and violence, but also its lyrical, emotional and theatrical qualities. I gave him my manuscript in 2015 and, miraculously, our \u201cWagner for teens\u201d was commissioned.</p> <p>I was thrilled about creating something unlike anything I\u2019d ever done. But I was also anxious. First I embarked on an opera crash course. I\u2019ve now seen at least 60. (My favourite is <em>Eugene Onegin</em>.) I also asked every composer and librettist I knew for their top tips. (Thank you, Jonathan Dove, Jeremy Sams, George Stiles.) \u201cLots of vowels!\u201d \u201cShort lines!\u201d \u201cOne syllable words!\u201d \u201cA few consonants to bite into!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be operatic!\u201d</p> <p>I could do all that. I studied Anglo-Saxon, and have always loved alliteration, which works well in a libretto. I\u2019ve read a lot of Norse sagas and Old English poetry, so I was familiar with their rhythms. I also wanted to capture the bleak quality of Norse mythology: its raven-dark frost worlds, its fire and ice, the wait for the inexorable End of Days and Ragnar\u00f6k, the twilight of the gods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6802d3a5469d1db4dfdc8442fd74aa168ad617a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6802d3a5469d1db4dfdc8442fd74aa168ad617a9/0_0_6499_4399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Shelvey (Baldr) and Marta Fontanals-Simmons (Hel) in the World Premiere of The Monstrous Child by Gavin Higgins and libretto by Francesca Simon @ Linbury Theatre, Royal Opera House.

My solution was for her to talk to the audience \u2013 the newly arrived dead \u2013 much more than in most operas. She\u2019s banished alive to Niflheim, the fog world of the dead, to spend eternity with rotting corpses. Without her flippant asides, it could be unbearable. Over 10 drafts, I struggled with making the opera work as drama and not just a monologue. I\u2019ve also had to discover how to share Hel\u2019s story with the music. The analogy I used was picture books. The words need to allow space for the illustrations. Of course, I made rookie mistakes. In a novel, it doesn\u2019t matter if characters hang around silently while others are the main focus. Gavin once pointed out that I had seven people on stage for ages and only two were singing.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, I was sitting on the New York subway when a voice popped into my head. A sarcastic, teenage, yeah whatever, eye-rolling voice. She said, \u201cYou\u2019d think after my brother the snake was born they\u2019d have stopped at one.\u201d I knew who was speaking. It was Hel, the Norse goddess of the dead, half-human, half-corpse, daughter of a god and a giantess, who Odin hurls into the Underworld and forces to rule the dead. The whole plot of my novel The Monstrous Child came to me in that moment. I\u2019ve always loved mythology, and Hel\u2019s story seemed a great way to write about dysfunctional families and the turbulence and passion of adolescence. It was the first time I\u2019d written a novel in the first person. While writing it, I knew it could be turned into an opera. Opera is so heightened, the perfect way to express the epic sweep of gods and giants, love and hate, jealousy and vengeance, as well as a young girl\u2019s journey towards creating her own life. However, believing I\u2019d written an operatic book was one thing. Imagining that it would actually become an opera was quite another. It all started in 2013 (it\u2019s true, opera takes for ever) when I was introduced to John Fulljames, then associate director of the Royal Opera House, at the interval of Die Fledermaus at the ENO. My beloved dog had died that day, and I was not feeling sociable. But I am forever grateful I did decide to go out that night, because John liked my Horrid Henry books and said I should contact him if I ever had an idea for an opera. I remember thinking, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d I knew almost nothing about opera, and wasn\u2019t a fan. Another bit of luck was that I knew the composer, Gavin Higgins, through a mutual friend. I loved his music, its harshness and energy and violence, but also its lyrical, emotional and theatrical qualities. I gave him my manuscript in 2015 and, miraculously, our \u201cWagner for teens\u201d was commissioned. I was thrilled about creating something unlike anything I\u2019d ever done. But I was also anxious. First I embarked on an opera crash course. I\u2019ve now seen at least 60. (My favourite is Eugene Onegin.) I also asked every composer and librettist I knew for their top tips. (Thank you, Jonathan Dove, Jeremy Sams, George Stiles.) \u201cLots of vowels!\u201d \u201cShort lines!\u201d \u201cOne syllable words!\u201d \u201cA few consonants to bite into!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be operatic!\u201d I could do all that. I studied Anglo-Saxon, and have always loved alliteration, which works well in a libretto. I\u2019ve read a lot of Norse sagas and Old English poetry, so I was familiar with their rhythms. I also wanted to capture the bleak quality of Norse mythology: its raven-dark frost worlds, its fire and ice, the wait for the inexorable End of Days and Ragnar\u00f6k, the twilight of the gods. Most important, I had to find a way to keep Hel\u2019s acerbic voice. My solution was for her to talk to the audience \u2013 the newly arrived dead \u2013 much more than in most operas. She\u2019s banished alive to Niflheim, the fog world of the dead, to spend eternity with rotting corpses. Without her flippant asides, it could be unbearable. Over 10 drafts, I struggled with making the opera work as drama and not just a monologue. I\u2019ve also had to discover how to share Hel\u2019s story with the music. The analogy I used was picture books. The words need to allow space for the illustrations. Of course, I made rookie mistakes. In a novel, it doesn\u2019t matter if characters hang around silently while others are the main focus. Gavin once pointed out that I had seven people on stage for ages and only two were singing. Truthfully, I\u2019d forgotten the others were there. Hello, chorus of the gods. We\u2019re telling a mythic story of the beginning and end of the world, with an angry, lovelorn, regal, funny and depressed teen as our guide. I can\u2019t give too much away, but director Tim Sheader and designer Paul Wills have come up with some brilliantly theatrical ideas that I never imagined while I was writing. Oh. One more thing. It\u2019s an opera cliche that the heroine dies at the end. Let\u2019s just say that a woman will be the last one standing in The Monstrous Child. \u2022 The Monstrous Child is at the Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, until 3 March.",

      "bodyText": "Twenty years after Sir William Macpherson was picked to lead the public inquiry into Stephen Lawrence\u2019s murder and the allegedly corrupt police investigation that followed, Grenfell Tower went up in flames. In his final report, published in February 1999, Macpherson would go on to label the police response to the teenager\u2019s killing \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d, a term that captured so well the unwitting prejudice and plain racial stereotyping afflicting parts of British society. The phrase became a lodestar for anti-racism and equality reforms launched in an effort to move the country on from sporadic race riots, racist violence and everyday prejudice of the \u201cno blacks, no dogs, no Irish\u201d variety. There were murmurs Britain was becoming a post-racial society. Then last September came a discordant clang. A lawyer for some Grenfell families said the public inquiry must ask if the 72 deaths were \u201ca product of institutional racism\u201d. At least 34 victims were nationals of African, Middle Eastern or Asian countries. Imran Khan, who represented the Lawrence family to Macpherson, now wanted to know if, 20 years on, unwitting actions had delivered a racist outcome and if institutional racism had affected the way firefighters behaved. The phrase, once described as \u201cincendiary\u201d by Trevor Philips, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), was back. It was an offensive slur, said firefighters, who had shown bravery, saved lives and witnessed horrors. But it had to be asked because the demise of institutional racism cannot be assumed even though it has fallen out of favour in preference to the softer language of \u201cunconscious bias\u201d. It was clear when the former Labour MP, Angela Smith, this week described ethnicity as \u201ca funny tinge\u201d, even people you would expect to show confidence on the matter still struggle to talk about race. Macpherson defined institutional racism as \u201cthe collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin\u201d. It is seen in \u201cprocesses, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantages minority ethnic people\u201d. Two decades on, statistics collated in the government\u2019s race disparity audit \u2013 one sign of progress itself perhaps \u2013 tell part of the story. The number of black and Caribbean pupils achieving 5 A*-C GCSE grades including maths and English increased from 34% in 2006 to nearly 49% in 2012, a larger rise than for white British pupils. The number of minority ethnic students at top universities rose from 9% in 1995 to 18% in 2017. But gulfs remain. In 2016-17, 3.6% of black Caribbean A-level students got three top grades or better compared with 11.2% of whites. Only one black British student was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2015, 2016 and 2017 collectively. More mixed race people than white people were victims of crime last year; white offenders were given the shortest custodial sentences from 2009 to 2017 and black people are detained under the Mental Health Act four times more often than white people. All ethnic groups have a higher proportion of people living in overcrowded homes than white British people (2%), with the most overcrowded being among Bangladeshis (30%). Home ownership remains far higher for whites than ethnic minorities, who are also twice as likely to be unemployed. There are some upsides. Black people are more likely to have cancer diagnosed earlier, are more likely to be involved in local decision-making and ethnic minorities are more likely to use the internet. The first minority ethnic mayors have been elected in London and Bristol and Sajid Javid has become the first minority ethnic home secretary. Nevertheless, Stephen Lawrence\u2019s mother, Doreen, said this month progress reforming institutions was \u201cstagnant\u201d. \u201cAs time moved on, it\u2019s as though they changed the word from \u2018racism\u2019 to diversity, and then \u2018diversity doesn\u2019t exist any more\u2019,\u201d Lady Lawrence told MPs.

Fourteen percent of the population is non-white, compared with 6.6% of the police forces. In London, where the minority population is 40%, only 14% of officers are from that group. Dr Pete Jones, a psychologist who has run more than 2,000 implicit bias tests for police forces, found almost a fifth of officers and police staff tested since 2009 have an ethnicity bias strong enough to impact their behaviour. So perhaps it is no surprise that last week the EH RC warned of \u201cpersistent racial inequalities\u201d in stop and search, traffic stops, use of force and deaths during and after police contact. Twelve percent of incidents when police use force against people involve black people, despite them only making up 3.3% of the population and race hate crimes were up 14% in the year to 2017/18 (though police reporting improvements are likely to be a factor). Omar Khan, the director of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality thinktank, also highlights the recently emboldened far right, Labour\u2019s response to antisemitism in the party and the disproportionate effect of welfare cuts on minorities as evidence of continued problems. \u201cThere has been a lack of recognition over the last 20 years about how far behind we have been,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still tiptoe around racism.

What were the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference? Straw told parliament that it would \u201cinquire into the matters arising from the death of Stephen Lawrence on 22 April 1993 to date, in order particularly to identify the lessons to be learned for the investigation and prosecution of racially motivated crimes\u201d.

He was advised by Tom Cook, a retired deputy chief constable, Dr John Sentamu, the Bishop for Stepney, and Dr Richard Stone, the chair of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality. What did they find? A 350-page report concluded that the investigation into the killing had been \u201cmarred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership\u201d. Specific officers in the Metropolitan police were named and the entire force was criticised. The report\u2019s authors stated that the debate about policing and racism has been transformed by the inquiry, \u201cand that the debate thus ignited must be carried forward\u201d. What were its recommendations? A total of 70 recommendations designed to show \u201czero tolerance\u201d for racism in society were made. They included measures not just to transform the attitude of the police towards race relations and improve accountability but also to get the civil service, NHS, judiciary and other public bodies to respond and change. What was their impact? Some 67 of the report\u2019s recommendations led to specific changes in practice or the law within two years of its publication. They included the introduction of detailed targets for the recruitment, retention and promotion of black and Asian officers, as well as the creation of the Independent Police Complaints Commission with the power to appoint its own investigators. The abolition of the \u201cdouble jeopardy rule\u201d \u2013 which stated that people could not be tried for the same crime twice \u2013 eventually led to the 2012 conviction of Gary Dobson and David Norris for Lawrence\u2019s murder.",

      "body": "<p>Mar\u00eda Isaura Cuaran, an indigenous Siona woman, is displaying a rash that has appeared at the base of her neck. It is barely visible, but there nonetheless. Pulling her turquoise top off her left shoulder and tugging down on her bead necklace, Cuaran talks about \u201cthe company\u201d and how, she alleges, it has affected the local river.</p> <p>\u201cStomach problems, coughing, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, welts, little spots, little blotches, general malaise \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Sitting next to Cuaran is Marleni Piaguaye. The two women appeared equally agitated, equally desperate to talk.</p> <p>\u201cMore in the women, but some men too,\u201d Cuaran says. \u201cThe children are the most affected.\u201d</p> <p>Piaguaye is wearing a red London T-shirt with Big Ben and the union jack on it. This is somewhat ironic, given where \u201cthe company\u201d is from.</p> <p>Between them, Cuaran and Piaguaye have seven children. They form two families living in the tiny village of Puerto Silencio, in the north-east of a roughly 4,500-hectare (11,100-acre) Siona reserve called Buenavista, deep in the Colombian Amazon along the border with Ecuador. Buenavista is the largest in geographic terms of six Siona reserves and home to approximately 600 people.</p> <p>Running past the village is the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco River, which flows into the Putumayo, itself in turn a major tributary of the mighty Amazon.</p> <p>In Puerto Silencio, like across the vast majority of the rural Amazon, the local river is the main source of water \u2013 for drinking, cooking, bathing, swimming, and washing clothes and utensils. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2018/jun/27/the-war-goes-on-one-tribe-caught-up-in-colombias-armed-conflict\">'The war goes on\u2019: one tribe caught  up in Colombia\u2019s armed conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How has the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco changed in recent years?</p> <p>\u201cBefore, the water was clear,\u201d Piaguaye said. \u201cNow it\u2019s dirty.\u201d</p> <p>And the fish? \u201cNow they sometimes smell of oil, gasoline. Sometimes you can even see it.\u201d</p> <p>Piaguaye claims this is severely affecting the Siona\u2019s health \u2013 even the women\u2019s most intimate parts. \u201cWe enter the water and our body starts to itch. The whole body. Welts appear. Welts! And our vaginal areas \u2026 they\u2019re a lot worse.\u201d</p> <p>Bathing and swimming remain a serious problem. Piaguaye says over the years she and her family have sometimes been able to use another water source, in addition to the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco. But other families, like Cuaran\u2019s, haven\u2019t been so fortunate.</p> <p>\u201cWe have access to a little stream where the water runs crystal clear and that\u2019s all we\u2019ve been using,\u201d Piaguaye said. \u201cWhen I bathe there, I\u2019m not affected. But those who don\u2019t have that option, well, it turns out bad for them, because then they have to use that dirty water.\u201d</p> <p>Given the alleged contamination, 15 rainwater harvesting systems were recently installed in the village by two NGOs: the indigenous-run, Ecuador-based Ceibo Alliance and the international Amazon Frontlines.</p> <p>Both Cuaran and Piaguaye, like many others in Puerto Silencio, are adamant they know who is responsible: the Colombian subsidiary of the UK-based company Amerisur Resources, which reportedly began exploiting oil in a concession called Platanillo, just to the west of Buenavista\u2019s reserve, a decade ago.</p> <p>Among other things, the women allege that the company was using a tube to dump untreated \u2013 or inadequately treated \u2013 production wastewater into a stream called the Mansoya River, which ultimately feeds into the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco. They say they have seen that tube for themselves. </p> <p>\u201cWe think the river\u2019s contaminated because, when the company arrived, they pointed that tube towards the stream,\u201d Piaguaye said. \u201cNot directly, but there\u2019s one stream [running away from the oil installations], the Mansoya, and it\u2019s the water from the Mansoya that feeds into another stream that then arrives here in the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco.\u201d</p> <p>Permission to dump into the Mansoya was granted by Colombia\u2019s ministry of environment in 2009.</p> <p>Is there any scientific evidence for the women\u2019s allegations? Colombia\u2019s national authority of environmental licences (ANLA) visited the authorised dumping point on the Mansoya last year and found no observable \u201cimpact on the water, soil or vegetation\u201d, noting in a report that there was no longer any infrastructure to dump, that Amerisur claimed it had not done so since 2012, and that in 2015 the company was granted permission to reinject waste water into the ground instead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2015/jul/07/scientists-worlds-most-isolated-tribes-decisions\">Scientists must let world's most isolated tribes make own decisions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, according to the Siona, no samples were taken where they requested and no results of samples that may have been taken elsewhere have ever been sent to them, despite numerous requests.</p> <p>Amerisur, listed on the London Stock Exchange\u2019s AIM market, denies it has contaminated the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco, or any other river, since operating in Platanillo. Between 2008 and 2013, the company only disposed of \u201cdomestic and produced treated water\u201d that was \u201cfully permitted and audited under the environmental licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere has been no surface disposal for five years, so any claim that Amerisur continues disposing this way cannot be true. This disposal was replaced by licensed subsurface injection in January 2014.\u201d</p> <p>The Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco isn\u2019t the only body of water the Siona in Buenavista allege Amerisur has affected. According to a report issued in August 2017 after a visit to the reserve by numerous government agencies, wastewaters from Platanillo had not been treated adequately and had contaminated wetlands, rivers and/or streams, including the Mansoya, Singuiy\u00e1 and Peneya.</p> <p>\u201cThese tributaries flow into the Putumayo and Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco rivers, which are used by the Siona for cleaning, washing and recreation,\u201d the report alleged. \u201cMany members [of Buenavista] say that contact with the water in the Putumayo and Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco has caused symptoms of dermatitis and/or skin diseases, urinary tract infections, and sight problems in children and adults.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Siona, the company has also dumped poorly treated wastewaters directly into the Putumayo. They say this sparked outrage in Buenavista as well as in the nearby village of La Rosa.</p> <p>The ministry of environment also granted permission to dump wastewaters into the Putumayo River in 2011.</p> <p>Buenavista\u2019s spokesman, Mario Erazo Yaiguaje, showed the Guardian the tube running through the forest that was allegedly used to do it. Some of it has now been cut away \u2013 apparently for scrap metal.</p> <p>\u201cThe company always did it at night,\u201d Yaiguaje alleges. \u201cFew people travel [on the river] then, so they took advantage. In the very early morning, above all. It had a serious impact on us. The smell was quite something. It was contaminating the fish, the water \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The president of La Rosa\u2019s council, Gregorio Rosales, says he remembers the dumping too. \u201cWhen operations began there was dumping,\u201d he alleges. \u201cEven in the Putumayo. And Mansoya. It was permitted by the ANLA. When people protested, they simply emitted a new regulation \u2013 rather than dump it, bury [reinject] it.\u201d</p> <p>One La Rosa resident, Beto Alvarado, accompanied the Guardian, Yaiguaje and other Siona to see the tube. He claims to remember the dumping as well, saying it happened in 2012 and 2013. \u201cThey did it at night,\u201d he also says. \u201cBetween 10pm and 4am. We could smell something foul in the big river.\u201d</p> <p>Like on the Mansoya, the ANLA reportedly visited the dumping point on the Putumayo last year and found no environmental effects, again noting that permission to reinject was granted in 2015, that there is no longer any functioning infrastructure to dump there, and that Amerisur should dismantle the now-fragmented tube. The ANLA also claimed to have travelled from La Rosa downriver to Buenavista and identified no effects there either.</p> <p>Amerisur denies allegations of contaminating the Putumayo too. \u201c[The company] complies with the environmental regulations under which its operations are governed,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAll potential contaminants are removed above and beyond the requirements before the disposal of the treated water, a process which is allowed under the environmental licence.</p> <p>\u201cThis is both legal and standard practice in the oil industry in Colombia. In the years since Amerisur has operated the Platanillo field, there has been no water contamination. In addition, and at Amerisur\u2019s own instigation, the company has invested in water reinjection facilities, a process which has the full approval of the environmental authorities.\u201d</p> <p>Platanillo extends for more than 11,100 hectares, but because of the way the rivers run, it potentially affects an area far larger than that. </p> <p>\u201cThe situation has been fully explained to the community of Buenavista during the socialisation processes that [was] carried out, not just by the company but by the government agencies involved. However, persistent unfounded claims continue to be made, which ignore both the facts and the results obtained by the regular legal and environmental audits by ANLA and Corpoamazon\u00eda. In all the many water disposal audits which have taken place, Amerisur has never been sanctioned,\u201d the company spokesperson said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2018/jun/27/the-war-goes-on-one-tribe-caught-up-in-colombias-armed-conflict\">As explored in part one of this series</a>, over the last few decades the Siona \u2013 numbering roughly 2,600 in total \u2013 have found themselves tragically caught up in Colombia\u2019s armed conflict, together with the US\u2019s so-called \u201cwars\u201d on both drugs and terror \u201c. Ten years ago the country\u2019s constitutional court declared them \u201cin danger of being physically and culturally exterminated\u201d, a concern it reiterated in June 2017.</p> <p>Although fighting between the government and the country\u2019s largest guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo (the Farc), officially ended in 2016 with a historic peace deal, in Putumayo, as elsewhere, conflict continues, albeit in a slightly different form.</p> <p>According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in July last year, paramilitaries, \u201cnarco-paramilitaries\u201d, \u201cdissident Farc organisations\u201d and \u201carmed soldiers\u201d are still fighting.</p> <p>Under the inter-American human rights system, the commission has issued what it calls \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d and urged Colombia\u2019s government to take the \u201cnecessary steps to protect the lives and personal integrity\u201d of leaders and their families in Buenavista and one other Siona reserve, Santa Cruz de Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco. To date however, the government has taken no concrete action, as the Siona and various civil society organisations told the commission at a hearing in Bolivia on 12 February.</p> <p>Buenavista has been locked in a fierce struggle with Amerisur for several years.</p> <p>According to its <a href=\"http://www.amerisurresources.com/images/rns-pdfs/Amerisur-Resources-plc-Annual-Report-2017.pdf\">2017 annual report</a>, the company first became the operator at Platanillo in 2008. It is one of numerous concessions in Colombia\u2019s Putumayo basin where Amerisur now operates or has working interests.</p> <p>Numerous issues are at stake. One is a proposal by Amerisur to expand its operations by exploring for oil in a concession immediately east of Platanillo, called Putumayo-12, which entirely overlaps Buenavista\u2019s reserve, as well as a huge swathe of land into which the community is trying to expand the reserve under a government land restitution programme. This is the subject of part three of this series.</p> <p>Another is the alleged social and environmental concerns regarding a recently built pipeline, the Oleoducto Binacional Amerisur, which crosses the border into Ecuador and has prompted Siona from the village of San Jos\u00e9 de Wisuya, on the opposite bank of the Putumayo from Buenavista, to take legal action and make formal complaints to Ecuador\u2019s ministry of environment and Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo. A third is similar alleged concerns \u2013 such as Cuaran\u2019s and Piaguaye\u2019s \u2013 regarding operations in Platanillo.</p> <p>It is for some years now that the Siona have been alleging that the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco, among others, has been contaminated, to others in civil society, to the media, to the government. According to Cuaran and Piaguaye, the same kinds of health effects that they have reported to the Guardian were communicated to health ministry representatives during a rare visit to Puerto Silencio in 2017, but they heard nothing back.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve come here and we\u2019ve spoken, but they\u2019re ignoring us,\u201d one of the women says. \u201cYes, they\u2019ve come and asked the same questions as you, but until now [no response],\u201d says the other.</p> <p>Ricardo Amortegui, the head of communications at the ministry of health, said he would inquire about following up the 2017 visit and acknowledged the Siona\u2019s \u201cdifficult situation\u201d \u2013 the consequence of what he called \u201criver contamination by oil operations and health impacts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo correct the origin of the problem it\u2019s necessary that the contamination ceases,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t the responsibility of this ministry but perhaps the ministry of energy and mines, the ANLA or even the national environmental authority.\u201d</p> <p>The Siona in Buenavista are continuing to insist that the ANLA, in full coordination with community leaders, visit their territory to \u201cverify the social and environmental impacts\u201d. At the Bogota meeting in December, ANLA personnel reportedly said that ANLA had visited Buenavista in 2018 and \u201cdidn\u2019t confirm the allegations made by the Siona at the points they had identified\u201d, according to a Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo record of the meeting. However, that same record cited a Siona leader or leaders replying that the 2018 ANLA visit had been made without their knowledge or participation, and didn\u2019t include the places which they have been alleging, since 2012, have been affected.</p> <p>The December meeting ended with ANLA personnel promising, in the first week of January this year, to schedule a visit to the places identified by the Siona in the first half of 2019. The Defensor\u00eda is committing to coordinating the visit. The ANLA said it has been scheduled for May.</p> <p>Buenavista\u2019s lawyer, Lina Mar\u00eda Espinosa Villegas, believes it is \u201cfundamental\u201d that the visit goes ahead.</p> <p>\u201cAmerisur\u2019s presence in areas surrounding Buenavista and ancestral Siona territory poses a serious risk to them, their territory and sources of water,\u201d Espinosa, working for Amazon Frontlines, said. \u201cAlthough the company\u2019s operations [in the Platanillo concession] aren\u2019t inside the reserve, they are seriously affecting ecosystems and water essential to the Siona.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mar\u00eda Isaura Cuaran, an indigenous Siona woman, is displaying a rash that has appeared at the base of her neck. It is barely visible, but there nonetheless. Pulling her turquoise top off her left shoulder and tugging down on her bead necklace, Cuaran talks about \u201cthe company\u201d and how, she alleges, it has affected the local river. \u201cStomach problems, coughing, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, welts, little spots, little blotches, general malaise \u2026\u201d Sitting next to Cuaran is Marleni Piaguaye. The two women appeared equally agitated, equally desperate to talk. \u201cMore in the women, but some men too,\u201d Cuaran says. \u201cThe children are the most affected.\u201d Piaguaye is wearing a red London T-shirt with Big Ben and the union jack on it. This is somewhat ironic, given where \u201cthe company\u201d is from. Between them, Cuaran and Piaguaye have seven children. They form two families living in the tiny village of Puerto Silencio, in the north-east of a roughly 4,500-hectare (11,100-acre) Siona reserve called Buenavista, deep in the Colombian Amazon along the border with Ecuador. Buenavista is the largest in geographic terms of six Siona reserves and home to approximately 600 people. Running past the village is the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco River, which flows into the Putumayo, itself in turn a major tributary of the mighty Amazon. In Puerto Silencio, like across the vast majority of the rural Amazon, the local river is the main source of water \u2013 for drinking, cooking, bathing, swimming, and washing clothes and utensils. How has the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco changed in recent years? \u201cBefore, the water was clear,\u201d Piaguaye said. \u201cNow it\u2019s dirty.\u201d And the fish? \u201cNow they sometimes smell of oil, gasoline. Sometimes you can even see it.\u201d Piaguaye claims this is severely affecting the Siona\u2019s health \u2013 even the women\u2019s most intimate parts. \u201cWe enter the water and our body starts to itch. The whole body. Welts appear. Welts! And our vaginal areas \u2026 they\u2019re a lot worse.\u201d Bathing and swimming remain a serious problem. Piaguaye says over the years she and her family have sometimes been able to use another water source, in addition to the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco. But other families, like Cuaran\u2019s, haven\u2019t been so fortunate. \u201cWe have access to a little stream where the water runs crystal clear and that\u2019s all we\u2019ve been using,\u201d Piaguaye said. \u201cWhen I bathe there, I\u2019m not affected. But those who don\u2019t have that option, well, it turns out bad for them, because then they have to use that dirty water.\u201d Given the alleged contamination, 15 rainwater harvesting systems were recently installed in the village by two NGOs: the indigenous-run, Ecuador-based Ceibo Alliance and the international Amazon Frontlines. Both Cuaran and Piaguaye, like many others in Puerto Silencio, are adamant they know who is responsible: the Colombian subsidiary of the UK-based company Amerisur Resources, which reportedly began exploiting oil in a concession called Platanillo, just to the west of Buenavista\u2019s reserve, a decade ago. Among other things, the women allege that the company was using a tube to dump untreated \u2013 or inadequately treated \u2013 production wastewater into a stream called the Mansoya River, which ultimately feeds into the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco. They say they have seen that tube for themselves. \u201cWe think the river\u2019s contaminated because, when the company arrived, they pointed that tube towards the stream,\u201d Piaguaye said. \u201cNot directly, but there\u2019s one stream [running away from the oil installations], the Mansoya, and it\u2019s the water from the Mansoya that feeds into another stream that then arrives here in the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco.\u201d Permission to dump into the Mansoya was granted by Colombia\u2019s ministry of environment in 2009. Is there any scientific evidence for the women\u2019s allegations? Colombia\u2019s national authority of environmental licences (ANLA) visited the authorised dumping point on the Mansoya last year and found no observable \u201cimpact on the water, soil or vegetation\u201d, noting in a report that there was no longer any infrastructure to dump, that Amerisur claimed it had not done so since 2012, and that in 2015 the company was granted permission to reinject waste water into the ground instead. However, according to the Siona, no samples were taken where they requested and no results of samples that may have been taken elsewhere have ever been sent to them, despite numerous requests. Amerisur, listed on the London Stock Exchange\u2019s AIM market, denies it has contaminated the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco, or any other river, since operating in Platanillo. Between 2008 and 2013, the company only disposed of \u201cdomestic and produced treated water\u201d that was \u201cfully permitted and audited under the environmental licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere has been no surface disposal for five years, so any claim that Amerisur continues disposing this way cannot be true. This disposal was replaced by licensed subsurface injection in January 2014.\u201d The Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco isn\u2019t the only body of water the Siona in Buenavista allege Amerisur has affected. According to a report issued in August 2017 after a visit to the reserve by numerous government agencies, wastewaters from Platanillo had not been treated adequately and had contaminated wetlands, rivers and/or streams, including the Mansoya, Singuiy\u00e1 and Peneya. \u201cThese tributaries flow into the Putumayo and Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco rivers, which are used by the Siona for cleaning, washing and recreation,\u201d the report alleged. \u201cMany members [of Buenavista] say that contact with the water in the Putumayo and Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco has caused symptoms of dermatitis and/or skin diseases, urinary tract infections, and sight problems in children and adults.\u201d According to the Siona, the company has also dumped poorly treated wastewaters directly into the Putumayo. They say this sparked outrage in Buenavista as well as in the nearby village of La Rosa. The ministry of environment also granted permission to dump wastewaters into the Putumayo River in 2011. Buenavista\u2019s spokesman, Mario Erazo Yaiguaje, showed the Guardian the tube running through the forest that was allegedly used to do it. Some of it has now been cut away \u2013 apparently for scrap metal. \u201cThe company always did it at night,\u201d Yaiguaje alleges. \u201cFew people travel [on the river] then, so they took advantage. In the very early morning, above all. It had a serious impact on us. The smell was quite something. It was contaminating the fish, the water \u2026\u201d The president of La Rosa\u2019s council, Gregorio Rosales, says he remembers the dumping too. \u201cWhen operations began there was dumping,\u201d he alleges. \u201cEven in the Putumayo. And Mansoya. It was permitted by the ANLA. When people protested, they simply emitted a new regulation \u2013 rather than dump it, bury [reinject] it.\u201d One La Rosa resident, Beto Alvarado, accompanied the Guardian, Yaiguaje and other Siona to see the tube. He claims to remember the dumping as well, saying it happened in 2012 and 2013. \u201cThey did it at night,\u201d he also says. \u201cBetween 10pm and 4am. We could smell something foul in the big river.\u201d Like on the Mansoya, the ANLA reportedly visited the dumping point on the Putumayo last year and found no environmental effects, again noting that permission to reinject was granted in 2015, that there is no longer any functioning infrastructure to dump there, and that Amerisur should dismantle the now-fragmented tube. The ANLA also claimed to have travelled from La Rosa downriver to Buenavista and identified no effects there either. Amerisur denies allegations of contaminating the Putumayo too. \u201c[The company] complies with the environmental regulations under which its operations are governed,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAll potential contaminants are removed above and beyond the requirements before the disposal of the treated water, a process which is allowed under the environmental licence. \u201cThis is both legal and standard practice in the oil industry in Colombia. In the years since Amerisur has operated the Platanillo field, there has been no water contamination. In addition, and at Amerisur\u2019s own instigation, the company has invested in water reinjection facilities, a process which has the full approval of the environmental authorities.\u201d Platanillo extends for more than 11,100 hectares, but because of the way the rivers run, it potentially affects an area far larger than that. \u201cThe situation has been fully explained to the community of Buenavista during the socialisation processes that [was] carried out, not just by the company but by the government agencies involved. However, persistent unfounded claims continue to be made, which ignore both the facts and the results obtained by the regular legal and environmental audits by ANLA and Corpoamazon\u00eda. In all the many water disposal audits which have taken place, Amerisur has never been sanctioned,\u201d the company spokesperson said. As explored in part one of this series, over the last few decades the Siona \u2013 numbering roughly 2,600 in total \u2013 have found themselves tragically caught up in Colombia\u2019s armed conflict, together with the US\u2019s so-called \u201cwars\u201d on both drugs and terror \u201c. Ten years ago the country\u2019s constitutional court declared them \u201cin danger of being physically and culturally exterminated\u201d, a concern it reiterated in June 2017. Although fighting between the government and the country\u2019s largest guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo (the Farc), officially ended in 2016 with a historic peace deal, in Putumayo, as elsewhere, conflict continues, albeit in a slightly different form. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in July last year, paramilitaries, \u201cnarco-paramilitaries\u201d, \u201cdissident Farc organisations\u201d and \u201carmed soldiers\u201d are still fighting. Under the inter-American human rights system, the commission has issued what it calls \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d and urged Colombia\u2019s government to take the \u201cnecessary steps to protect the lives and personal integrity\u201d of leaders and their families in Buenavista and one other Siona reserve, Santa Cruz de Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco. To date however, the government has taken no concrete action, as the Siona and various civil society organisations told the commission at a hearing in Bolivia on 12 February. Buenavista has been locked in a fierce struggle with Amerisur for several years. According to its 2017 annual report, the company first became the operator at Platanillo in 2008. It is one of numerous concessions in Colombia\u2019s Putumayo basin where Amerisur now operates or has working interests. Numerous issues are at stake. One is a proposal by Amerisur to expand its operations by exploring for oil in a concession immediately east of Platanillo, called Putumayo-12, which entirely overlaps Buenavista\u2019s reserve, as well as a huge swathe of land into which the community is trying to expand the reserve under a government land restitution programme. This is the subject of part three of this series. Another is the alleged social and environmental concerns regarding a recently built pipeline, the Oleoducto Binacional Amerisur, which crosses the border into Ecuador and has prompted Siona from the village of San Jos\u00e9 de Wisuya, on the opposite bank of the Putumayo from Buenavista, to take legal action and make formal complaints to Ecuador\u2019s ministry of environment and Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo. A third is similar alleged concerns \u2013 such as Cuaran\u2019s and Piaguaye\u2019s \u2013 regarding operations in Platanillo. It is for some years now that the Siona have been alleging that the Pi\u00f1u\u00f1a Blanco, among others, has been contaminated, to others in civil society, to the media, to the government. According to Cuaran and Piaguaye, the same kinds of health effects that they have reported to the Guardian were communicated to health ministry representatives during a rare visit to Puerto Silencio in 2017, but they heard nothing back. \u201cThey\u2019ve come here and we\u2019ve spoken, but they\u2019re ignoring us,\u201d one of the women says. \u201cYes, they\u2019ve come and asked the same questions as you, but until now [no response],\u201d says the other. Ricardo Amortegui, the head of communications at the ministry of health, said he would inquire about following up the 2017 visit and acknowledged the Siona\u2019s \u201cdifficult situation\u201d \u2013 the consequence of what he called \u201criver contamination by oil operations and health impacts\u201d. \u201cTo correct the origin of the problem it\u2019s necessary that the contamination ceases,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t the responsibility of this ministry but perhaps the ministry of energy and mines, the ANLA or even the national environmental authority.\u201d The Siona in Buenavista are continuing to insist that the ANLA, in full coordination with community leaders, visit their territory to \u201cverify the social and environmental impacts\u201d. At the Bogota meeting in December, ANLA personnel reportedly said that ANLA had visited Buenavista in 2018 and \u201cdidn\u2019t confirm the allegations made by the Siona at the points they had identified\u201d, according to a Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo record of the meeting. However, that same record cited a Siona leader or leaders replying that the 2018 ANLA visit had been made without their knowledge or participation, and didn\u2019t include the places which they have been alleging, since 2012, have been affected. The December meeting ended with ANLA personnel promising, in the first week of January this year, to schedule a visit to the places identified by the Siona in the first half of 2019. The Defensor\u00eda is committing to coordinating the visit. The ANLA said it has been scheduled for May. Buenavista\u2019s lawyer, Lina Mar\u00eda Espinosa Villegas, believes it is \u201cfundamental\u201d that the visit goes ahead. \u201cAmerisur\u2019s presence in areas surrounding Buenavista and ancestral Siona territory poses a serious risk to them, their territory and sources of water,\u201d Espinosa, working for Amazon Frontlines, said. \u201cAlthough the company\u2019s operations [in the Platanillo concession] aren\u2019t inside the reserve, they are seriously affecting ecosystems and water essential to the Siona.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Radical new laws should allow police to positively discriminate in favour of minority ethnic recruits, otherwise the ranks of officers will be too white for decades to come, the leader of Britain\u2019s police chiefs has said.</p> <p>In an interview to mark the 20th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\">the Macpherson report</a> into the death of Stephen Lawrence, Sara Thornton said police had made huge progress, but \u201cunconscious bias\u201d still existed and the way they used their powers needed to be seen to be fair.</p> <p>Thornton is the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council and will retire next month after 33 years of service.</p> <p>She rose to the top having been part of the Metropolitan police team during the Macpherson inquiry, a watershed for policing which still shapes public policy and debate today.</p> <p>Thornton said new laws should be passed to \u201cshock the system\u201d.</p> <p>Since 1999 police have been trying to get the proportion of officers from ethnic minorities to match the proportion in the populations they serve.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/05/its-nowhere-near-good-enough-broken-promises-on-police-diversity\">not one of the 43 forces</a> in England and Wales has achieved that and it will be 2052 at the earliest before that happens. It is likely to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/19/met-police-disproportionately-white-for-another-100-years\">even decades beyond that</a> if, as expected, the minority ethnic population grows.</p> <p>Thornton said her personal view was that positive discrimination was needed: \u201cThat is unlawful at the moment. If you want to do something to give a shock to the system and say we can\u2019t wait to 2052, I think we need to do something different.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a political judgment, isn\u2019t it? How important is this? If it\u2019s important, then I think you need to look at a different approach.\u201d</p> <p>While 14% of the population are from an ethnic minority, just 7% of police in England and Wales are \u2013 up from 2% when Macpherson reported 20 years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/23/race-lawrence\">John Grieve: The Macpherson report left a profound and lasting legacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thornton said a quarter or even 30% of new recruits in some big forces were from an ethnic minority. But changing the overall makeup of forces was slow and budget cuts meant few new officers joined between 2010-2015.</p> <p>\u201cIt will take a long time. The turnover of police officers is really quite slow, so it is about 6% a year, it\u2019s always going to take you a long time, and it\u2019s about whether we can wait,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Police chiefs such as the former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe have favoured the move, but the government has balked at the idea of introducing positive discrimination on the grounds of race. It has been used in Northern Ireland to get more Catholics into the police service and in the US.</p> <p>Positive action is legal and allows measures to encourage applications from under-represented groups. Some chiefs believe the focus on race issues has been lost at times, so more could be done without a fight with the government to change the law.</p> <p>Thornton said: \u201cI think there\u2019s an argument that we could select on merit and put people into a pool [of recruits] and then appoint on representation.\u201d</p> <p>Thornton was once described as the former prime minister David Cameron\u2019s favourite police chief. She is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd7bddigD-c\">former chief constable of Thames Valley</a>, which covers the constituency of Theresa May, who pressed the police over race while home secretary.</p> <p>Thornton, 56, is expected to be announced on Friday as the government\u2019s new anti-slavery commissioner.</p> <p>Thornton said \u201cunconscious bias\u201d still existed in policing and there were problems in promotion, and minority ethnic officers being more likely to face disciplinary action.</p> <p>\u201cIf we like ourselves, we prefer people who are like ourselves, because we understand them and they are familiar. People who aren\u2019t like ourselves, sometimes we feel less comfortable with.

      "bodyText": "Radical new laws should allow police to positively discriminate in favour of minority ethnic recruits, otherwise the ranks of officers will be too white for decades to come, the leader of Britain\u2019s police chiefs has said. In an interview to mark the 20th anniversary of the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, Sara Thornton said police had made huge progress, but \u201cunconscious bias\u201d still existed and the way they used their powers needed to be seen to be fair. Thornton is the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council and will retire next month after 33 years of service. She rose to the top having been part of the Metropolitan police team during the Macpherson inquiry, a watershed for policing which still shapes public policy and debate today. Thornton said new laws should be passed to \u201cshock the system\u201d. Since 1999 police have been trying to get the proportion of officers from ethnic minorities to match the proportion in the populations they serve. But not one of the 43 forces in England and Wales has achieved that and it will be 2052 at the earliest before that happens. It is likely to be even decades beyond that if, as expected, the minority ethnic population grows. Thornton said her personal view was that positive discrimination was needed: \u201cThat is unlawful at the moment. If you want to do something to give a shock to the system and say we can\u2019t wait to 2052, I think we need to do something different. \u201cIt is a political judgment, isn\u2019t it? How important is this? If it\u2019s important, then I think you need to look at a different approach.\u201d While 14% of the population are from an ethnic minority, just 7% of police in England and Wales are \u2013 up from 2% when Macpherson reported 20 years ago. Thornton said a quarter or even 30% of new recruits in some big forces were from an ethnic minority. But changing the overall makeup of forces was slow and budget cuts meant few new officers joined between 2010-2015. \u201cIt will take a long time. The turnover of police officers is really quite slow, so it is about 6% a year, it\u2019s always going to take you a long time, and it\u2019s about whether we can wait,\u201d she said. Police chiefs such as the former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe have favoured the move, but the government has balked at the idea of introducing positive discrimination on the grounds of race. It has been used in Northern Ireland to get more Catholics into the police service and in the US. Positive action is legal and allows measures to encourage applications from under-represented groups. Some chiefs believe the focus on race issues has been lost at times, so more could be done without a fight with the government to change the law. Thornton said: \u201cI think there\u2019s an argument that we could select on merit and put people into a pool [of recruits] and then appoint on representation.\u201d Thornton was once described as the former prime minister David Cameron\u2019s favourite police chief. She is a former chief constable of Thames Valley, which covers the constituency of Theresa May, who pressed the police over race while home secretary. Thornton, 56, is expected to be announced on Friday as the government\u2019s new anti-slavery commissioner. Thornton said \u201cunconscious bias\u201d still existed in policing and there were problems in promotion, and minority ethnic officers being more likely to face disciplinary action. \u201cIf we like ourselves, we prefer people who are like ourselves, because we understand them and they are familiar. People who aren\u2019t like ourselves, sometimes we feel less comfortable with. What are those stereotypes we sometimes just fall into?\u201d She added that unconscious bias training had been introduced to combat this. \u201cI do think we can have policies and procedures that can unintentionally discriminate.\u201d She gave the example of one large force, Greater Manchester, holding a promotion board during Ramadan, when Muslim candidates would be fasting and thus possibly physically weaker and at a disadvantage. Thornton said she did not like to use the term institutional racism \u2013 the headline finding of the Macpherson inquiry \u2013 because it was misunderstood and taken as a slur on every officer. Thornton said forces needed to treat their officers fairly, and they in turn needed to be seen to use their powers justly. It was crucial for legitimacy in a service that prided itself on \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d, she said, with the issue being even more important because police exercised the \u201ctyranny and majesty of state power\u201d. Thornton said: \u201cFor marginalised communities, policing can represent the tyranny of state power. \u201cLet\u2019s be candid about this, if within communities there is a sense of being over-policed and under-protected, it\u2019s not the sort of occupation parents are going to encourage their youngsters to get involved in.\u201d Police had made huge progress, she said, with the gap in black people\u2019s trust in officers narrowing to 7% less than white people\u2019s. Stephen Lawrence, 18, was murdered by a white racist gang at a south-east London bus stop in 1993 and Macpherson found police incompetence and prejudice, which he described as \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d, helped the killers escape justice. Police fought suggestions of errors and bias with vehemence, but were exposed by the inquiry. Police chiefs were the last to realise the injustice their force had inflicted on the murdered victim\u2019s parents, Doreen and Neville Lawrence. Thornton, a superintendent when the inquiry held its dramatic hearings, said Met leaders who had given their working life to the force could not believe the Lawrence investigation had gone so wrong, before the Macpherson inquiry laid the failings bare. Thornton said an argument from some officers that police prejudice was no worse than that of others in society was not good enough: \u201cWe are police officers with significant powers and therefore it matters much more.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 February 2019.

      "bodyText": "Anthem seeks to infuse co-operative shooting with the nuanced storytelling that has made its developer, BioWare, one of the world\u2019s most respected \u2013 and in doing so, it takes copious notes from Bungie\u2019s colourful sci-fi shooter Destiny. It\u2019s an intriguing gamble, but sadly, Anthem proves to be depressingly hollow. Initially all seems well, as Anthem sensibly front-loads its strongest features. The game takes place on an alien planet subject to perpetual cataclysms, and players assume the role of heroic mercenaries, using their powerful Javelin mech suits to fight the dangerous creatures that appear in their wake. This world is visually stunning, beyond almost anything we\u2019ve seen in the current generation of video games. The planet\u2019s surface appears to have been shattered and then hastily cobbled back together, as if some divine baker has tried to rescue an enormous dropped meringue. It\u2019s a place where lush rainforests cling to vertiginous rock formations and perch on towering white mesas, while sparkling waterfalls pour down cliff-faces hundreds of feet high. Similar attention has been lavished upon the Javelin suits. There are four to choose from, from the hulking Colossus to the nimble Interceptor. They all come equipped with a powerful jetpack: leap from the ground and hit the boosters, and your Javelin punches through the air like an F-15 breaking the sound barrier. They\u2019re not the easiest things to control, particularly using a mouse and keyboard, but flying around is supremely liberating regardless. The true power of these suits is revealed during combat. Each comes with a variety of weapons ranging from pistols to massive assault cannons, and its own special abilities. The Ranger, for example, can equip his off-hand with a high-powered laser beam or a heat-seeking missile, while the suit can generate a force-field that deflects enemy bullets. Over time, each Javelin can charge up a devastating \u201cUltimate\u201d, such as a pummelling barrage of rockets fired from the Ranger\u2019s chest. When four players are locked in battle against one of Anthem\u2019s more powerful opponents, the potential of the game is plain to see. Yet, despite being touted as a cooperative experience, Anthem\u2019s team play is limited to reviving fallen comrades and occasionally pulling off a \u201ccombo\u201d power set up by another player. Otherwise, there\u2019s little sense of teamwork and almost zero communication. The effect is of playing alongside other people rather than with them. This bizarre sense of isolation is most acutely felt in your home city, Fort Tarsis, to which you return at the end of every mission. Here, Anthem separates you from other players, switching to a narrow first-person perspective while you pick up new missions, upgrade your Javelin and (should you really want to) talk to the game\u2019s characters. Fort Tarsis is notionally where the human side of Anthem resides; plot-critical characters and chatty civilians are sprinkled around like story-garnish. Yet Anthem\u2019s tale is entirely disposable. In the absence of any meaningful opportunities for character development, most conversations amount to quipping duels, as if the dialogue was written by a machine-learning algorithm fed on Joss Whedon scripts. It\u2019s disappointing to see BioWare fail to deliver in the area where the studio is historically most adept, but poor storytelling is far from the worst of Anthem\u2019s problems. Continually returning to Fort Tarsis to accept a new mission or upgrade your Javelin obliterates the flow. It\u2019s like two completely different games have been welded together so abruptly that the seam is still glowing.

Prime minister Scott Morrison announced the Australian infrastructure financing facility last year as part of Australia\u2019s \u201cPacific step up\u201d, which is aimed at combatting rising Chinese influence in the region. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Thursday confirmed the bank would be made up of $500m in grants and $1.5bn to be funded from the federal budget.

Aid groups maintain there is no fat left to trim in the aid budget. Care Australia chief executive Sally Moyle said a Pacific step up shouldn\u2019t stem from an Asia step down. \u201cAustralia cannot be seen as a development partner to be running hot and cold, we\u2019ve got to be a consistent true friend and that doesn\u2019t come from saying \u2018oh well sorry Cambodia you\u2019re fine now we\u2019re taking the money away\u2019,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Moyle said it was vital the infrastructure scheme has safeguards that considered issues such as displacement of communities, gender equality and environmental impacts. \u201cIf you don\u2019t there\u2019s a real risk we might be building white elephants in the Pacific,\u201d she said. Moyle noted a long history of infrastructure projects across the region that have made things worse for locals. \u201cFabulous new highways built that don\u2019t connect to villages, where people are trying to get their goods to the markets, but it does nothing for them, all it does \u2026 is allows elites to drive around. It doesn\u2019t help poor people,\u201d Moyle said.

We said we\u2019re helping to alleviate poverty but then we\u2019ve pulled out. What that means is doors are closing to us in Asia,\u201d Purcell said. Purcell said there was no point building hospitals if there was no consideration for ongoing building maintenance, the availability of skilled medical staff and the cost of wages and petrol generators. The aid program has been hit with more than $11bn in funding cuts since 2013 when the Coalition came to power. Australian aid has fallen to a historic low level to just 22 cents of every $100 of gross national income. Last year, the government skimmed money from the aid program to Indonesia and put it towards building an undersea cable for Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. World Vision chief executive Claire Rogers, who has a background in banking, is worried the government is rushing the bank without proper consultation and involving Pacific communities. \u201cAny infrastructure projects funded by the new loan facility should be pro-poor, climate resilient, and be bundled with other community development projects to maximise their poverty reduction impact,\u201d she said. Australian National University professional Stephen Howes is critical of the involvement of Australia\u2019s Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in the new infrastructure bank. Efic stands to have its callable capital of $200m boosted to $1.2bn under the government\u2019s plan. Howes is worried that Efic could give a green light to Australian businesses to push projects in neighbouring countries by recruiting local political champions to their cause. \u201cThe risks are obvious.

The motion proposed by the Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper is due to be debated in the coming week and May will be seen as having little option other than to sack ministers if they rebel to support it. The \u201cBrexit delivery group\u201d of 100 MPs from both the remain and leave wings of the party have warned May that many of their number are prepared to rebel unless she allows a free vote on taking no deal off the table.</p> <p>Under another amendment drawn up by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, MPs would support the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal in exchange for it being put to a public vote. It would not be tabled until May brings her final deal back to parliament for the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. If that does not happen next week, May has promised to table another amendable motion, like the one that resulted in her being defeated by Brexit rebels this month. Labour is likely to table its own amendment to that motion, which would put forward Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s alternative Brexit policy.</p> <p>In Brussels, Corbyn \u2013 who this week had eight pro-people\u2019s vote members of his party leave to form the Independent Group \u2013 has made a point of saying that the option of holding a second referendum remains \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/21/starmer-pm-is-running-down-clock-so-mps-only-get-binary-choice\">very much part of the agenda put forward by the Labour party</a>\u201d, should May fail to back a close economic partnership with the EU. Up to 10 Labour shadow ministers have said they would be prepared to resign rather than vote against a second referendum amendment. Some senior party figures believe much of the appeal of the 11-strong Independent Group would be neutralised if Labour leant towards backing a referendum.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Global threat to the human diet \u2013 </strong>About 20% of the Earth\u2019s vegetated surface has become less productive for food over the past 20 years, a UN report says.

The convicted drug dealer Abdul Deghayes, 22, from Brighton, died of stab wounds on Sunday after being attacked in a car that crashed in Brighton. Daniel Macleod, 36, of Lambeth, south London, is due to appear before magistrates in Brighton on Friday.

North Korea said it faced shortfalls that would lead to daily rations being cut from 550g per person to 300g. The UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said talks were under way with the North Korean government after requests for help via humanitarian agencies.

      "body": "<p>Getting people to trip over their tongues has long been a staple of satire. And since 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/late-night-tv-roundup\">satirical political commentary</a> hasn\u2019t exactly been in short supply. And yet the newbie talkshow Soft Focus With Jena Friedman is thrillingly unexpected: a bold blend of feminist politics and heart-in-your-mouth edginess.</p> <p>Created by Friedman, a New York-based standup whose show American C*nt (her spelling) got rave reviews at the Edinburgh festival fringe in 2015, Soft Focus is a gonzo-style magazine show, whose second offering is now on Adult Swim. Although it has only run for a slim total of 40 minutes so far, it has featured a wannabe cannibal on a dating game, a suspected murderer running for president and the CEO of a sex doll company. In other words: if Friedman\u2019s work is funny \u2013 and it really is \u2013 it\u2019s at the outrageous end of the scale. And the outrage is first and foremost her own.</p> <p>Friedman is an alumnus of the Daily Show \u2013 where she spent the last three years of Jon Stewart\u2019s tenure as a field producer for Samantha Bee, John Oliver and Michael Che \u2013 and the Late Show with David Letterman. But she had been putting progressive politics on stage since way before either. Her first solo project, in 2007, was a satirical musical, The Refugee Girl Revue, which laid bare the twin issues of white privilege and anti-immigrant sentiment through a parody of deeply problematic American Girl dolls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57463af68530e62fbd21f9fc225553523ca66e2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57463af68530e62fbd21f9fc225553523ca66e2f/0_202_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jena Friedman on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jena Friedman on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Contrary to the male comedian shtick that it\u2019s always only about the laughs, and never any agenda, Friedman believes everyone has an agenda. \u201cNothing is ever just a thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s never just a joke. There are a lot of guys online who supported Trump ironically \u2013 and then look what happened. People who think things aren\u2019t political, they\u2019ve had the luxury of going through life without things being political.\u201d By people, she mostly means white men, the show\u2019s primary target. Because, as she puts it, women and people of colour are \u2013 and until they are treated as equals will remain \u2013 political by virtue of their very existence.</p> <p>Arriving at the Daily Show, she revelled in Stewart\u2019s directive to go after whatever she cared about. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out the funny later,\u201d he\u2019d say. Friedman produced prescient segments on the minimum wage and the OxyContin epidemic. She helped Bee lay the groundwork for a prominent republican financial commentator to step in it, as he glibly labelled anyone earning $2 an hour \u201cmentally retarded\u201d. She studied economics, she says. \u201cI knew how to get him.\u201d She and Che also got a former Food and Drug Administration employee-cum-journalist to admit, on camera, that he was paid by a big pharma company. That hypocrisy writ large was where they found the laughs.</p> <p>Friedman may have started out in sketch improv, but Stewart\u2019s format \u2013 talking to real people in the real world \u2013 is what stuck: \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite thing to do.\u201d Soft Focus repeatedly showcases how thoroughly she has made it her own. Her strength is evident in the frequent impeccably timed knowing looks to camera whenever her guests come up with the goods.</p> <p>In the opening credits of Soft Focus, Friedman\u2019s voiceover announces that the show is the light touch that hard issues sometimes need. Those hard issues? Everything from campus rape and sexual harassment in gaming to #MeToo.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKggypYWNW4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jKggypYWNW4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Gilberto Valle on Soft Focus.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>There\u2019s an interview with the former NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, who was arrested in 2012 for apparently plotting to rape, cook and eat his wife and her friends on Dark Fetish Net \u2013 and who is now dating. Dating. As soon as Friedman read that, she knew she just had to \u201cgive people a heads-up\u201d. The segment is part chatshow, part truly icky gameshow. Valle tells her he\u2019s a normal guy who would never dream of doing anything to anyone without their consent, then nods in full agreement as she lays out exactly what he did to get arrested. When Friedman gets him to confirm he is dating, she brings out three contestants, Take Me Out-style, who each ask him a question, then answer two of Valle\u2019s. He asks them all where they live and how fast they can run \u2013 a chilling TV moment if ever there was one.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s John McAfee, the anti-virus software developer turned murder suspect, who has declared a second run for the US presidency, as the libertarian hopeful, in 2020. \u201cI think people who are running for president, we need to talk to them as soon as we can,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game at this point.\u201d With unswerving focus \u2013 apart from when McAfee pulls out his gun and one of his bodyguards forgets he\u2019s holding one too and inadvertently points it at her \u2013 she quizzes him about his suspected criminal past, his run-ins with the US government (he tells her he once hacked the government\u2019s entire IT system) and his bombastic tweeted pledge to eat his own dick if bitcoin doesn\u2019t perform as well as he says it will. She somehow gets him to repeat this promise eight times. (It\u2019s the only bit in the segment where she cracked up and had to do another take.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfe4Fjf3sds\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tfe4Fjf3sds?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>John McAfee on Soft Focus.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As a host, Friedman is an intriguing blend of concern, coyness and deadpan wit. She looks and listens like a health professional \u2013 the doctor on to whose chair you gratefully slump \u2013 then trips up viewer and guest with something so subtle you\u2019re past it before it hits you. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be funny,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of being under the radar.\u201d It allows her to sneak in the kind of pointed line a more exuberant delivery might have dimmed, such as when she asks McAfee to define, \u201cfor those who don\u2019t know\u201d, what makes a libertarian \u201cother than a white guy who\u2019s too cheap to pay for birth control\u201d. She has perfected the \u201cWait \u2026 what?\u201d approach to making you laugh.</p> <p>Underpinning, or perhaps, threatening to unravel Friedman\u2019s comedy \u2013 and it\u2019s this tug-of-war that keeps you glued \u2013 is her awareness of the problems she is addressing. She does a whole segment at the end of her standup show on toxic masculinity and how to get to the root of it. How do you help men? There\u2019s such comedy in that question \u2013 \u201cHow do we be better to men?\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s also a truism, and an urgent one at that.</p> <p>Friedman\u2019s field reports hum with the need to effect change: trying to get college guys to <em>think</em> about consent and what it\u2019s like to be a college girl; trying to get male gamers to <em>think</em> about what it\u2019s like being a female gamer. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to get people to see things in a way that they haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>For a Gamergate-inspired segment, Friedman recruited four male gamers to play a VR game based on life as a woman as defined by #MeToo. (\u201cI love that we just call it #MeToo,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a cute little euphemism for rampant misogyny, sexism and rape culture in our present, patriarchal society.\u201d) Cue an adult film actor playing a Harvey Weinstein character doing very Weinstein things in an interview (there\u2019s a potted plant) that the gamers experience sitting alone in a room, on a chair, with a VR headset on. It has added sensory detailing (a sausage on a stick poking, a spritzer squirting) to make the experience more lifelike and the guys more uncomfortable. They are \u2013 for the most part. One of them says that victims, essentially, may be asking for it, but says that he doesn\u2019t actually know any female gamers. Another, of his own volition, brings Trump into the mix, saying that men who harass women shouldn\u2019t be elected <em>and</em> that he\u2019s a Maga supporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you guys making correlations with Trump voters and \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Friedman replies. \u201cYou just did that yourself.\u201d</p> <p><em>Soft Focus with Jena Friedman is on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/adultswim/videos\" title=\"\">Adult Swim</a>.</em></p>",

In the opening credits of Soft Focus, Friedman\u2019s voiceover announces that the show is the light touch that hard issues sometimes need. Those hard issues? Everything from campus rape and sexual harassment in gaming to #MeToo. There\u2019s an interview with the former NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, who was arrested in 2012 for apparently plotting to rape, cook and eat his wife and her friends on Dark Fetish Net \u2013 and who is now dating. Dating. As soon as Friedman read that, she knew she just had to \u201cgive people a heads-up\u201d. The segment is part chatshow, part truly icky gameshow. Valle tells her he\u2019s a normal guy who would never dream of doing anything to anyone without their consent, then nods in full agreement as she lays out exactly what he did to get arrested. When Friedman gets him to confirm he is dating, she brings out three contestants, Take Me Out-style, who each ask him a question, then answer two of Valle\u2019s. He asks them all where they live and how fast they can run \u2013 a chilling TV moment if ever there was one. And then there\u2019s John McAfee, the anti-virus software developer turned murder suspect, who has declared a second run for the US presidency, as the libertarian hopeful, in 2020. \u201cI think people who are running for president, we need to talk to them as soon as we can,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game at this point.\u201d With unswerving focus \u2013 apart from when McAfee pulls out his gun and one of his bodyguards forgets he\u2019s holding one too and inadvertently points it at her \u2013 she quizzes him about his suspected criminal past, his run-ins with the US government (he tells her he once hacked the government\u2019s entire IT system) and his bombastic tweeted pledge to eat his own dick if bitcoin doesn\u2019t perform as well as he says it will. She somehow gets him to repeat this promise eight times. (It\u2019s the only bit in the segment where she cracked up and had to do another take.) As a host, Friedman is an intriguing blend of concern, coyness and deadpan wit. She looks and listens like a health professional \u2013 the doctor on to whose chair you gratefully slump \u2013 then trips up viewer and guest with something so subtle you\u2019re past it before it hits you. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be funny,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of being under the radar.\u201d It allows her to sneak in the kind of pointed line a more exuberant delivery might have dimmed, such as when she asks McAfee to define, \u201cfor those who don\u2019t know\u201d, what makes a libertarian \u201cother than a white guy who\u2019s too cheap to pay for birth control\u201d. She has perfected the \u201cWait \u2026 what?\u201d approach to making you laugh. Underpinning, or perhaps, threatening to unravel Friedman\u2019s comedy \u2013 and it\u2019s this tug-of-war that keeps you glued \u2013 is her awareness of the problems she is addressing. She does a whole segment at the end of her standup show on toxic masculinity and how to get to the root of it. How do you help men? There\u2019s such comedy in that question \u2013 \u201cHow do we be better to men?\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s also a truism, and an urgent one at that. Friedman\u2019s field reports hum with the need to effect change: trying to get college guys to think about consent and what it\u2019s like to be a college girl; trying to get male gamers to think about what it\u2019s like being a female gamer. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to get people to see things in a way that they haven\u2019t.\u201d For a Gamergate-inspired segment, Friedman recruited four male gamers to play a VR game based on life as a woman as defined by #MeToo. (\u201cI love that we just call it #MeToo,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a cute little euphemism for rampant misogyny, sexism and rape culture in our present, patriarchal society.\u201d) Cue an adult film actor playing a Harvey Weinstein character doing very Weinstein things in an interview (there\u2019s a potted plant) that the gamers experience sitting alone in a room, on a chair, with a VR headset on. It has added sensory detailing (a sausage on a stick poking, a spritzer squirting) to make the experience more lifelike and the guys more uncomfortable. They are \u2013 for the most part. One of them says that victims, essentially, may be asking for it, but says that he doesn\u2019t actually know any female gamers. Another, of his own volition, brings Trump into the mix, saying that men who harass women shouldn\u2019t be elected and that he\u2019s a Maga supporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you guys making correlations with Trump voters and \u2026\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Friedman replies. \u201cYou just did that yourself.\u201d Soft Focus with Jena Friedman is on Adult Swim.",

      "body": "<p>Mark Ronson fiddles with the lead that connects his phone to the hotel room speaker. He presses play and rushes out, reappearing when the last notes die away. That\u2019s really good, I tell him, because it is. The song he plays is the title track from his forthcoming album, Late Night Feelings, and it pulls off the old disco trick of sounding simultaneously euphoric and yearning. The track packs the kind of chorus \u2013 sung by Lykke Li \u2013 that you suspect is going to be inescapable for the rest of the year. He nods. \u201cI think these are my best \u2026\u201d He trails off and rolls his eyes. \u201cWell, of course I\u2019m going to sit in front of you and say something like that.\u201d Then he presses play on the phone and rushes out of the room again.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly an unusual way to hear one of the most hotly anticipated pop albums of the year, a self-styled collection of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/01/broken-hearted-bring-on-the-sad-banger-songs-like-mark-ronson\" title=\"\">sad bangers</a>\u201d that is also home to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9hcJgtnm6Q\" title=\"\">Nothing Breaks Like a Heart</a>, Ronson\u2019s collaboration with Miley Cyrus that, the day I meet him, has taken up residence in the Top 10 everywhere from Belgium to Lebanon. But rushing in and out as if you can\u2019t face being in the room while another person listens to your music is very Mark Ronson.</p> <p>Famously a nice guy, he also has a reputation for making quite heavy weather of the business of being himself. The last time I met him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/04/mark-ronson-uptown-special-interview\" title=\"\">was in 2015</a>. His 2010 album, Record Collection, had sold \u201cway less\u201d than his 2007 breakthrough, Version, and he thought that he had \u201cgone cold\u201d. At that point, though, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/04/mark-ronson-uptown-funk-biggest-track-2015\" title=\"\">Uptown Funk</a> was in the process of establishing itself as one of the biggest singles of the decade, and I arrived at his studio just as he took delivery of a celebratory bottle of champagne from his record company. \u201cI sent that to myself to try and look good in front of a journalist,\u201d he muttered when I mentioned it, before telling me that the stress of making the single had, at various junctures, made him faint, vomit and cause his hair to fall out. When he played Uptown Funk to his stepfather, Mick Jones of <a href=\"https://myrockmixtapes.com/2016/12/30/what-is-aor/\" title=\"\">AOR</a> titans Foreigner, Jones had innocently asked if the guitar was played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nile-rodgers\" title=\"\">Nile Rodgers</a>. \u201cSo, there you go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve finally made a record so good that people don\u2019t think it\u2019s me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56d0a91f28dc60bd14b90a58b43af7dd75b1dac2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d0a91f28dc60bd14b90a58b43af7dd75b1dac2/0_0_4319_6479/667.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Ronson.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Uptown Funk went on to win two Grammys and become not just one of the biggest-selling singles of the decade, but of all time: 20m copies and counting.

He formed Silk City with his friend and fellow producer Diplo \u2013 \u201cwhen the kind of piano chord shit that I like hit his drums, it accidentally sounded like 80s or 90s piano house\u201d \u2013 and their 2018 collaboration with Dua Lipa, Electricity, was another global hit.</p> <p>He produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/20/lady-gaga-joanne-review-stefani-germanotta\" title=\"\">Lady Gaga\u2019s album Joanne</a> \u2013 the title track of which has just won a Grammy \u2013 and it is an LP that had the kind of influence on pop that his work on Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black did a decade ago. It sent other artists scuttling in a similarly stripped-back, rootsy, analogue direction: it was said that everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/10/kesha-rainbow-review-wronged-pop-avenger-makes-captivating-comeback\" title=\"\">Kesha\u2019s Rainbow</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/06/kylie-minogue-golden-review-yearning-country-reinvention\" title=\"\">Kylie Minogue\u2019s Golden</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/04/justin-timberlake-man-of-the-woods-album-review\" title=\"\">Justin Timberlake\u2019s Man of the Woods</a> was inspired by it. In the middle of making that album, he co-wrote Shallow, a duet between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper for the A Star Is Born soundtrack: another transatlantic No 1, it won two Grammys and a Golden Globe for best song, and is nominated in the same category at this weekend\u2019s Oscars.</p> <p>And yet Ronson is still self-deprecating to a fault. Today, his description of the making of Shallow involves giving so much credit to everybody else involved \u2013 Lady Gaga had the idea for the chorus and the lyrics \u201cthat made my hairs just stand up\u201d; his regular collaborators, Andrew Wyatt and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/15/its-10-years-of-relationships-boiled-down-lady-gaga-anthony-rossomando-shallow\" title=\"\">former Libertine Anthony Rossomando</a>, came up with the guitar part and Cooper had the idea to make it a duet \u2013 that he makes it sound as if he just stood there and watched the rest of them getting on with it. To hear him tell it, every collaborator on Late Night Feelings had to be coaxed into getting involved, rather than clamouring to work with someone who currently appears to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/04/john-seabrook-song-machine-review-pop-music\" title=\"\">a hit-making machine</a>. \u201cThey probably thought I was some pop wheeler-dealer,\u201d he shrugs when I raise an unconvinced eyebrow.</p> <p>He says he didn\u2019t feel any pressure as a result of Uptown Funk\u2019s success because it was \u201can anomaly, it\u2019s clearly something that\u2019s only going to happen once in a lifetime\u201d. But it\u2019s worth noting that virtually all of Ronson\u2019s successes seem weirdly anomalous. Who would have thought the second album by Amy Winehouse, one of a raft of vaguely jazzy and/or neo-soul female vocalists who were doing the rounds at the time, would go on to become a classic? Who could have predicted a cover of a mildly successful single by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/28/popandrock.thezutons\" title=\"\">the Zutons</a> in a 60s soul style would become one of the most deathless singles of its era? And despite his apparent dominance in modern pop, he says he feels out of step with the current climate, where \u201call your songs have to be under three minutes and 15 seconds because if people don\u2019t listen to them all the way to the end they go into this ratio of \u2018non-complete heard\u2019, which sends your Spotify rating down\u201d and songwriters are forced to churn out hits at short order.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9hcJgtnm6Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A9hcJgtnm6Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cEverybody shows off about how quickly they write songs these days, because of the way pop music is made,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are like: \u2018Yeah man, we wrote that song in 30 minutes,\u2019 and I feel like: \u2018Yeah, and it fucking sounds like you wrote it in 30 minutes.\u2019 There are things written in that time that are fucking brilliant \u2013 Amy wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/nov/25/amy-winehouse-back-to-black\" title=\"\">Back to Black</a> in, like, 10 minutes \u2013 but a lot of the time I think the quality\u2019s slipped to a point where it\u2019s just OK, where I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with doing that with my own music.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, he wonders whether his most celebrated production work would have even been a hit in 2019. \u201cEverything has to be produced so it sounds competitively as loud as possible coming out of an iPhone or as loud as possible when it comes out of a Spotify hits playlist; you have to make sure the kick drum and the guitar have the same loudness and presence all the way through the whole fucking song or you don\u2019t stand a chance. It\u2019s kind of crazy how you have to think about music now. I mean, Amy wouldn\u2019t have let that shit happen for a second, which makes me think how Back to Black would have been received, or how it would have probably performed badly on Spotify playlists if it was released today.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/05/10-years-of-spotify-should-we-celebrate-or-despair\">Has 10 years of Spotify ruined music?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says the making of Late Night Feelings was complex and \u201cemotionally taxing\u201d. He had started making an entirely different album when, during projects with Diplo, SZA and Tame Impala\u2019s Kevin Parker, he had a crisis of confidence in the studio. \u201cKevin is so talented it\u2019s almost intimidating to be in the studio with him, so I defer to him a lot. Diplo has his own school of working where there\u2019s a bunch of kids on laptops, and I was starting to become one of those guys just standing over people going: \u2018Yeah, why don\u2019t we try turning the hi-hat up.\u2019 That\u2019s not who I am \u2013 I was starting to lose my imprint on the music I was making.

      "bodyText": "Mark Ronson fiddles with the lead that connects his phone to the hotel room speaker. He presses play and rushes out, reappearing when the last notes die away. That\u2019s really good, I tell him, because it is. The song he plays is the title track from his forthcoming album, Late Night Feelings, and it pulls off the old disco trick of sounding simultaneously euphoric and yearning. The track packs the kind of chorus \u2013 sung by Lykke Li \u2013 that you suspect is going to be inescapable for the rest of the year. He nods. \u201cI think these are my best \u2026\u201d He trails off and rolls his eyes. \u201cWell, of course I\u2019m going to sit in front of you and say something like that.\u201d Then he presses play on the phone and rushes out of the room again. It\u2019s certainly an unusual way to hear one of the most hotly anticipated pop albums of the year, a self-styled collection of \u201csad bangers\u201d that is also home to Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, Ronson\u2019s collaboration with Miley Cyrus that, the day I meet him, has taken up residence in the Top 10 everywhere from Belgium to Lebanon. But rushing in and out as if you can\u2019t face being in the room while another person listens to your music is very Mark Ronson. Famously a nice guy, he also has a reputation for making quite heavy weather of the business of being himself. The last time I met him was in 2015. His 2010 album, Record Collection, had sold \u201cway less\u201d than his 2007 breakthrough, Version, and he thought that he had \u201cgone cold\u201d. At that point, though, Uptown Funk was in the process of establishing itself as one of the biggest singles of the decade, and I arrived at his studio just as he took delivery of a celebratory bottle of champagne from his record company. \u201cI sent that to myself to try and look good in front of a journalist,\u201d he muttered when I mentioned it, before telling me that the stress of making the single had, at various junctures, made him faint, vomit and cause his hair to fall out. When he played Uptown Funk to his stepfather, Mick Jones of AOR titans Foreigner, Jones had innocently asked if the guitar was played by Nile Rodgers. \u201cSo, there you go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve finally made a record so good that people don\u2019t think it\u2019s me.\u201d Uptown Funk went on to win two Grammys and become not just one of the biggest-selling singles of the decade, but of all time: 20m copies and counting. The accompanying album, Uptown Special \u2013 which featured collaborations with everyone from Stevie Wonder to novelist Michael Chabon, who provided lyrics \u2013 broke him in the US, a country previously immune to the charms of his solo work. He formed Silk City with his friend and fellow producer Diplo \u2013 \u201cwhen the kind of piano chord shit that I like hit his drums, it accidentally sounded like 80s or 90s piano house\u201d \u2013 and their 2018 collaboration with Dua Lipa, Electricity, was another global hit. He produced Lady Gaga\u2019s album Joanne \u2013 the title track of which has just won a Grammy \u2013 and it is an LP that had the kind of influence on pop that his work on Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black did a decade ago. It sent other artists scuttling in a similarly stripped-back, rootsy, analogue direction: it was said that everything from Kesha\u2019s Rainbow to Kylie Minogue\u2019s Golden to Justin Timberlake\u2019s Man of the Woods was inspired by it. In the middle of making that album, he co-wrote Shallow, a duet between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper for the A Star Is Born soundtrack: another transatlantic No 1, it won two Grammys and a Golden Globe for best song, and is nominated in the same category at this weekend\u2019s Oscars. And yet Ronson is still self-deprecating to a fault. Today, his description of the making of Shallow involves giving so much credit to everybody else involved \u2013 Lady Gaga had the idea for the chorus and the lyrics \u201cthat made my hairs just stand up\u201d; his regular collaborators, Andrew Wyatt and former Libertine Anthony Rossomando, came up with the guitar part and Cooper had the idea to make it a duet \u2013 that he makes it sound as if he just stood there and watched the rest of them getting on with it. To hear him tell it, every collaborator on Late Night Feelings had to be coaxed into getting involved, rather than clamouring to work with someone who currently appears to be a hit-making machine. \u201cThey probably thought I was some pop wheeler-dealer,\u201d he shrugs when I raise an unconvinced eyebrow. He says he didn\u2019t feel any pressure as a result of Uptown Funk\u2019s success because it was \u201can anomaly, it\u2019s clearly something that\u2019s only going to happen once in a lifetime\u201d. But it\u2019s worth noting that virtually all of Ronson\u2019s successes seem weirdly anomalous. Who would have thought the second album by Amy Winehouse, one of a raft of vaguely jazzy and/or neo-soul female vocalists who were doing the rounds at the time, would go on to become a classic? Who could have predicted a cover of a mildly successful single by the Zutons in a 60s soul style would become one of the most deathless singles of its era? And despite his apparent dominance in modern pop, he says he feels out of step with the current climate, where \u201call your songs have to be under three minutes and 15 seconds because if people don\u2019t listen to them all the way to the end they go into this ratio of \u2018non-complete heard\u2019, which sends your Spotify rating down\u201d and songwriters are forced to churn out hits at short order. \u201cEverybody shows off about how quickly they write songs these days, because of the way pop music is made,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are like: \u2018Yeah man, we wrote that song in 30 minutes,\u2019 and I feel like: \u2018Yeah, and it fucking sounds like you wrote it in 30 minutes.\u2019 There are things written in that time that are fucking brilliant \u2013 Amy wrote Back to Black in, like, 10 minutes \u2013 but a lot of the time I think the quality\u2019s slipped to a point where it\u2019s just OK, where I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with doing that with my own music.\u201d Indeed, he wonders whether his most celebrated production work would have even been a hit in 2019. \u201cEverything has to be produced so it sounds competitively as loud as possible coming out of an iPhone or as loud as possible when it comes out of a Spotify hits playlist; you have to make sure the kick drum and the guitar have the same loudness and presence all the way through the whole fucking song or you don\u2019t stand a chance. It\u2019s kind of crazy how you have to think about music now. I mean, Amy wouldn\u2019t have let that shit happen for a second, which makes me think how Back to Black would have been received, or how it would have probably performed badly on Spotify playlists if it was released today.\u201d He says the making of Late Night Feelings was complex and \u201cemotionally taxing\u201d. He had started making an entirely different album when, during projects with Diplo, SZA and Tame Impala\u2019s Kevin Parker, he had a crisis of confidence in the studio. \u201cKevin is so talented it\u2019s almost intimidating to be in the studio with him, so I defer to him a lot. Diplo has his own school of working where there\u2019s a bunch of kids on laptops, and I was starting to become one of those guys just standing over people going: \u2018Yeah, why don\u2019t we try turning the hi-hat up.\u2019 That\u2019s not who I am \u2013 I was starting to lose my imprint on the music I was making. But I think it suited where I was emotionally and what I was able to handle.\u201d He couldn\u2019t handle much because his marriage to the French model and actor Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume collapsed in 2017. \u201cI was floundering,\u201d he says. \u201cI was drinking too much and just giving orders over the backs of people\u2019s shoulders and shit. So I got into a new studio in LA and I basically told the engineer: \u2018Show me how all this shit works and take the month off.\u2019 I went back to doing what I usually do, being by myself in the studio. If it doesn\u2019t start with me, if that\u2019s not the ground floor, then it\u2019s not my record.\u201d He ended up scrapping what he had done and writing new songs, inspired by his divorce, aided by a team of collaborators who, coincidentally, were \u201call kind of going through their own breakups around the same time, so I don\u2019t know if that was subconsciously why we found each other\u201d, including Lykke Li, and King Princess, the hotly tipped singer-songwriter signed to Ronson\u2019s label, Zelig. \u201cMy stuff normally comes from the groove and an interesting bassline, but anything that just had a groove and a bassline but not the kind of sadness to it, it just fell by the wayside.

      "body": "<p>There is a lot of excitement over the release, later this year, of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/13/frozen-2-first-trailer-released-for-disney-sequel\" title=\"\">sequel to Frozen</a>, but in my house, greater anticipation is reserved for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46799623\" title=\"\">Barbie live action movie</a>, due out in 2020, with Margot Robbie in the title role. For the last few years Mattel, Barbie\u2019s makers, have been fighting competition from more modern Disney heroines, and the movie \u2013 in which Barbie is, reportedly, expelled from Barbie world for not being perfect enough \u2013 is part of the brand\u2019s attempt at a feminist rejigging.</p> <p>I was never big into Barbie as a child. She and Ken seemed underpowered compared with my gang of hulking great Sindy dolls and their single beau, Action Man, with his weird felt hair and khaki jeep and switch at the back of his head that actually made his eyes swivel. Sindy has no presence in America, however, and among my daughters\u2019 fourth birthday presents were palaeontologist Barbie and scientist Barbie. They are also committed to a seven-season Barbie animation on Netflix called <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70294800\" title=\"\">Life in the Dreamhouse</a>.</p> <p>It is curious to watch a brand associated to the level of archetype with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/16/barbie-bigger-body-image-fashionista-thin\" title=\"\">reductive representation of women </a>try to resell itself as progressive \u2013 although Barbie has always had a certain amount of feminist window-dressing. In the 1960s, apparently, there was an astronaut Barbie and a surgeon Barbie, although of course they both looked identical to fashion-horse Barbie. Now, after years of Barbie\u2019s proportions being mocked and criticised, there is the option of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/28/curvy-barbie-is-it-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-thigh-gap\" title=\"\">curvy Barbie</a>\u201d, introduced in 2016 along with tall and petite Barbie, and with a fuller figure than the norm. (As my kids recently discovered, skinny Barbie\u2019s clothes don\u2019t fit over curvy Barbie\u2019s bum). Some Barbies have glasses. Last week, Mattel introduced a Barbie in a wheelchair.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jan/14/barbies-turning-60-in-pictures\">Barbie's turning 60 \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tone of Life in the Dreamhouse, meanwhile, is arch, a sort of italicised horror-show in which Ken is a lovable idiot, Barbie is generous and kind and her rival, Rockelle, is a conniving mean girl, forever getting her comeuppance by falling into fountains or having vats of cake frosting spill on her dress. The show winks at the adults watching \u2013 don\u2019t worry, we know the very idea of Barbie is ridiculous! \u2013 while selling to the kids a world in which girls scream and kvetch and throw wardrobe-related fits and demand that everything in their life come in pink. It is Girl World to the extent that the Barbie mansion is entirely self-governing, but all they do with their power is fight over who is the cutest.</p> <p>Oddly, however, I find the kitsch style of Life in the Dreamhouse, and the Barbie range more generally, preferable to the strained sincerity of Frozen with its tedious life lessons. Elsa and her fellow Disney princesses come with you-go-girl messaging as standard, but the vehicle for this message is, as it always was, a figurine with a tiny waist, plunging cleavage and huge eyes, which in doll form looks unavoidably porny. Modern Barbie is over-ironised, perhaps, but after almost 60 years in production, she has the one thing her rivals still lack; a degree of self-awareness that amounts almost to charm.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a lot of excitement over the release, later this year, of the sequel to Frozen, but in my house, greater anticipation is reserved for the Barbie live action movie, due out in 2020, with Margot Robbie in the title role. For the last few years Mattel, Barbie\u2019s makers, have been fighting competition from more modern Disney heroines, and the movie \u2013 in which Barbie is, reportedly, expelled from Barbie world for not being perfect enough \u2013 is part of the brand\u2019s attempt at a feminist rejigging. I was never big into Barbie as a child. She and Ken seemed underpowered compared with my gang of hulking great Sindy dolls and their single beau, Action Man, with his weird felt hair and khaki jeep and switch at the back of his head that actually made his eyes swivel. Sindy has no presence in America, however, and among my daughters\u2019 fourth birthday presents were palaeontologist Barbie and scientist Barbie. They are also committed to a seven-season Barbie animation on Netflix called Life in the Dreamhouse. It is curious to watch a brand associated to the level of archetype with its reductive representation of women try to resell itself as progressive \u2013 although Barbie has always had a certain amount of feminist window-dressing. In the 1960s, apparently, there was an astronaut Barbie and a surgeon Barbie, although of course they both looked identical to fashion-horse Barbie. Now, after years of Barbie\u2019s proportions being mocked and criticised, there is the option of a \u201ccurvy Barbie\u201d, introduced in 2016 along with tall and petite Barbie, and with a fuller figure than the norm. (As my kids recently discovered, skinny Barbie\u2019s clothes don\u2019t fit over curvy Barbie\u2019s bum). Some Barbies have glasses. Last week, Mattel introduced a Barbie in a wheelchair. The tone of Life in the Dreamhouse, meanwhile, is arch, a sort of italicised horror-show in which Ken is a lovable idiot, Barbie is generous and kind and her rival, Rockelle, is a conniving mean girl, forever getting her comeuppance by falling into fountains or having vats of cake frosting spill on her dress. The show winks at the adults watching \u2013 don\u2019t worry, we know the very idea of Barbie is ridiculous! \u2013 while selling to the kids a world in which girls scream and kvetch and throw wardrobe-related fits and demand that everything in their life come in pink. It is Girl World to the extent that the Barbie mansion is entirely self-governing, but all they do with their power is fight over who is the cutest. Oddly, however, I find the kitsch style of Life in the Dreamhouse, and the Barbie range more generally, preferable to the strained sincerity of Frozen with its tedious life lessons. Elsa and her fellow Disney princesses come with you-go-girl messaging as standard, but the vehicle for this message is, as it always was, a figurine with a tiny waist, plunging cleavage and huge eyes, which in doll form looks unavoidably porny. Modern Barbie is over-ironised, perhaps, but after almost 60 years in production, she has the one thing her rivals still lack; a degree of self-awareness that amounts almost to charm. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>When my grandfather was a child, his stepfather would bring him along as he sold moonshine to poor working men in south-west Virginia coal country. The men adored my grandfather, who was not yet even school age, for his talent for mocking Democrats. He told me this story on a few occasions to explain, I think, the inevitability of his later affiliation with the Republican party. He was a Republican in much the same way that I am a Democrat \u2013 voting with little enthusiasm every few years and sometimes not at all.</p> <p>When I consider that story now, I find myself thinking less about my grandfather and more about the men who laughed at his jokes. What were their politics? Not all were the predecessors of today\u2019s Republicans, as we might imagine them to be. In Appalachia, so-called \u201cmountain Republicans\u201d comprised an old vanguard of anti-secessionists, who opposed slavery and the Confederacy. They saw themselves as heirs to the enlightened legacy of Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president. My grandfather belonged (or at least aspired to belong) to that tradition. His audience might have consisted of Democrats, who enjoyed hearing their abuses repeated in the mouth of a child. But it is more likely that they would describe themselves as without politics, just laughing at the powerful and self-important. For a long time, it did not occur to me there were other possibilities.</p> <p>My wider view of politics in Virginia\u2019s coal country changed when I discovered that the publisher of my grandfather\u2019s local community paper, Crawford\u2019s Weekly, was a communist. And not just a communist in print, but a shot-while-inciting-class-war, sabotage-the-New-Deal-from-within, run-for-local-political-office-on-a-platform-of-a-producer\u2019s-republic communist. His name was Bruce Crawford, and when my partner, also from south-west Virginia, discovered his writings, we read them aloud to each other as though they were letters from an eccentric uncle.</p> <p>Our favorite piece of his writing comes from the pages of the New Masses, a US Marxist magazine that flourished between the world wars, where he announced in 1935 that he had killed his own paper because it interfered with his politics. \u201cIt was too radical for its bourgeois customers,\u201d Crawford wrote from Norton, Virginia, \u201cand not radical enough for me. Like capitalism, it was full of contradictions. Hence it could not go on.\u201d The essay, Why I Quit Liberalism, is an exceptional piece of early #quitlit, with the same indulgent qualities. \u201cIf I get shot in the leg again, or go to jail, there won\u2019t be that damned feeling of apology to the respectable,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith the more tangible roots to bourgeois life severed, I hope to know a new and meaningful freedom, whatever the hardships.\u201d</p> <p>Rural spaces are often thought of as places absent of things, from people of colour to modern amenities to radical politics. The truth, as usual, is more complicated. The parents and grandparents of my childhood friends were union organisers; when my grandfather moved to east Tennessee, he went from a world of communist coal miners to the backyard of one of the most important incubators of the civil rights movement, the Highlander Research and Education Center. I now organise with people whose families have fought against economic exploitation for generations. From my vantage point in West Virginia and south-west Virginia, what is old is new again: the revival of a labour movement, the fight against extractive capitalism, the struggle against corporate money in politics and the continuation of women\u2019s grassroots leadership.</p> <p>The question of whether mainstream liberal opinion is shifting further left has been hotly debated in the national press after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> won the primary for New York\u2019s 14th congressional district with grassroots momentum and a socialist-friendly platform. Both conservative and liberal commentators predicted disaster, framing the then 28-year-old rising political star as a gift to Donald Trump. Former Democratic congressman\u2013turned\u2013political pundit Steve Israel warned: \u201cA message that resonates in downtown Brooklyn, New York, could backfire in Brooklyn, Iowa.\u201d Nancy Pelosi waved off the win as a district-specific what-happens-in-the-Bronx-stays-in-the-Bronx phenomenon. A few months later, Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress.</p> <p>Political veterans such as Pelosi and Israel think that the cornerstones of the emerging left platform \u2013 housing as a human right, criminal justice reform, Medicare for all, tuition-free public colleges and trade schools, a federal jobs guarantee, abolition of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for-profit prisons, campaign finance reform and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/07/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-plan\" title=\"\">a Green New Deal</a> \u2013 might perform well in urban centres but not elsewhere.</p> <p>Appalachia has become symbolic of the forces that gave us Donald Trump. After all, his pandering to white racial anxiety did find purchase here. His fantasies to make America great again centre on our dying coal industry. And the region\u2019s conservative voters, who have been profiled endlessly, have been a reliable stand-in for all Trump voters, absorbing the outrage of progressive readers. But what Pelosi and Israel see as common sense and pragmatism can also be interpreted as tired oversimplifications and a failure of imagination.</p> <p>We remain attached, after all, to narratives that have worked very hard to simplify and neatly divide the state of the union: blue cities, red rural areas, a few swing suburbs. \u201cIn a period of political tumult, we grasp for quick certainties,\u201d wrote the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild in Strangers in Their Own Land (2016). Indeed, the biggest gift that the left has given the right since 2016 is not a few avowed socialists but the myth that Trump voters are inscrutable and monolithic. \u201cI love Cleveland, but I\u2019ve always considered it separate from Ohio,\u201d resident Julie Goulis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/09/donald-trump-divided-empire-urban-rural-america-future\" title=\"\">told the Guardian </a>just before the 2017 inauguration. \u201cSome of the soul-searching I\u2019ve been doing after the election has been about how I can understand people outside of my bubble.\u201d</p> <p>It would be far better for progressives to save their bubble-popping for moments such as this, when an opportunity emerges to better understand those closer on the political spectrum in those same spaces. The limbo we are trapped in compels white progressives to attempt to understand Trump voters rather than rural socialists or communists \u2013 or even rural people of colour, who face many of the same struggles as Trump voters, perhaps even more pronounced, and choose a different way forward.</p> <p>Let us get free of that, once and for all. Appalachia should not be seen as a liability to the left, a place that time and progress forgot. The past itself is not a negative asset. The hierarchies and systems of power here feel old because they are, but this legacy also means there are many who are well practiced in the art of survival and resistance. Our present can be reckoned with, and a different future emerge, but the way forward for the left, in my world, is through the past.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Ocasio-Cortez asks if voters are prepared to choose people over money, I hear echoes of a much older question that still resonates in Appalachia: which side are you on? In 1931, when Black Mountain Coal Company cut miners\u2019 wages in Harlan, Kentucky, a long strike ensued. Harlan\u2019s infamously corrupt sheriff, JH Blair, terrorised union families; law enforcement, including the National Guard, intervened on behalf of the interests of coal operators to force miners \u2013 through threats, coercion and violence \u2013 to return to work. When the sheriff and deputised coal company operatives ransacked activist Florence Reece\u2019s home in search of her husband, who helped organise the strike, Reece penned what would become one of history\u2019s most recognisable labour anthems, Which Side Are You On? The song galvanised workers and inspired bystanders to surrender the illusion that one could be impartial in the face of so much oppression. \u201cUs poor folks haven\u2019t got a chance unless we organise,\u201d she sang. \u201cThey say in Harlan County there are no neutrals there.\u201d</p> <p>Reece set her humanity against the plundering coal bosses who controlled every aspect of her family\u2019s life. Striking at the legitimacy of the ruling class, her question became immortal, useful not only to workers but, later, to civil rights activists. Would a candidate with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s platform fail in Appalachia? Perhaps. But people would find themselves animated to hear old questions in a new context, attached to new possibilities. In fact, some already have.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b674592ae5a40a79198b9cf239a01772a3850ac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b674592ae5a40a79198b9cf239a01772a3850ac4/0_247_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rally in Charleston, West Virginia, protesting against low wages and rising living costs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rally in Charleston, West Virginia, protesting against low wages and rising living costs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In late 2016, for example, a young man named Nic Smith, another product of south-west Virginia, made headlines for his participation in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/fight-for-15-meet-the-enfant-terrible-behind-the-battle-for-us-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">#Fightfor15</a> demonstration. Outside a Richmond McDonald\u2019s, Smith, a Waffle House employee, connected the plight of fast-food workers with the past struggles of coal miners in his family. He also pushed back against the Trumpian reactionary politics that elevates white working-class racial anxiety over class solidarity. \u201cAin\u2019t no damn immigrant stole a coal job,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you that right now. And really, even if they did, would you really be blaming the immigrants or the people that hired them? The only reason they would hire an immigrant over an American citizen is if it benefits their wallets.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of rigging a dying industry, Smith explains in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/20/i-make-2-35-an-hour-in-coal-country-i-dont-want-handouts-i-want-a-living-wage\" title=\"\">a Washington Post op-ed</a>, it would be far better to unionise low-wage workers and raise the minimum wage. He joined #Fightfor15, he wrote, because his family \u201chas always understood that we can\u2019t wait for a saviour at the ballot box to shepherd in the change we so desperately need\u201d.</p> <p>A self-described \u201cdamn white trash hillbilly from the holler\u201d, Smith is an exotic figure to the many media outlets that covered him. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9a4az8/this-coal-country-socialist-fights-for-dollar15-v24n4\" title=\"\">Vice complimented him</a> for not fitting \u201cthe image of the typical millennial activist\u201d \u2013 a former factory worker, you see, who \u201cisn\u2019t the kind of Democratic socialist who spouts off at Brooklyn parties about the \u2018means of production\u2019\u201d. Smith\u2019s approach is fairly typical, however, if you are looking from Appalachia rather than New York. Here, activists such as Smith often connect to the struggles of their parents and grandparents as they engage in activism.</p> <p>For decades, this distinct motivation has been at the heart of much of the success that the left has seen elsewhere. Helen Lewis, a beloved Appalachian educator who became an activist in the 1940s, taught poor people economic history to prime them for organising. She began by asking them what their grandparents did for a living, then what their parents did. This strategy inspired generational thinking, and, according to historians Jessica Wilkerson and David P Cline, Lewis\u2019s bottom-up Appalachian Studies \u201cinfluenced a cadre of activists, including grassroots leaders and white civil rights activists who migrated to the mountains to build alliances with rural whites\u201d. Learning about the region\u2019s history, whether through one\u2019s family or formal study, is often a crucial step in helping people understand that their struggles are a new battle in an old war.</p> <p>Brandon Wolford, for example, a teacher from Mingo County, West Virginia, grew up watching news footage of 1980s miners\u2019 strikes that his father participated in. The price of coal had declined, and companies such as the Pittston Coal Company tried to recoup their losses by slashing workers\u2019 wages and benefits. In the case of Pittston, the United Mine Workers of America eventually prevailed, winning back many protections and securing others, although coal\u2019s economic slump made it difficult for organised labour to rebound fully. The memories of those and other labour victories, however, stayed with families. \u201cKnowing the role my father and both grandfathers had played in these events sparked a special interest,\u201d Wolford wrote in 55 Strong: Inside the West Virginia Teachers\u2019 Strike, in 2018. \u201cI wanted to be involved in a movement like that someday.\u201d</p> <p>In February 2018, Wolford joined more than 20,000 West Virginia teachers and public school employees who went on strike to force state leaders to reckon with inflated insurance premiums, low pay and a widespread teacher shortage. The strike closed schools in all 55 counties for nine days and endured even after union support stopped. It ended with a 5% pay raise across the board and a pledge from state leaders to re-examine the state\u2019s public employee insurance agency.</p> <p>The West Virginia teachers\u2019 strike emerged as one of the clearest visions of the new labour movement. It inspired education strikes in other states, including Kentucky and North Carolina. But understanding the strike requires knowing a century of southern West Virginia history, notably its infamous labour uprisings, from the Mine Wars of the 1920s to big coal\u2019s union-busting campaigns of the 1980s. When momentum to strike built in early 2018, teachers in West Virginia\u2019s coal country were among the first to mobilise and put action to a vote. In a Facebook group, they used coal country\u2019s labour history to portray the strike as not only urgent and just, but also natural \u2013 something that people like them had been doing for generations. In a speech at a countywide meeting, Katie Endicott, an English teacher from Mingo County, emphasised the familiarity: \u201cIf we can do this, if we can stand, then we know that our brothers and sisters in Wyoming [County] are not going to let us stand alone. We know that our brothers and sisters in Logan County will not let us stand alone. The south will stand. And if the south stands, the rest of the state will follow our lead.\u201d</p> <p>To create solidarity in the present, to make change for the future, West Virginians needed to remember their radical past. To the extent that collective action requires a public narrative \u2013 a story that helps consolidate its moving parts and moral purpose \u2013 West Virginia\u2019s south played its part exceptionally.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>This past sits uneasily within Joe Manchin\u2019s vision of West Virginia. In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, Manchin, the state\u2019s former governor and second-term Democratic senator, became a favourite of pundits. They predicted that Democrats\u2019 only lifeline would be replicating his limp style of centrist politics. An Atlantic essay titled <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/west-virginia-senate-joe-manchin-trump/537690/\" title=\"\">What Joe Manchin Can Teach Democrats</a> touted Manchin\u2019s utility as \u201ca sounding board for, and bridge between, his party\u2019s leadership and conservative, rural, white voters\u201d. Manchin\u2019s vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court amid allegations of sexual assault did little to dim pundits\u2019 rose-coloured view of the great moderate. Manchin was better than no Democrat at all, they reasoned \u2013 the best West Virginia can do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39c8565a0cf455c9600f379310d92ec36ef9db81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39c8565a0cf455c9600f379310d92ec36ef9db81/0_138_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closed petrol station in Itmann, West Virginia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed petrol station in Itmann, West Virginia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet as writer Aaron Bady, a West Virginia native, counters: \u201cIt\u2019s because I am burdened with a handful of facts about West Virginia \u2013 and a memory that goes back more than two years \u2013 that this kind of analysis stands out as the garbage that it is.\u201d One of these facts is the 1996 gubernatorial race, in which Manchin was outflanked on the left in the Democratic primary by Charlotte Pritt. Pritt\u2019s anti-corporate platform alienated coal industry power players; Manchin, a coal millionaire, convinced a coalition of Democrats to finance and support Pritt\u2019s Republican challenger, Cecil Underwood. For many observers, Manchin\u2019s vengeance went beyond politics: Pritt was a teacher and the daughter of a coal miner, you see; she was a worker and she beat an owner. The 1996 election and Manchin\u2019s later political ascent prove less about the left\u2019s potential in West Virginia than they reflect a common truth: bosses cheat to win.</p> <p>This fact of life has been proven once again by Richard Ojeda, a West Virginia state senator who recently parlayed an unsuccessful bid for Congress into the beginnings of a presidential campaign, one of the first in the Democrats\u2019 2020 field. Ojeda became an outspoken defender of teachers during their strike, and he garnered a lot of attention by reminding West Virginians of their history. \u201cTeachers are joining a fight for the soul and spirit of West Virginia that started hundreds of years ago,\u201d he wrote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VoteOjeda2020/status/967926315268628481\" title=\"\">in a long Twitter thread</a>. \u201cHundreds of years ago, investors came to West Virginia and purchased most of the land for all but nothing. Even today, you will be hard pressed to find many people in WV who own their mineral rights.\u201d</p> <p>His logic is simple: West Virginia\u2019s workers, whether coal miners or teachers, have never benefited from the state\u2019s natural wealth due to greedy corporations and the politicians they buy. Ojeda\u2019s plainspoken, often angry distillations of the state\u2019s woes, and his tender attention to the plight of teachers, grabbed national attention. He was featured as an example of someone who could turn the tide for Democrats in \u201cMiddle American places where their party used to prevail, but has been decimated in the Trump era,\u201d as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/us/politics/richard-ojeda-west-virginia-congress.html\" title=\"\">journalist Trip Gabriel suggests</a>.</p> <p>Ojeda\u2019s willingness to stoke rather than soothe the growing militancy of West Virginia\u2019s rank and file undermines the claim that the state is doomed to centrist Democrats. His success should not be underestimated. But, like Manchin and current governor Jim Justice (a lifelong Republican who got elected as a Democrat only to defect back to the GOP), Ojeda also has a history of straying to the right. Ojeda voted for Trump (a decision he now says he regrets) and has said he might switch teams. Moreover, Ojeda\u2019s evasiveness about the appeal of Trump\u2019s racism among West Virginia voters makes it difficult to embrace him as a unifying leader of the rural left. Indeed, I am reminded of former Republican senator James E Watson\u2019s response to Wendell Willkie when Willkie switched parties, from Democrat to Republican, to run for president in 1940. Asked by Willkie if he believed in the power of conversion, a sceptical Watson replied: \u201cIt\u2019s all right if the town whore joins the church, but they don\u2019t let her lead the choir the first night.\u201d</p> <p>Ojeda\u2019s presidential bid also sends a strong signal that he approves of the media ecosystem that has branded him a novelty. That novelty is dangerous, not least because pundits and political reporters are eager to propagate the idea that to win in places such as West Virginia \u2013 and now, it seems, the nation at large \u2013 the left needs its own version of Trump: a brash populist, prone to macho posturing, with a no-bullshit persona and little time for the rules or party politics.</p> <p>But the more Ojeda\u2019s star rises, the further it departs from its grassroots origins, including a labour movement that is 75% women. In a story announcing Ojeda\u2019s presidential bid, for example, the Intercept initially ran a headline that referred to him as the leader of the teachers\u2019 strike \u2013 not just a vocal supporter. This mistake, although minor and originating from editors and not Ojeda\u2019s team, is reminiscent of the historical erasure of women\u2019s political work in Appalachia, particularly of women such as Pritt who are further to the left of West Virginia\u2019s Democratic establishment. More recently, there was Paula Jean Swearengin, Manchin\u2019s primary challenger and an environmental activist, and Talley Sergent, who performed just as well as Ojeda in the recent midterms without generating a fraction of his national interest.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The 2016 election still looms over us. But if all you know \u2013 or care to know \u2013 about Appalachia are election results, then you miss the potential for change. It might feel natural to assume, for example, that the region is doomed to elect conservative leadership. It might seem smart to point at the \u201cD\u201d beside Joe Manchin\u2019s name and think: \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d There might be some fleeting concession to political diversity, but in a way that makes it the exception rather than the rule \u2013 a spot of blue in Trump Country.</p> <p>If you believe this, then you might find these examples thin: worthy of individual commendation, but not indicative of the potential for radical change. But where you might look for change, I look for continuity, and it is there that I find the future of the left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7fd68b1a3cad3592bfc79fbe72eb1d70b30e1da0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fd68b1a3cad3592bfc79fbe72eb1d70b30e1da0/0_243_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Striking school workers inside the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Striking school workers inside the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It matters that workers are rising up, and it matters that women are leading.

Here, the greatest possible rebuke to the forces that gave us Trump will not be people outside of the region writing sneering columns, and it likely will not start with electoral politics.

The 1% and the working class are not economic descriptors. They\u2019re political accusations. They split society in two, declaring one side the illegitimate ruler of the other; one side the taker of the other\u2019s freedom, power and promise.\u201d</p> <p>This is a language the left knows well in Appalachia and many other rural communities. \u201cThe socialist argument against capitalism,\u201d Robin says, \u201cisn\u2019t that it makes us poor.

How can one look at our economic conditions and who we have helped elect and claim freedom? But then I imagine the power of people who face their suffering head on and still say: \u201cI am free.\u201d There is no need to visit the future to see the truth in that.

      "bodyText": "When my grandfather was a child, his stepfather would bring him along as he sold moonshine to poor working men in south-west Virginia coal country. The men adored my grandfather, who was not yet even school age, for his talent for mocking Democrats. He told me this story on a few occasions to explain, I think, the inevitability of his later affiliation with the Republican party. He was a Republican in much the same way that I am a Democrat \u2013 voting with little enthusiasm every few years and sometimes not at all. When I consider that story now, I find myself thinking less about my grandfather and more about the men who laughed at his jokes. What were their politics? Not all were the predecessors of today\u2019s Republicans, as we might imagine them to be. In Appalachia, so-called \u201cmountain Republicans\u201d comprised an old vanguard of anti-secessionists, who opposed slavery and the Confederacy. They saw themselves as heirs to the enlightened legacy of Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president. My grandfather belonged (or at least aspired to belong) to that tradition. His audience might have consisted of Democrats, who enjoyed hearing their abuses repeated in the mouth of a child. But it is more likely that they would describe themselves as without politics, just laughing at the powerful and self-important. For a long time, it did not occur to me there were other possibilities. My wider view of politics in Virginia\u2019s coal country changed when I discovered that the publisher of my grandfather\u2019s local community paper, Crawford\u2019s Weekly, was a communist. And not just a communist in print, but a shot-while-inciting-class-war, sabotage-the-New-Deal-from-within, run-for-local-political-office-on-a-platform-of-a-producer\u2019s-republic communist. His name was Bruce Crawford, and when my partner, also from south-west Virginia, discovered his writings, we read them aloud to each other as though they were letters from an eccentric uncle. Our favorite piece of his writing comes from the pages of the New Masses, a US Marxist magazine that flourished between the world wars, where he announced in 1935 that he had killed his own paper because it interfered with his politics. \u201cIt was too radical for its bourgeois customers,\u201d Crawford wrote from Norton, Virginia, \u201cand not radical enough for me. Like capitalism, it was full of contradictions. Hence it could not go on.\u201d The essay, Why I Quit Liberalism, is an exceptional piece of early #quitlit, with the same indulgent qualities. \u201cIf I get shot in the leg again, or go to jail, there won\u2019t be that damned feeling of apology to the respectable,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith the more tangible roots to bourgeois life severed, I hope to know a new and meaningful freedom, whatever the hardships.\u201d Rural spaces are often thought of as places absent of things, from people of colour to modern amenities to radical politics. The truth, as usual, is more complicated. The parents and grandparents of my childhood friends were union organisers; when my grandfather moved to east Tennessee, he went from a world of communist coal miners to the backyard of one of the most important incubators of the civil rights movement, the Highlander Research and Education Center. I now organise with people whose families have fought against economic exploitation for generations. From my vantage point in West Virginia and south-west Virginia, what is old is new again: the revival of a labour movement, the fight against extractive capitalism, the struggle against corporate money in politics and the continuation of women\u2019s grassroots leadership. The question of whether mainstream liberal opinion is shifting further left has been hotly debated in the national press after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won the primary for New York\u2019s 14th congressional district with grassroots momentum and a socialist-friendly platform. Both conservative and liberal commentators predicted disaster, framing the then 28-year-old rising political star as a gift to Donald Trump. Former Democratic congressman\u2013turned\u2013political pundit Steve Israel warned: \u201cA message that resonates in downtown Brooklyn, New York, could backfire in Brooklyn, Iowa.\u201d Nancy Pelosi waved off the win as a district-specific what-happens-in-the-Bronx-stays-in-the-Bronx phenomenon. A few months later, Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Political veterans such as Pelosi and Israel think that the cornerstones of the emerging left platform \u2013 housing as a human right, criminal justice reform, Medicare for all, tuition-free public colleges and trade schools, a federal jobs guarantee, abolition of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for-profit prisons, campaign finance reform and a Green New Deal \u2013 might perform well in urban centres but not elsewhere. Appalachia has become symbolic of the forces that gave us Donald Trump. After all, his pandering to white racial anxiety did find purchase here. His fantasies to make America great again centre on our dying coal industry. And the region\u2019s conservative voters, who have been profiled endlessly, have been a reliable stand-in for all Trump voters, absorbing the outrage of progressive readers. But what Pelosi and Israel see as common sense and pragmatism can also be interpreted as tired oversimplifications and a failure of imagination. We remain attached, after all, to narratives that have worked very hard to simplify and neatly divide the state of the union: blue cities, red rural areas, a few swing suburbs. \u201cIn a period of political tumult, we grasp for quick certainties,\u201d wrote the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild in Strangers in Their Own Land (2016). Indeed, the biggest gift that the left has given the right since 2016 is not a few avowed socialists but the myth that Trump voters are inscrutable and monolithic. \u201cI love Cleveland, but I\u2019ve always considered it separate from Ohio,\u201d resident Julie Goulis told the Guardian just before the 2017 inauguration. \u201cSome of the soul-searching I\u2019ve been doing after the election has been about how I can understand people outside of my bubble.\u201d It would be far better for progressives to save their bubble-popping for moments such as this, when an opportunity emerges to better understand those closer on the political spectrum in those same spaces. The limbo we are trapped in compels white progressives to attempt to understand Trump voters rather than rural socialists or communists \u2013 or even rural people of colour, who face many of the same struggles as Trump voters, perhaps even more pronounced, and choose a different way forward. Let us get free of that, once and for all. Appalachia should not be seen as a liability to the left, a place that time and progress forgot. The past itself is not a negative asset. The hierarchies and systems of power here feel old because they are, but this legacy also means there are many who are well practiced in the art of survival and resistance. Our present can be reckoned with, and a different future emerge, but the way forward for the left, in my world, is through the past. * * * When Ocasio-Cortez asks if voters are prepared to choose people over money, I hear echoes of a much older question that still resonates in Appalachia: which side are you on? In 1931, when Black Mountain Coal Company cut miners\u2019 wages in Harlan, Kentucky, a long strike ensued. Harlan\u2019s infamously corrupt sheriff, JH Blair, terrorised union families; law enforcement, including the National Guard, intervened on behalf of the interests of coal operators to force miners \u2013 through threats, coercion and violence \u2013 to return to work. When the sheriff and deputised coal company operatives ransacked activist Florence Reece\u2019s home in search of her husband, who helped organise the strike, Reece penned what would become one of history\u2019s most recognisable labour anthems, Which Side Are You On? The song galvanised workers and inspired bystanders to surrender the illusion that one could be impartial in the face of so much oppression. \u201cUs poor folks haven\u2019t got a chance unless we organise,\u201d she sang. \u201cThey say in Harlan County there are no neutrals there.\u201d Reece set her humanity against the plundering coal bosses who controlled every aspect of her family\u2019s life. Striking at the legitimacy of the ruling class, her question became immortal, useful not only to workers but, later, to civil rights activists. Would a candidate with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s platform fail in Appalachia? Perhaps. But people would find themselves animated to hear old questions in a new context, attached to new possibilities. In fact, some already have. In late 2016, for example, a young man named Nic Smith, another product of south-west Virginia, made headlines for his participation in a #Fightfor15 demonstration. Outside a Richmond McDonald\u2019s, Smith, a Waffle House employee, connected the plight of fast-food workers with the past struggles of coal miners in his family. He also pushed back against the Trumpian reactionary politics that elevates white working-class racial anxiety over class solidarity. \u201cAin\u2019t no damn immigrant stole a coal job,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you that right now. And really, even if they did, would you really be blaming the immigrants or the people that hired them? The only reason they would hire an immigrant over an American citizen is if it benefits their wallets.\u201d Instead of rigging a dying industry, Smith explains in a Washington Post op-ed, it would be far better to unionise low-wage workers and raise the minimum wage. He joined #Fightfor15, he wrote, because his family \u201chas always understood that we can\u2019t wait for a saviour at the ballot box to shepherd in the change we so desperately need\u201d. A self-described \u201cdamn white trash hillbilly from the holler\u201d, Smith is an exotic figure to the many media outlets that covered him. Vice complimented him for not fitting \u201cthe image of the typical millennial activist\u201d \u2013 a former factory worker, you see, who \u201cisn\u2019t the kind of Democratic socialist who spouts off at Brooklyn parties about the \u2018means of production\u2019\u201d. Smith\u2019s approach is fairly typical, however, if you are looking from Appalachia rather than New York. Here, activists such as Smith often connect to the struggles of their parents and grandparents as they engage in activism. For decades, this distinct motivation has been at the heart of much of the success that the left has seen elsewhere. Helen Lewis, a beloved Appalachian educator who became an activist in the 1940s, taught poor people economic history to prime them for organising. She began by asking them what their grandparents did for a living, then what their parents did. This strategy inspired generational thinking, and, according to historians Jessica Wilkerson and David P Cline, Lewis\u2019s bottom-up Appalachian Studies \u201cinfluenced a cadre of activists, including grassroots leaders and white civil rights activists who migrated to the mountains to build alliances with rural whites\u201d. Learning about the region\u2019s history, whether through one\u2019s family or formal study, is often a crucial step in helping people understand that their struggles are a new battle in an old war. Brandon Wolford, for example, a teacher from Mingo County, West Virginia, grew up watching news footage of 1980s miners\u2019 strikes that his father participated in. The price of coal had declined, and companies such as the Pittston Coal Company tried to recoup their losses by slashing workers\u2019 wages and benefits. In the case of Pittston, the United Mine Workers of America eventually prevailed, winning back many protections and securing others, although coal\u2019s economic slump made it difficult for organised labour to rebound fully. The memories of those and other labour victories, however, stayed with families. \u201cKnowing the role my father and both grandfathers had played in these events sparked a special interest,\u201d Wolford wrote in 55 Strong: Inside the West Virginia Teachers\u2019 Strike, in 2018. \u201cI wanted to be involved in a movement like that someday.\u201d In February 2018, Wolford joined more than 20,000 West Virginia teachers and public school employees who went on strike to force state leaders to reckon with inflated insurance premiums, low pay and a widespread teacher shortage. The strike closed schools in all 55 counties for nine days and endured even after union support stopped. It ended with a 5% pay raise across the board and a pledge from state leaders to re-examine the state\u2019s public employee insurance agency. The West Virginia teachers\u2019 strike emerged as one of the clearest visions of the new labour movement. It inspired education strikes in other states, including Kentucky and North Carolina. But understanding the strike requires knowing a century of southern West Virginia history, notably its infamous labour uprisings, from the Mine Wars of the 1920s to big coal\u2019s union-busting campaigns of the 1980s. When momentum to strike built in early 2018, teachers in West Virginia\u2019s coal country were among the first to mobilise and put action to a vote. In a Facebook group, they used coal country\u2019s labour history to portray the strike as not only urgent and just, but also natural \u2013 something that people like them had been doing for generations. In a speech at a countywide meeting, Katie Endicott, an English teacher from Mingo County, emphasised the familiarity: \u201cIf we can do this, if we can stand, then we know that our brothers and sisters in Wyoming [County] are not going to let us stand alone. We know that our brothers and sisters in Logan County will not let us stand alone. The south will stand. And if the south stands, the rest of the state will follow our lead.\u201d To create solidarity in the present, to make change for the future, West Virginians needed to remember their radical past. To the extent that collective action requires a public narrative \u2013 a story that helps consolidate its moving parts and moral purpose \u2013 West Virginia\u2019s south played its part exceptionally. * * * This past sits uneasily within Joe Manchin\u2019s vision of West Virginia. In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, Manchin, the state\u2019s former governor and second-term Democratic senator, became a favourite of pundits. They predicted that Democrats\u2019 only lifeline would be replicating his limp style of centrist politics. An Atlantic essay titled What Joe Manchin Can Teach Democrats touted Manchin\u2019s utility as \u201ca sounding board for, and bridge between, his party\u2019s leadership and conservative, rural, white voters\u201d. Manchin\u2019s vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court amid allegations of sexual assault did little to dim pundits\u2019 rose-coloured view of the great moderate. Manchin was better than no Democrat at all, they reasoned \u2013 the best West Virginia can do. Yet as writer Aaron Bady, a West Virginia native, counters: \u201cIt\u2019s because I am burdened with a handful of facts about West Virginia \u2013 and a memory that goes back more than two years \u2013 that this kind of analysis stands out as the garbage that it is.\u201d One of these facts is the 1996 gubernatorial race, in which Manchin was outflanked on the left in the Democratic primary by Charlotte Pritt. Pritt\u2019s anti-corporate platform alienated coal industry power players; Manchin, a coal millionaire, convinced a coalition of Democrats to finance and support Pritt\u2019s Republican challenger, Cecil Underwood. For many observers, Manchin\u2019s vengeance went beyond politics: Pritt was a teacher and the daughter of a coal miner, you see; she was a worker and she beat an owner. The 1996 election and Manchin\u2019s later political ascent prove less about the left\u2019s potential in West Virginia than they reflect a common truth: bosses cheat to win. This fact of life has been proven once again by Richard Ojeda, a West Virginia state senator who recently parlayed an unsuccessful bid for Congress into the beginnings of a presidential campaign, one of the first in the Democrats\u2019 2020 field. Ojeda became an outspoken defender of teachers during their strike, and he garnered a lot of attention by reminding West Virginians of their history. \u201cTeachers are joining a fight for the soul and spirit of West Virginia that started hundreds of years ago,\u201d he wrote in a long Twitter thread. \u201cHundreds of years ago, investors came to West Virginia and purchased most of the land for all but nothing. Even today, you will be hard pressed to find many people in WV who own their mineral rights.\u201d His logic is simple: West Virginia\u2019s workers, whether coal miners or teachers, have never benefited from the state\u2019s natural wealth due to greedy corporations and the politicians they buy. Ojeda\u2019s plainspoken, often angry distillations of the state\u2019s woes, and his tender attention to the plight of teachers, grabbed national attention. He was featured as an example of someone who could turn the tide for Democrats in \u201cMiddle American places where their party used to prevail, but has been decimated in the Trump era,\u201d as journalist Trip Gabriel suggests. Ojeda\u2019s willingness to stoke rather than soothe the growing militancy of West Virginia\u2019s rank and file undermines the claim that the state is doomed to centrist Democrats. His success should not be underestimated. But, like Manchin and current governor Jim Justice (a lifelong Republican who got elected as a Democrat only to defect back to the GOP), Ojeda also has a history of straying to the right. Ojeda voted for Trump (a decision he now says he regrets) and has said he might switch teams. Moreover, Ojeda\u2019s evasiveness about the appeal of Trump\u2019s racism among West Virginia voters makes it difficult to embrace him as a unifying leader of the rural left. Indeed, I am reminded of former Republican senator James E Watson\u2019s response to Wendell Willkie when Willkie switched parties, from Democrat to Republican, to run for president in 1940. Asked by Willkie if he believed in the power of conversion, a sceptical Watson replied: \u201cIt\u2019s all right if the town whore joins the church, but they don\u2019t let her lead the choir the first night.\u201d Ojeda\u2019s presidential bid also sends a strong signal that he approves of the media ecosystem that has branded him a novelty. That novelty is dangerous, not least because pundits and political reporters are eager to propagate the idea that to win in places such as West Virginia \u2013 and now, it seems, the nation at large \u2013 the left needs its own version of Trump: a brash populist, prone to macho posturing, with a no-bullshit persona and little time for the rules or party politics. But the more Ojeda\u2019s star rises, the further it departs from its grassroots origins, including a labour movement that is 75% women. In a story announcing Ojeda\u2019s presidential bid, for example, the Intercept initially ran a headline that referred to him as the leader of the teachers\u2019 strike \u2013 not just a vocal supporter. This mistake, although minor and originating from editors and not Ojeda\u2019s team, is reminiscent of the historical erasure of women\u2019s political work in Appalachia, particularly of women such as Pritt who are further to the left of West Virginia\u2019s Democratic establishment. More recently, there was Paula Jean Swearengin, Manchin\u2019s primary challenger and an environmental activist, and Talley Sergent, who performed just as well as Ojeda in the recent midterms without generating a fraction of his national interest. * * * The 2016 election still looms over us. But if all you know \u2013 or care to know \u2013 about Appalachia are election results, then you miss the potential for change. It might feel natural to assume, for example, that the region is doomed to elect conservative leadership. It might seem smart to point at the \u201cD\u201d beside Joe Manchin\u2019s name and think: \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d There might be some fleeting concession to political diversity, but in a way that makes it the exception rather than the rule \u2013 a spot of blue in Trump Country. If you believe this, then you might find these examples thin: worthy of individual commendation, but not indicative of the potential for radical change. But where you might look for change, I look for continuity, and it is there that I find the future of the left. It matters that workers are rising up, and it matters that women are leading. It matters that the fight against extractive capitalism is fiercer than ever. And for all of these actions, it matters that the reasoning is not simply, \u201cthis is what is right\u201d, but also, \u201cthis is what we do\u201d. That reclamation of identity is powerful. Here, the greatest possible rebuke to the forces that gave us Trump will not be people outside of the region writing sneering columns, and it likely will not start with electoral politics. It will come from ordinary people who turn to their neighbours, relatives, and friends and ask, through their actions: \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d \u201cListen to today\u2019s socialists,\u201d the political scientist Corey Robin writes, \u201cand you\u2019ll hear less the language of poverty than of power. Mr Sanders invokes the 1%. Ms Ocasio-Cortez speaks to and for the \u2018working class\u2019 \u2013 not \u2018working people\u2019 or \u2018working families\u2019, homey phrases meant to soften and soothe. The 1% and the working class are not economic descriptors. They\u2019re political accusations. They split society in two, declaring one side the illegitimate ruler of the other; one side the taker of the other\u2019s freedom, power and promise.\u201d This is a language the left knows well in Appalachia and many other rural communities. \u201cThe socialist argument against capitalism,\u201d Robin says, \u201cisn\u2019t that it makes us poor. It\u2019s that it makes us unfree.\u201d Indeed, the state motto of West Virginia is montani semper liberi: mountaineers are always free. It was adopted in 1863 to mark West Virginia\u2019s secession from Virginia, a victory that meant these new citizens would not fight a rich man\u2019s war. There are moments when that freedom feels, to me, unearned. How can one look at our economic conditions and who we have helped elect and claim freedom? But then I imagine the power of people who face their suffering head on and still say: \u201cI am free.\u201d There is no need to visit the future to see the truth in that. There is freedom in fighting old battles because it means that the other side has not won.

Words used by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to describe Bishop in the wake of the announcement include \u201celegant\u201d. Current prime minister Scott Morrison described her \u201cgrace\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald ran a headline on the resignation that began \u201cPerfectly poised, Julie Bishop quits politics\u201d. Sigh. Bishop\u2019s Liberal pedigree was a law degree from the University of Adelaide that she deployed at one time defending corporations against compensation claims from dying asbestos victims.

Type the words into Google and you\u2019ll get sold a chandelier. For months we\u2019ve been discussing the Liberals\u2019 \u201cwoman problem\u201d, the dwindling numbers of women in their parliamentary ranks, their collapsed appeal among female voters \u2013 only 38% of whom now express a preference for this party. When Bishop\u2019s leadership bid failed, she returned to the backbench. Her sudden low profile revealed how much her party had made of her previous visibility to camouflage the extent of their institutional sexism. She claimed feminism was \u201cnot particularly useful\u201d to her, decried the existence of a glass ceiling and railed against the quotas that\u2019ve brought her Labor rivals to within a whisker of gender parity. Who gained but her party\u2019s male-dominated establishment when Julie Bishop advised girls to \u201cstop whinging, get on with it\u201d? It was to the great convenience of the men who ended her ambitions that rather than build internal party numbers, Bishop instead invested in a belief that the decorative red shoe emoji \u201cwas a statement of women\u2019s empowerment\u201d. Note that Morrison \u2013 who defeated her in the leadership contest \u2013 said yesterday: \u201cHer successor will have big shoes to fill and we all know Julie has the best shoes in the parliament.\u201d The hagiography around the resignation insisting that Julie Bishop was a trailblazer inspires despair for affirming that the success of a trail is relative to the wilderness you find yourself in; yes, no woman in the Liberal party has had the career Bishop has had. The \u201cwoman problem\u201d of the Liberals \u2013 and their Coalition colleagues, the Nationals \u2013 remains intrinsic to the parties\u2019 culture and identity. Because what kind of trail is Bishop\u2019s for any Liberal or conservative woman to follow; just have a look where it leads. There are but 21 women federal parliamentarians remaining on the Coalition\u2019s website \u2013 of these, several have announced resignations, two have been diminished by scandal, others preselected to unwinnable positions, others facing impossible battles in marginal seats. Some senators may survive \u2013 but senators cannot be prime ministers, or treasurers. I\u2019ve written before about how for rightwing women \u201ccomplying with that structure of power \u2026 is the activity of structurally reinforcing powerlessness.\u201d The Bishop saga demonstrates this sadly, and too well. But what the events in federal parliament this week have shown is just how lonely the political journey is for these women, too. The Coalition government\u2019s minister for women, Liberal Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, has also resigned from parliament and gave her official valediction a couple of days ago. Her own party\u2019s benches were conspicuously sparse an audience to her speech.",

      "bodyText": "Nine has said it will appeal against a court order to pay $280,000 in damages to Chinese businessman Chau Chak Wing, after a federal court judge ruled that a 2015 Sydney Morning Herald article linking him to a US bribery case was defamatory. Less than an hour after Justice Michael Wigney ruled on Friday that the article, written by journalist John Garnaut, had used \u201cimprecise and loose\u201d language in a way that was \u201cderisive\u201d of Chau, the Herald\u2019s new owner said it would appeal. \u201cWe are disappointed that the judge did not uphold our public interest defence, which was the only one available to us under Australian defamation law, and was not persuaded by our evidence,\u201d a spokesman for the group said in a statement. \u201cJohn Garnaut is a careful, meticulous, Walkley award-winning journalist who is globally recognised for his China expertise. \u201cWithin the current defamation regime, both the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age remain committed to the role of public interest journalism. We source and check all our stories vigorously and take great pride in our role to inform the community debate.\u201d Chau had brought the defamation proceedings against the Sydney Morning Herald over an online article titled \u201cAre Chau Chak Wing\u2019s circles of influence in Australia-China ties built on hot air?\u201d, published on 16 October 2015. Published shortly after US prosecutors accused Chinese-Australian woman Sheri Yan and her finance chief Heidi Park of arranging a $US200,000 bribe for former UN general assembly president John Ashe in 2013, Garnaut\u2019s article said Chau was an unindicted co-conspirator identified in US court documents by the pseudonym CC-3. During the trial, Chau\u2019s barrister, Bruce McClintock SC, did not dispute whether Chau was CC-3, but argued that the Herald had gone further in its article and wrongly asserted that he was guilty of an offence. Chau claimed the article defamed him by falsely suggesting he bribed Ashe and participated in a conspiracy to bribe. The other imputations were that Chau acted in so seriously wrong a manner as to deserve extradition to the US on criminal charges and that he created his Australian business empire by making illicit payments to government officials. Fairfax Media, the owner of the Herald at the time, and Garnaut denied the article insinuated \u201cactual guilt\u201d, saying it suggested he was \u201csuspected\u201d of being involved in the UN scandal, and contended the publication was reasonable. If Wigney did find it conveyed those imputations, it sought to plead the qualified privilege defence, which requires a media outlet to show the defamatory article was of public interest and that it acted reasonably in publishing it. On Friday, Wigney ruled in Chau\u2019s favour on all but the last imputation, and dismissed the Herald\u2019s qualified privilege defence. In the summary judgment read out in the courtroom, the judge said the article had gone \u201cwell beyond\u201d merely imputing suspicion by \u201ca combination of disparagement, insinuation and suggestion\u201d which had \u201ceffectively imputed guilt\u201d. Wigney said the \u201cgeneral tone and tenor\u201d of the article was \u201crather derisive and disparaging if not at times sneering and contemptuous\u201d of Chau, and that it used \u201csensational and hyperbolic language\u201d and included \u201cgratuitous barbs\u201d. A reference in the article to a $70m Vaucluse mansion Chau bought from James Packer contained an \u201cimplicit insertion\u201d that he was implicated in a bribery, Wigney said, because it stated Chau might never live there but instead \u201cbunker down in China\u201d. The judge said denials from Chau included in the article were \u201cundermined\u201d by being \u201cdisaggregated\u201d throughout the text and a general tone of \u201cincredulity\u201d, which was likely to cause an ordinary, reasonable reader to be \u201cdismissive\u201d and \u201csceptical\u201d. He dismissed the defence of qualified privilege, saying he was not convinced the Herald\u2019s conduct was \u201creasonable under the circumstances\u201d in part because of the suggestion Chau might remain in China to avoid extradition despite not having been charged with any offence. After the judgment, the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Andrew Hastie, released a statement saying the judgment would \u201cbe carefully analysed\u201d. \u201cGenerally speaking, we are concerned about the impact that defamation laws in Australia are having on responsible journalism that informs Australians about important national security issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to report freely and fairly on national security is a vital part of our democracy. Australia\u2019s democratic institutions \u2013 including our free media \u2013 must be protected. We take this responsibility very seriously and will continue to work as a committee to uphold Australian sovereignty and interests.\u201d",

Leo Varadkar\u2019s government is due on Friday to publish a mammoth omnibus bill incorporating 16 pieces of legislation to try to shelter Ireland from the doomsday scenario of the UK crashing out of the EU. The parliamentary marathon in Dublin will begin amid increasingly fraught warnings of a hammer blow to agriculture, food processing, transport and other industries. Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, told the D\u00e1il on Thursday that the European commission would bail out Ireland\u2019s beef industry in the event of a trade war with Britain. Brussels recognised the sector\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d and would \u201csupport and protect\u201d it, he said. Coveney spoke in the wake of reports that Britain envisaged World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs plus a system of \u201ctariff rate quotas\u201d for some food imports, which would favour big producers such as Brazil at Ireland\u2019s expense. \u201cThis would be nothing short of a catastrophe for our beef industry and would have a devastating effect on farmers the length and breadth of this country,\u201d said Lisa Chambers, Brexit spokeswoman for the main opposition party, Fianna F\u00e1il.

Some suspect the UK government is intentionally raising the stakes for Ireland in hope that Dublin will soften its insistence on the Irish backstop and let the EU agree a compromise Brexit deal that Theresa May can bring to Westminster. \u201cThe British plan ... echoes tactics used against the government of \u00c9amon de Valera during the Anglo-Irish trade war of the 1930s,\u201d the Irish Independent reported.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s policy of deporting New Zealand citizens with criminal records has become \u201ccorrosive\u201d to the relationship between the two traditional allies, Jacinda Ardern has said, in her strongest warning yet to Scott Morrison. The Australian prime minister arrived in Auckland on Friday morning for a brief official meeting with Ardern and New Zealand officials, forgoing the traditional weekend stay prime ministers of both countries usually bestow upon each other. Since 2014, more than 4,000 people have been stripped of their Australian visa and returned to their country of birth, regardless of how long ago they left. New Zealand-born Australians have made up the vast bulk of the deportations. In a joint statement the two prime ministers \u201cacknowledged the importance of the sensitive management of visa cancellation decisions, appeals and removals of New Zealand citizens who have been convicted of crimes in Australia, and committed to continue working together\u201d. But minutes later Ardern spoke far more plainly at the pair\u2019s joint press conference, using strong language rarely directed at Australia. \u201cIn my view, this issue has become corrosive in a relationship over time,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that New Zealand has no issue with Australia taking a dim view of newly arrived non-citizens committing crimes \u2026 but equally, the New Zealand people have a dim view of the deportation of people who move to Australia as children and have grown up there.\u201d Morrison told the media Australia had \u201cvery well-defined immigration and citizenship laws\u201d and his government had \u201ctaken a very strong line\u201d on it. \u201cVisas are not citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cVisas are provided on the basis of people being compliant with those visas, and that doesn\u2019t include committing crimes. \u201cAnd so we take a very strong view about this. It is a view that is not restricted to New Zealand, I should stress \u2026 this is not targeted at New Zealand in any way, shape or form.\u201d The 2014 changes to Australian law mandated the automatic cancellation of a visa for anyone sentenced to 12 months or more in jail. Some of those deported have had extensive criminal histories in Australia, but no link to New Zealand beyond citizenship. Some have no family or other connections in New Zealand. Last month dozens of New Zealanders held in Australian detention centres embarked on a mass hunger strike, and begged Ardern to intervene on their behalf, with some having been detained for months or even years in remote centres hundreds of kilometres from their families. This week it was revealed that an Indigenous Australian man who was born in New Zealand when his parents were visiting, but had no ties to the country, was to be deported. The Australian government is attempting to expand its deportation powers even further to include non-citizens, including minors, who are convicted of an offence that carries a maximum sentence of two years, no matter their own sentence. Labor has said it will oppose the bill, as it potentially allows for a child convicted of shoplifting to be deported. New Zealand maintains that only people with \u201cgenuine links\u201d to the country should be deported. Earlier on Friday a spokesperson for Ardern denied a report in the Australian newspaper that said New Zealand was unwilling to accept single, male asylum seekers from Nauru and Manus Island, and said the offer to resettle 150 asylum seekers remained active. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 March 2019.

      "bodyText": "Warren Mundine will step down \u2013 over a perceived conflict of interest \u2013 as chairman of a company that has been awarded government contracts to deliver Indigenous employment services. Labor has called for a full accounting of all government grants provided to Mundine and any business he is involved in, after the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet confirmed it awarded $320,000 over two years to help produce Mundine\u2019s Sky News television show. The company, RISE Ventures, is contracted to provide services to the community development program (CDP) in six regions and was tentatively awarded new three-year contracts in December, in a joint venture with local Indigenous businesses. The Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, signed off on the renewed contracts in December, about six weeks before Mundine, a former federal secretary of the Labor party, was named as the Liberal candidate for the federal seat of Gilmore, on the New South Wales south coast. Scullion told Senate estimates on Friday he had received \u201cverbal advice\u201d that Mundine would step down as chairman before the writs were issued. An hour later, that advice was confirmed in the form of a note delivered to the associate secretary of Indigenous affairs, Ray Griggs, who said Mundine \u201cwill be resigning from his position on Rise on Monday\u201d. The Labor senator Jenny McAllister criticised the department for not directly asking Mundine about his plans to resign before Friday, saying that continuing to negotiate aspects of the CDP contracts while Mundine remained chairman of the company created a perceived conflict of interest. Mundine\u2019s resignation risks the company being ineligible for the contract, which stipulates that providers must have a minimum 50% Indigenous ownership. RISE is 50-50 owned. McAllister said the decision not to place negotiations on hold until the issue was resolved created a perception that RISE was being given additional leeway. \u201cIn light of the fact that the person involved is a senior Liberal party operative since January, there is a problem.\u201d Griggs agreed there was an \u201cabsolute perception of conflict of interest; whether it\u2019s a real conflict is another matter\u201d. McAllister also criticised the decision to award Mundine $320,000 to produce two seasons of his television show, Mundine Means Business, on Sky News. The department said in estimates that Mundine was awarded a $300,000 contract (excluding GST) in 2017, split between $200,000 in consultancy fees on Indigenous business policy and $100,000 to establish the television show, after he approached Scullion\u2019s office with the proposal. Scullion said he did not discuss the issue with Mundine. In 2018, Mundine was awarded a grant of $220,000 to continue what Scullion described as his \u201cvery successful television show\u201d. He was unable to quantify its success, saying that was a \u201cdifficult question to answer\u201d but the department \u201cmade a decision\u201d that it was successful. \u201cWas there an evaluation made of the effectiveness of this blockbuster performance by Mr Mundine on Sky?\u201d Labor senator Pat Dodson asked. \u201cWere you able to say that as a consequence of the performance tonight there are 10 new businesses?\u201d McAllister asked if any other Aboriginal person had been given the opportunity to apply for funding to create a television program. Scullion replied, \u201cI suspect not.\u201d McAllister said: \u201cA person who was known to be very close to the prime minister, is sitting on the prime minister\u2019s Indigenous Advisory Council, receives a direct grant that no one else was able to apply for to have a television program to raise his public profile, and then that person is a candidate for the Liberal party. \u201cCan you see the problem? \u201cThere are other high profile, very successful, very intelligent Indigenous people and none of those people were given money to have a program on television.\u201d Scullion said there was no connection between Mundine\u2019s later decision to run for the Liberal party and the awarding of the funds.",

      "bodyText": "The government has \u201cno basis to believe that there is a ban on Australian coal exports into China\u201d, the trade minister has said, but it has import quotas which Australia expects will be applied to all countries. Simon Birmingham told reporters on Friday he was working with the embassy in Beijing to understand how restrictions were being applied to coal shipments, but he said there was no evidence to suggest the measures were targeted at Australia. He said it was unhelpful for people to speculate that tensions in the Australia/China relationship were behind the import quotas, insisting the relationship between Canberra and Beijing was strong, and \u201cour ability to work through these issues is strong\u201d. Birmingham pointed to previous occasions when trade in various commodities had slowed and then recovered. Earlier on Friday, Scott Morrison told reporters he was not \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d over the reported ban. The prime minister, in New Zealand for bilateral talks with his counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, said local ports made their own decisions about such matters. \u201cI think people should be careful about leaping to conclusions about this,\u201d he told reporters in Auckland. \u201cWe will, of course, continue to engage with those local ports and those authorities and work through the same regulatory issues that we have worked through in the past.\u201d On Friday morning, the Australian dollar was trading more than one percentage point down from Thursday after Reuters reported that one of China\u2019s biggest ports had banned imports of Australian coal and would cap overall coal imports for 2019. Citing an unnamed official, the Reuters report said five harbours overseen by Dalian customs \u2013 Dalian, Bayuquan, Panjin, Dandong and Beiliang \u2013 would no longer allow Australian coal to be cleared. China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, and coal is the latter\u2019s biggest export commodity. No reason has been given for the apparent ban. Pressed on Friday as to whether the restrictions were targeted at Australia, or whether they were the result of diplomatic tension between the two countries, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman said only that customs assessed \u201cthe safety and quality of imported coal\u201d to \u201csafeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese importers and protect the environment\u201d. The news follows the Australian government\u2019s decision this month to cancel the visa of prominent Chinese businessman Huang Xiangmo and the banning in August last year of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies from supplying equipment to Australia\u2019s 5G broadband network. On Thursday, the China Daily published an editorial condemning LNP senator Barry O\u2019Sullivan, who made an offensive remark about Chinese people breaching biosecurity rules during a parliamentary committee meeting this week. The paper\u2019s editorial said it \u201creflects an ugly side of Australia\u2019s political culture\u201d and accused the government of fanning xenophobia. The editorial also explicitly mentioned the Huawei ban, saying Australia was putting its relationship with China at risk. \u201cAustralia\u2019s decision to block Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from supplying equipment to its 5G broadband network, and allusions by some Australian media and politicians that China is the \u2018state actor\u2019 behind the recent hacking of the networks of Australia\u2019s major political parties indicate how closely Canberra is trying to toe the line set by Washington, even at the cost of its relations with China,\u201d the editorial stated. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is playing down the saga saying Australia\u2019s export relationship with China was based on \u201cmutual benefit\u201d. \u201cThe two-way trading relationship between Australia and China is important and strong, and it is in Australia\u2019s long-term national interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the volume and the value of our coal exports to China and in the last quarter of 2018, it was higher in the same period last year and the coal exports underpin more than 50,000 jobs and $60bn of exports, so they will continue to be strong and robust.\u201d Reuters said in its report that imports from Russia and Indonesia would not be affected by the change, leading to speculation the decision could be tied to diplomatic tensions between Australia and China. But Frydenberg said the coal decision was not necessarily linked. The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, sought to calm markets, telling a parliamentary hearing in Sydney that he did not expect the ban to have a \u201cdramatic effect\u201d on the economy. While conceding it would be \u201cconcerning\u201d if the decision were a sign of a \u201cdeterioration in the underlying political relationship\u201d Lowe said it was also possible the decision was made on environment grounds or as a way of boosting domestic coal prices in China. \u201cI think we still have to wait and see what the underlying issues are,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t jump yet to the conclusion that this is something linked to Australia.\u201d Lowe\u2019s comments marry with those made by Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, who said the ban was made on environmental grounds and described it as \u201ccompletely normal\u201d. \u201cChina\u2019s customs assesses the safety and quality of imported coal, analyses possible risks, and conducts corresponding examination and inspection compliant with laws and regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cBy doing so, it can better safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese importers and protect the environment.\u201d On Thursday night, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official Graham Fletcher told a Senate estimates hearing his department was urgently seeking clarification from Chinese officials. \u201cWe should be in a better position by this time tomorrow because the Chinese realise that this is a very significant issue and they probably don\u2019t want to see it on the front pages any more than we do.

Pyongyang has told the United Nations that it is facing a shortfall of 1.4 million tons in food production this year, including crops of rice, wheat, potato and soybean. The UN estimates that 10.3 million people \u2013 almost half of North Korea\u2019s population \u2013 are in need of food due to a sharp drop in crop production. It estimates that 40% of people in the country are undernourished. \u201cThe government has requested assistance from international humanitarian organizations present in the country to address the impact of the food security situation,\u201d said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric. UN agencies are holding talks with Pyongyang \u201cto take early action in order to address humanitarian needs,\u201d he said. In a memo to the UN, the communist regime called on international organisations \u201cto urgently respond to addressing the food situation\u201d. It said food production last year was 4.951m tons, 503,000 tons down on 2017. The UN confirmed these figures as official government data provided at the end of January. North Korea said it would import 200,000 tons of food and produce about 400,000 tons of early crops, but that it would still be left with a gap and from January would cut daily rations to 300g (10.5 ounces) per person from 550g. The release of the undated two-page memo by the North Korean mission to the UN comes ahead of a second summit next week between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Washington has been demanding that North Korea give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States, while the communist regime has been seeking a lifting of punishing sanctions, a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war and security guarantees. The 15-member UN security council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",

The Hayabusa 2 probe touched down on the asteroid Ryugu at around 11:30pm GMT on Thursday. Data from the probe showed changes in speed and direction, indicating it had reached the asteroid\u2019s surface, according to officials from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). A live webcast of the control room showed dozens of JAXA staff members nervously monitoring data ahead of the touchdown before exploding into applause after receiving a signal from Hayabusa2 that it had landed. \u201cWe made a successful touchdown, including firing a bullet\u201d into the Ryugu asteroid, Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa 2 project manager, told reporters. \u201cWe made the ideal touchdown in the best conditions,\u201d he said. JAXA spokeswoman Chisato Ikuta said the control centre had \u201creceived data that shows that the probe is working normally and is healthy.\u201d Scientists are continuing to gather and analyse data from the probe, she said. The probe was due to fire a bullet at the Ryugu asteroid, to stir up surface matter, which it will then collect for analysis back on Earth.

He said the firing of the bullet - the first of three planned in this mission - \u201cwill lead to a leap, or new discoveries, in planetary science.\u201d The spacecraft is seeking to gather 10g of the dislodged debris with an instrument named the Sampler Horn that hangs from its underbelly. Whatever material is collected by the spacecraft will be stored onboard until Hayabusa 2 reaches its landing site in Woomera, South Australia, in 2020 after a journey of more than three billion miles.

They are only the first wave of co-chairs to be announced and more are expected soon. </p> <p>Collectively the co-chairs represent an effort by the campaign to build a diverse operation, in light of Sanders difficulty attracting minority voters in 2016 and recent revelations of sexual harassment by former female staffers on his first presidential campaign. </p> <p>Sanders, who launched his campaign for president on Tuesday, hired Faiz Shakir, the former political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, to be the campaign manager. The former aide to Harry Reid is the first Muslim campaign manager for a major party candidate in presidential history. </p> <p>Khanna has built his profile as a progressive voice in the House, working with Sanders on the campaign to raise the minimum wage for Amazon workers and on legislation to end US-support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Re-elected to a second term in 2018, Khanna has spent a significant portion of his time outside his blue district, pushing big tech investment in parts of the Midwest and Appalachia.</p> <p>\u201cEvery 50 years, there is someone who can fundamentally alter the course of American politics,\u201d Khanna said in a statement. \u201cBernie Sanders has the chance to reorient our economic policy towards workers and communities left behind instead of corporate interests and to reorient our foreign policy to prioritize peace, diplomacy and restraint instead of war.\u201d </p> <p>Cruz met with Sanders during his visit to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria left residents without electricity and clean water. Her high-profile altercation with Donald Trump over his administration\u2019s response to Puerto Rico earned national attention. She said in a statement that she is hopeful Sanders can \u201cusher a new path towards the resolution of many of the issues facing Puerto Rico.\u201d</p> <p>Turner, a former Ohio state senator, is one of Sanders most loyal supporters.

      "bodyText": "Up to a third of the military construction budgets President Trump hoped to tap to fund his border wall may have already been spent, Congressional Quarterly reports: Yesterday, Fox News host Laura Ingraham tweeted a thank you to a free enterprise advocacy organization that calls itself the Job Creators Network, for a Times Square Billboard blasting Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the Amazon pullout in New York. AOC was quick to quip back, highlighting who funded the billboard criticizing her. According to a report from the Public Accountability Initiative published today, the Job Creator\u2019s Network is funded Trump-supporting billionaires and conservative lobbyists with ties to big corporations, but claims to be \u201cthe voice of Main Street\u201d. Andrew Perez, a reporter for a nonpartisan financial investigation organization called MapLight, shared tax documents also tying the Job Creators Network to Mitch McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff. Senator and 2020 Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris responded today to the allegations against actor Jussie Smollett, who has been charged with faking a hate crime against himself to boost his salary. Harris quickly and publicly condemned the attacks against Smollett before investigators uncovered the actor\u2019s alleged fraud. Some divisive public figures have used the case to draw untrue conclusions about hate crimes in the US. As VICE reports, hate crimes are on the rise and only 0.03 % of those reported turn out to be faked. It\u2019s far more likely that they are underreported as only half of hate crime victims alert the authorities, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Per VICE: FBI data, which relies on voluntary reporting from local police departments, has also pointed to a rise in hate crimes nationwide in recent years. According to the bureau\u2019s most recent count, hate crime reports jumped by nearly 17 percent in 2017, compared to the previous year. Black and Jewish victims accounted for the biggest spikes\u201d. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released data today showing that the Republican tax plan helped US banks make more than $28 billion in additional profit this year, the Hill reports: Yearly profits increased increased $72. 4 billion from 2017, and the rise includes $28.8 billion more than banks would have kept under the previous tax regime. Bank profits in the fourth quarter of 2018 rose to $59 billion, an $8.1 billion increase from the same period in 2017. The Republican tax-cut bill reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. The bill\u2019s supporters said the corporate tax cut would fuel the U.S. economy, while Democrats panned it as a handout to wealthy elites\u201d. The money hasn\u2019t exactly been spread around. As HuffPost reporter Matt Fuller pointed out on Twitter, wages continue to fall flat. A report from 2018 from the Economic Policy Institute found the cuts have not led to compensation growth. Nearly $200 million in military construction funds, approved by Congress for projects like submarine manufacturing, aircraft improvement, and repair of aging military facilities across Pennsylvania could be diverted for Trump\u2019s border wall Senator Bob Casey\u2019s office told the Associated Press today. It\u2019s still unclear how the Trump Administration will pay for the wall but Casey said in a statement that he will \u201cfight like hell to keep this funding and these projects up and running in Pennsylvania\u201d. On a weekly news show in Iowa today, Representative Steve King announced that would be seeking reelection in 2020. He will face three challengers, the Des Moines Register reports. The Republican Congressman faced calls for his resignation and was removed from key committees after questioning why white nationalism and white supremacy was offensive, in an interview with the New York Times released in January. It wasn\u2019t the first time King made racist remarks that sparked controversy, but he has refused to step down. \u201cDon\u2019t let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who\u2019s going to represent you in the United States Congress\u201d he told hosts on the Iowa Press show, saying he had \u201cnothing to apologize for\u201d. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has weighed in on the State Board of Elections\u2019 decision to re-do the election for his state\u2019s 9th Congressional District, after a months-long investigation into allegations of ballot tampering. \u201cI thank the Board for unanimously doing the right thing\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cPeople must have confidence that their vote matters and this action sends a strong message that election fraud must not be tolerated\u201d. Gabrielle Canon here, taking over for Adam Gabbatt A newly unsealed complaint filed by federal prosecutors revealed today that an investigative analyst from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was charged for handing over former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s private bank records to Stormy Daniels\u2019 attorney Michael Avenatti, along with disclosing details of the confidential information to the New Yorker, CNN reports. Per CNN: The analyst, John C. Fry, was charged by prosecutors in the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California with the unauthorized disclosure of a document called a suspicious activity report, or SAR, which banks file when they review transactions that raise red flags... In May 2018, Fry, who works in the IRS\u2019 San Francisco office, accessed and downloaded five SARs connected to Cohen, according to the complaint, and then, seeing that other such documents were unavailable in the database, turned over some of the SARs to Avenatti and told The New Yorker reporter that he was alarmed to see other SARs were inaccessible, the complaint says\u201d. A little more detail on North Carolina ordering that fresh election, from the Associated Press: The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted 5-0 on Thursday to hold a new election in the 9th Congressional District. The board did not immediately set a schedule. Following last November\u2019s election, Republican Mark Harris had held a slim lead over Democrat Dan McCready in unofficial results from the district running from Charlotte through several counties to the east. But the state refused to certify the win because of absentee-ballot irregularities. Harris said Thursday during the hearing that he thought a new election should be called, despite his lawyers arguing in recent legal filings to the state board that he should be certified the winner. The Republican said he was still struggling from health problems caused by a blood infection that landed him in a hospital and led to two strokes. Harris said he was suffering from confusion, but that he could see there were substantial doubts about fairness and that a new election is necessary. Roger Stone has been handed a stricter gag order by a federal judge. The long-time Donald Trump confidante was ruled to have defied an earlier order when he posted a photo of the judge, alongside crosshairs, on social media. Stone is charged with lying to Congress about his communications with Wikileaks, witness tampering and obstruction of an official proceeding. North Carolina ordered a new Congressional election in the ongoing voter fraud case in the state. The election will be for the state\u2019s ninth congressional district. After November\u2019s mid-term elections the Republican Mark Harris held a slim lead, but North Carolina refused to certify the win due to irregularities. Harris\u2019s campaign has been subject to a hearing amid fraud claims relating to absentee ballots. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he will not run for Senate in 2020. Pompeo had been widely linked with running \u2013 Senate leader Mitch McConnell reportedly approached the secretary \u2013 in his home state of Kansas, where he previously served as a US congressman. \u201cIt\u2019s ruled out,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m loving it.\u201d Sign up for our morning briefing for a global perspective on the US.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson has issued a new set of restrictions on Trump associate Roger Stone in a DC federal court. Under the new ruling, Stone may make no statements about the case and hold no press releases or press conferences. Stone has also been ordered not to make posts about the case on social media. Stone also may not comment about the case indirectly, Jackson said. Any violation of this fresh gag \u201cwill be a basis for revoking your bond\u201d, Jackson said \u2013 which could mean Stone going to jail. Giving her ruling, Jackson told Stone she had \u201cserious doubts about whether you\u2019ve learned any lesson at all\u201d. His apology \u201crings quite hollow\u201d, the judge said. Since posting the photograph, Stone has \u201cdecided to pursue a strategy of attacking others,\u201d Jackson said. She added: \u201cMr Stone could not even keep his story straight on the stand.\u201d Jackson said the photo Stone posted \u201cwas not selected randomly\u201d. She noted that a Google search brings up \u201cmany unaltered photographs\u201d. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, presiding over the Roger Stone hearing, has taken a break before ruling on Stone\u2019s fate. David Smith is reporting that Stone claimed one of his \u201cmany\u201d volunteers who operate out of his house could have posted the photo. Stone was unable to identify which volunteer posted it, however. Prosecutor Jonathan Kravis has told the court that even after posting the crosshairs photo, Stone continued to give interviews to amplify the coverage. Judge Jackson, speaking to Stone\u2019s attorney Bruce Rogow, has seemed skeptical about the chances of Stone keeping quiet, David Smith reports. Guardian reporter David Smith is tweeting from inside the DC court where Roger Stone is appearing. Stone has told the court that he is \u201cheartfully sorry\u201d and admitted abusing the court order that originally allowed him out on bail. Of the crosshairs in the photo, Stone told the judge: \u201cIt\u2019s a celtic occult symbol... I\u2019m not into the occult.\u201d He added: \u201cI honestly did not believe it was crosshairs. I honestly thought it was a misinterpretation.\u201d While Stone appears to have begun his statement with a full-scale apology, he seems to have switched, at least briefly, to trying to explain his actions: Stone is reportedly claiming that the crosshairs in the photo he posted of Judge Amy Berman are not crosshairs, but a Celtic symbol. Here\u2019s the image: Roger Stone is on the witness stand in court, and apparently channelling Oliver Twist. Here\u2019s the Huffington Post\u2019s Ryan Reilly: Roger Stone has made it to court... here he is arriving at the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse in Washington DC a little back. You\u2019ll remember that the long-time Trump consort is back in court to face Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Stone posted a photo of the judge next to some crosshairs on Instagram \u2013 now we\u2019ll find out whether Stone violated the terms of his release by doing so. If he did, Stone could be put in jail. Earlier we saw Donald Trump tweet out a video of some fence panels being put into place on the border. \u201cTHE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW!\u201d Trump whooped under the video. But it now seems that the video is actually five months old. Not to mention it doesn\u2019t show a new barrier being constructed \u2013 just an existing barrier being upgraded. The website Task &amp; Purpose reports that Trump\u2019s footage was actually filmed on September 18 2018. A spokeswoman for the US Army Corps of Engineers told Task &amp; Purpose it had filmed the upgrade project last September. A Silicon Valley congressman with plans to bring big tech to Iowa, a sharp-tongued mayor who took on the Trump administration after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and a leader of the Bernie Sanders\u2019 grassroots army will serve as co-chairs for the Vermont senator\u2019s second presidential campaign. Representative Ro Khanna, who is the first member of Congress not from Sanders home state of Vermont to publicly endorse him, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, and Nina Turner, the president of Our Revolution, will serve as Sanders\u2019 surrogates and ambassadors, offering guidance to the campaign and hitting the trail to amplify issues such as healthcare, the environment and tech innovation. They are only the first wave of co-chairs to be announced and more are expected soon. Collectively the co-chairs represent an effort by the campaign to build a diverse operation, in light of Sanders difficulty attracting minority voters in 2016 and recent revelations of sexual harassment by former female staffers on his first presidential campaign. Sanders, who launched his campaign for president on Tuesday, hired Faiz Shakir, the former political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, to be the campaign manager. The former aide to Harry Reid is the first Muslim campaign manager for a major party candidate in presidential history. Khanna has built his profile as a progressive voice in the House, working with Sanders on the campaign to raise the minimum wage for Amazon workers and on legislation to end US-support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Re-elected to a second term in 2018, Khanna has spent a significant portion of his time outside his blue district, pushing big tech investment in parts of the Midwest and Appalachia. \u201cEvery 50 years, there is someone who can fundamentally alter the course of American politics,\u201d Khanna said in a statement. \u201cBernie Sanders has the chance to reorient our economic policy towards workers and communities left behind instead of corporate interests and to reorient our foreign policy to prioritize peace, diplomacy and restraint instead of war.\u201d Cruz met with Sanders during his visit to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria left residents without electricity and clean water. Her high-profile altercation with Donald Trump over his administration\u2019s response to Puerto Rico earned national attention. She said in a statement that she is hopeful Sanders can \u201cusher a new path towards the resolution of many of the issues facing Puerto Rico.\u201d Turner, a former Ohio state senator, is one of Sanders most loyal supporters. As the head of Our Revolution, which was a spin off of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign, she led the effort to draft him into the race this season. A few people are pointing out that Trump is yet to say anything about the coast guard who had stockpiled weapons and was plotting to attack Democratic members of Congress, but weighed in on Jussie Smollett almost immediately: Christopher Hasson, a neo-Nazi serving as a lieutenant in the US coast guard, was arrested last week. Prosecutors described Hasson, who had compiled a spreadsheet of apparent targets including Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and anchors from CNN and MSNBC, last week. Vice-president Mike Pence is off to Colombia next week to \u201cvoice the United States\u2019 unwavering support for [Venezuala] interim president Juan Guaido\u201d, according to the White House. Pence will be in Bogota on Monday to reiterate US support for Guiado, the leader of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled national assembly who swore himself in as interim president in January. Guaido has been recognized by more than 40 countries, including the US, the UK, Brazil and Germany. Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro has refused to step down, despite ongoing chaos in the country that has prompted an estimated four million people to flee the country. Last week Trump urged to the Venezuelan military to abandon their support for Maduro and back Guaido. At least 245 children have been separated from their families at the southern border since the Trump administration announced it would end the practice. CNN reports that those separations occurred between late June 2018 \u2013 when the government \u2013 and early February 2019. The number was released in a court filing as part of an American Civil Liberties Union case against the Trump administration. \u201cThe administration said the basis for the separation in the majority of cases was \u2018criminality, prosecution, gang affiliation or other law enforcement purpose\u2019,\u201d according to CNN. The Trump White House is forcing interns to sign non-disclosure agreements, the Daily Beast is reporting. The latest batch of interns, who joined the White House earlier this year, were warned against leaking during their induction, the Beast says, before signing the NDAs. They were then warned that breaching the agreements could \u201cresult in legal, and thus financial, consequences for them\u201d. It\u2019s not the first time Trump has ordered staff to sign NDAs \u2013 even though some believe that the agreements would never be held up in court. Empire actor Jussie Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct this morning, after allegedly lying when he claimed to have been attacked and beaten by two masked men shouting racist and homophobic slurs. Smollett had claimed the men shouted \u201cThis is Maga country\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan \u2013 during the alleged attack, which has led to: In the days after the alleged attack on Smollett, Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker described it as \u201can attempted modern day lynching\u201d. Florida is planning a \u201cfinal lobbying blitz\u201d to lure the 2020 Democratic National Convention to the state, according to a Politico report. Speculation has been mounting in recent days that Democrats will choose Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the site of the pre-election convention. DNC chairman Tom Perez has been weighing Milwaukee, Houston and Miami as potential sites, and Politico says Florida Democrats are concerned Perez might be about to shun them for America\u2019s Dairyland. Miami\u2019s stable of Democratic donors \u2014 many of whom have hosted President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton multiple times and are already being hit up by numerous Democratic presidential hopefuls \u2014 are applying their clout to the city\u2019s bid. Some of them say they\u2019re already leaning on potential 2020 candidates \u2014 they won\u2019t say which ones \u2014 to get them behind Miami\u2019s convention bid. Something we may have missed yesterday \u2013 long-time Trump attorney and aide Michael Cohen has launched a fundraising campaign to pay his legal costs. The description on Cohen\u2019s Go Fund Me page seeks to paint Cohen, who was convicted of lying to the Senate and House intelligence committees, as something of a truth-telling patriot: On July 2, 2018, Michael Cohen declared his independence from Donald Trump and his commitment to tell the truth. On August 21, Michael Cohen made the decision to take legal responsibility and to continue his commitment to tell the truth. Michael decided to put his family and his country first. Now Michael needs your financial help. Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who once put shoe polish on his face to impersonate Michael Jackson, has cancelled the first stop on his \u201clistening tour\u201d about race. The announcement comes after Virginia Union University\u2019s student body wrote to Northam asking him not to attend a planned event at the college. The governor announced the tour after admitting smearing shoe polish on his face in the 1980s while impersonating Jackson. Northam made the confession after it emerged his 1984 yearbook page included a photo of a man wearing blackface standing next to someone in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. Northam has said he won\u2019t resign. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has ruled out running for Senate in 2020. Pompeo had been widely linked with running in his home state of Kansas, where he previously served as a US congressman. The Kansas seat will become vacant in 2020, and Senate leader Mitch McConnell had reportedly urged Pompeo to run. But the secretary of state told NBC News it ain\u2019t going to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s ruled out,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m loving it.\u201d Pompeo added that he plans to \u201cbe the secretary of state as long as President Trump gives [him] the chance to serve as a senior diplomat.\u201d Given Trump\u2019s record of firing senior members of staff, one could argue that that leaves Pompeo some wiggle room. Look who\u2019s up: Couple of points here: a) that is not a wall, b) this is merely a renovation of an existing fence. Trump has built no new miles of wall. Democrats are being urged to sign a resolution which would halt Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration. With the backing of Houser speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep Joaquin Castro started circulating a letter round House members yesterday, seeking co-sponsors to his one-page resolution. Democrats have until 3pm today to sign, and it is likely to be introduced on Friday. \u201cI write to invite all Members of Congress to cosponsor Congressman Joaquin Castro\u2019s privileged resolution,\u201d Pelosi wrote to colleagues, \u201cto terminate this emergency declaration using the termination mechanism within the National Emergencies Act\u201d. All Members take an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution. [...] The President\u2019s decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated. We have a solemn responsibility to uphold the Constitution, and defend our system of checks and balances against the President\u2019s assault. Good morning. \u2022\u2018Get Me Roger Stone\u2019 is not just the name of a documentary about the long-time Donald Trump associate. It\u2019s also what a DC federal court is saying, after Stone posted a photo to Instagram showing Judge Amy Berman Jackson next to a set of rifle crosshairs. Stone is due in court at 2.30pm and could be sent to jail. \u2022Democrats are continuing to hit the trail today, hoping to win the nomination for an election that is now just 20 months away. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris and Julian Castro are all appearing at various events around the country. \u2022Donald Trump has managed to squeeze some meetings around his executive time. He will receive an intelligence briefing at 11.30am, then have lunch with acting secretary of the interior David Bernhardt at 12.15pm. At 6.15pm he is hosting a reception for National African American History Month. \u2022Last but far, far from least, Robert Mueller is said to be close to concluding his investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. It likely won\u2019t drop today, but we\u2019ll have updates if there\u2019s any news.",

McIlroy in this touch is compulsive viewing.</p> <p>In events of 2019 prior to this, McIlroy\u2019s highest single-round score was 72. A 63 at last week\u2019s Genesis Open and 65 at the earlier Farmers Insurance Open stood out before round one here, where McIlroy found 17 greens in regulation.

A majestically cut two-iron from 300 yards pitched within inches of the hole, with the subsequent 6ft putt for an eagle converted. The only minor trauma of the day arrived at the par-five 6th, where McIlroy was unable to find a gap between tree branches with his second shot. He bemoaned the narrow limb which knocked his ball back to earth. \u201cIt\u2019s something a dog would pick up,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThe one branch it could not hit, it hit.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy\u2019s consistency is endorsed by numbers; in his last 13 rounds on the PGA Tour, he is an aggregate of 48 under par. His first-round lead is just one, from Dustin Johnson. That threat to McIlroy is a live one; Johnson won this tournament in 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s way too much going on out there for me to worry about what anyone else is doing,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThe greens are so tough.

      "bodyText": "Renewed perspective continues to pay off for Rory McIlroy. The sense that victory is tantalisingly close for the Northern Irishman was renewed on Thursday in Mexico City, where a seemingly effortless 63 \u2013 eight under par \u2013 positioned him atop the WGC leaderboard. McIlroy in this touch is compulsive viewing. In events of 2019 prior to this, McIlroy\u2019s highest single-round score was 72. A 63 at last week\u2019s Genesis Open and 65 at the earlier Farmers Insurance Open stood out before round one here, where McIlroy found 17 greens in regulation. His longest converted putt was from 20ft, further demonstrating his level of accuracy. Afterwards, the 29-year-old suggested his on-course vigour is all in the mind. There is no prospect whatsoever of McIlroy contemplating victory prematurely. \u201cI\u2019m managing my game well,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI love where my attitude is at. My attitude on the golf course is fantastic and my putting is good. I\u2019ve seen some really good signs with my putting over the last few weeks. I had three really good putting rounds at Riviera the last three days and carried it into here. So if I\u2019m excited about anything with my game, it\u2019s my putting. That and my attitude have been probably the best they\u2019ve been in a long time. \u201cI think winning is a by-product of doing a lot of things; practising the right way, thinking well, training well, eating well, all this stuff that I try to do. Winning is a by-product of doing all the little things well and I feel like I\u2019m on a really good journey of doing that. \u201cI can\u2019t put pressure on myself, I can\u2019t push it. I\u2019m off to a great start this week, but I literally have taken each and every day this year one day at a time and that\u2019s the way I\u2019m going to treat it not just this week but going forward.\u201d Peak McIlroy arrived at the 1st. A majestically cut two-iron from 300 yards pitched within inches of the hole, with the subsequent 6ft putt for an eagle converted. The only minor trauma of the day arrived at the par-five 6th, where McIlroy was unable to find a gap between tree branches with his second shot. He bemoaned the narrow limb which knocked his ball back to earth. \u201cIt\u2019s something a dog would pick up,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThe one branch it could not hit, it hit.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s consistency is endorsed by numbers; in his last 13 rounds on the PGA Tour, he is an aggregate of 48 under par. His first-round lead is just one, from Dustin Johnson. That threat to McIlroy is a live one; Johnson won this tournament in 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s way too much going on out there for me to worry about what anyone else is doing,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThe greens are so tough. Today was a good day. I controlled the ball well and gave myself a lot of opportunities.\u201d Tiger Woods returned a level-par 71 during which he struggled on the greens. The score was, though, mildly impressive given the 14-times major winner had opened with a double bogey, hooking his first tee shot out of bounds. England\u2019s Tyrrell Hatton, who finished just a shot adrift of the winner Phil Mickelson a year ago, is again in good position after a Thursday 67. \u201cI like it here, this course suits my eye,\u201d said Hatton.

He had worked at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, first at the information desk in the lobby and later as a curator of painting and sculpture (he had no formal training), and would write poems on his lunch break. I immediately bought his 1964 book Lunch Poems, the first collection of poetry I would ever own.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think Frank O\u2019Hara would think it was silly that I discovered his work on a social media app</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I always assumed I wasn\u2019t clever or cultured enough to understand poetry. I love the Fast and the Furious movies, for chrissakes. I don\u2019t know anything about painters or photographers or theatre. Poetry belonged to rich people who wore black berets and kept paperback books in their jacket pockets to advertise that they read, who were thrilled when they could tell someone that they don\u2019t own a TV.</p> <p>But when I was reading Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems it didn\u2019t feel like they were too academic for me. It felt like making a new exciting friend. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I had been so stunned by words. Reading Lunch Poems felt like my brain was being zapped with electric currents. As I read I kept exclaiming things like \u201choly cow!\u201d to myself, even though I don\u2019t think I have ever used the phrase \u201choly cow\u201d even once in my life previously.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f381a981980b7c0caac3800d5b2f41b289803edc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f381a981980b7c0caac3800d5b2f41b289803edc/0_161_800_715/500.jpg\" alt=\"Frank O\u2019Hara 1965\" width=\"500\" height=\"447\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank O\u2019Hara 1965</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Schifano</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frank\u2019s poems were conversational and funny and weird in a way that I didn\u2019t know poetry could be. One line in Five Poems \u2013 \u201can invitation to lunch, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT\u201d \u2013 made me laugh so much I choked. Even when he was talking about humiliation and anxiety, there was an ease and casualness to his work that made other poets seem stuffy and detached. You can vividly imagine Frank writing poems, because he invites you to \u2013 bundled in a coat on his lunch break, sitting in bustling 1950s Manhattan, scribbling in a notebook, eating liver sausage sandwiches and watching workers putting up Christmas trees on Park Avenue. One of my favourites, \u201cPoem\u201d \u2013 in which Frank sees a newspaper proclaiming that starlet Lana Turner had collapsed at a party \u2013 was written on a Staten Island Ferry while Frank was travelling to a poetry reading:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have been to lots of parties<br>and acted perfectly disgraceful<br>but I never actually collapsed<br>oh Lana Turner we love you get up</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cCan you believe this!\u201d I would say to my friend at work, reading out key passages to her until she took the book herself, found a poem about defecating and laughed a loud booming laugh. \u201cI truly cannot believe this!\u201d I told family members at my sister\u2019s birthday dinner, recalling a particularly nice poem about Frank drinking a Coke with his love.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/04/money-playlist-jamie-lee-frank-o-hara-the-fates-robbie-basho-and-more\">Money's playlist: Frank O'Hara, the Fates, Robbie Basho and more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m still discovering new old poems by my new best friend Frank and learning more about him.

I don\u2019t think Frank O\u2019Hara would think it was silly that I discovered his work on a social media app that is primarily designed for empowering bikini selfies and laxative tea advertisements. He would probably think it was funny. In his 1959 poem \u2018Naphtha\u2019 he writes \u201cI am ashamed of my century, for being so entertaining, but I have to smile\u201d.

But I couldn\u2019t concentrate. \u201cCatastrophe of my personality\u201d kept repeating in my head, like my brain was trying to memorise it independently of my will. I read the words out loud to myself in my apartment, letting them roll around my mouth like melting toffee, quite sure I had never read a more remarkable sentence in my life. I couldn\u2019t decide if it was hilarious or if it made me want to cry. \u201cAnd interesting, and modern\u201d. I needed to find the person who had written the words that had ruined my life. It\u2019s probably not very dignified to admit that I first encountered the poems of Frank O\u2019Hara on Instagram. (The aforementioned passage was from a 1957 poem called \u201cMayakovsky\u201d from O\u2019Hara\u2019s book Meditations in an Emergency). I\u2019m ashamed to say that I had never even heard of him, but I quickly learned the facts: he was part of the \u201cNew York School\u201d of poets in the 1950s and \u201860s, until he was hit by a car in 1966 and died. He had worked at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, first at the information desk in the lobby and later as a curator of painting and sculpture (he had no formal training), and would write poems on his lunch break. I immediately bought his 1964 book Lunch Poems, the first collection of poetry I would ever own. I always assumed I wasn\u2019t clever or cultured enough to understand poetry. I love the Fast and the Furious movies, for chrissakes. I don\u2019t know anything about painters or photographers or theatre. Poetry belonged to rich people who wore black berets and kept paperback books in their jacket pockets to advertise that they read, who were thrilled when they could tell someone that they don\u2019t own a TV. But when I was reading Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems it didn\u2019t feel like they were too academic for me. It felt like making a new exciting friend. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I had been so stunned by words. Reading Lunch Poems felt like my brain was being zapped with electric currents. As I read I kept exclaiming things like \u201choly cow!\u201d to myself, even though I don\u2019t think I have ever used the phrase \u201choly cow\u201d even once in my life previously. Frank\u2019s poems were conversational and funny and weird in a way that I didn\u2019t know poetry could be. One line in Five Poems \u2013 \u201can invitation to lunch, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT\u201d \u2013 made me laugh so much I choked. Even when he was talking about humiliation and anxiety, there was an ease and casualness to his work that made other poets seem stuffy and detached. You can vividly imagine Frank writing poems, because he invites you to \u2013 bundled in a coat on his lunch break, sitting in bustling 1950s Manhattan, scribbling in a notebook, eating liver sausage sandwiches and watching workers putting up Christmas trees on Park Avenue. One of my favourites, \u201cPoem\u201d \u2013 in which Frank sees a newspaper proclaiming that starlet Lana Turner had collapsed at a party \u2013 was written on a Staten Island Ferry while Frank was travelling to a poetry reading: I have been to lots of parties and acted perfectly disgraceful but I never actually collapsed oh Lana Turner we love you get up \u201cCan you believe this!\u201d I would say to my friend at work, reading out key passages to her until she took the book herself, found a poem about defecating and laughed a loud booming laugh. \u201cI truly cannot believe this!\u201d I told family members at my sister\u2019s birthday dinner, recalling a particularly nice poem about Frank drinking a Coke with his love. I\u2019m still discovering new old poems by my new best friend Frank and learning more about him. I\u2019m almost ready to give some of his contemporaries a go and see if there are other poets who can create electric sparks in my brain. I don\u2019t think Frank O\u2019Hara would think it was silly that I discovered his work on a social media app that is primarily designed for empowering bikini selfies and laxative tea advertisements. He would probably think it was funny. In his 1959 poem \u2018Naphtha\u2019 he writes \u201cI am ashamed of my century, for being so entertaining, but I have to smile\u201d. I\u2019m looking forward to learning more. \u2022 Sinead Stubbins is a writer and cultural critic. She has written for Vulture, Pitchfork, Vice and Junkee",

      "body": "<h2>1) A clash for the ages at Old Trafford</h2> <p>Sometimes you just have to stoke the hype. The ramifications of Sunday\u2019s fixture at Old Trafford could ripple out for years. A victory for Manchester United would deal a serious blow to Liverpool\u2019s hopes of landing that long-awaited title. And if J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team fall short this season, then winning the league will be exponentially more difficult for them in future, especially with title jitters close to institutionalised among their fanbase. That, in turn, would make a United victory particularly satisfying for their supporters and increase the chances of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r being appointed as the club\u2019s permanent manager (and a bonus offshoot of that could be, if reports are to be believed, that Chelsea get to thinking it would be a good idea to promote Gianfranco Zola).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/20/mats-hummels-bayern-munich-liverpool-champions-league\">Georginio Wijnaldum insists clean sheet could be a boon for Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the other hand, if Liverpool were to prevail at Old Trafford in what looks to be one of their toughest remaining matches, then their title challenge would get a mighty boost. On top of restoring a three-point lead over Manchester City, it would help settle those all-too-palpable nerves, thus smoothing the run-in. And an away win at Old Trafford, on the back of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s victory there and Burnley\u2019s draw, might also persuade United\u2019s decision-makers that Solskj\u00e6r is no magician and luring someone with better pedigree, such as Mauricio Pochettino, remains a better bet. <strong>PD<br></strong></p> <h2>2) To Hendo or not to Hendo: that is the question for Klopp?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b9c265ee7fdd98851fc844ae5e23f8d8aad965\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b9c265ee7fdd98851fc844ae5e23f8d8aad965/0_133_3844_2306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Henderson excelled in Tuesday\u2019s match with Bayern Munich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Henderson excelled in Tuesday\u2019s match with Bayern Munich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Garc\u00eda/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Virgil Van Dijk sure to return to Liverpool\u2019s defence, Fabinho, who deputised well for the Dutchman in defence against Bayern Munich, should take up his usual position in midfield, where his nous and snappy passing are important. So whither Jordan Henderson? Back to the bench despite the fact that he, too, played well against Bayern? Or should he be retained in the hope that he performs the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho role, stifling and riling Paul Pogba? Chances are that J\u00fcrgen Klopp will plump for solidity and dynamism in central midfield in recognition of, firstly, United\u2019s improvement there since the sides met at Anfield in December and, secondly, the fact that Liverpool can be particularly confident of making gains down the wings if United are without the pace of Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial. <strong>PD<br><br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) A welcome sighting of the lesser-spotted Lanzini</h2> <p>Fulham\u2019s ongoing search for an away win takes them to the Friday night lights of the London Stadium, where West Ham could welcome back into their matchday squad some or all of Samir Nasri, Fabian Balbuena and the lesser-spotted Manuel Lanzini. Lanzini has recovered from the cruciate injury he suffered in the build-up to the World Cup with Argentina and Manuel Pellegrini has stated how much he is looking forward to working with the playmaker before what is likely to be his first appearance under the Chilean. While Nasri is likely to start against Fulham, Lanzini looks a good bet to come off the bench at some point with the out-of-sorts Robert Snodgrass the player likely to make way. Against a Fulham defence that regularly borders on the slapstick, the duo may provide the spark of creativity that gets sullen Austrian colleague Marko Arnautovic firing on all cylinders again. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>4) The return of Victor Camarasa to Cardiff\u2019s starting line-up?</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/20/cardiff-nantes-emiliano-sala-extension-payment-fee\">Cardiff and Nantes agree extension for first payment of Emiliano Sala fee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although he didn\u2019t start in either of Cardiff City\u2019s impressive back-to-back wins against Bournemouth or Southampton, there is a strong argument to be made that Victor Camarasa is their most influential player. When the Spaniard plays in an advanced midfield position, Cardiff enjoy far more possession, and with successive home games to come against Watford and Everton, Neil Warnock will want to see him team spend more time on the ball. Should he decide to include Camarasa in his starting line-up, he will be forced into the difficult decision of dropping somebody from a winning team and it will be intriguing to see who he leaves out. Joe Ralls or Bobby Reid seem the most likely candidates, and should either player start the game against Watford on the substitute\u2019s bench, they will have every right to feel a little aggrieved about being ordered to take one for the team. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>5) Pereira and Tielemans crucial for Leicester</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62202b88c52a7df2907edf304a44faf03ccae09d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62202b88c52a7df2907edf304a44faf03ccae09d/106_206_4754_2853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youri Tielemans made an impressive start to his Leicester career against Tottenham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youri Tielemans made an impressive start to his Leicester career against Tottenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Palace beat Leicester 1-0 at Selhurst Park in December, it was their first league win in two years without Wilfried Zaha. All the same, there is no chance of them choosing to do without their best player on Saturday, which gives Ricardo Pereira the perfect opportunity to show why he has made the Leicester right-back position his own \u2013 despite an unpromising start to his Premier League career earlier this season. One player who has made an excellent impression at the club is Youri Tielemans, who brought welcome creativity to their midfield during his debut against Spurs. The gifted Belgian\u2019s problem at Monaco, who loaned him out in January, was inconsistency. But if he makes it two fine performances from two for Leicester, then Roy Hodgson will need Zaha to be on top form \u2013 otherwise Claude Puel will be celebrating a first home win since Boxing Day. <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2>6) An even more invigorated Burnley?</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/21/ive-had-to-hold-back-animal-harry-kanes-tottenham-return-says-pochettino\">\u2018I\u2019ve had to hold back animal Harry Kane\u2019s Spurs return,\u2019 says Pochettino</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sean Dyche used the recent gap in Burnley\u2019s schedule to take his squad to Portugal for five days of warm-weather training. Following their win against Brighton almost a fortnight ago, they entertain Tottenham at Turf Moor as they attempt to extend an unbeaten Premier League run in which they have harvested 15 points from their past seven games. Considering they only accumulated 12 in their previous 19, that\u2019s quite the resurgence, and Tottenham will need to be extremely wary of the threat Burnley pose. Following a similar February break last season, Burnley drew their first game back, then won five in a row. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>7) Bournemouth spark extinguished?</h2> <p>While Bournemouth were singularly unimpressive in defeat to Liverpool at Anfield, there were some mitigating factors. As well as missing long-term absentees Lewis Cook and Simon Francis, their loan signing Nathaniel Clyne was ineligible to play against his parent club, while key players such as Junior Stanislas, Callum Wilson and David Brooks were also absent. The ongoing absence of Wilson, Brooks and \u2013 possibly \u2013 Stanislas, not to mention the creativity the trio bring with them could make for a very tricky afternoon against an obdurate and well-drilled Wolves rearguard that can be extremely difficult to penetrate or break down. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>8) A team of Terriers with a bit more bite</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/21/christian-atsu-newcastle-rafael-benitez\">Christian Atsu: \u2018Sometimes what\u2019s happened to me seems like a miracle\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Huddersfield prepare for their inevitable return to the Championship, their trip to Newcastle should give some indication as to whether they are likely to go down swinging and in style. The Terriers have taken just one point from the past 39 available, but have shown increasing signs of life since the appointment of Jan Siewert in January.

      "bodyText": "1) A clash for the ages at Old Trafford Sometimes you just have to stoke the hype. The ramifications of Sunday\u2019s fixture at Old Trafford could ripple out for years. A victory for Manchester United would deal a serious blow to Liverpool\u2019s hopes of landing that long-awaited title. And if J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team fall short this season, then winning the league will be exponentially more difficult for them in future, especially with title jitters close to institutionalised among their fanbase. That, in turn, would make a United victory particularly satisfying for their supporters and increase the chances of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r being appointed as the club\u2019s permanent manager (and a bonus offshoot of that could be, if reports are to be believed, that Chelsea get to thinking it would be a good idea to promote Gianfranco Zola). On the other hand, if Liverpool were to prevail at Old Trafford in what looks to be one of their toughest remaining matches, then their title challenge would get a mighty boost. On top of restoring a three-point lead over Manchester City, it would help settle those all-too-palpable nerves, thus smoothing the run-in. And an away win at Old Trafford, on the back of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s victory there and Burnley\u2019s draw, might also persuade United\u2019s decision-makers that Solskj\u00e6r is no magician and luring someone with better pedigree, such as Mauricio Pochettino, remains a better bet. PD 2) To Hendo or not to Hendo: that is the question for Klopp? With Virgil Van Dijk sure to return to Liverpool\u2019s defence, Fabinho, who deputised well for the Dutchman in defence against Bayern Munich, should take up his usual position in midfield, where his nous and snappy passing are important. So whither Jordan Henderson? Back to the bench despite the fact that he, too, played well against Bayern? Or should he be retained in the hope that he performs the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho role, stifling and riling Paul Pogba? Chances are that J\u00fcrgen Klopp will plump for solidity and dynamism in central midfield in recognition of, firstly, United\u2019s improvement there since the sides met at Anfield in December and, secondly, the fact that Liverpool can be particularly confident of making gains down the wings if United are without the pace of Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial. PD 3) A welcome sighting of the lesser-spotted Lanzini Fulham\u2019s ongoing search for an away win takes them to the Friday night lights of the London Stadium, where West Ham could welcome back into their matchday squad some or all of Samir Nasri, Fabian Balbuena and the lesser-spotted Manuel Lanzini. Lanzini has recovered from the cruciate injury he suffered in the build-up to the World Cup with Argentina and Manuel Pellegrini has stated how much he is looking forward to working with the playmaker before what is likely to be his first appearance under the Chilean. While Nasri is likely to start against Fulham, Lanzini looks a good bet to come off the bench at some point with the out-of-sorts Robert Snodgrass the player likely to make way. Against a Fulham defence that regularly borders on the slapstick, the duo may provide the spark of creativity that gets sullen Austrian colleague Marko Arnautovic firing on all cylinders again. BG 4) The return of Victor Camarasa to Cardiff\u2019s starting line-up? Although he didn\u2019t start in either of Cardiff City\u2019s impressive back-to-back wins against Bournemouth or Southampton, there is a strong argument to be made that Victor Camarasa is their most influential player. When the Spaniard plays in an advanced midfield position, Cardiff enjoy far more possession, and with successive home games to come against Watford and Everton, Neil Warnock will want to see him team spend more time on the ball. Should he decide to include Camarasa in his starting line-up, he will be forced into the difficult decision of dropping somebody from a winning team and it will be intriguing to see who he leaves out. Joe Ralls or Bobby Reid seem the most likely candidates, and should either player start the game against Watford on the substitute\u2019s bench, they will have every right to feel a little aggrieved about being ordered to take one for the team. BG 5) Pereira and Tielemans crucial for Leicester When Palace beat Leicester 1-0 at Selhurst Park in December, it was their first league win in two years without Wilfried Zaha. All the same, there is no chance of them choosing to do without their best player on Saturday, which gives Ricardo Pereira the perfect opportunity to show why he has made the Leicester right-back position his own \u2013 despite an unpromising start to his Premier League career earlier this season. One player who has made an excellent impression at the club is Youri Tielemans, who brought welcome creativity to their midfield during his debut against Spurs. The gifted Belgian\u2019s problem at Monaco, who loaned him out in January, was inconsistency. But if he makes it two fine performances from two for Leicester, then Roy Hodgson will need Zaha to be on top form \u2013 otherwise Claude Puel will be celebrating a first home win since Boxing Day. PD 6) An even more invigorated Burnley? Sean Dyche used the recent gap in Burnley\u2019s schedule to take his squad to Portugal for five days of warm-weather training. Following their win against Brighton almost a fortnight ago, they entertain Tottenham at Turf Moor as they attempt to extend an unbeaten Premier League run in which they have harvested 15 points from their past seven games. Considering they only accumulated 12 in their previous 19, that\u2019s quite the resurgence, and Tottenham will need to be extremely wary of the threat Burnley pose. Following a similar February break last season, Burnley drew their first game back, then won five in a row. BG 7) Bournemouth spark extinguished? While Bournemouth were singularly unimpressive in defeat to Liverpool at Anfield, there were some mitigating factors. As well as missing long-term absentees Lewis Cook and Simon Francis, their loan signing Nathaniel Clyne was ineligible to play against his parent club, while key players such as Junior Stanislas, Callum Wilson and David Brooks were also absent. The ongoing absence of Wilson, Brooks and \u2013 possibly \u2013 Stanislas, not to mention the creativity the trio bring with them could make for a very tricky afternoon against an obdurate and well-drilled Wolves rearguard that can be extremely difficult to penetrate or break down. BG 8) A team of Terriers with a bit more bite As Huddersfield prepare for their inevitable return to the Championship, their trip to Newcastle should give some indication as to whether they are likely to go down swinging and in style. The Terriers have taken just one point from the past 39 available, but have shown increasing signs of life since the appointment of Jan Siewert in January. The German has had the best part of two weeks to get his players used to his new, more energetic way of doing things, and their performance at St James\u2019 Park could speak volumes.Twenty-one-year-old striker Karlan Grant, brought in from Charlton at the end of January, has now been awarded the strike originally adjudged to be a Sead Kolasinac own goal in Huddersfield\u2019s defeat at the hands of Arsenal, and with 15 goals to his name this season (14 of them scored for Charlton), he has already scored once more than the rest of his new team-mates put together, and should make his first Premier League start at St James\u2019. BG 9) A Southampton side that\u2019s heard some home truths One of many Premier League clubs who used their early exit from the FA Cup to go abroad for some warm-weather training, Southampton went to Tenerife, where their manager Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl got to spend some one-on-one time with each member of his senior squad. The Austrian was visibly enraged following his side\u2019s last-minute defeat at the hands of Cardiff City last time out, so it\u2019s fair to say some of the aforementioned exchanges may have been decidedly frank and possibly a little brutal. \u201cI think they want to see what deficit they have still and they also want to see what they make better now in their game,\u201d he told the Southern Daily Echo. \u201cWe invested a lot of time to find the right clips for these guys, and maybe it helps the next time for them to find better decisions in those moments. I think for everybody it\u2019s important to get that feedback, and for us it is also important to hear how they feel in the moment and what is the atmosphere in the group and what they think about our way.\u201d The results of the quality time he spent with his players will be available for all to see when they travel to Arsenal. BG 10) Mike Dean bringing up his century Having let everyone down by refusing to notch up his century of red cards in the marquee game between Manchester City and Chelsea, Mike Dean remains on 99 not out and will surely be unable to resist a bravura flourish, before waving his card in appreciation to all four corners of the ground. Turf Moor on Saturday lunchtime is his next port of call \u2013 the footballers of Tottenham Hotspur and Burnley should consider themselves warned. BG",

Gambling games on smartphones have surged in popularity in recent years, allowing high-stakes betting within the palm of its users\u2019 hands, with video game-style play making them appear \u201charmless\u201d and introductory offers providing incentives to sign up. Scrutiny of the gambling industry has been focused on fixed-odds betting terminals in high street bookmakers, leading the government to cut the maximum stake on the machines from \u00a3100 to \u00a32, although this has yet to be implemented. However, smartphone gambling could be more problematic for people psychologically predisposed to addiction, given how the betting games can be accessed anywhere in the UK with an internet connection, according to academics. The study, published in the academic journal European Addiction Research, found that because users check their phones frequently throughout the day \u2013 referred to as \u2018snacking\u2019 \u2013 mobile gamblers tend to bet more often, even after suffering repeated losses. A common design principle in mobile gaming, as this type of gambling is referred to, is that a mix of small wins, \u2018near misses\u2019 and losses encourage greater levels of engagement. Experts have previously warned that gambling companies use sophisticated techniques to ingrain their products in the lives of their users by creating psychological dependencies, nudging people into live gameplay through notifications, emails and other methods. Notwithstanding the euphoria of winning, this can activate mechanisms in the brain akin to the effect of cocaine, going on to invoke \u201cphantom notifications\u201d, where users sense the buzz of their smartphone even when it hasn\u2019t gone off, prompting them to check it. Campaigners have long argued that the UK\u2019s gambling laws are in dire need of an overhaul, with rapid technological advancements rendering them outdated within a sector that yielded \u00a35.4bn last year. Matt Zarb-Cousin, a spokesman for gambling reform and co-founder of Gamban, an app that blocks gambling websites, said: \u201cOur gambling laws were written before smartphones even existed, and at a time when internet gambling was only getting started. \u201cSo while government is able to regulate stakes on machines like FOBTs, there are no such provisions for online, even though the games are the same. Our laws need updating in response to how people gamble today.\u201d The report\u2019s authors said smartphone gambling is more dangerous than FOBTs because it is \u201cso ubiquitous\u201d, adding that there are almost no legal restrictions on smartphone gambling because the companies themselves are often based in other jurisdictions. \u201cThe job of regulating them is extremely challenging.\u201d Prof Richard Tunney, head of psychology at Aston University and lead author of the paper, alongside Richard James, psychology research fellow at Nottingham University, and Prof Claire O\u2019Malley at the University of Durham, said: \u201cPolicymakers have clamped down hard on fixed-odds terminals because they\u2019ve become associated in the public imagination with problem gamblers. But actually, we\u2019ve been overtaken by technology, because it\u2019s now possible for people to gamble pretty much anywhere, any time on their smartphone.\u201d They added: \u201cFor people psychologically disposed to addictive behaviours, this means an outlet for that addiction is now just a tap away.\u201d Labour MP Carolyn Harris said the biggest problem was that betting from armchairs, at bus stops, in pubs, or in the dead of night has been normalised, with the growing ease of opportunities to gamble making it ever more addictive. \u201cThere are no stringent regulations over eligibility, credit checks or affordability, and vulnerable people get sucked into a world where offshore-based companies just want to take as much money as possible from you, with no interest whatsoever about the social consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sheer accessibility of gambling on smartphones has become the main enemy for problem gamblers.\u201d",
