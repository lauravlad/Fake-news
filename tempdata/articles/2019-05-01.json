As expected, she did not exactly open the book on her entire Brexit strategy (such as there is one). But there were various things that she said that we had not heard before.</p> \n  <p>Just as importantly, she struck a slightly new tone. She has now given up even pretending that no deal would be more acceptable than a bad deal. And in the past at these sessions, the most tetchy exchanges have always been those between May and <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, her Labour shadow in the 2010-15 parliament who now chairs the Commons home affairs committee. But no longer. May v Cooper was abrasive, but the two MPs who clearly infuriated her most were the Tory Brexiters <strong>Sir Bernard Jenkin </strong>and <strong>Sir Bill Cash</strong>. Maybe <strong>John Peet</strong> is right (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/may/01/brexit-latest-news-pmqs-may-liaison-pm-to-face-questions-from-mps-amid-claims-she-is-preparing-for-deal-with-labour-live-news?page=with:block-5cc9ad598f085bb0e0dec08f#block-5cc9ad598f085bb0e0dec08f\">3.30pm)</a> and she\u2019s finally had it with the ERG.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May hinted that the government and Labour were closer in what they want on a customs union than people realise.</strong> Labour says it wants a customs union with the EU, while the government says it just wants a customs arrangement. Speaking to Labour\u2019s <strong>Hilary Benn</strong>, she said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the discussions we have been having ... is the whole question about customs arrangements for the future. Various terms are used in relation to customs. Sometimes people use different terms to mean the same thing. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And later she told Cooper:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are sitting down [with Labour] and talking about what it is that we both want to achieve in relation [to customs]. I think actually there is a greater commonality in terms of some of the benefits of a customs union that we have already identified between ourselves and the official opposition. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>May also stressed that the political declaration already agreed with the EU allowed for a \u201cspectrum\u201d of outcomes on customs in the future trade talks. In her opening statement she also said she hoped the cross-party talks could result in a deal. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve been having constructive, meaningful talks which are continuing. </p> \n   <p>There are differences on issues but on many of the key areas - particularly on the withdrawal agreement - there is common ground. </p> \n   <p>We know that we need to end this uncertainty and do it as soon as possible and I hope a deal can be done. We certainly approach this with an open mind. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said there was a chance for the UK to use Brexit to develop \u201cworld-leading\u201d border technology. </strong>This came when Cooper cast doubt on whether technological solutions were available that could minimise delays at the border. May replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t accept the bigger picture you have set out. </p> \n   <p>I know the reference you have made to technology but an awful lot of work has been done on technology that is available at the borders and the opportunities that the UK has, actually. </p> \n   <p>I think there is an opportunity today for the UK to be introducing ways of dealing with these issues at our borders that could be world-leading. </p> \n   <p>One of the problems with this debate has consistently been that very often it\u2019s framed in terms of existing models and it\u2019s important for us to be looking at the new models that are available and can be used in these areas.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May hinted that the planned Brexit transition might have to be extended beyond December 2020.</strong> Asked if there would be enough time to conclude a UK-EU trade deal by the end of next year, when the transition is due to end, May replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Obviously the time has been reduced in relation to that ... It is still possible to achieve it by the end of December 2020.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if that meant she was ruling out an extension to the transition, she again said it was \u201cpossible\u201d to conclude the final deal by the end of next year, but she also said the withdrawal agreement would allow the transition to be extended. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May admitted that the planned three-year spending review, due to be announced this summer, could be scaled back if the Brexit deal is not passed.</strong> The review, which will cover spending starting from the 2020-21 financial year, could cover jsut one year, she conceded.

The main one, obviously, is why, during a session lasting more than three quarters of an hour, not one MP asked about Brexit? It remains the biggest crisis facing the country for decades. The situation is unresolved, and the government is deadlocked. Yet no one could be bothered to ask May what might happen next.</p> \n  <p>Why?</p> \n  <p>It is not that it does not matter anymore. And there is no evidence to suggest that MPs have suddenly stopped caring, that Mark Francois has come back from his Easter hols having resolved that EU membership isn\u2019t that bad after all, or that Ben Bradshaw has changed his mind about a second referendum.</p> \n  <p>May will be answering questions about Brexit at the liaison committee this afternoon. But no MP ever passes up a chance to raise an issue they care about on the grounds that someone else might ask the question later.</p> \n  <p>So why the conspiracy of silence? I can think of two possible reasons - one robust, and the other more speculative.</p> \n  <p>First, there are local elections in England and Northern Ireland tomorrow and for the two main parties, the Conservatives and Labour, Brexit has probably become an electoral millstone. The Tories are ashamed at their failure to deliver it, and Labour\u2019s policy is an elaborate fence-sitting exercise that leaves it open to attack from both sides. The biggest party in the Commons with a Brexit record it might actually be proud of is the SNP, and it is probably no coincidence that the only Brexit-related question (although it sounded more like one about higher education) came from Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster.</p> \n  <p>As for a speculative explanation, it felt like the Commons is still incapacitated by Brexit ennui. Like the rest of the population, MPs might just be fed up with it all. In the endless debates before Easter every conceivable Brexit theory and argument has been raised, and no one seems to have any plausible idea as to how the deadlock can be broken. It felt as if they did not say anything about Brexit because there was nothing left to say.</p> \n  <p>So instead we had a PMQs devoted to an array of domestic issues. They may have been important, but none of the exchanges crackled with the energy you get when great matter are at stake, or reputations are being won or lost. Jeremy Corbyn focused on poverty and public services and, although he very effectively exposed the big gap between May\u2019s aspirations when she became PM and her record (her defence of government policy was even more lacklustre than usual), it nevertheless felt low key. May came under just as much pressure from the Tories Tom Tugendhat, on Huawei, and Johnny Mercer, on the prosecution of soldiers who served in Northern Ieland during the Troubles. But even those exchanges did not light up the session.</p> \n  <p>And that begs the second question. For the past few months, as it has hamstrung the executive and vetoed Brexit, the Commons has seemed more powerful than ever. But today as soon as the subject switched away from Brexit, it sounded irrelevant. How could that be?</p> \n  <p>It is because both are functions of no one party having a majority. MPs can block Brexit, but they don\u2019t seem to be able to do anything else. All-powerful and powerless at the same time, that\u2019s the paradox of this parliament.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-02T07:33:16.568Z\">at 8.33am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cc987f18f08d5e277b58473\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-01T11:51:44.445Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Diana Johnson</strong> asks why Ireland has been so much better at providing compensation for those affected by the infected blood scandal than the UK.</p> \n  <p>May says an independent inquiry is underway.

It was about the link between capitalism and imperialism, and Hobson argued that the desire to open up foreign markets was driven by excess capital at home. His thesis was influential with Marxist, and you can see why it appealed to Jeremy Corbyn, who wrote an approving introduction to a new edition published in 2011.</p> \n  <p>But there\u2019s a problem. Many of the banks and financial houses described by Hobson were run by Jews and there is a clear strain of antisemitism running through the book.</p> \n  <p>This has all been flagged up today by the Times columnist and Conservative peer <strong>Daniel Finkelstein</strong> who quotes this passage from Imperialism. Hobson wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>These great businesses \u2014 banking, booking, bill discounting, loan floating, company promoting \u2014 form the central ganglion of international capitalism. United by the strongest bonds of organisation, always in closest and quickest touch with one as other, situated in the very heart of the business capital of every state, controlled, so far as Europe is concerned, by men of a single and peculiar race, who have behind them many centuries of financial experience, they are in a unique position to control the policy of nations ...</p> \n   <p>Does anyone seriously suppose that a great war could be undertaken by any European state, or a great state loan subscribed, if the house of Rothschild and its connections set their face against it?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamWagner1/status/1123345710949261314\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You can find the whole of Hobson's Imperialism: A Study here <a href=\"https://t.co/gLzwKyhNBX\">https://t.co/gLzwKyhNBX</a><br><br>Here is a longer excerpt of the bit about the \"men of a single and peculiar race\" which concludes by mentioning the House of Rothschild (page 63-64) <a href=\"https://t.co/NRdhMmFKSj\">pic.twitter.com/NRdhMmFKSj</a></p>\u2014 Adam Wagner (@AdamWagner1) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamWagner1/status/1123345710949261314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/corbyn-s-praise-for-deeply-antisemitic-book-6jfcmh5fp\">his column (paywall)</a> Finkelstein also quotes more explicitly antisemitic views expressed by Hobson in an earlier book. And he concludes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Corbyn is praising as \u201ccorrect and prescient\u201d a directly antisemitic analysis.</p> \n   <p>Did Mr Corbyn not read the book before he praised it?

      "bodyText": "This from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby who says Williamson wanted police involvement as he \u201cwould have been cleared\u201d. The UK\u2019s first female defence secretary Penny Mordaunt will continue in her role at the Government Equalities Office, which has responsibility for \u201cgender and LGBT equality\u201d, says the Ministry of Defence. She was minister of state for the armed forces from 2015 to 2016. The Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson is also calling for the police to investigate the leak. She\u2019s written to Met police commissioner Cressida Dick, asking her to investigate if the leak is a breach of the Official Secrets Act. Gavin Williamson denies being behind the leak. The Conservative and Labour parties both say they welcome the recall petition in Peterborough to unseat disgraced ex-Labour whip Fiona Onasanya. More than 7,000 constituents voted to trigger a byelection. The Conservative\u2019s parliamentary candidate for Peterborough, Paul Bristow, said: \u201cThe people of Peterborough deserve a better MP who will vote in parliament to deliver Brexit. I\u2019m delighted this result gives local people the chance to make their voices heard and vote for a better MP \u2013 and it will be a choice between Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour candidate and me.\u201d He pledged: \u201cI\u2019ll be fighting hard throughout this campaign to show why it is only a Conservative MP who can truly tackle crime and deliver the jobs and investment Peterborough needs, as well as to ensure Brexit is a success for the local community.\u201d Labour\u2019s party chair, Ian Lavery MP, said: \u201cLabour campaigned hard for a victory in this recall petition.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re delighted they will now have the chance to vote for a Labour MP in our excellent candidate, Lisa Forbes. Labour will move the writ tomorrow.\u201d He pledged the party would fight \u201cvigorously\u201d to retain the seat and also said it was a two-horse race, with the choice between Labour and the Conservatives. \u201cThe voters of Peterborough will have a stark choice: between the Tories who have cut police numbers while crime is rising, or Labour who will put more bobbies on the beat and cut crime; the Conservatives who are destroying our NHS, or Labour who will provide the doctors and nurses local hospitals in the region desperately need. \u201cAnd voters will have the choice between a Labour party which will invest to create high-skilled, well-paid jobs, or the Tory policies that have left too many people here in Peterborough striving but barely surviving.\u201d Meanwhile, Nigel Farage said his Brexit party will also field a candidate, giving rise to speculation that he could throw his hat into the ring for a seat in Westminster. Labour MP Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, has called for a police investigation. She said: \u201cThe Tories are in chaos and incapable of sorting out their own crisis. Conservative infighting has undermined the basic functioning of government, and has now potentially put security at risk. The police must urgently investigate.\u201d The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has commented on Gavin Williamson\u2019s departure but said he thought there \u201cwas no alternative outcome\u201d. Arriving in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, he said: \u201cOn a personal level I\u2019m very sorry about what happened for Gavin\u2019s sake, but given the gravity of the situation there was no other alternative outcome.\u201d How the investigation unfolded It took just a over week from the UK\u2019s National Security Council meeting on 23 April to the sacking of Gavin Williamson, according to a timeline from the Press Association. The next day the Daily Telegraph newspaper revealed Theresa May had agreed to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain\u2019s new 5G network - despite security concerns raised by cabinet minsters at the meeting. Labour called for an investigation and, on 25 April, Dominic Grieve \u2013 who chairs the parliamentary intelligence and security committee \u2013 said the leak was \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d. Home secretary Sajid Javid said it was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d for any minister to release sensitive information. Gavin Williamson and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt denied they were responsible and Williamson said neither he nor any of his team had \u201cdivulged information from the National Security Council\u201d. On 26 April, ministers who were at the NSC meeting were reportedly told by cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill to confess or deny if they were behind the leak. Sources close to international trade secretary Liam Fox and international development secretary Penny Mordaunt denied either were involved. On 27 April, reports emerged that cabinet members were expected to be summoned for interviews as part of a formal inquiry. Ministers and their aides were reportedly given questionnaires to fill in, explaining where they were in the hours after the NSC meeting. China\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, defended Huawei, calling on the government to act independently and resist external pressure. The next day Jeremy Hunt said he was quizzed as part of the investigation and was prepared to hand over his phone, adding that the UK should exercise \u201ca degree of caution\u201d about the role of large Chinese firms such as Huawei. On 29 April, the US delivered a warning that there is no safe level of involvement by Chinese tech giant Huawei in the 5G networks of western powers. And on 1 May Gavin Williamson was sacked as defence secretary after the inquiry into the leak. Meanwhile the commentators are predicting the likely atmosphere in parliament, with the Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire suggesting Labour will shout out the name of the departing defence secretary next time national security threats are mentioned. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Peter Walker says Theresa May \u201cconsiders the matter closed\u201d and there\u2019s no need for a police investigation Earlier I said there was no modern precedent for a minister being sacked as a result of a leak inquiry. (See 5.59pm.) In 1986 Leon Brittan did resign after approving the leak of a letter from the solicitor general attacking Michael Heseltine over Westland. But it is not an exact parallel. Number 10 did not need to conduct a genuine leak inquiry on that occasion because they knew full well who was responsible; Downing Street itself had ordered the leak. Margaret Thatcher feared that the subsequent Commons debate would bring her down but she survived, partly because it was felt Neil Kinnock did not quite nail the case for the prosecution. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Catherine Avery is taking over now. Gavin Williamson has released his letter to the PM. In it he says that he was not involved \u201cin any way\u201d in this leak and that he accepts the assurances of his staff about their not being involved. This is from Sky\u2019s Alistair Bunkall. Tonight we\u2019ve had the appointment of the first female defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt. In another first, Fiona Onasanya has become the first MP to face recall. There will be a byelection in her Peterborough constituency after more than 10% of registered voters signed a petition demanding one following her conviction for lying about a speeding ticket. The recall process was introduced by the coalition government, but the only previous attempt to use it failed because the petition launched after the DUP MP Ian Paisley was suspended from the Commons did not hit the 10% threshold. Onasanya is free to stand in the byelection but as she has been expelled from Labour she would have to stand as an independent and would therefore have almost no chance of winning. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. Rory Stewart, the justice minister, has been appointed international development secretary. That is an unusual example of a minister being appointed to a job for which he is well qualified. Stewart, a former diplomat, has extensive experience of Iraq, where he helped administer a province after the war, and Afghanistan, where he set up a development NGO. In a recent interview with the Spectator, he said he was good at helping countries to recover. He was talking about why he might stand as a candidate to replace the prime minister \u2013 arguing that his experience rebuilding war-torn Iraq would be useful for Brexit Britain. It might not have been the best argument to advance to Tory activists, but it explains why he will relish this job. He said: Difficult periods need different types of people. One of the reasons why I would be tempted towards this job is that we desperately need to rebuild ourselves internationally after Brexit. I am one of the only people in parliament who is a genuine specialist ... That\u2019s been my life. I\u2019ve written four books about it, done three television documentaries about it, I\u2019ve taught it at Harvard, I\u2019ve spent more than a decade living in funny countries and working there. I\u2019ve done it as a developer, as a diplomat, I\u2019ve done it in war zones. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has called for a criminal investigation into Gavin Williamson. He said: This story cannot begin and end with dismissal from office. What is at stake is the capacity of our security services to give advice at the highest level. This must now be referred to the Metropolitan police for a thorough criminal investigation into breaches of the Official Secrets Act. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, has been made defence secretary. In her new role, she will also continue as minister for women and equalities, No 10 says. Mordaunt is a former junior minister at the Ministry of Defence. As MP for Portsmouth North, she has good links with the navy with whom she serves as a reservist. Here is Theresa May\u2019s letter to Gavin Williamson sacking him. There is no precedent in modern times for a cabinet minister being sacked as a result of a leak inquiry. In fact, it is hard to think of a precedent for any leak inquiry actually reaching a conclusion. Hugh Dalton did resign as chancellor in 1947 after giving information about his budget to an evening paper lobby journalist shortly before he delivered it. A short paragraph got published before the speech had been delivered, and he resigned. But there was no great mystery at the time about what had happened, and Dalton never denied being responsible - unlike Williamson, who issued a statement last week denying he had given the Huawei story to the Daily Telegraph. Downing Street has just put out this press release: The prime minister has this evening asked Gavin Williamson to leave the government, having lost confidence in his ability to serve in the role of defence secretary and as a member of her cabinet. The prime minister\u2019s decision has been informed by his conduct surrounding an investigation into the circumstances of the unauthorised disclosure of information from a meeting of the National Security Council. The prime minister thanks all members of the National Security Council for their full cooperation and candour during the investigation and considers the matter closed. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s evidence to the Commons liaison committee. As expected, she did not exactly open the book on her entire Brexit strategy (such as there is one). But there were various things that she said that we had not heard before. Just as importantly, she struck a slightly new tone. She has now given up even pretending that no deal would be more acceptable than a bad deal. And in the past at these sessions, the most tetchy exchanges have always been those between May and Yvette Cooper, her Labour shadow in the 2010-15 parliament who now chairs the Commons home affairs committee. But no longer. May v Cooper was abrasive, but the two MPs who clearly infuriated her most were the Tory Brexiters Sir Bernard Jenkin and Sir Bill Cash. Maybe John Peet is right (see 3.30pm) and she\u2019s finally had it with the ERG. Here are the main points. May hinted that the government and Labour were closer in what they want on a customs union than people realise. Labour says it wants a customs union with the EU, while the government says it just wants a customs arrangement. Speaking to Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, she said: One of the discussions we have been having ... is the whole question about customs arrangements for the future. Various terms are used in relation to customs. Sometimes people use different terms to mean the same thing. And later she told Cooper: We are sitting down [with Labour] and talking about what it is that we both want to achieve in relation [to customs]. I think actually there is a greater commonality in terms of some of the benefits of a customs union that we have already identified between ourselves and the official opposition. May also stressed that the political declaration already agreed with the EU allowed for a \u201cspectrum\u201d of outcomes on customs in the future trade talks. In her opening statement she also said she hoped the cross-party talks could result in a deal. She said: We\u2019ve been having constructive, meaningful talks which are continuing. There are differences on issues but on many of the key areas - particularly on the withdrawal agreement - there is common ground. We know that we need to end this uncertainty and do it as soon as possible and I hope a deal can be done. We certainly approach this with an open mind. She said there was a chance for the UK to use Brexit to develop \u201cworld-leading\u201d border technology. This came when Cooper cast doubt on whether technological solutions were available that could minimise delays at the border. May replied: I don\u2019t accept the bigger picture you have set out. I know the reference you have made to technology but an awful lot of work has been done on technology that is available at the borders and the opportunities that the UK has, actually. I think there is an opportunity today for the UK to be introducing ways of dealing with these issues at our borders that could be world-leading. One of the problems with this debate has consistently been that very often it\u2019s framed in terms of existing models and it\u2019s important for us to be looking at the new models that are available and can be used in these areas. May hinted that the planned Brexit transition might have to be extended beyond December 2020. Asked if there would be enough time to conclude a UK-EU trade deal by the end of next year, when the transition is due to end, May replied: Obviously the time has been reduced in relation to that ... It is still possible to achieve it by the end of December 2020. When asked if that meant she was ruling out an extension to the transition, she again said it was \u201cpossible\u201d to conclude the final deal by the end of next year, but she also said the withdrawal agreement would allow the transition to be extended. May admitted that the planned three-year spending review, due to be announced this summer, could be scaled back if the Brexit deal is not passed. The review, which will cover spending starting from the 2020-21 financial year, could cover jsut one year, she conceded. (See 3.57pm.) She said parliament would not approve a no-deal Brexit. Asked if it was impossible to leave the EU without a deal, she replied: What I think is that parliament will act to insist the UK government is not willing to leave without a deal. Actually leaving without a deal is not entirely in the hands of the UK government because the issue of the extensions to article 50 rests with the whole of the EU sitting around that table. Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, goes next. He is asking about Huawei. (This must have been scheduled at the last minute. Huawei was not included in a list of topics to be covered released by the committee this morning.) Q: Do you accept that the Chinese regime engages in systematic cyber espionage against us? May says the UK is willing to call out those people who are engaged in this. There are state players and non-state players doing this. Q: Do you accept that Huawei is deeply linked to the Chinese state and its hostile intelligence agencies? May says Huawei is a private company. But May says she is very concerned about protecting national security. Q: You are not contradicting me when I say it is intimately linked to the Chinese state. May says it is a private company. But the government has put considerable resources into cyber security. Q: Why did David Lidington say legally speaking Huawei was a private company. Isn\u2019t that vacuous given it is legally obliged to cooperate with the communist Chinese regime? May says what is important is how you deal with cyber security. She says Huawei products are closely reviewed. The most recent review found no evidence of state interference. Lewis concludes by telling May she should read the unredacted copy of a report addressing this produced by the intelligence and security committee. He suggests that, if she does read it, she will realise that Huawei is suspect. And that\u2019s it. The hearing is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: People are annoyed at how Brexit has held up policy on other issues. When will the social care green paper being published? May says it is not the case that all work on this has been shelved. Q: But the green paper is ready. When will it be published? May says she recognises how strongly people feel about this. This is a short-term, a medium-term and a long-term issue, she says. The green paper will be published \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d. Q: But when? May says Wollaston is assuming that there is a completed green paper. She does not accept that. May says she thinks it is still possible to negotiate the final trade deal by the end of 2020. May says it is \u201cpossible\u201d that the final Brexit deal could be concluded by December next year - implying there is a good chance the transition may have to be extended. Q: Would you rather pass your deal by compromising with Labour on a customs union? Or by offering a confirmatory vote? May says she does not accept the premise of this. She hopes to get an agreement with Labour. But there are a number of issues to resolve. Sarah Wollaston, the Change UK MP who chairs the liaison committee, goes next. Q: Shouldn\u2019t the final deal be put to the people? May says she has not changed her view since she last discussed this with Wollaston. MPs must abide by the result of the referendum, she says. David TC Davies, the Conservative chair of the Welsh affairs committee, goes next. Q: If MPs do not pass a deal, would you prefer no-deal, or no Brexit? May says she wants a deal to pass. Q: Can I conclude you would not support a no-deal Brexit? May says the best option is to have a deal. And she says, if it looks as if there will be no-deal, parliament has made it clear it will act to prevent this. The withdrawal agreement does not give everyone what they want. But it is the best option available. Q: Do you think cabinet ministers have undermined you? May says it is important to leave with a deal. Q: The failure to leave on 29 March is a failure, isn\u2019t it? May says she wanted to leave then and voted for it. But others would not. Q: Why can\u2019t you accept Scotland having the same autonomy in the UK as the UK does in the EU? The EU can\u2019t stop the UK holding a referendum. May says her view is that Scotland has had an independence referendum. Q: What do you feel about calling a climate change emergency? May says climate change is one of the biggest problems facing the world. But the term \u201cemergency\u201d suggests something that has just arisen. That is not the case, she says. This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. The SNP\u2019s Angus Brendan MacNeil, the chair of the international trade committee, goes next. Q: You used to say there were three options: a deal, no-deal or revoking article 50. Now you are raising a second referendum as an option. (See 3.04pm.) What has changed? May says she does not accept that there has been a change. Q: So why did you mention a second referendum? Because some MPs have floated the idea, she says. Q: There have been 120 governors of the Bank of England, all of them men. Would you like the next one to be a woman? May says she does encourage women to apply for top jobs. Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business committee, goes next. Q: The chief whip reportedly told cabinet yesterday that they had to go for a second referendum or a customs union. (See 9.26am.) Do you agree with him? May says she will not comment on what was said at cabinet. Q: Do you agree with what Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said yesterday about Tory MPs not approving a customs union. May says it depends what you mean by customs union. She says it is not always clear what people mean. Q: Do you support higher fees for EU students? May says no final decisions have been made on this. Q: Would higher fees discourage students from coming? May says higher fees have not discouraged other foreign students from coming. But she wants people to come here for the quality of the educations. Q: If fees were higher for UK students wanting to study abroad, would that help in the fight against burning injustices. May says there are excellent universities here in the UK. Q: So you are relaxed about higher fees for EU students here, and UK students studying abroad. May says it is the quality of education that counts. She says it is not for her to decide what other countries charge. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee, goes next. Q: Are you concerned about Brexit uncertainty costing business hundreds of millions of pounds? May says she thinks investment will be unleashed if there is a Brexit deal. Q: So would you like to get a deal as soon as possible, rather than wait until October? May confirms that is the case. Q: Have you got a date in mind for when MPs might vote on this again? May says she wants to do it as soon as possible, and \u201cwell before that extension deadline [31 October] comes into play\u201d. Q: What will you do about the spending review? May says the chancellor also wants a deal soon. If there were to be no deal agreed soon, the Treasury would have to decide what to do about the spending review. Q: Do you have a plan? Would there be a one-year review instead of a three-year one? May says that has yet to be decided. May says the three-year spending review due this summer could be scaled back if the Brexit deal is not passed. Q: Will there be a revised economic impact assessment if you propose a different plan? May says the government would have to consider that. The economic analysis published last year did cover various scenarios, she says. She says she would want parliament to have the information it would need to be well informed. Q: Do you share my frustration that the NI border is being used as an excuse by the EU to be difficult? If there were to be no deal, both sides would want to keep the border open. May says she will not comment on the EU. But at the heart of the Good Friday agreement is a compromise: people can be Northern Ireland citizens, and free to travel to Ireland easily. That is important to preserve. Andrew Murrison, the Conservative chair of the Northern Ireland committee, goes next. Q: You said a few weeks ago the UK was not ready to leave without a deal on 29 March because not enough work had been done in Northern Ireland. What has been done since? May says the government has now being working with the Irish government to revive talks aimed at restoring the Northern Ireland executive. Cooper says it feels like they are going \u201caround in circles\u201d. Q: Are you ruling out any change to the government\u2019s position on customs? May says she is having discussions with Labour on a range of issues. They have similar aims. They both want to protect jobs. How that can be achieved has not been wholly identified, she says. Cooper says is really worried that, if May does not shift, the UK will just be stuck. Cooper says there are three solutions to tariffs: the Chequers plan for collecting tariffs for the EU; new technology; and actually staying in the customs union. Which is it? May says the government is still discussing this with Labour. But she does not accept Cooper\u2019s claim that the technological solution are not available. She says there is a chance to produce a \u201cworld-leading\u201d approach to customs. Q: It sounds like you are ruling out being part of the common external tariff. In or out? May says the government has set out in the political declaration a spectrum of options on this, for further discussion. The government is discussing this with Labour. It will find out if there is a possible \u201clanding zone\u201d for a deal. Q: It sounds like you are stuck. Your definition of compromise seems to be everyone else saying you were right. What evidence is there that you might move? May says she has shown a willingness to compromise on other issues. On customs, it is important to sit down and \u201ctease out\u201d the different elements. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, goes next. Q: Are you still ruling out the UK being part of the common external tariff? May says, if the UK wants to have trade agreements on goods, it needs to be able to vary tariffs. Q: So are you ruling out being in the common external tariff for goods? May says under the government\u2019s plans the UK would be able to have a CET with the EU, but different tariffs for the rest of the world. Q: So are you going back to the Chequers plan for the UK to be able to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. May says the political declaration makes it clear that this issue is yet to be resolved. Q: So it sounds you are not shifting on customs. You talk about compromise. But has nothing changed? May says, in the talks with Labour, both sides are talking about what they want to achieve. There is \u201ca greater commonality in terms of some of the benefits of the customs union\u201d that they have identified, she says. Can we come to an agreement? \u201cI hope we will be able to,\u201d May says. This is from the Economist\u2019s John Peet. Stephen McPartland, the Conservative who chairs the regulatory reform committee, goes next. May says the government is looking at how commitments given by the government on workers\u2019 rights can be guaranteed. Sir Patrick McLoughlin, Tory chair of the European statutory instruments committee, goes next. Q: Would you now rule out leaving without a deal? She says parliament will act to insist the UK government will not leave without a deal. But this is not entirely in the hands of the government, she says. It is also up to the EU. McLoughlin urges the government to reconsider its decision not to publish the bill. Cash says the UK will be subject to EU laws passed beyond closed doors. That amounts to \u201ccastrating parliament\u201d, he says. May says, during the transition, there will not be time for new laws to be introduced and negotiated and agreed. Cash rejects that, saying there is a procedure allowing MPs to be accelerated. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European scrutiny committee, goes next. May says she does not accept his argument that the UK will continue to see the ECJ having a remit in the UK after Brexit. Cash reminds May he said she should resign three weeks ago. Q: Why have you not published the EU withdrawal agreement bill? May says the government will publish it when the work on it is over. Q: But the agreement has been concluded. May says more work is going on. For example, the government is incorporating the Gareth Snell amendment in the bill. Bernard Jenkin, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, goes next. Q: You were not obliged at the EU summit to accept an article 50 extension, were you? May says parliament had passed legislation calling for this. Q: But it just required you to seek an extension. May says this was an act of parliament. If you are obliged to seek an extension, the implication is that you are also required to accept it. She says, if she had asked for an extension and been given it by the EU, and if she had then turned it down, that would have looked very odd. Jenkin says, if she had asked the attorney general, she would have been told she was not obliged to agree an extension. Q: Is it right that you will not leave the EU without a deal? May says she stands by what she has said in the past about no deal being better than a bad deal. When she first made that argument, at Lancaster House, she was talking in the abstract. Now she has a deal, and a good one. Q: So if the Commons refuses to approve a deal, you will want the UK to stay in indefinitely. May says the UK will only stay in if article 50 is revoked. Q: Would the votes include a second referendum? May says neither the government nor the opposition is proposing this. Q: Will the options being put to MPs include a customs union? May says the government would discuss this with Labour. Q: Will it include a customs union? May repeats her answer. Hilary Benn, the Labour MP asking the questions, says he would expect Labour to propose this, since it is their policy. May says various terms are used, and sometimes they mean the same thing. May suggests Labour\u2019s customs union policy and the government\u2019s are very similar. May says the talks with Labour have been \u201cconstructive\u201d and \u201cmeaningful\u201d. She hopes a deal can be done with Labour. If not, the government will bring it to the Commons and hold a series of votes. She says there are four choices: leaving with a deal, leaving without a deal, holding a referendum, or revoking article 50. May says there are four choices facing MPs: leaving with a deal, leaving without a deal, holding a referendum, or revoking article 50. (Is this a hint as to the options that the government might put to MPs if it holds its own indicative votes?) Theresa May is giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee. The session should last 90 minutes, and it will be all about Brexit. Gove says he hopes to have the chance over dinner with the US president Donald Trump when he visits the UK to make it clear to him that he needs to take climate change seriously. Gove says the UK has cut its carbon emissions faster than any other G7 country since 2010. That has happened because of a partnership between government and the private sector, he says. He says it is important to ensure that dealing with climate change does not hold back economic growth, because that growth is necessary to trigger the innovation that will led to new ways of tackling climate change. But he says that he accepts the government needs to do more. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, asks Gove if he agrees that the socialist command-and-control economies of Eastern Europe have the worst record on the environment. Gove agrees. He cites Venezuela as another example. Gove says the government is spending \u00a35bn every year helping developing nations deal with climate change. Gove says five of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2010. A warming world would result in the desertification of large parts of the earth, he says. Gove says climate change is a crisis that all politicians have to meet. He says the first politician to make this clear was Margaret Thatcher. She was a Christian who believed in stewardship, and scientist who believed in the facts. There is a \u201cgreen thread of ambition\u201d running through Conservative thought, he says. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says Gove\u2019s words are \u201choneyed\u201d, but we need to see action too. She says if Gove is serious, he must accept the need to cancel the third runway at Heathrow. She says aircraft travel could end up accounting for two fifths of UK emissions. In response, Gove says his department is working on plans to make honey for environmentally sustainable. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is responding now. He says Theresa May wanted to be present for this debate, but cannot attend because she is giving evidence to the liaison committee later. Corbyn says we have a chance to act. This opportunity won\u2019t be available to other generations. It is for this generation to take it, he says. Corbyn says the UK government\u2019s attempts to cut carbon emissions do not go far enough. He says an emergency does not have to be a catastrophe. He says this could be used as an excuse to rebuild the economy. Corbyn says he was very disappointed by the recent statements made by Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, about the Amazon rain forest. He says the world is in danger of making extinct species that it has not yet discovered. Corbyn says austerity has reduced the UK\u2019s capacity to respond to climate disasters. The UK must take serious steps on debt relief to help countries around the world respond to climate change. He says UK aid should not fund fossil fuel projects. Corbyn says homes must be made more energy efficient. And he says there must be more investment in cycling and in public transports. He also calls for forests to be expanded. Sadly, the UK has some of the lowest levels of forest coverage in Europe. Corbyn says he would like to see coalfield areas becoming hubs for industries like batteries and energy storage. And he says basic products should be flown across the world if they can be transported in a more environmentally-friendly way. Corbyn says David Attenborough said in his \u201cbrilliant\u201d recent programme on climate change that the world stood at a turning point. The future of life on the planet was at stake, he says. If there is a climate emergency, radical and urgent action must be taken, he says. He says global emissions will have to fall by 45% by 2030. The hidden hand of the market will not save us, he says. And technological solutions will not emerge out of nowhere, he says. Corbyn says massive government intervention is needed to develop technological answers. Corbyn says air pollution is damaging children in cities around the world, before they reach the age of five. And it is working-class communities that suffer most. The better off, who are often the most responsible, can pay their way out of trouble, he says. He says some of the 60m refugees in the world today are climate refugees. Steve Brine, a Conservative MP, asks where coal fits in Labour\u2019s vision of a low-carbon future. Corbyn says he is coming on to that. He wants carbon reduction, he says. Justine Greening, the Tory former cabinet minister, says Corbyn is being too party political. Is he willing to agree a cross-party approach to climate change? Corbyn says he is willing to talk to anyone on this issue. He says he sat down with other leaders recently when they met Greta Thunberg. Philip Dunne, a Conservative, asks Corbyn if he regrets saying coal mines should be reopened when he stood for the Labour leadership in 2015. Corbyn says he does not regret anything he said in that contest. He says the way coalfield communities in places like south Wales were treated under the Tories was disgraceful. Corbyn says he joined WWF as a schoolchild. He says WWF says 60% of birds, mammals and reptiles have been lost since 1970, a year many MPs can remember. Corbyn says he hopes the UK can host the climate change conference in 2020. The UK must make it clear to President Trump that he needs to re-engage with the Paris climate change agreement. But that agreement is not enough, he says. He says even if every country met its obligations, there would be a 3C rise in global temperatures. That would mean southern Europe, the horn of Africa, central America and the Caribbean facing permanent drought. And cities like Miami and Rio de Janeiro would be lost to rising sea levels. Corbyn says in his time as an MP he has learnt that change does not come from politicians. It comes from the people. Colin Clark, the Conservative MP, asks Corbyn if he accepts that natural gas has done a great deal to promote decarbonisation. Will Corbyn protect jobs in this sector? Corbyn says, if Clark is asking about fracking, Labour is opposed to that. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, intervenes to say she is glad to see Corbyn is following the Green party\u2019s lead. Corbyn says he and Lucas are on exactly the same side on this issue. Corbyn says it was inspiring to see schoolchildren protesting about climate change outside parliament recently. He says it was humbling having children out there determined to teach adult politicians the importance of tackling climate change. Jeremy Corbyn is opening the Labour debate on climate change. Here is the Labour motion. It is saying the Commons should declare a climate emergency. That this house declares an environment and climate emergency following the finding of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change that to avoid a more than 1.5\u00b0C rise in global warming, global emissions would need to fall by around 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero by around 2050; recognises the devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on UK food production, water availability, public health and through flooding and wildfire damage; notes that the UK is currently missing almost all of its biodiversity targets, with an alarming trend in species decline, and that cuts of 50% to the funding of Natural England are counterproductive to tackling those problems; calls on the government to increase the ambition of the UK\u2019s climate change targets under the Climate Change Act 2008 to achieve net zero emissions before 2050, to increase support for and set ambitious, short-term targets for the roll-out of renewable and low carbon energy and transport, and to move swiftly to capture economic opportunities and green jobs in the low carbon economy while managing risks for workers and communities currently reliant on carbon intensive sectors; and further calls on the government to lay before the house within the next six months urgent proposals to restore the UK\u2019s natural environment and to deliver a circular, zero waste economy. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said that while the Labour leader absolutely condemned the antisemitism in the John Hobson book (see 11.01am), he did not believe it was wrong to write the foreword, saying the issue had been exaggerated by inaccurate reporting. The book, the spokesman said, had been praised by other politicians but was \u201cclearly a text of its time and its era\u201d, adding that it also included \u201cracially offensive phraseology\u201d about other groups. Jeremy\u2019s foreword was talking about the broad ideas around imperialism and Hobson\u2019s analysis, and how they applied to today. He wasn\u2019t writing an introduction to the book so he doesn\u2019t talk about either of these things. Asked if Corbyn should apologise given the worries expressed by the Jewish Labour Group and others, the spokesman said some of the blame should be placed on the media. I would say that it\u2019s not surprising given the way some of these things are reported. It doesn\u2019t just apply to this story, but quite a few others. It\u2019s not surprising that people reading that think that Jeremy or other people in the Labour party are saying things that they\u2019re clearly not. Asked if Corbyn stood by the foreword, the spokesman said he did, adding: It was fine to write a foreword to Hobson\u2019s Imperialism and to talk about the big issues it raised. Number 10 has not ruled out Theresa May backing a customs union with the EU, the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves reports. Being outside the customs union will not automatically mean the UK can strike a trade deal with the US, experts have told the Brexit select committee today. Sam Lowe, research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said the government may have to make a choice between China and the US if it exits the EU without a customs deal. He told the committee: The US have specified if you do a deal with China, they are going to have some issues in their agreement with you, so you are put in this awkward situation of having to chose. The issue of the UK\u2019s alignment with the EU\u2019s customs union post Brexit is one of the critical focuses of the current talks between the government and Labour. Economist Ruth Lea said remaining in the customs union but not in the EU would be \u201cthe worst possible world\u201d because the UK would not have a say in any deal the EU struck with third countries. But Lowe said the realpolitik was that deals with third countries were difficult to seal. He said a trade deal with India was highly unlikely and he was not convinced that the British public had the appetite some of the hard Brexiters for a US trade deal. Does leaving the customs union grant you some opportunities?. Yes possibly, I would argue they are not as wide as people might argue. Then you have to look at what is the trade off? What is the economic benefit of these new agreements versus us being in a customs union. As it stands there is no economic evidence to suggest that the new free trade agreements would compensate us for the loss of leaving the customs union, there are potentially political awards in that you can announce to the public that we have a new trade agreement with the US and it makes a good headline, but from economic perspective less so. PMQs - Snap verdict: An exceptionally dull PMQs, but one which raised a particularly interesting question, or rather two. The main one, obviously, is why, during a session lasting more than three quarters of an hour, not one MP asked about Brexit? It remains the biggest crisis facing the country for decades. The situation is unresolved, and the government is deadlocked. Yet no one could be bothered to ask May what might happen next. Why? It is not that it does not matter anymore. And there is no evidence to suggest that MPs have suddenly stopped caring, that Mark Francois has come back from his Easter hols having resolved that EU membership isn\u2019t that bad after all, or that Ben Bradshaw has changed his mind about a second referendum. May will be answering questions about Brexit at the liaison committee this afternoon. But no MP ever passes up a chance to raise an issue they care about on the grounds that someone else might ask the question later. So why the conspiracy of silence? I can think of two possible reasons - one robust, and the other more speculative. First, there are local elections in England and Northern Ireland tomorrow and for the two main parties, the Conservatives and Labour, Brexit has probably become an electoral millstone. The Tories are ashamed at their failure to deliver it, and Labour\u2019s policy is an elaborate fence-sitting exercise that leaves it open to attack from both sides. The biggest party in the Commons with a Brexit record it might actually be proud of is the SNP, and it is probably no coincidence that the only Brexit-related question (although it sounded more like one about higher education) came from Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster. As for a speculative explanation, it felt like the Commons is still incapacitated by Brexit ennui. Like the rest of the population, MPs might just be fed up with it all. In the endless debates before Easter every conceivable Brexit theory and argument has been raised, and no one seems to have any plausible idea as to how the deadlock can be broken. It felt as if they did not say anything about Brexit because there was nothing left to say. So instead we had a PMQs devoted to an array of domestic issues. They may have been important, but none of the exchanges crackled with the energy you get when great matter are at stake, or reputations are being won or lost. Jeremy Corbyn focused on poverty and public services and, although he very effectively exposed the big gap between May\u2019s aspirations when she became PM and her record (her defence of government policy was even more lacklustre than usual), it nevertheless felt low key. May came under just as much pressure from the Tories Tom Tugendhat, on Huawei, and Johnny Mercer, on the prosecution of soldiers who served in Northern Ieland during the Troubles. But even those exchanges did not light up the session. And that begs the second question. For the past few months, as it has hamstrung the executive and vetoed Brexit, the Commons has seemed more powerful than ever. But today as soon as the subject switched away from Brexit, it sounded irrelevant. How could that be? It is because both are functions of no one party having a majority. MPs can block Brexit, but they don\u2019t seem to be able to do anything else. All-powerful and powerless at the same time, that\u2019s the paradox of this parliament. Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson asks why Ireland has been so much better at providing compensation for those affected by the infected blood scandal than the UK. May says an independent inquiry is underway. But she agrees that it should have been launched earlier. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. Sir David Amess, a Conservative, asks about the Music Man project, for children with disabilities, and says Southend should get city status. May praises the work of Music Man. And she commends Amess for his city status campaign. This is from the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman, who ran the marathon for charity. The Conservative Jeremy Lefroy asks May if she will ensure Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who remains in jail in Iran, that she has not been forgotten. May says she and the foreign secretary constantly raise this case with their Iranian counterparts. The case has not been forgotten, she says. The SNP\u2019s David Linden asks about the problems faced by parents with very sick babies. May says the government is looking at this issue. A minister will discuss this with Linden. Johnny Mercer, a Conservative MP, asks about a former soldier who has been charged with attempted murder over an incident in Northern Ireland over 40 years ago. What is May doing to protect people like this? John Bercow, the Speaker, says MPs must observe sub judice rules. May says the current arrangements in relation to historic deaths in Northern Ireland is not working for anyone. There were more than 3,500 killings. Most were committed by terrorists. Service personnel must be treated fairly, and the government is considering legislation, she says. Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the foreign affairs committee, says the decision to allow Huawei to build part of the new 5G infrastructure is \u201cextraordinary\u201d. The UK will be \u201chosting a dragon\u201d. Why is the UK ignoring the concerns of its allies? May says the UK is reviewing its arrangements for 5G infrastructure. Decisions will be announced in due course. Considerations will include the need for security, and for diversity of supply, she says. Labour\u2019s Teresa Pearce asks about a constituent who went on holiday to Dubai, was forced to sign a confession for a drugs offence and jailed for 25 years. His family have tried to get him transferred back to the UK. But that has not happened, suggesting the prisoner transfer agreement is worthless. May says she will look into this case. This is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard. Labour\u2019s Jim Cunningham asks if May still stands by her manifesto commitment to maintain free TV licences and bus passes for pensioners. May says she stands by her manifesto. The BBC has the money to continue providing free TV licences for over-75s, she says. Marion Fellows, the SNP MP, asks about payday loans. Universal credit is forcing more people to use these companies. Will May stop the roll-out of UC to stop people having to rely on \u201cthese vultures\u201d. May says UC claimants can get 100% advances. And the Scottish government has powers over welfare that it is not using, she says. The SNP\u2019s Deidre Brock asks May to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on Cambridge Analytica visiting Downing Street. She has had a letter from a minister saying no meetings took place. But now the Foreign Office have told her that a series of meetings took place. When did ministers meet Cambridge Analytica or AggregateIQ (AIQ)? May says she has responded to these questions. The UK government publishes more transparency data than the Scottish government, she adds. Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative, asks about a constituent who took her life while suffering from post-natal depression. Will the government do more to support the mental health of mothers returning to work? May sends her condolences to the woman\u2019s family. This is an important issue, she says. The government is looking at a returners\u2019 programme to help people going back to work, especially mothers with young children. Paul Williams, the Labour MP, says people in his constituency are fed up with anti-social behaviour and rising crime. Cleveland police have lost 500 officers. Will May review its funding needs? May says the police are getting more money. But the issue of dealing with crime is not just about policing. It is also about what can be done to turn young people away from crime and violence. That is why she held a knife crime summit last month. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says the Scottish government will match tuition fees for EU students until 2021. Will May match that, or spread a hostile environment? May says the Scottish government has said EU students will get free tuition until 2024, but English students will have to pay. Blackford says May\u2019s policy is blinded by ideology. The government is proposing giving EU students visas for three years. But Scottish university courses normally last four years. Will the government allow students going to Scottish universities four-year visas? May says students in Scotland can convert their visas. She says it is a bit rich for the SNP to accuse her of being ideological. Corbyn says there is an obvious connection between lower police numbers and rising crime. The government has cut council budgets by 50%. Poverty is up and violent crime is up. The government is more concerned about promoting austerity and tackling injustices. Can May explain why things are getting worse? May says the NHS has had it biggest cash boost for years, employment is at record high, and more pupils are in good schools. Conservative councils are the ones that provide the best services, she says. Corbyn says May seems to have her head in the sand. Some \u00a37bn has been cut from adult social care since 2010. We need a strategy to ensure people get the help they need. He turns to crime, and says violent crime is rising. The police have too few staff to investigate. Does May agree there is a violent crime epidemic? May says Corbyn referred to care companies. Referring to Four Seasons going into administration, she says there should be no effect on the elderly in their homes. She accuses Corbyn of quoting crime figures selectively. And she criticises him for voting against tougher laws on knife crime. Corbyn says life expectancy has fallen by six months. Things are getting worse. In one of the richest countries in the world food banks are handing out 14m food parcels a year to people who don\u2019t have enough to eat. May says the best route out of poverty is to be in work. There are record numbers of people in work, she says. She says this government is taking decisions to allow people to keep more money in their pockets. On fuel duty freezes and tax cuts, Labour voted against. Corbyn says many of those getting food parcels are in work. Even Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, said universal credit is making the situation worse. There are 1.4m people who need social care. Does May agree with Damian Green who wants to tax the over-50s and take away their benefits? May says the government has put more money into social care. But is it not just about funding. As some Labour MPs say it is, May says it is also about best practice. Jeremy Corbyn joins May in congratulating those who ran the marathon. He wishes people a happy May Day on international workers\u2019 day. Tomorrow there are local elections, he says. He says May promised to fight against burning social injustices when she became PM. But yesterday the Social Mobility Commission said inequality was entrenched. May starts by saying Corbyn should have welcomed the union. It is the first time he has not welcomed a union in this house, she says. (Her joke falls flat.) She says there is a real commitment in government to tackle inequality. Labour offers failed policies, broken promises and piles of debt. Corbyn says social mobility so going backwards. Life expectancy is falling for the first time since 1945. People can expect to live shorter lives than they did in the past. May says that is not the case. People are not expecting to live shorter lives than in the past. The government is taking steps to ensure people can live healthy lives. The Tories are improving people\u2019s lives. Corbyn has just voted against government policies. John Lamont, a Scottish Conservative, says on this day in 1707 Scotland and England come together to form the United Kingdom. May thanks Lamont for highlighting this. She says all MPs will want to mark this. Under the SNP public services are getting worse because they are focusing on holding another independence referendum. Theresa May starts by sending her best wishes to Chloe Smith, the Cabinet Office minister who has had a baby. She congratulates those MPs, Commons staffers and lobby journalists who took part in the marathon. This is from Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant. PMQs is about to start. I always do a snap summary, but today I will do it at the end of the whole session, not straight after the May/Corbyn exchanges, because May v her party and the Commons is a more important story at the moment than May v the Labour leader. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. BrexitCentral\u2019s Jonathan Isaby has some bad news for journalists ... Nearly 8 million people in Britain eligible to vote in the European elections are not yet registered, my colleague Sarah Marsh reports. The figures have been highlighted by the anti-Brexit campaign, Best for Britain. They have an online tool which enables people to register to vote and to request a postal vote which is available here. The government has has cancelled all its no-deal Brexit contracts with cross-channel ferry companies at a cost of around \u00a350m to the tax payer, it has emerged. The cancellation fee comes on top of the \u00a333m it is paying out to Eurotunnel in an out-of-court settlement over the award of the \u00a3103m ferry contracts in December including two contracts, worth around \u00a390 with DFDS and Brittany Ferries. They were contracted to guarantee transport capacity across the channel for medicines and other critical goods that were put at risk by potential deals in Dover or Calais in the event of a crash out. The decision to cancel the contracts altogether comes just weeks after the government cancelled its no-deal contingency plans on foot of the extension of article 50 to the end of October. It had already cancelled on of the three ferry contracts in February after it emerged the shipping company, Seaborne, would not be able to lease any boats in time. Here is some more comment on the Corbyn/Hobson/antisemitism row. The historian Robert Saunders has posted a thread on Twitter starting here. And here is one of his key posts. My colleague Jonathan Freedland has also posted a Twitter thread on this, starting here. And here is one of his key posts. This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Gideon Rachman. And this is from the Herald\u2019s Iain Macwhirter. Here is Theresa May leaving Number 10 a few minutes ago on her way to the Commons for PMQs. It will be disappointing if we get through PMQs without anyone asking about the Daily Mail splash. And here is how the story starts. Theresa May and six female cabinet members had a night out with the wife of a former Vladimir Putin ally who had donated \u00a3135,000 at a Tory fundraiser. Lubov Chernukhin was entertained by the prime minister at the five-star Goring Hotel in Belgravia on Monday evening. It is understood the banker won the dinner as an auction prize at the Conservative party\u2019s Black and White ball earlier this year. The \u00a3135,000 bid takes Mrs Chernukhin\u2019s donations to the Tories over the past seven years past the \u00a31million mark. The party has insisted that Mrs Chernukhin, now a British citizen, is not a \u2018Putin crony\u2019. But the money will raise fresh questions about the Tories\u2019 links to Russia just a year after the Salisbury spy poisoning. As BuzzFeed\u2019s Alan White points out, if Theresa May is unhappy about the story, she can blame Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who revealed that the dinner had taken place by posting a picture on her Instagram feed. Campaigners fighting to stop the expansion of Heathrow have failed in their attempt to block the new runway in the high court, my colleague Sandra Laville reports. In her various media interviews this morning Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has also been defending Jeremy Corbyn over the latest antisemitism row - this one prompted by a book written by a radical Guardian journalist more than 100 years ago. The writer was John Hobson and the book was Imperialism: A Study, published in 1902. It was about the link between capitalism and imperialism, and Hobson argued that the desire to open up foreign markets was driven by excess capital at home. His thesis was influential with Marxist, and you can see why it appealed to Jeremy Corbyn, who wrote an approving introduction to a new edition published in 2011. But there\u2019s a problem. Many of the banks and financial houses described by Hobson were run by Jews and there is a clear strain of antisemitism running through the book. This has all been flagged up today by the Times columnist and Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein who quotes this passage from Imperialism. Hobson wrote: These great businesses \u2014 banking, booking, bill discounting, loan floating, company promoting \u2014 form the central ganglion of international capitalism. United by the strongest bonds of organisation, always in closest and quickest touch with one as other, situated in the very heart of the business capital of every state, controlled, so far as Europe is concerned, by men of a single and peculiar race, who have behind them many centuries of financial experience, they are in a unique position to control the policy of nations ... Does anyone seriously suppose that a great war could be undertaken by any European state, or a great state loan subscribed, if the house of Rothschild and its connections set their face against it? In his column (paywall) Finkelstein also quotes more explicitly antisemitic views expressed by Hobson in an earlier book. And he concludes: Mr Corbyn is praising as \u201ccorrect and prescient\u201d a directly antisemitic analysis. Did Mr Corbyn not read the book before he praised it? Did he read it but, as with the Mear One mural, not notice that it was antisemitic? Did he realise it but decide it didn\u2019t matter because there were other more important things about it? One thing is clear. The problem of left-wing antisemitism isn\u2019t really about Israel. It\u2019s much more deeply embedded than that. MPs who have criticised Corbyn in the past for his stance about this have seized on this as fresh evidence that the Labour leader is at the very least unduly complacent about antisemitism. This is from Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting. This is from Labour\u2019s Margaret Hodge. And this is from Ian Austin, the MP who resigned from Labour earlier this year over Corbyn\u2019s stance on antisemitism and foreign policy generally. But others are less censorious. This is from Tristram Hunt, the historian and former Labour MP who is not a Corbyn supporter. This is from the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who is sympathetic to Corbyn. These are from Sunder Katwala, a former head of the Fabian Society, the Labour-affiliated thinktank (and not a Corbynite). And this is from the historian Chris Williams. For the record, this is what Rebecca Long-Bailey said about the row. The guy in question was a political thinker of his time, whether you agree with his opinions or not. Numerous Labour and Conservative colleagues have commented on him, whether that\u2019s negatively or positively, taking certain parts of his thinking into consideration. But in no way would the Labour party or Jeremy Corbyn condone any antisemitic comments in any way. And this is what a party spokesperson said about this. Jeremy praised the liberal Hobson\u2019s century-old classic study of imperialism in Africa and Asia. Similarly to other books of its era, Hobson\u2019s work contains outdated and offensive references and observations, and Jeremy completely rejects the antisemitic elements of his analysis. In an interview on the Today programme Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and a member of Labour\u2019s negotiating team in the cross-party Brexit talks, was asked about the reports (see 9.26am) about Theresa May preparing to give in to Labour demands. She said she thought ministers might have to agree to the UK staying in a customs union (Labour\u2019s key demand). \u201cI think pragmatically that they potentially may have no option in order to be able to push this deal through,\u201d she said. She went on: We are fleshing out the details to see how far the government can move towards us and then we will be able to ascertain how far we are able to move towards them. There are certain issues that we think they will be prepared to move on and we might be prepared to support certain positions. There are certain areas which we haven\u2019t seen any movement at all. We want to take a view on the whole package, the whole deal, to see if there has been any true movement. Theresa May is taking PMQs today, and then spending 90 minutes giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee (the one comprising chairs of all the Commons select committees - a sort of Commons captain\u2019s XI, although that might be crediting them with more glory than they deserve). The last time she answered questions in public was almost three weeks ago (her Commons statement after the EU summit agreeing the Brexit delay until October). In theory this means these two sessions should be ripe for producing news, although experience suggests that there is no limit to May\u2019s ability to get through a public grilling without giving anything away. May will be speaking in the context of reports in Conservative- supporting papers claiming she is close to doing a deal with Labour to get her Brexit plan through the Commons. This is from the Daily Mail story, by Jason Groves and Jack Doyle. The Tories may have to accept a permanent customs union to get Brexit through parliament, the cabinet was warned yesterday. In a blunt analysis, the government\u2019s chief whip Julian Smith said there was no chance of passing a version of Mrs May\u2019s deal without Labour\u2019s support \u2013 and warned that the government could be \u2018sunk\u2019 if it tried. A source said Mr Smith told yesterday\u2019s meeting of the cabinet: \u2018It\u2019s a customs union or a second referendum, and we are not having a second referendum.\u2019 Culture secretary Jeremy Wright reportedly said after a 90-minute discussion in No 10: \u2018The options are like being in an acid bath because there are no good options\u2019. And this is from the Daily Telegraph\u2019s version, which is the front page splash. Brexiteers still believe Mrs May can win round Tory rebels by making changes to the Northern Irish backstop, but the prime minister appears increasingly convinced that support from Labour is the only way to get the stable majority she needs for a divorce deal and the trade talks to come. Downing Street sources insisted last night that the government remains opposed to joining a customs union with the EU after Brexit - Labour\u2019s number one demand - but leave supporters fear Mrs May will agree with Labour a form of customs union in all but name. Michael Gove, the environment secretary who campaigned for leave in the EU Referendum, backed Mrs May in yesterday\u2019s meeting, suggesting that the Tories might have to give ground to Labour so that Jeremy Corbyn could claim victory in the talks and sell the deal to his MPs. Mr Gove told ministers that it would be better to have the \u201cunpalatable\u201d outcome of a deal with Labour than the \u201cdisastrous\u201d outcome of Brexit not happening at all ... Sources said Mr Gove argued that if a withdrawal agreement bill - the legislation needed to achieve Brexit with a deal - contained a promise to deliver the \u201cbenefits of a customs union\u201d it would allow a Tory Government to pursue an independent trade policy while leaving a future Labour government room to pursue a full customs union. None of this is confirmed, and it is possible that these stories have been briefed as a pre-emptive hit by ministers who want to stop May doing a deal with Labour. But with luck by the end of the day we may get some clues as to whether or not this speculation looks sound. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: The high court rules on a legal challenge against government plans for a third runway at Heathrow. 10.40am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, publishes a plan to increase Scottish exports. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: Jeremy Corbyn opens a debate on a Labour motion saying the Commons should declare a climate emergency. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, will respond for the government. 3pm: Theresa May gives evidence to the Commons liaison committee about Brexit. 3.15pm: Facebook and Twitter executives give evidence to the joint human rights committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I finish after May\u2019s evidence to the liaison committee. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Penny Mordaunt becomes the UK\u2019s first female defence secretary after being tipped for the job two years ago after the sacking of Michael Fallon. It is a post that seems more suited to her background than her previous job as international development secretary. Mordaunt is a Royal Navy reservist, a former minister for the armed forces and the MP for Portsmouth, home of HMNB Portsmouth. She is also an enthusiastic Brexiter, one of the leading faces on the Vote Leave campaign, but someone who has stayed loyal to the prime minister throughout the rows over the Chequers summit, the withdrawal agreement and the meaningful vote, despite her obvious reservations. Mordaunt\u2019s outspokenness has not always been to her benefit and she was accused by the then prime minister David Cameron of making \u201ca very misleading claim\u201d during the referendum campaign that Britain would not have a veto on Turkey joining the EU. Asked whether Britain had a veto on the issue, Mordaunt had said: \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t.\u201d She then argued: \u201cI do not think that the EU is going to keep Turkey out. I think it is going to join. I think the migrant crisis is pushing it more that way.\u201d Mordaunt has avoided any major gaffes since joining the cabinet to replace Priti Patel, just two weeks after Gavin Williamson replaced Fallon. Her name has been in the frame for the Tory leadership as a dark horse Brexiter candidate without the baggage of Boris Johnson or Michael Gove. She ran the campaign of Andrea Leadsom, now the Commons leader, who conceded to May in the leadership race following the Brexit vote. Mordaunt has a family history in the armed forces. Her father was in the parachute regiment, which she mentioned during her maiden speech in parliament. Known to colleagues as an occasional mischief-maker, she admitted that a speech she delivered on the welfare of poultry had been made with the sole purpose of saying the word \u201ccock\u201d in the House of Commons, imposed as a forfeit by cheeky Royal Navy colleagues during training. At the international development department (DfID), Mordaunt has been an aid budget sceptic and argued for more involvement from the private sector to help the UK meet its 0.7% aid target, remarks that drew stern criticism from the aid sector. She told cabinet ministers she would aim for DfID to become a fundraising department rather than a spending one, telling them it was unsustainable to continue to meet the spending target with taxpayer cash. Mordaunt has also enthusiastically embraced the role of minister for women and equalities, one she will keep. In that role, she has been outspoken on abortion law, privately pushing the prime minister to work to end the ban in Northern Ireland and also oppose Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cglobal gag\u201d which ends US aid to women\u2019s health charities involved in family planning. She has spoken tongue-in-cheek before about the difficulties of being a woman in the armed forces. In her 2014 \u201cloyal address\u201d before the Queen\u2019s speech, she called for the armed forces to become more accessible by highlighting her own training. \u201cI felt that the lecture and practical demonstration on how to care for the penis and testicles in the field failed to appreciate that some of us attending had been issued with the incorrect kit,\u201d she said.",

The probe by Sir Mark Sedwill into who leaked information from a National Security Council meeting last week was different on both counts. The circumstances were also different \u2013 as soon as the Telegraph reported that Chinese firm Huawei would play a role in the UK\u2019s 5G communications network despite the worries of some cabinet ministers, there was anger that such a decision would be divulged to the media. The report appeared in the papers on Wednesday last week. The following day senior Tory Nicholas Soames said the leak would \u201ccause our friends and allies to wonder if we can be considered reliable\u201d, saying that whoever was responsible would be sacked. The official response began the next day as Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, began an inquiry which reportedly involved ministers and their advisers being issued with questionnaires in which they had to explain where they were following Tuesday\u2019s NSC meeting. It is understood that the inquiry was so thorough that even Theresa May and any No 10 team members present at the NSC meeting were asked to account for their subsequent actions. The investigation spread near-panic among some advisers, who are used to briefing journalists in a period rife with leaks when a series of ministers are jostling to become the next prime minister. They were also asked to give details of their mobile phones, with the expectation the inquiry could examine details of relevant calls or messages. Sedwill, who is also the National Security Adviser, ordered ministers to comply by Friday afternoon. The focus immediately fell on cabinet ministers (and their special advisers or other aides) who attended the NSC meeting and were reported to have expressed worries about the decision to include Huawei in the 5G project. These included the then defence secretary Gavin Williamson, as well as the home secretary Sajid Javid, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, international development secretary Penny Mordaunt and international trade secretary Liam Fox. All swiftly denied any responsibility, whether directly or via aides. Hunt later confirmed that he had been questioned by officials and that he would be prepared to hand over his phone for examination. \u201cI would be very happy for anyone to look at my phone, as would my trusted special adviser,\u201d he said. Some MPs called for the leak to be referred to the police, or for MI5 investigators to be brought in, but neither of these happened. Further chronology can be gleaned from May\u2019s letter sacking Williamson. This showed that she called him to a meeting on Tuesday evening, during which she asked him to account for \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that he was behind the leak. She was not satisfied, and he was dismissed the next day. There have been other less serious leaks of details from NSC meetings, and some pundits did speculate whether any heads would actually roll over the divulgence of a decision which would have been made public anyway \u2013 especially amid a climate of near-universal leaking from cabinet.

The defence secretary was later summoned to May\u2019s House of Commons office, where she confronted him with the evidence, offered him the opportunity to resign \u2013 and when he refused, immediately fired him.</p> \n<p>It is understood that Williamson has acknowledged speaking to the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford on the phone for 11 minutes on the day of the leak. But he denies that he revealed what had happened at the National Security Council when he was asked by the reporter about the Huawei discussion.</p> \n<p>In what rapidly escalated into an extraordinary public spat, the ex-minister continued to maintain that the leak came from outside his team. \u201cI think the prime minister has made a serious mistake,\u201d a source said.</p> \n<p>Formerly a staunch May loyalist who served the prime minister as her chief whip, Williamson later issued a strenuous public denial. He told Sky News the leak inquiry, overseen by cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, had been \u201ca witch hunt from the start\u201d and had taken place \u201cin a kangaroo court with a summary execution\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b1c48c8c49965911cdc5675e9bdb63de3b4b7ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b1c48c8c49965911cdc5675e9bdb63de3b4b7ec/0_59_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Williamson during ice breaking drills with the Royal Marines in Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin Williamson during ice breaking drills with the Royal Marines in Norway.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MOD</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>May was determined to reassert her authority over her squabbling ministers, whom Williamson\u2019s successor as chief whip, Julian Smith, recently described as the \u201cworst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history\u201d.</p> \n<p>The investigation was launched by Sedwill after an outcry from ministers and the security services, who warned of the risks of allowing a culture of leaks to continue with impunity. Those anxieties were amplified in the case of the Huawei story, which was regarded as both economically and politically sensitive.</p> \n<p>Sedwill, who unusually combines the job of cabinet secretary with that of May\u2019s national security adviser, has insisted on the need for a tough line against leaks.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday evening, No 10 published a blunt letter from May to Williamson, in which she accused him of failing to engage fully with the leak investigation.</p> \n<p>The prime minister said: \u201cIt has been conducted fairly, with the full cooperation of other NSC attendees. They have answered all questions, engaged properly, provided as much information as possible to assist with the investigation, and encouraged their staff to do the same. Your conduct has not been of the same standard as others\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIn our meeting, I put to you the latest information from the investigation, which provides compelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorised disclosure.

      "bodyText": "Gavin Williamson has claimed that he is the victim of a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d after being dramatically sacked by Theresa May over the leak from the National Security Council of Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G network. May was told of what she called \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence of Williamson\u2019s involvement before she was due to face a grilling from the backbench liaison committee. The defence secretary was later summoned to May\u2019s House of Commons office, where she confronted him with the evidence, offered him the opportunity to resign \u2013 and when he refused, immediately fired him. It is understood that Williamson has acknowledged speaking to the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford on the phone for 11 minutes on the day of the leak. But he denies that he revealed what had happened at the National Security Council when he was asked by the reporter about the Huawei discussion. In what rapidly escalated into an extraordinary public spat, the ex-minister continued to maintain that the leak came from outside his team. \u201cI think the prime minister has made a serious mistake,\u201d a source said. Formerly a staunch May loyalist who served the prime minister as her chief whip, Williamson later issued a strenuous public denial. He told Sky News the leak inquiry, overseen by cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, had been \u201ca witch hunt from the start\u201d and had taken place \u201cin a kangaroo court with a summary execution\u201d. May was determined to reassert her authority over her squabbling ministers, whom Williamson\u2019s successor as chief whip, Julian Smith, recently described as the \u201cworst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history\u201d. The investigation was launched by Sedwill after an outcry from ministers and the security services, who warned of the risks of allowing a culture of leaks to continue with impunity. Those anxieties were amplified in the case of the Huawei story, which was regarded as both economically and politically sensitive. Sedwill, who unusually combines the job of cabinet secretary with that of May\u2019s national security adviser, has insisted on the need for a tough line against leaks. On Wednesday evening, No 10 published a blunt letter from May to Williamson, in which she accused him of failing to engage fully with the leak investigation. The prime minister said: \u201cIt has been conducted fairly, with the full cooperation of other NSC attendees. They have answered all questions, engaged properly, provided as much information as possible to assist with the investigation, and encouraged their staff to do the same. Your conduct has not been of the same standard as others\u2019.\u201d \u201cIn our meeting, I put to you the latest information from the investigation, which provides compelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorised disclosure. No other credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified,\u201d she added. Williamson later published his reply, saying that he believed a \u201cthorough and formal inquiry\u201d would have vindicated him. He said he had declined May\u2019s offer to resign, believing that it would have appeared to be an acceptance that he or his staff had been responsible. Williamson will be replaced as defence secretary by the Brexiter Penny Mordaunt, widely regarded as a potential leadership contender, who previously served as international development secretary. Mordaunt will retain responsibility for women and equalities in her new role. Prisons minister Rory Stewart, a cerebral former diplomat, will become the new international development secretary. The Daily Telegraph obtained details of discussions at the NSC, including the claim that the prime minister had overruled several ministers, to allow the controversial Chinese firm to be involved in building \u201cnon-core\u201d parts of the 5G network. Williamson was among those reported to have raised concerns, together with the home secretary, Sajid Javid, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and Mordaunt. All of them subsequently became suspects in the most serious Whitehall leak inquiry in living memory. With Williamson now identified as the culprit, Downing Street said the leak inquiry had been shut down. \u201cThe prime minister thanks all members of the National Security Council for their full cooperation and candour during the investigation and considers the matter closed,\u201d it said.

If they do not have that confidence, you risk undermining that decision-making process, which in turn potentially harms national security.\u201d Williamson was closely involved in negotiating the confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist party, and had recently sought to thaw relations with the DUP\u2019s senior members at Westminster in a bid to secure their support for the prime minister\u2019s rejected Brexit deal. He was promoted from chief whip after Michael Fallon was forced to leave the cabinet after admitting that his conduct had \u201cfallen short\u201d over sexual harassment claims.

A similar manifesto commitment was made by the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats at the last election and with similar intent, making science part of a social justice agenda that is likely to persist through different governments.</p> <p>According to calculations by the Campaign for Science and Engineering, reaching this goal will require doubling R&amp;D spend from \u00a333bn to \u00a365bn over 10 years. If achieved, this would represent the most significant shift in the contribution of science and innovation to our economy in decades. It would require not only multi-billions from the public purse, \u00a37bn of which has already been committed, but also tens of billions of new investment in the UK from research-intensive industry, large and small.

To accomplish that, I believe we need a 10-year education mission led by the education secretary, alongside the R&amp;D investment mission led by the business secretary.</p> <p>A mission on education would, quite rightly, supply the talent to deliver and sustain a newly elevated level of research and innovation in the UK. As Sir John Kingman, chair of UK Research and Innovation, has said, 50% more research will require 50% more researchers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/29/scientific-research-transforms-lives-why-is-that-so-often-forgotten\">Scientific research transforms lives.

This would avoid the widening of perceived or real divisions and may make it more likely that the benefits of research and innovation are felt across society.</p> <p>A 10-year education mission could tackle the problems of resource and provision in science education, and the particularly difficult problem of identity \u2013 \u201cis this for me?\u201d \u2013 that can create barriers at an early stage. The industrial strategy\u2019s goals on technical education and adult retraining could play an important part in this broader mission.</p> <p>A transformation of the nature of the UK economy of this scale will require political commitment. Cross-party consensus on its importance for UK society needs to be backed by cross-government consensus. Trade, immigration, education, business and Treasury need to be united in their ambition to deliver it, and all departments could adopt new research and innovation in to their own work. This is a challenge for those hoping to lead the next administration to embrace.</p> <p>\u2022 Sarah Main is executive director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering</p>",

We need to act now to make sure everyone can participate in this \u201caccelerating frontier\u201d over the next decade. To accomplish that, I believe we need a 10-year education mission led by the education secretary, alongside the R&amp;D investment mission led by the business secretary. A mission on education would, quite rightly, supply the talent to deliver and sustain a newly elevated level of research and innovation in the UK. As Sir John Kingman, chair of UK Research and Innovation, has said, 50% more research will require 50% more researchers. But another important civic goal of the education mission would be to enable everyone to participate in an accelerating knowledge and innovation economy if they wish, as citizens and commentators as well as researchers. This would avoid the widening of perceived or real divisions and may make it more likely that the benefits of research and innovation are felt across society. A 10-year education mission could tackle the problems of resource and provision in science education, and the particularly difficult problem of identity \u2013 \u201cis this for me?\u201d \u2013 that can create barriers at an early stage. The industrial strategy\u2019s goals on technical education and adult retraining could play an important part in this broader mission. A transformation of the nature of the UK economy of this scale will require political commitment. Cross-party consensus on its importance for UK society needs to be backed by cross-government consensus. Trade, immigration, education, business and Treasury need to be united in their ambition to deliver it, and all departments could adopt new research and innovation in to their own work. This is a challenge for those hoping to lead the next administration to embrace. \u2022 Sarah Main is executive director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering",
