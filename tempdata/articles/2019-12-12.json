I\u2019m enthused by the queues at polling stations in the UK. I think this is the most important election of our generation. It\u2019s often said that this isn\u2019t about Brexit, but ultimately if it wasn\u2019t for the Brexit deadlock we wouldn\u2019t be having an election at all. Of course issues around the NHS, policing and education are important but this election is an attempt at giving us another say on Brexit. In Gibraltar we overwhelmingly voted to remain, we rely on fluidity at our border with Spain, so workers, goods, food and medicine can cross. For me, I think we need another say ... and this election is giving us that!<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And another Guardian reader is at work in <strong>Shanghai</strong>:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Currently sat with one eye on work and one eye on the Guardian website watching with trepidation.

      "bodyText": "Our new results live blog is now ready to take you through the night (if you\u2019re in the UK \u2013 daylight readers around the world are also very welcome). Join us via the link below: Britain has been voting in the first December general election for almost 100 years, with Boris Johnson hoping the result will give the Conservatives the majority they did not have in the last parliament, allowing him to implement Brexit on 31 January. Despite the weather, the day has seen people turning out to vote in large numbers in some locations, with constituents in multiple seats posting pictures of lengthy queues outside polling stations, particularly in London, and waits of more than half an hour to vote. My colleague Esther Addley has the story here. At the EU summit in Brussels some leaders have been saying they hope one party will be able to form a majority government after the election. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), said: The best thing for Ireland, for the UK and for Europe would be an end to the uncertainty, so whether that\u2019s prime minister Johnson winning with a large majority, or remain parties winning a majority, we\u2019ll work with whatever the outcome is. What has been very hard to work with was a hung parliament that wasn\u2019t able to come to a majority decision on anything. I just hope we\u2019re not in that position tomorrow. And Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, said he would advise the next prime minister \u201cto get a majority in the House of Commons and to be able to fulfil the agreements we decided on both sides.\u201d We are closing this blog now, but the coverage continues on our results blog. It\u2019s here. Here are some last-minute messages from the parties. From Jeremy Corbyn From Boris Johnson From Nicola Sturgeon From Jo Swinson From the Brexit party Good evening. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Haroon. This blog will be running until about 9pm, at which point we will launch a fresh one. Here, fairly randomly, is some \u2018how it\u2019s going\u2019 speculation from journalists. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford. From the Daily Mail\u2019s John Stevens From the former Sun political journalist Steve Hawkes Jackson Carlaw, the interim Scottish Tory leader, has had a spat on Twitter with Nicola Sturgeon and her Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, after he tweeted that he had voted this morning in his East Renfrewshire constituency, 12 days after stating on Twitter he had sent in his postal vote. An eagle-eyed voter flagged the apparent discrepancy, to Sturgeon\u2019s amusement. Russell, the Scottish government\u2019s cabinet secretary for constitutional relations, was more pointed. He tweeted: \u201cEh? Surely not as voting twice would be a criminal offence. Whereas tweeting something that isn\u2019t true for electoral effect is just crass and dishonest \u2026\u201d Carlaw, who holds the contiguous Scottish parliament seat of Eastwood, protested to both Sturgeon and Russell he had just made two proxy votes, both for Tory candidate Paul Masterton. East Renfrewshire is an SNP target seat, and is often a barometer of Scotland\u2019s shifting political mood. The Tories took it from the SNP in 2017 with a 4,712 majority, while the SNP had taken it from Labour\u2019s then Scottish leader Jim Murphy in 2015 in its remarkable landslide. The previous Westminster seat of Eastwood had long been Tory-held until Murphy won it first in 1997. Talking of Southampton Itchen, and its majority of just 31, here is a picture of a queue from a polling station there: And here\u2019s a lovely, festive queue in Northamptonshire: It\u2019s a similar story in Leeds: The election count in Orkney and Shetland, the UK\u2019s most northerly and most dispersed constituency, relied on a eight-seater aircraft propeller-driven aircraft to bring ballot boxes to the count on Friday morning. The constituency, which has 34 inhabited islands including the isolated Foula and Fair Isle, is the only one that relies on aircraft to transport ballot papers to a count. A Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander operated by Loganair was due to take off from Sumburgh on the southern tip of mainland Shetland at 1am on Friday after all the archipelago\u2019s ballot boxes arrive, for a 45-minute flight to Kirkwall, the capital town of Orkney 90 miles south. Onboard was Jan Riise, Shetland\u2019s returning officer, who will keep guard over its 30 ballot boxes. Problems have also been reported at Southampton University where the students\u2019 union says at least 76 people have been turned away from the polling station despite being registered to vote. A blogpost on the union\u2019s website says: We\u2019ve received reports of multiple students being prevented from voting their local polling station due to an administrative error, meaning they\u2019re not on their polling station list despite being registered to vote. This morning, our VP education and democracy, Jo Lisney, experienced this first hand and was turned away from her polling station in Southampton Test. Jo says: \u201cIt was a shock this morning when I went to vote and was told I couldn\u2019t. I had my polling card come through so I knew I could, but the people at the station showed me the list and it said \u2018details deleted\u2019. After this I called the Electoral Commission and they confirmed I can vote and told me to go back with my polling card but if it doesn\u2019t work, call them again.\u201d Since then we\u2019ve received at least 75 further reports of students experiencing the same issue. One of the seats in the city \u2013 Southampton Itchen \u2013 was decided by just 31 votes in 2017, the Tories\u2019 Royston Smith holding on to the seat by the skin of his teeth. The union blogpost did add: Despite these issues, we are thrilled to hear so many students are voting in the general election today. In Liverpool, 48 voters were given ballot papers for the wrong constituency, the Liverpool Echo reports. They were given papers for Wavertree, rather than Riverside, at a polling station that serves both constituencies. Tony Reeves, Liverpool city council\u2019s returning officer, told the Echo: Due to a medical issue overnight, a key member of staff was unable to be present when it opened at 7am. The remaining staff took a decision to oversee both constituencies until a replacement arrived, to make sure voters were not turned away. A short time later it was identified that 48 electors had accidentally been given a ballot paper for Wavertree, rather than Riverside and had voted in the wrong constituency. He added that the votes wrongly cast would be declared null and void and that they were attempting to contact the voters in question to allow them to recast their vote. They say never say never in politics, but Nigel Dodds says the DUP will never, ever support Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. The party\u2019s deputy leader slammed the door on any conceivable deal, tacit or otherwise, to put Labour\u2019s leader into Downing Street. \u201cJeremy Corbyn is someone whom we could never support as prime minister,\u201d Dodds told the Guardian. Lest there be any doubt about conceivably backing a Corbyn-led coalition, Dodds used the word \u201cnever\u201d four times. For most unionists Jeremy Corbyn is a complete no no. We will never support Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Jeremy Corbyn will not get our support. Dodds cited the Labour leader\u2019s positions on antisemitism, IRA terrorism, and a Scottish referendum. Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister brings a lot of other things to the table which we could never accept \u2026 all those things would be anathema to the DUP and the people that we represent. Dodds was speaking outside a polling station in Belfast North, where he faces a stiff challenge from Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s John Finucane. By drawing a line down the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal betrays the DUP and arguably advances Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s goal of Irish unity, but Dodds still prefers Johnson to Corbyn. He said the DUP could retain influence in Westminster and push for a new deal \u2013 as long as Johnson obtained just a slender majority. It\u2019s getting tighter and tighter and tighter. In 1992, John Major had a majority of 21 and he ended up depending on the unionist MPs in parliament. I think the DUP will be significant players in the next parliament. More pictures of queues are emerging as people make their way home from work. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has said at an EU summit in Brussels that he believes a trade deal can be negotiated with the UK by the end of 2020 if the country leaves the bloc next month. He asked: Why not? In 11 months you can do a lot of things if you have the political will. What we should do is look forward and try to have the best relations after Brexit. Sheffield newspaper the Star reports that Labour has complained after a blitz of anti-Jeremy Corbyn posters were plastered across the city overnight. It says placards that read \u201cWould you trust this man with your children?\u201d featuring Corbyn\u2019s picture have been placed outside schools and other places. The posters described him as \u201can extremist\u201d and said he defended terrorists. Nick Bradley, the chairman of the Penistone and Stocksbridge constituency Labour party, told the Star hundreds of the \u201cillegal and offensive\u201d placards had gone up, adding: This has been a campaign full of appalling lies with people using social media in particular to peddle offensive content. Putting a poster of Jeremy Corbyn outside a school with the message \u2018would you trust this man with your children\u2019 is as offensive as it gets. The Star said Labour had reported the matter to the police but South Yorkshire police told the Guardian it was a matter for the council. The Conservatives have sent out an email to their supporters this afternoon with the subject: \u201cLabour turnout is high.\u201d It includes a red siren in the subject field. Here is part of the text of the email, which is signed by Boris Johnson. Are the Tories genuinely worried, or is it just a ploy to ensure their supporters go out and vote? This has been a strange election but it continues to get stranger. The Hollywood star Danny DeVito has been championing Labour and now a fan site for the Californian rap-metal veterans, Rage Against the Machine (RATM), has urged people to vote for the former Conservative cabinet member David Gauke. RATM may have rapped \u201cFuck you I won\u2019t do what you tell me\u201d but that hasn\u2019t stopped their fans producing a tactical voting guide for their followers, which includes the band\u2019s endorsement of Gauke. Speaking at an EU leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said he hoped that the general election would not produce a hung parliament. He told reporters: The best thing for Ireland, for the UK and for Europe would be an end to the uncertainty, so whether that\u2019s prime minister Johnson winning with a large majority, or remain parties winning a majority, we\u2019ll work with whatever the outcome is. What has been very hard to work with was a hung parliament that wasn\u2019t able to come to a majority decision on anything. I just hope we\u2019re not in that position tomorrow. Varadkar warned, however, that Brexit would not be done with if the UK leaves on 31 January. He said: Brexit doesn\u2019t just end with the UK leaving the European Union. We move on to the next phase and that\u2019s going to be really important. The withdrawal agreement doesn\u2019t solve the issue of trade, and the trading relationship between Britain and Ireland is essential for our agrifood sector, for our exporters and our small businesses. So it\u2019s going to be really crucial for Ireland that we get a good deal on trade with the UK. Eagle-eyed voters in Hackney North and Stoke Newington will spot on their ballot paper that the listed Lib Dem candidate is someone who has been dropped by the party. Ben Mathis was suspended from the Lib Dems at the end of November for posting \u201cclearly offensive\u201d tweets. A spokesperson for the Lib Dems told the Guardian that Mathis\u2019s sacking came too close to the election date to take his name down or arrange an alternative candidate, as the Electoral Commission guidelines are very strict in this respect. People with limited mobility have told of how they struggled to have their say in the election thanks to inaccessible voting stations, alleged postal vote registration failures and slippery floors. In Chester-le-Street, where the polling station is inside a portable building, the council had not made reasonable adjustments to allow everyone to easily enter, according to Robert Berry, 68, who has issues with his hips. He said: The step to get in is too high. You\u2019ve really got to pull yourself up. And the floor was wet. The poor chap in front of me had fallen down to his knees. He had to sit for a while and recover. Then, the returning officer said they had commented on this to Durham county council and nothing had been done. There\u2019s a lino floor inside and it was just like an ice rink. Someone from the shop nearby came by with a big piece of cardboard which solved it. Alex, from Widnes, Cheshire, witnessed - and helped - someone experiencing difficulty at a polling station in Halton. It was a portable building in the local park situated on the grass beside a path. It was raised on stilts with a large puddle in front of the door that had to be stepped in in order to access the polling station if you had limited mobility. There was no ramp or means of access except by going up this step. As I was leaving, a man with a mobility scooter arrived and had to be helped into the cabin whilst his scooter was left outside in the rain. The umbrella on his scooter in the photo is mine. Even if there had been ramp access, the space inside would not have been sufficient for him to move around. I also saw other elderly voters step in this puddle in order to enter and exit the polling station. Meanwhile, in Colchester, a voter with connective tissue disease Ehlers-Danlos syndrome claimed she had applied in person twice to Electoral Commission workers for a postal vote but her requests were effectively ignored. She said: As someone who is disabled and really struggles to get out at the best of times, it very nearly prevented me from voting. If it hadn\u2019t been for local councillors taking disabled and older people to the polling stations, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to vote at all. When I spoke to one of the councillors about it, they said that a lot of people in the area were saying the same thing. Robyn Brook, in Castleford, West Yorkshire, said she went early to vote to avoid crowds but was forced to vote outside since there was not a ramp for people in wheelchairs at the portable building. There was no ramp access, the stairs were huge, there\u2019s no way even the wheelchair being tipped up I could\u2019ve got in there. The staff were lovely, really apologetic. They had requested having a ramp put on. The area I live in has a lot of bungalows, its not just myself who would have needed it. I had to fill my form outside and pass it to the man working there. I was sat in the cold for about five minutes. In East Dunbartonshire, where the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, is coming under pressure from the SNP candidate, Amy Callaghan, activists from both parties are relieved that the weather has held. It\u2019s been a gloomy day and the light was already fading by 3.30pm, but at least the forecast downpours have yet to happen. Even smaller village polling stations like Torrance report that business has been brisk, and bigger stations suggest turnout could match 2015, when it was above 80%. As we reported last week, some local Lib Dems have been jittery about the amount of time Swinson has been away from the constituency since she became party leader, while Callaghan has had visits from Nicola Sturgeon and a lot of activist support. Technically, there is no blanket ban on photos being taken inside polling stations (although the Electoral Commission recommends that it is best avoided and many stations explicitly prohibit photos as a result), but this brought a smile to my face. There are more details on the rules surrounding polling stations and much much more in this article by my colleague Martin Belam. People who have not received their postal votes are still eligible to vote at their local polling station if they contact their local authority, although that is difficult for those voters who live overseas. Lots of overseas voters have been contacting the Guardian to tell us about the issues they\u2019re experiencing. Dr Laura Sinclair, a medical physicist based in Dublin, got in touch after her voting forms for her home constituency in Hull failed to arrive. When she phoned the council to chase up the problem, she says they gave her conflicting stories, in the first case that many of the postal votes had been lost, and in the second that she had failed to register in time. She also claims she was refused an emergency proxy vote. Laura understands the council used a separate organisation to send off its postal ballots. She said: I am not the only person who has lost their democratic right to vote in this general election. I am angry and upset that my basic right to vote has been taken away by a third-party company. A Hull council spokesperson said: The postal vote was sent the elector on Monday 2 December to the address in Ireland that she had written on her application for a postal vote. The letter had been returned marked as address incomplete, however the address was written in exactly in the form that she provided on her request for a postal vote. British voter Stephanie Huber-Nagel, who lives in Germany, said her postal voting pack never arrived. I applied for my postal vote this summer and I\u2019ve been waiting for the past few weeks for my postal voting pack to arrive at my German address as my husband had received his at the end of November. Unfortunately mine never made it on time and only reached me yesterday. The delay was due to the fact that the original envelope did not include my postcode despite my registration letter for postal vote clearly marking my postcode. It took the German postal services nearly two weeks to establish my full address and forward me my post. I am really upset about this as due to a simple human/computer error my right to vote in one of the most important elections of my lifetime has been taken away from me. One overseas voter, Cameron Ross, was so concerned about his postal vote not arriving in time that he flew to the UK from his home in Amsterdam. He is voting in a key marginal, Richmond Park, where Conservative Zac Goldsmith holds a 45-vote majority. He said: The outcome of this election is too important to let ride on the postal voting system. I arrived at St Lukes polling station (Richmond Park) at 8am this morning. I was told that I could not vote because the administrators at the station didn\u2019t know how to find the list of registered overseas voters. Following a phone call to the local electoral office, they managed to find the list of overseas voters on the back of their electoral roll document. I wonder if anyone else was turned away? I was also denied the chance to vote by proxy on behalf of my wife. They claimed they had not received those instructions in time. I\u2019m full of respect for the volunteers who oversee these polling stations, but they appeared underprepared and overwhelmed. In a seat with a wafer-thin majority of 45. More on Conservative Facebook ads from Michael Barton and Caelainn Barr: Although the official election campaigns have come to a standstill, the battle for voters continues online. The Conservatives launched a constituency -pecific Facebook campaign yesterday, which appears to be primarily targeted to users in marginal seats. The campaign warns against tactical voting and focuses on 91 constituencies. An ad encouraging voters in Broxtowe not to vote tactically had at least 6,000 views. The Conservatives have a majority of 863 in this constituency. Facebook users in Hastings and Rye appear to have been targeted with a similar ad which has had at least 2,000 views. Similarly that seat is held by the Conservatives by 346 votes. The Conservative anti-tactical voting campaign has been running since 7 December. In the EU\u2019s eastern half, the election campaign has been viewed with bemusement, with the main focus on what will happen to the rights of the millions of EU nationals living in Britain after Brexit. The rightwing governments in Hungary and Poland have appreciated the Tories staying quiet on rule of law issues and not adding to the chorus of EU complaints over backsliding in the country. Aware that Poland and Hungary may be two of Britain\u2019s closer friends in a post-Brexit EU, British diplomats have sought to cosy up to the governments rather than criticise them, and the ruling parties in both countries will be hoping for a Johnson win. In the opinion section of Hungary\u2019s pro-government Magyar H\u00edrlap newspaper, author Daniel Deme writes that these are the most important British elections since the second world war, claiming that Boris Johnson wants to \u201cpreserve national sovereignty and identity\u201d against Corbyn, whom the author calls a radical Marxist in favour of mass migration. Poland\u2019s Lewica leftwing coalition, which made it into parliament in recent elections, gave a ringing endorsement of Labour\u2019s manifesto and called on all Poles eligible to vote to vote for Corbyn. But the predominant reaction is confusion at the mess of British politics and what effect the election will have on Brexit. According to independent Hungarian outlet HVG, the only thing at stake in this election is \u201cwho will be the ringmaster in the long-running Brexit circus\u201d. US Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has issued a pro-Labour call for the UK public to vote. Sharing an anti-Conservative video originally posted by Jeremy Corbyn, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this: Wandsworth council, which covers the Labour marginal of Battersea, the Tory marginal of Putney, and the safe Labour seat of Tooting, has confirmed that \u201cunprecedented numbers\u201d of people were voting this morning. There have been few reports of queues since the pre-work rush to vote. This was Putney this morning. This appears to be the same polling station at a church this afternoon. The Tories are sending targeted ads from the PM to voters in specific constituencies saying their seat is \u201cone of the nine seats needed to Get Brexit Done\u201d ... but they are sending them out to dozens of constituencies. The adverts have been posted to voters in more than 40 constituencies, saying they are \u201cone of the nine\u201d. They include: Dagenham and Rainham, Wrexham, Lincoln, East Devon, Sedgefield, Bolton North East, Batley &amp; Spen, Birmingham Northfield, Workington, Stoke on Trent North, Bishop Auckland, Wakefield, Stockton South, Scunthorpe, Great Grimsby, Ashfield and Peterborough, West Bromwich East, Weaver Vale, Colne Valley, Darlington, Barrow and Furness, Crewe and Nantwich, Bolsover, Rother Valley, Penistone and Stocksbridge, Newport and West, Dudley North, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Haslingden &amp; Hyndburn , Bury South, Alyn &amp; Deeside, Bassetlaw, Coventry North West, Wolverhampton North East, Warrington South, Dewsbury, Lincoln, Vale of Clwyd, Worsley and Eccles South, Heywood and Middleton, Clwyd South, Wrexham, Leigh, Peterborough, Blackpool South. A reader who works in online advertising contacted the Guardian because she thought it implied that there were only nine specific constituencies that were being referred to. First-time voters have been in touch to tell us how they feel about casting their vote. Lisa Bickell, 34, a dual national British-German citizen living in Durham, voted for the first time today. I have been anxious to vote all week and fearful to be turned away due to my dual citizenship or any other electoral error. This election feels like the most important one I have ever taken part in. Being so excited, I woke up really early and decided to head to the booth at 7.20am to avoid any queue and get reassurance. There wasn\u2019t anyone there and I quickly made my cross and left. Everyone was really nice and I came home feeling very happy, proud and British! Max, who is from Canada and lives in London, sees his future in the UK. I\u2019m a citizen of both the Commonwealth and Europe but I barely made it! There was an issue with my registration and when I called on 5 December I was told I had not provided proof of my Canadian citizenship by the cut-off date, 4 December. I promptly submitted all documents in order to be registered for the next election. Despite this, I received my polling card last night and was able to vote today. I\u2019m very humbled and touched that this was resolved so promptly and thank the UK for allowing me to help them shape the future of our world. I see my future in London, which has been the most welcoming city I\u2019ve lived in and where my French accent has not prompted people to label me as a foreigner. Alice Davies, 19, who is from London but studying and voting at the University of Leeds, is worried others like her might not be able to vote. My dad is British and my mum is Irish and I was born in London and lived in England all my life. I was removed from the electoral register and was told that I was removed with \u2018all the Europeans\u2019. I\u2019m UK-born with an Irish passport so eligible to vote in all elections. After repeatedly insisting that I was registered to vote the polling station staff member made a phone call and then told me I could be added back on and allowed to vote. I\u2019ve heard there are millions of Irish passport holders in the UK. It\u2019s worrying that if you weren\u2019t absolutely confident in the electoral services or had dedicated staff members to help, your vote could be withheld. Cardiff University has suffered an error with its online voting registration system, leaving up to 180 of its students ineligible to cast their votes, writes Will Neal. The university says it is difficult to give an exact figure, but the issue has reportedly affected all students who registered to vote in November. The university initially gave its students a deadline of the end of October to register via its own internal system. When the deadline passed, all applications that had been submitted were sent to the local council. Due to an administrative oversight, the portal was then left online throughout November even though applications were no longer been passed on. As a result, a number of students who accessed the portal after the October deadline were not registered to vote. The city council has said it is too late for them to be included on the list of voters for the area as the legal deadline for registration has passed. Jackie Yip, president at Cardiff University student\u2019s union, told the Guardian: It is extremely alarming to hear about the number of students who may potentially be denied the right to vote due to clerical errors in the registration system. The Students\u2019 Union will be calling for a significant investigation into these failures to ensure they are not repeated in the future. It comes after Cardiff received up to 1,000 invalid applications ahead of today\u2019s elections, due to problems with inputting addresses. Efforts were successfully made to contact those affected, but at least 200 people were not registered in time. A spokesperson for the university said: \u201cWe are deeply sorry and apologise, unreservedly. We have contacted all students we believe are affected. As soon as the issue was brought to our attention, we did everything possible to put it right.\u201d \u201cWe undertake a full review of our processes to ensure this can never happen again,\u201d he added. In Brussels, all the 28 EU heads of state and government, except Boris Johnson, are gathering for a two-day summit. Johnson is being represented by Donald Tusk\u2019s replacement as European council president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium. As Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, arrived at the Europa building, where leaders are meeting, he was asked what advice he would give the newly elected prime minister of the UK, whoever he may be. \u201cTo get a majority in the House of Commons and to be able to fulfil the agreements we decided on both sides,\u201d Bettel told reporters. \u201cTo have a parliament in London that agrees on the future relationship and all these things very quickly.\u201d Bettel\u2019s comments reflect the widely held view among the leaders that a Johnson majority and an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU on 31 January would now be the least worst outcome. Charles Michel, the new president of the European council, has told reporters at a two-day EU leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels that the EU will comment on the general election once the results are in. He said: \u201cI show always respect for the choices made by the voters and we will wait and see what will be the outcome of these elections.\u201d Should Boris Johnson secure a working majority, the EU27 are expected to issue a summit communique on Friday announcing their intention to move swiftly on to negotiations about the future relationship with the UK. The Conservatives in Southport, Merseyside, have been accused of attaching an election posters to a lamppost outside a polling station in the constituency. Reader Dominic Porteous sent in this picture of the offending poster. The south west London borough of Merton says it is taking \u201curgent action\u201d to remove election posters near polling stations. Candidates in this election received abuse or insulting remarks in 16.5% of mentions or replies about them on Twitter, a snapshot analysis has found. PoliMonitor, supported by a grant from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, analysed 139,564 tweets referencing the 2,503 candidates on the social networking site published on Monday 11 November 2019 referencing.. It found that 23,039 were abusive. By contrast, analysis on abuse received by candidates in the 2017 general election by the University of Sheffield found that approximately 4% of tweets mentioning candidates were abusive, although as the methodology is different, the results are not directly comparable. Other findings of the PoliMonitor research were: The three party leaders received the most abuse, with Boris Johnson the most targeted, followed by Jeremy Corbyn and then Jo Swinson. Most of the abuse was concentrated amongst 150 candidates who received 96% of the abuse. In all, 515 received abuse and 1,988 (79%) did not. Of the top 30 most abused candidates in the 24 hour period, only three were not incumbent MPs at the time the election was called: Richard Tice (Brexit party), George Galloway (Independent) and Liz Jarvis (Lib Dems). Female candidates received slightly more abusive tweets compared to male candidates, 17.3% vs 16.2%, with many directed towards women based on appearance and gender. Concerns were raised before the election at the number of MPs - particularly women \u2013 standing down with many citing abuse, including cabinet minister Nicky Morgan and Heidi Allen, the former Conservative MP who defected to the Liberal Democrats via Change UK. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott who was found by a previous study to be subject to nearly half the abusive tweets sent to female MP, was sixth in the PoliMonitor list of politicians receiving the most abuse, behind Michael Gove (Conservatives) and Caroline Lucas (Green party). Sam Cunningham, CEO of PoliMonitor, said: While most candidates received little or no abuse, the most prominent candidates received thousands of abusive messages, deterring politicians from having constructive conversations about policies which matter. For some, this abuse is deterring them from taking part in politics altogether. More positively, the most extremely abusive terms were absent in the data analysed, suggesting social media companies and the public are getting better at stamping out the most abhorrent and unacceptable language. Brexit has upended Northern Ireland politics but election day here has boiled down to a traditional, familiar contest between Orange and Green. Of 18 constituencies the most closely watched and bitterly fought is North Belfast, where the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds risks defenestration by Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s rising star John Finucane. Both men voted this morning amid grey rain that matches voters\u2019 dour mood. Remainers \u2013 a majority here \u2013 say Brexit has been foisted on them. Leavers, who tend to be unionist, call Boris Johnson\u2019s deal a betrayal that will weaken Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK. Existential stakes, yet Northern Ireland\u2019s MPs may be little more than spectators when the region\u2019s fate is decided. A hung parliament is the only chance either side has of exerting influence at Westminster. Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP have thrown everything they have at North Belfast, a toxic battle of smears, dirty tricks, tribal appeals and Troubles-era rhetoric. Defeat for Dodds, its deputy leader and Brexit architect, would hit DUP morale and confidence. But the party may return to Westminster with an additional MP courtesy of North Down, where it is favoured to win the seat vacated by by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s nightmare scenario is for Finucane to falter in North Belfast and for Elisha McCallion to lose her Derry seat to Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP. The party of John Hume hopes to clinch a Lazarus-like revival by take an additional seat in South Belfast where Claire Hanna, thanks in part to Sinn F\u00e9in and other pro-remain parties standing aside, is tipped to oust the DUP\u2019s Emma Little-Pengelly. Naomi Long, leader of the non-aligned Alliance party, has an uphill battle against Gavin Robinson, the DUP\u2019s incumbent in East Belfast. Whatever the results, there is hope the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in will in coming weeks negotiate their way back to Stormont, the seat of the assembly that collapsed in acrimony three years ago, zombifying Northern Ireland politics. Some cautious optimism, too, in the Republic where a thinkthank report says there could be an economic bounce if Johnson wins a majority and pushes through his Brexit deal. Police in Nottingham helped an older voter to a polling station after responding to a report of an 80-year-old suffering from the cold and struggling to walk. \u201cIt transpired he\u2019d overexerted himself walking to his local station to cast his vote,\u201d according to the police operation response team. He was also got a cup of hot coffee to \u201cwarm him up\u201d. There is no sign now of the pre-work polling queues reported earlier in the Tory marginal of Putney. This image was taken just after dawn. Jack Shenker writes for the Guardian that this election pitches the interests of rentiers against renters. He says that the Conservatives are intent on preserving the status quo, while Labour believe things cannot stay as they are. As things stand, the beneficiaries of that status quo are those who control, trade and live off existing assets and are thus liberated from dependence on the productive economy \u2013 including hedge funds, private equity firms and other purveyors of footloose, financialised capital, but also those who own their own homes outright or earn an income from pension funds, as well as actual landlords. The far bigger group that is losing out encompasses not only private tenants, but everyone reliant on wages and public spending for survival, not to mention all those who would prefer not to see the planet burn. There are, of course, a great many older people in the first category who, seeking an insurance policy against the spiralling costs of social care, are understandably protective of their assets and wary of radical change. Labour\u2019s challenge is to convince them that efforts to rebalance the economy will improve rather than diminish their lives in the years to come, and that curbing the domination of market logic \u2013 in housing, as well as many other areas of society \u2013 will bring immense benefits to their children, grandchildren and the wider community as well. A long queue of students voting has been reported at one of the University of Exeter\u2019s Cornish campus in the relatively marginal constituency Falmouth and Truro. The Conservatives are defending a majority of 3,792 over Labour in the seat. Meanwhile, turnout appears to continue to be high at the University of Kent in the Labour marginal of Canterbury. Lots of people have contacted the Guardian to tell us that they have had issues with postal votes. Fraser Robinson and his wife are registered to vote in Ceredigion, Wales, and had applied for a postal ballot from the Netherlands. The documents never came through. He said: We made sure we were registered and were confirmed but ballots never arrived. The council electoral services officer I spoke to confessed that she was \u2018tired of hearing from people overseas that they hadn\u2019t received ballots\u2019 and that she heard the same complaints during the EU election. The council has put the blame at the feet of Royal Mail, Royal Mail has blamed the council and the Electoral Commission has told me it is not their concern. Their casual approach to this problem has been really hard to stomach. If it was just my ballot lost in the post it would be one thing, but my wife\u2019s as well as other complaints from Ceredigion postal voters makes me wonder if any of them were actually dispatched. Maggie, who works on an administrative team in Poole, said that because her postal vote hadn\u2019t arrived she\u2019d had to take time off work to make sure she could vote in her constituency of Mid Dorset and North Poole. She said: I got in touch with the electoral office in Dorchester in Dorset who told me that they would reissue the postal pack but if that doesn\u2019t arrive this morning, I\u2019m going to have to drive from where I live in Wimborne to Dorchester (23 miles) to collect the documentation that will allow me to vote in person at home. I\u2019ve had to take a half-day off work and obviously pay for the petrol \u2013 but I think it\u2019s very important to vote in my constituency today. This is a particularly important election and it\u2019s possible my vote could make a difference where I live. James Aufenast lives in north London but was supposed to be submitting a proxy postal vote to Bath and North East Somerset on behalf of his sister Julia, who lives in Hong Kong. He said: My sister is really concerned about what is happening in the UK right now despite having her own problems in Hong Kong. She was keen for me to vote for her by proxy (postal vote) and we organised well ahead of time. However, Bath and NE Somerset Council failed to send out the voting forms in time. In a marginal constituency where every vote counts, she feels she has been deprived of her democratic right at a crucial time. I feel culpable too as it was up to me to organise and I have let her down. Obviously the responsibility lies with Bath, but I think the reason I am so upset is because it feels like a huge amount is riding on this election. Aufenast said that when he contacted the local council to chase the issue up, they told him he was not the first person to have called in. The council said in a response to his query: We have received a lot of calls from electors that have not received poll cards and postal votes. It\u2019s a combination of a national election and the Christmas post that have created a Royal Mail fiasco. Party activists in Haddington, a large market town in the Scottish National party target seat of East Lothian, report unusually high levels of voting this morning \u2013 something put down to voters eager to avoid going out after dark and very high levels of interest in this election. Lorraine Glass, a veteran SNP election campaigner standing outside the Aubigny sports centre, said turnout had \u201creally quite good\u201d, despite the chilly December weather. It\u2019s busier for this time of day than it would normally be. I think people are much more engaged than they were in 2017. People have been really polite on the doorsteps. They say they\u2019re fed up with Brexit but they\u2019re wanting to talk to you about it. Sandra Gaughan, a Labour campaigner, said people wanted to vote during daylight hours. It gets dark at 4.30pm. It has been really, really constant. I was here at 7.30am with my daughter before she went to work, and she had to queue. There were people queueing here at 7 o\u2019clock; there was some woman who was quite bureaucratic saying: \u2018Tell me which street you live on and I will tell you which booth to go to.\u2019 East Lothian is being keenly contested by the SNP\u2019s candidate, Kenny MacAskill, a veteran SNP figure most famous for freeing from prison the man accused of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, when he was Scottish justice secretary. Labour\u2019s Martin Whitfield, a pro-EU centrist, won the seat from the SNP by a relatively large majority of 3,083 votes (5.5%) in 2017. This contest is being seen as a significant test of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s popularity in this relatively affluent, pro-remain constituency, which normally has a high turnout at elections. Good afternoon, this is Haroon Siddique, taking over the blog for a bit to give Matthew a break. I\u2019ll then be back to take you through from 3pm to 8pm. Another place where queues have been reported is University of Lincoln. Lincoln is expected to be one of the tightest contests. The Conservatives\u2019 Karl McCartney is trying to win back the seat he lost by just 1,538 votes to Labour\u2019s Karen Lee in 2017. McCartney, who ousted Labour in 2010, won by just 1,443 votes in 2015. A 48-year-old man has been arrested after a suspicious device was found near a polling station in North Lanarkshire (see earlier). Police said the device was discovered on the ground floor of Glen Tower flats in Motherwell at around 1am on Thursday. A cordon was placed around the building as residents were evacuated following the find. Explosive ordnance disposal staff were called to the scene to examine the item before carrying out a controlled explosion despite the device being found to be \u201cnon-viable\u201d. People who were registered to vote at Glen Tower have been told to attend an alternative polling station at Knowetop primary achool on Knowetop Avenue in Motherwell. A community room within the building was due to be used as a polling station. Ch Insp Mark Leonard said: \u201cPolice in Motherwell have arrested a 48-year-old man in connection with a suspicious device found on the ground floor of Glen Tower flats, Motherwell, around 1am on Thursday December 12 2019. Inquiries are ongoing.\u201d Here\u2019s a round up of some queuing news from PA Media. Waits of more than half an hour were reported at various locations across England on Thursday morning. Queuing appeared particularly widespread in London, with long lines reported in a number of constituencies. Chris Schofield said more than 70 voters were waiting in the Bermondsey and Old Southwark constituency - some of whom gave up and left during his 20-minute wait, \u201cpresumably to go to work\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about 20 times busier than it was in 2017, and for the locals and Euro elections,\u201d the 27-year-old consultant said. \u201cAtmosphere is very London: orderly queueing and no one is talking to each other!\u201d Several voters claimed they had never seen queues like it in years. Asked why he thought there were so many queuing, Schofield said: \u201cI think it\u2019s the election of a lifetime for many of us.\u201d Alixe Bovey reported queueing for 35 minutes in the Streatham constituency. \u201cIn 20 years of voting in Streatham Hill, always at about this time of day, I have never encountered a queue of more than six or seven people,\u201d she tweeted. Waits were also reported in English cities such as Cambridge, where John Walsh tweeted to say it was the \u201cfirst time ever\u201d that he had to queue to exercise his democratic right. Many members of the public said they were encouraged by the queues, suggesting it could mean a greater turnout than in the last general election. In the 2017 poll, there a turnout of 66.4%. Voters unable to vote for whatever reason can return to their polling stations at any time before 10pm on Thursday evening. The Electoral Commission advises polling stations \u201ccan get very busy, particularly towards the end of the day\u201d, but says voters in a queue before 10pm will be entitled to apply for a ballot paper. Voters in England, Scotland and Wales do not need to take anything with them to vote, while those in Northern Ireland must have photo ID. In the Netherlands, which stands to lose more than most from a hard or no-deal Brexit, NRC Handelsblad lamented a campaign \u201cpoor on substance and rich in empty rhetoric\u201d for a vote that \u201ccould change the course of Brexit, and the country\u201d. Hardly a single moment from the past few weeks lasted longer than the one-day news cycle, the paper said, while the debates provided no new insights beyond Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d and Corbyn\u2019s \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d. Both parties \u201cpromised more money and more investment, but avoided fundamental discussions about structural health, education and benefit reforms \u2013 or even Brexit\u201d. Johnson \u201ccould not explain how he would negotiate a trade deal in record time or what would happen if the talks dragged on\u201d, the paper said, while Corbyn \u201cwas silent on Brexit, aware a good election result was only possible if both leftwing big-city remainers, working class Brexiteers in the middle and north vote Labour\u201d. Sweden\u2019s Svenska Dagbladet described a country hopelessly split, and in multiple directions, leaving many facing \u201can impossible choice. How is a Conservative who wants to stay in the EU supposed to vote? Or a social democrat who believes Jeremy Corbyn is a leftwing extremist?\u201d In Denmark, Berlingske said Britain was voting in \u201cone of the most important elections in decades\u201d, whose outcome would \u201cdefine the UK\u2019s exit from EU or decide whether the country get a new referendum\u201d and whose two protagonists \u201crepresent two radically different visions for Britain\u201d. \u201cIf the Conservative party wins an absolute majority, Britain can leave the EU by 31 January \u2013 but the UK must immediately start negotiating a future trade agreement,\u201d it explained. \u201cIf Labour wins, there\u2019ll be yet another referendum on Brexit. And if there\u2019s no clear winner \u2013 it will be a big and serous mess.\u201d The student vote was a big factor in the surprise victory for Labour\u2019s Rosie Duffield in Canterbury in 2017. Queues to vote have been reported again at the university. Police Scotland have confirmed that they carried out a controlled explosion overnight after a suspicious device was found near a polling station in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. The \u201cnon-viable device\u201d was found on the ground floor of Glen Tower flats, Motherwell, at 1am this morning. A community room in the same building was planned for use as a polling station today. All residents registered there have now been directed to vote at Knowetop primary school instead. Ch Insp Mark Leonard said: \u201cA cordon was placed around the building and residents within the cordon were evacuated for safety reasons. \u201cThe evacuation has now ended and police are working with North Lanarkshire council to return people to their homes. \u201cInquiries are ongoing and we are keen to talk to anyone that may have seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area around 12 and 1am this morning.\u201d There is not much interest in the British election in Russia, but Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the head of the nationalist LDPR party and a loose ally of Vladimir Putin, delivered a full-throated endorsement for the Tories and Brexit. Zhirinovsky, who is known for making outrageous statements, tweeted: Russia has largely welcomed the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union as proof that the European project is coming apart at the seams and that western liberalism is failing, a thesis that Vladimir Putin has been repeating for years. Russia has also brushed aside accusations that it leaked details of trade talks between the United States and the UK, with the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, quoting Boris Johnson\u2019s assertion that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of Russian interference in British politics. Johnson had said that before details of the trade talks were leaked. Russian TV anchors took a fairly straight approach on election day, but highlighted the theatrical nature of the campaign, an element somewhat lacking in Russia\u2019s own elections. \u201cThe main agenda of the elections was of course Brexit, but the campaign often resembled a show, with PM Boris Johnson bringing milk to people at home, hiding from journalists\u2019 questions in a refrigerator, and baking a pie, but mainly underlining that Brexit is a reality,\u201d a broadcast on state-run Rossiya-24 summed up the campaign on Monday. The newscaster concluded the report by noting competing accusations of antisemitism in the Labour party and anti-Muslim remarks by Johnson. Voters have been in touch to share the signs they have spotted at their local polling stations. Adam, 42, who runs a graphic design agency spotted the \u201cchoosing chimp\u201d in Brockley, London. Our local polling station is at Myatt Garden primary school. The teachers had put some thought into the placement of polling signage!\u201d Rob Priest, a history lecturer living in south London, took a photo of his local polling station: A church, food bank, and polling station at the All Nations church on Poynders Road in Clapham. One thing I have been energised by this year is teaching students who are voting for the first time \u2013 almost all of them weren\u2019t able to vote in the referendum and I get the sense they are taking it very seriously. Charlie Hamilton loved the sign spotted by her colleague, Sam Picknell, at Plaistow polling station, West Sussex. Top marks for this: \u201cSocialism or Brexit? this is the Hamlet-like dilemma of the vote in the UK,\u201d writes Enrico Franceschini in the Italian daily La Repubblica. Commenting on the third general election in four years, Franceschini compares the rhythm of politics in what was once a stable European democracy to that of Italy\u2019s. He adds: Today the tribes in which Great Britain is divided are forced to mingle to choose the lesser evil: Boris Johnson, if they want to avoid socialism; Jeremy Corbyn, if they want to avoid Brexit. Many, in both cases, will be holding their noses as they vote. In Corriere della Sera, Beppe Severgnini writes about what a Labour or Conservative could mean for the UK. With Brexit dominating, should Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg (who Severgnini calls \u201cthe sons of Thatcher\u201d) regain power, then they will be tempted to transform Britain into \u201ca pirate ship off the coast of Europe\u201d. He adds: It would be a serious mistake. It is no longer the times of pirate Sir Francis Drake: the European fortress is robust and the defenders have powerful cannons. We are repelled by the idea of shooting - metaphorically - at our English friends. But, if they force us, we\u2019ll do it. German media have been unusually blunt in their assessment of the level of debate in the British elections, and particularly scathing in its assessment of Boris Johnson. \u201cThe country is moving into a new era,\u201d wrote correspondent Cathrin Kahlweit in a leader for S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, a broadly left-leaning, serious broadsheet. \u201cIt will become more insular, cultivate a less civil form of patriotism, inflict more harm on minorities. Necessary reforms \u2013 a new electoral law, a written constitution, better public services \u2013 are likely to be postponed.\u201d Centre-right broadsheet Die Welt wrote that Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d would \u201cblow up in his face\u201d. \u201cHe keeps quiet about the fact that the hard part [of the negotiations] only starts after the withdrawal.\u201d Der Spiegel had a thorough look at Britain\u2019s likely future beyond the election and came to a conclusion that runs against the tenor of the debate in the British media: \u201cA Labour victory would be a blessing for the economy. Because in the case of a victory Corbyn wants to negotiate a \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit deal with the EU ... which should be better for the economy than Johnson\u2019s comparatively hard Brexit.\u201d Queues are usually rare at polling stations, according to research that involved surveys of poll workers, emails Prof Toby James, head of politics at the University of East Anglia. Only 2% of poll workers reported a problem with queues at the 2018 and 2019 local elections, while 6% reported problems at the 2015 general election. The problem that tends to be much more frequently experienced are voters being turned away because they are not on the electoral register (but think that they are because they pay council tax). Hopefully, recent registration drives ahead of the election will mean that we will see less of this today. Problems with the accessibility of polling stations and voters instructing each other how to vote were also often reported in our research. Overall, however, elections do tend to be very well run \u2013 and credit must be given to the electoral officials who have been working under severe pressure ahead of the election. The leader of the Democratic Unionist party, Arlene Foster, has cast her vote in Co Fermanagh, wearing a union jack shawl. Foster arrived at the polling station at Brookeborough primary school shortly after 10am Voters in Bermondsey, south-east London, faced difficulty getting to one polling station after an apparent burst water water main caused flooding in the road around it. Hannah Tookey, who waded through the water to cast her vote, tweeted: \u201cIt was too deep to wade through the middle, even in wellies.\u201d Graham Kings, was prevented from voting by the flooding. He said: \u201cI could have gone home and put wellington boots on and waded across the flooded road to try to get in, but had to go to work and so will vote this evening.\u201d A Southwark council spokeswoman said a polling station inspector had helped voters to get in and cast their votes. \u201cNo one was prevented from voting at any point,\u201d she told PA Media. \u201cAccess to the voting station wasn\u2019t compromised at all.\u201d A Thames Water spokesman said the pipe was damaged by a third party carrying out roadworks in the area. The water supply is being re-routed to the properties in the area while Thames Water repairs the pipe, the spokesman added. Scotland\u2019s first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was joined by her partner, Peter Murrell, as well as the SNP\u2019s Glasgow East candidate David Linden, as she cast her vote at Broomhouse Park Community Hall. The Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, will cast his vote at Clarkston Hall in East Refrewshire, while Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, voted at the Ralston Community Centre in Paisley, Renfrewshire. Boris Johnson has broken from tradition by not voting in his own constituency, PA points out. He was photographed with his dog at polling station in Methodist Central Hall, in the marginal constituency of Cities of London and Westminster where the Conservative are defending a narrow majority of 3,148. The party faces a high-profile challenge in the seat from Chuka Umunna, who joined the Liberal Democrats this year after quitting the Labour party earlier this year.. Johnson opted to vote in central London despite a heavy tactical voting campaign to oust him from his own Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat. Johnson took the seat with a 5,034 majority at the snap election two years ago but pro-European Union campaigners have urged remainers to unite behind Labour\u2019s Ali Milani in a bid to topple the PM. On polling day in 2017, then-prime minister Theresa May voted in her constituency of Maidenhead and David Cameron had his say in Witney in 2015. At the General Election in 2010, Gordon Brown turned up to his local polling station in North Queensferry, situated in the Dunfermline and West Fife constituency he resided in and next to his own seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. Tony Blair also voted with his family at a polling station in his constituency of Sedgefield, County Durham, in 2005, even though he had been in Downing Street for eight years by that point. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and her husband, Duncan Hames, have cast their votes at Castlehill Primary School in Bearsden in her constituency of East Dunbartonshire. Solicitor Emily Waterhouse got in touch with the Guardian to tell us that she had to wait an hour to vote at her polling station, Stour Space on Roach road, in the constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow. When Waterhouse arrived at the polling station at 8.15am she said that were about 50 people in the queue: The problem was there was only one woman there taking the register. I\u2019m lucky my workplace is lenient so I could wait but everyone is trying to get to work. There were about 150 in the queue when I left at 9.15. The Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was greeted by a small number of supporters as he and his wife, Laura Alvarez, arrived to cast their votes in north London. A protester dressed as Elmo, a character from children\u2019s TV programme Sesame Street, was restrained by security guards as she tried to approach Corbyn as he entered the polling station. As the woman in fancy dress argued with security and police, Corbyn said: \u201cHello guys, can we stop the arguments please.\u201d And there have been queues too in Lucy Powell\u2019s safe Labour seat of Manchester Central. So far the only reports of queues we are aware of in a marginal Tory seat are in the south-west London seat of Putney. Reports of long queues in London continue to be posted on Twitter, but here\u2019s one outside the capital in Cambridge, where Labour\u2019s Daniel Zeichner is defending a 12,661 majority. France\u2019s media have been following the UK election campaign closely, and did not take long to draw their conclusions. \u201cBoris Johnson: the liar weakening Europe,\u201d was the front-page splash in the popular Le Parisien tabloid last month. The paper called the prime minister as \u201cEurope\u2019s bogeyman\u201d, a politician for whom \u201cpretty much everything is either an empty promise, economical with the truth, or a downright lie\u201d. Le Monde said, earlier this week, that neither Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn looked particularly promising for Europe. The Labour leader was \u201ca leftwing Eurosceptic who views the EU as a capitalists\u2019 club\u201d, it said, \u201cand has never admitted that leaving will jeopardise all his fine promises of a radical social and economic reform\u201d. But the paper reserved its fiercest criticism for Johnson. \u201cNo longer the clown, the prime minister has started to show his true face,\u201d it said. \u201cBrutal; hungry for power; fleeing the public and awkward questions; disregarding parliament; brandishing a nationalism and an arrogance worthy of Trump.\u201d For all Europeans, starting with Britain\u2019s closest neighbours and partners, the French, \u201cthe entrenchment of a sort of mini-Trump, who dreams of tearing up social and environmental standards and transforming the UK into a tax haven at the doors of the continent, would be very bad news\u201d. In its eve-of-election analysis, Lib\u00e9ration was equally damning. This was, it said, \u201ca different kind of election, far more than the simple renewal of a democratic parliament. Its outcome will define the country\u2019s future for several generations.\u201d And yet the five-week campaign had been \u201cbrutal, packed with untruths and even outright lies, bitter, devoid of substantive debate. It was also, and above all, uninspiring. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have both, for very different reasons, broken all records for unpopularity.\u201d So will voters choose \u201cCorbyn\u2019s radical, hard-left programme, or the certainty of Brexit on a plate by Johnson? The two leaders both talk of uniting the country after three years of division. But each led a deeply polarising campaign. The chance that those fractures will heal fast looks slim indeed.\u201d And now for some London voting queues north of the river. First, in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Islington North seat. Next in another in safe Labour seat of Hornsey and Wood Green. And third in Bethnal Green and Bow, where Labour also has a big majority. Not everyone has had to brave the cold this morning as some of our readers outside the UK have been in touch to tell us how they feel watching the election from abroad. Rory from south London is on holiday in Laos: My other half and I are on holiday on Don Det island in Laos for polling day (don\u2019t worry \u2013 we voted by post before we left)! Luckily it will be our breakfast time as the results start pouring in so we will be readily refreshing the Politics Live blog. We were at Glastonbury in 2016 for the EU referendum and in Goa in 2016 for Trump\u2019s election but hoping for a better result tomorrow. Phil, an English teacher in Hamburg, Germany feels a huge sense of foreboding Sitting here sipping my cuppa before work as a UK national who has been outside the UK for more than 15 years feeling a huge sense of foreboding. I am disenfranchised for the first time in my life and fear what will happen to us expats under a nationalist Tory government. Please tell me the British public aren\u2019t gonna fall for their crap again. It feels somewhat like an abusive relationship cycle. Ric, who is in his 20s and works in online gaming in Gibraltar believes this election is about Brexit: I live on the rock and sent my postal vote last week. I\u2019m enthused by the queues at polling stations in the UK. I think this is the most important election of our generation. It\u2019s often said that this isn\u2019t about Brexit, but ultimately if it wasn\u2019t for the Brexit deadlock we wouldn\u2019t be having an election at all. Of course issues around the NHS, policing and education are important but this election is an attempt at giving us another say on Brexit. In Gibraltar we overwhelmingly voted to remain, we rely on fluidity at our border with Spain, so workers, goods, food and medicine can cross. For me, I think we need another say ... and this election is giving us that! And another Guardian reader is at work in Shanghai: Currently sat with one eye on work and one eye on the Guardian website watching with trepidation. Postal vote already made. While Spain has endured two inconclusive general elections this year - and remains in the hands of a caretaker government - the country is still intrigued and appalled by the UK\u2019s own political contortions. In a dispatch from London, El Mundo\u2019s UK correspondent, Carlos Fresneda, discerns a clear drift towards Trumpism. \u201cMany people see the hostile and belligerent attitude [Boris Johnson] showed towards parliament in his first two months as a taste of things to come,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey fear that, bolstered by the ballot boxes and with an absolute majority, Boris Johnson could behave like a true despot and bring about a definitive split from Europe that sees British society lurch towards the US model (after all, he was born in New York).\u201d The paper\u2019s leader on Thursday morning is equally blunt. The UK, it says, is \u201cfatally fractured\u201d as a result of Brexit and has succumbed to populism more than any other EU country. Rafael Ramos, London correspondent for La Vanguardia, has filed a report from Tony Blair\u2019s former constituency, Sedgefield. There he finds that Labour\u2019s once impregnable \u201cred wall\u201d is looking vulnerable: \u201cA blue tsunami is on its way and it\u2019s being ridden by the blond menace Boris on a surfboard emblazoned with the word Brexit and done out in the colours of the Union Jack.\u201dFor others, the British media\u2019s election coverage is, as ever, a story in itself. Sergio Maydeu-Olivares, an international relations consultant, has tweeted some of Thursday\u2019s front pages: the Scottish Sun\u2019s call for the last person to leave Britain to snuff out the candles if Corbyn wins; the Mail\u2019s desperate plea to back Boris; and the Daily Record\u2019s call to make Scotland a Tory-free land.\u201d The UK press is going out on a limb over Thursday\u2019s election \u2013 and how,\u201d he writes. \u201cNo blushes. No subtlety. Check it out \u2026\u201d More photos queues to vote in south London, this time in Streatham, a safe Labour seat: And another in the Tory marginal of Putney. Boris Johnson kissed his dog Dilyn after voting at Methodist Central Hall near Downing Street. More reports of long queues in South London, this time in Putney, where Justine Greening won a narrow majority of 1,554 for the Tories in 2017 but is not standing in this election. And Camberwell, in Harriet Harman\u2019s safe Labour seat. There have also been big queues in Balham, in the London constituency of Tooting, where Labour\u2019s Rosena Allin-Khan won a majority of 15,458 in 2017. There have been queues already in Battersea, reports Steven Swinford, the deputy political editor of the Times. Labour\u2019s Marsha de Cordova is defending a 2,416 majority in Battersea. Voter selfie of the day so far: As this is the first December election for almost a century early voters have had to brave the dark as well as well as the cold. But there was already a small queue before polls opened in Caversham, in Reading East, where Labour is defending a 3,749 majority. Only a dog had to wait outside in the dark at a polling station in Bury North. Here\u2019s some more gloomy early voting photos: Please keep posting your comments below, but don\u2019t say how you voted. The Representation of the People Act outlaws the reporting of how people voted. We\u2019d like you to show us polling day where you are \u2013 share your pictures, videos and stories and we\u2019ll add them to the live blog. You can get in touch by filling in our form, contacting us via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056, and if you are a first time voter you can share your photos via Instagram using #guardianfirsttimevoter. You can read terms of service here. Please don\u2019t take photos or videos inside the polling booth as this could be a breach of the law. However before you go in, or after you come out, is great. Though you may want to tell us who you are voting for, we won\u2019t be able to publish these until after polling closes at 10pm. If there are any issues voting, we\u2019d like to hear about these too. The polling day weather forecast is pretty dire: wet and cold and even some snow on higher ground. Voting has started, ladies and gents. Polls opened at 7am and will stay open until 10pm. How the papers covered it And we\u2019ve heard from the PM as well: Other election news at a glance Nigel Farage says his Brexit party candidates have been \u201chounded\u201d over the course of a \u201cvery nasty\u201d campaign. The BBC has said its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, did not break electoral law when she reported claims that postal ballots painted a \u201cgrim\u201d picture for Labour. Gary Younge has been back to his hometown of Stevenage to see what voters are thinking. We\u2019ve factchecked the Tories\u2019 claim that the cost of the festive season for families will rise by more than \u00a3100 under Jeremy Corbyn. It won\u2019t. Research shows how Labour and the Conservatives have hidden away senior figures deemed to be embarrassing or \u201coff message\u201d. John Crace has his final campaign sketch: Johnson ends painful campaign with usual bad gags and lies. We\u2019ve pulled together some of the best images from the election campaign. Here\u2019s what the papers say as Britain goes to the ballot box. Corbyn\u2019s team are up and tweeting. And because it really deserves a post of its own, let\u2019s remember that yesterday, Johnson\u2019s final day was marred by accusations he hid in a fridge in order to avoid an interview with Good Morning Britain. Here\u2019s the moment: Marina Hyde, the woman who has kept me both sane and amused throughout this campaign, called the moment \u201cthe final frontier in election WTF-ery\u201d. Here\u2019s more from her, though it really is worth reading her entire column in full: Time for a historical perspective, perhaps: despite having an underground bedroom as part of the war rooms complex, Boris Johnson\u2019s hero Winston Churchill declined to sleep in it any more than four or five times in the entire second world war, including during the blitz when London was under sustained nightly bombardment. Without wishing to go out on a limb, then, it is difficult to imagine Churchill fleeing a lone Path\u00e9 news camera to conceal himself inside a refrigerator. Johnson\u2019s move forces an urgent reordering of the top three most embarrassing places British politicians have hidden because they couldn\u2019t handle the consequences of their actions. This now goes: 3. Edinburgh pub \u2013 Nigel Farage. 2. Disabled loo \u2013 Ken Livingstone. 1. Fridge \u2013 Boris Johnson. Tim Dowling has this handy guide to five politicians who have hidden \u2013 in fridges, toilets and behind trees. Good Election Day morning everyone! We made it, we\u2019re here, the campaign is finally over. It\u2019s been a whirlwind six weeks, let\u2019s have a wrap of some the happenings and absurdities we\u2019ve witnessed in that time: the leaders have travelled across the country, stolen phones, hidden in fridges, refused to apologise for their party\u2019s handling of antisemitism when repeatedly asked by Andrew Neil, refused to be interviewed by Andrew Neil at all, posed in boxing rings, posed bulldozing a menacing tower of styrofoam blocks, watched as their confident promise of becoming prime minister quickly became a vanishingly small prospect, or as their pledge to help the Tories by pulling out of seats backfired. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn whipped across the country yesterday as part of a frantic final day, seeking to woo the undecided voter and cement support among their bases. As for what result we\u2019ll see tonight, the Guardian\u2019s election opinion polls tracker shows the gap between Labour and Tories narrowing \u2013 though it comes with the usual caveats about relying on polls. Dan Sabbagh has written this guide to four election scenarios: from a thumping Tory win to a Corbyn coalition. Thanks for your company over the last 30 (week)days of this campaign. We\u2019re almost at the end, though who knows what will happen next. Let\u2019s do this.",

Here\u2019s a selection of the video moments of the campaign: Rees-Mogg sparks fury with Grenfell comments The Conservatives got off to a terrible start when Jacob Rees-Mogg explained that it was just common sense to have ignored the warnings of the emergency services at Grenfell Tower during the horrific fire. He was forced to apologise and kept a low profile for the remainder of the campaign, barely being seen outside his own constituency. Johnson heckled in Yorkshire Boris Johnson was heckled several times when he went to visit people affected by flooding in Yorkshire. \u201cYou took your time, Boris\u201d and \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d were some of the kinder remarks directed at the Conservative leader. One woman went viral on social media after telling a reporter she thought Johnson was an \u201carsehole\u201d. Farage and Brexit party back down After building up the expectation the Brexit party would stand nationwide, Farage unilaterally decided to withdraw candidates who were fighting against the Conservatives. Had he overplayed his hand in asking for an electoral pact the week before? Patel says government not to blame for poverty Priti Patel astonished observers by claiming that poverty wasn\u2019t caused by Westminster. A feature of the Conservative campaign was of MPs talking as if the party had not been in power for nine years. The ascension of Boris Johnson to the top job might have been year zero for those he had put in office, but it wasn\u2019t for a country that has experienced a decade of austerity politics. Morgan fails her maths Nicky Morgan came a cropper on live TV when she tried to defy basic arithmetic and explain that 19,000 people not leaving their jobs was the equivalent of 19,000 more people being in those jobs. The Good Morning Britain hosts were having none of it. Raab and McDonald face off over debates The debate over who was, or wasn\u2019t, going to appear in election debates and interviews \u2013 basically everybody on everything except Boris Johnson \u2013 overshadowed the debates themselves which were fairly anodyne. One highlight, though, was a spat between the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, after Johnson and Corbyn had clashed in the ITV debate. Raab was captured on camera in another testy confrontation when he spoke angrily to the grieving father of Harry Dunn before a local hustings meeting.

He said: \u201cBoris Johnson makes speeches about the cult of the strongman and wanting to stand up to human rights abusers in certain situations, but then in other situations pops up making contradictory signals to that.\u201d</p> <p>Without naming him, he also delivered a scathing assessment of a recent foreign secretary\u2019s ability to think strategically. </p> <p>Casson recounted: \u201cI once got stuck in traffic in the back of a car with one of the most recent foreign secretaries and I said: \u2018Given all of us in the Foreign Office spend our time trying to make sure you don\u2019t do anything different from what we normally do, what is it the thing that you think you are trying to get us to do to leave behind as your legacy?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThis person thought about it for a bit and said: \u2018Well, I really think we should be trying to save the African elephant and leading on the international wildlife trade, and it is really important that we bring girls into school worldwide and I suppose one of these conflicts in the world, we should be taking a lead on solving.\u201d We then had a discussion about whether Palestine, Libya, Syria or Yemen was particularly ripe for British intervention.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson repeatedly as foreign secretary highlighted the future of elephants, using one speech at Chatham House to admit he was \u201cobsessed with the tragic fate of the African elephant\u201d. He also said more girls in education was the key to unlocking some of the world\u2019s greatest problems.</p> <p>Casson added: \u201cI say this by way of saying there has been an absence of any depth of strategic thinking not just at political level but also confidence amongst officials not just in the Foreign Office but across Whitehall to think clearly about what is the nature of the power that we hold.</p> <p>\u201cThe bald fact for me is British foreign policy \u2013 as I was brought up to recognise it \u2013 came to an end in September 2013, when David Cameron made a conscious decision to stop being an activist prime minister on foreign policy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/30/syria-vote-westminster-foreign-policy\">after he lost the Syrian vote in the Commons</a>. Since then it is very difficult to name an issue on which Britain has made the running in the international space.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted this was not a lament for liberal interventionism, but instead a breakdown in a pro-active optimistic foreign policy drawing on Britain\u2019s strengths.</p> <p>As a former foreign affairs private secretary to Cameron, he added a prime minister \u201cneeds to be on the telephone a lot and travel a lot and see a big part of their job as having relationships with foreign leaders for the sake of relationships with foreign leaders. Since Tony Blair, and perhaps Gordon Brown, we have not really had a prime minister that has had the capacity and the appetite to see as a fundamental slice of their job investing in those political relationships. It has cost us in terms of foreign policy outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>He said from his own experience at No 10 that it is \u201ca bloody battle\u201d to get the prime minister to focus on foreign leaders since \u201cthe building is full of people who think it is a waste of time because it does not win you elections\u201d.</p> <p>He attributed the decline in UK foreign policy influence to a range of factors including the absence of the US holding the ring for its allies, the distraction of Brexit, the shift to a multi-polar world, but also the absence of any confidence in the British political system about what the UK can offer to help the shape the world.</p> <p>The critical factor in shaping British future power would be Brexit, he said, saying the world would be watching and smelling for the signs of economic success or failure. \u201cIf the rest of the world think we are in a mess, the rest of our foreign policy will be very difficult to conduct.\u201d</p> <p>He added that Britain had confused its international brand. \u201cAre we an open country that aspires to set an example and stand up for certain type of norms and influence?\u201d He said this showed in the country\u2019s policies on visas, foreign investment and universities. \u201cIt is not just about foreign policy statements. We need to find our way back to a clearer narrative of what is our point of attraction.\u201d</p> <p>He also urged Britain to be ruthless about aligning its future leverage after Brexit, saying it needed to think whether it wished to remain close to Europe, become the best friend of the newly emerging nations or instead maintain as long as possible the transatlantic umbrella. He said the few bureaucratic changes under way in Whitehall to prepare for Brexit did not match the scale of the challenge facing the country.</p>",

Casson recounted: \u201cI once got stuck in traffic in the back of a car with one of the most recent foreign secretaries and I said: \u2018Given all of us in the Foreign Office spend our time trying to make sure you don\u2019t do anything different from what we normally do, what is it the thing that you think you are trying to get us to do to leave behind as your legacy?\u2019 \u201cThis person thought about it for a bit and said: \u2018Well, I really think we should be trying to save the African elephant and leading on the international wildlife trade, and it is really important that we bring girls into school worldwide and I suppose one of these conflicts in the world, we should be taking a lead on solving.\u201d We then had a discussion about whether Palestine, Libya, Syria or Yemen was particularly ripe for British intervention.\u201d Johnson repeatedly as foreign secretary highlighted the future of elephants, using one speech at Chatham House to admit he was \u201cobsessed with the tragic fate of the African elephant\u201d. He also said more girls in education was the key to unlocking some of the world\u2019s greatest problems. Casson added: \u201cI say this by way of saying there has been an absence of any depth of strategic thinking not just at political level but also confidence amongst officials not just in the Foreign Office but across Whitehall to think clearly about what is the nature of the power that we hold. \u201cThe bald fact for me is British foreign policy \u2013 as I was brought up to recognise it \u2013 came to an end in September 2013, when David Cameron made a conscious decision to stop being an activist prime minister on foreign policy after he lost the Syrian vote in the Commons. Since then it is very difficult to name an issue on which Britain has made the running in the international space.\u201d He insisted this was not a lament for liberal interventionism, but instead a breakdown in a pro-active optimistic foreign policy drawing on Britain\u2019s strengths. As a former foreign affairs private secretary to Cameron, he added a prime minister \u201cneeds to be on the telephone a lot and travel a lot and see a big part of their job as having relationships with foreign leaders for the sake of relationships with foreign leaders. Since Tony Blair, and perhaps Gordon Brown, we have not really had a prime minister that has had the capacity and the appetite to see as a fundamental slice of their job investing in those political relationships. It has cost us in terms of foreign policy outcomes.\u201d He said from his own experience at No 10 that it is \u201ca bloody battle\u201d to get the prime minister to focus on foreign leaders since \u201cthe building is full of people who think it is a waste of time because it does not win you elections\u201d. He attributed the decline in UK foreign policy influence to a range of factors including the absence of the US holding the ring for its allies, the distraction of Brexit, the shift to a multi-polar world, but also the absence of any confidence in the British political system about what the UK can offer to help the shape the world. The critical factor in shaping British future power would be Brexit, he said, saying the world would be watching and smelling for the signs of economic success or failure. \u201cIf the rest of the world think we are in a mess, the rest of our foreign policy will be very difficult to conduct.\u201d He added that Britain had confused its international brand. \u201cAre we an open country that aspires to set an example and stand up for certain type of norms and influence?\u201d He said this showed in the country\u2019s policies on visas, foreign investment and universities. \u201cIt is not just about foreign policy statements. We need to find our way back to a clearer narrative of what is our point of attraction.\u201d He also urged Britain to be ruthless about aligning its future leverage after Brexit, saying it needed to think whether it wished to remain close to Europe, become the best friend of the newly emerging nations or instead maintain as long as possible the transatlantic umbrella. He said the few bureaucratic changes under way in Whitehall to prepare for Brexit did not match the scale of the challenge facing the country.",

      "body": "<p>The Guardian has been fact-checking claims made across the political spectrum as candidates fight for seats in the House of Commons. What was billed as the Brexit election has also become the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/06/boris-johnson-corbyn-labour-brexit\">trust election</a> as the integrity of leaders of the key political parties has repeatedly come into question.</p> <p>Amid fake fact-checking accounts and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/russia-involved-in-leak-of-papers-saying-nhs-is-for-sale-says-reddit\">allegations of Russian disinformation</a>, there have been some wild claims made by all the political parties, some regarding their own policies and others attacking those of their rivals. Here we take a look at some of the fact-checking highlights of the election campaign.</p> <h2>NHS</h2> <p>The health service has been a key battleground in this election, with all parties pledging more support for it. One of the most repeated pledges of the campaign has been the Conservatives\u2019 promise of <strong>40 new hospitals</strong>. The manifesto states that these are in addition to 20 hospital upgrades and will be built over the next 10 years.</p> <p>In reality, the party has allocated \u00a32.7bn so far to upgrade six hospitals, and no money is provided in the manifesto costings to do the rest of the work. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/boris-johnson-40-new-hospitals-pledge-costed\">Providing 40 new hospitals</a> could cost up to \u00a324bn, and there could be hurdles in the way including planning permission and a shortage of construction workers after Brexit.</p> <p>Hand in hand with new hospitals comes the promise of <strong>50,000 more nurses </strong>under the Tories. With this pledge, the devil is in the detail \u2013 the party is not planning to recruit that many new nurses, but rather 31,000, with the rest being existing staff who are persuaded not to leave. The manifesto does include money for \u201crecruitment, training and retention\u201d, but it is not explained how this will be allocated and the sum does not come close to paying for that many extra people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Labour has repeatedly warned that the <strong>NHS is on the table</strong> in trade talks between the UK and US, and it produced documents that it said proved its case. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/what-does-the-trade-dossier-say-about-the-nhs-and-drug-pricing\">documents confirmed</a> that talks between the UK and US have covered the NHS, drug pricing and patents, the pharmaceutical industry and medical devices as part of wider discussions on trade. They did not reveal any decisions about what would be included in any deal.</p> <h2>Crime and security</h2> <p>When Boris Johnson became prime minister in July, one of his first pledges on the steps of 10 Downing Street was to <strong>boost police officer numbers by 20,000</strong>. In reality, this was more of a restoration than a boost, as a roughly equal figure had been cut by Johnson\u2019s party over the past nine years.</p> <p>Prior to the campaign, the Conservatives were accused of using populist crime policies as a cynical electioneering ploy, and the same charge could be laid against the \u201cresearch\u201d they pushed out late in the campaign claiming there would be <strong>52 more murders and 146 more rapes a year under Labour</strong>. Aside from the fact that predicting the number of murders or rapes on such a detailed level is impossible, the method used to arrive at this figure was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/would-a-labour-government-mean-an-extra-a-week\">based on broad assumptions</a>.</p> <p>The Conservatives also tried to exploit immigration concerns, falsely claiming that Labour would extend free movement to the whole world, and then using spurious calculations to predict that this would lead to a surge in net migration, with <strong>840,000 more people arriving each year than leaving</strong> under Labour. It is not Labour policy to extend free movement to the rest of the world, as made clear in the party\u2019s manifesto.</p> <h2><strong>Economy, tax and spending</strong></h2> <p>The Conservatives and Labour have each promised to make people on the lowest incomes better off. Boris Johnson\u2019s comment that his party would <strong>raise the national insurance threshold</strong> to \u00a312,000 quickly turned out to be an aspiration rather than a promise; the Tory manifesto includes costings for increasing it only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/boris-johnson-lets-slip-manifesto-pledge-to-cut-national-insurance\">\u00a39,500 a year</a>.</p> <p>The Tories have focused on claims that voters will be worse off under Labour, putting a \u00a32,400-a-person price tag on the party delivering its promises. The figure was first used before Labour launched its manifesto, so it was not based on the current raft of policies, but it has been restated since then. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s claim that every household will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/would-labour-really-save-families-more-than-6700-a-year\">save \u00a36,700</a> should it get into power was also found to be rocky. Some of the savings, for example those offered by <strong>free broadband</strong>, will not come into effect until 2030. But a Question Time audience member\u2019s claim that Labour\u2019s plans to <strong>increase income tax</strong> for people paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/factcheck-earning-80000-or-more-top-5-of-uk-earners-labour\">\u00a380,000 or more</a> affected far more than the top 5% of earners was just wrong.</p> <h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2> <p>The Liberal Democrats want to stop it, Labour wants to negotiate a new deal and put it to the public in a second referendum with remain as an option, and the Tories want to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.</p> <p>But when and how the Conservatives could get it done is contentious. Johnson and his cabinet have repeatedly pledged to <strong>secure a trade deal by the end of 2020</strong>, which seems highly unlikely given the time constraints. Trade talks cannot legally begin until the UK leaves the EU, which is currently scheduled for 31 January. Because the scheduled transition period expires at the end of December 2020, this leaves just 11 months to negotiate the sort of deal with the EU that Canada took seven years to complete. Theresa May had originally envisaged talks taking two years. Experts say that on average it takes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/can-britain-reach-a-trade-deal-with-the-eu-by-the-end-of-2020\">48 months</a> to negotiate any trade deal.</p> <p>The Tory manifesto locks the party into refusing an extension to the transition period, which many have argued makes a no-deal scenario at the end of 2020 more likely.</p> <p>On the other side of the argument, the Lib Dems pledged a <strong>\u00a350bn remain bonus</strong>. This appears to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/will-there-be-a-50bn-remain-bonus-from-revoking-brexit\">fair estimate</a>, backed up by independent economic forecasters, but it is highly dependent on assumptions and it risks misleading the public by adding together every year of higher tax receipts.</p> <h2><strong>The fight for votes</strong></h2> <p>The Lib Dems were accused of distributing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/lib-dems-accused-over-misleading-and-irresponsible-leaflets\">\u201cmisleading and irresponsible\u201d</a> election leaflets that misrepresented newspaper reports as endorsements of the party.

But three weeks ago the same YouGov MRP poll had the Tories <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/11/27/yougov-mrp-conservatives-359-labour-211-snp-43-ld-\">on course for a majority of 68. </a>The figures suggest a relatively small shift in headline polling numbers can make a big difference to seat numbers; three weeks ago YouGov had the Tories 11 points ahead, and this week it has the gap at nine points (Tories 43%, Labour 34%). And this week\u2019s MRP analysis suggests that, although a Conservative majority of 28 is the central forecast, Johnson could end up with anything between 311 and 367 seats because of the margin of error - meaning a hung parliament (fewer than 326 seats) is a possibility. Johnson\u2019s favoured mode of campaigning has involved posing for photo opportunity, often in a blue-collar work environment with some Brexit metaphor to hand, and today he has been delivering milk, baking (\u201coven-ready deal\u201d) and doing his bit in a cracker factory. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/11/boris-johnson-hides-in-fridge-to-avoid-piers-morgan-interview\">At one point he appeared to take refuge in an industrial fridge to avoid having to talk to Piers Morgan on live TV.</a> Corbyn prefers addressing rallies, and so far he has been speaking in Govan, Middlesbrough, and Rotherham, stressing his commitment to fighting poverty and rescuing the NHS. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/11/general-election-poll-suggests-tory-lead-narrows-as-campaign-enters-last-day-live?page=with:block-5df0c7058f081dfdbe400595#block-5df0c7058f081dfdbe400595\">Jo Swinson has been urging people to vote Lib Dem to \u201cstop Brexit\u201d.</a> And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/11/general-election-poll-suggests-tory-lead-narrows-as-campaign-enters-last-day-live?page=with:block-5df0b3ba8f08eda98155efb2#block-5df0b3ba8f08eda98155efb2\">Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, has been arguing that the SNP is the party best placed to defeat the Tories in Scotland.</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, has said that it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d for the EU to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal with the UK by the end next year</strong>.

We will do all we can to get what I call the \u2018vital minimum\u2019 to establish a relationship with the UK if that is the time scale.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This claim, which is only a marginally blunter version of what he has said in public and which reflects the near-universal consensus in Brussels, undermines Johnson\u2019s claim that he would be able to get a good trade deal negotiated by this time next year. Barnier said one option would to extend the transition period for a year or two. The Conservative party has ruled this out, but the government is likely to come under pressure to do this in the spring (because a decision would have to to be taken by 1 July) and in a speech today <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Brexit party leader, said that if the Tories won the election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/11/general-election-poll-suggests-tory-lead-narrows-as-campaign-enters-last-day-live?page=with:block-5df0c7aa8f081dfdbe40059e#block-5df0c7aa8f081dfdbe40059e\">another Brexit crisis would erupt within months.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we get a Conservative majority, which I still think we will, we will be back in crisis by May next year as we face extension to the whole process, which has to be done by 1 July.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was supposed to be the Brexit election. But Johnson, who has done his best to avoid heavyweight media scrutiny, has managed to get to the end of the campaign without having to explain how he will obtain the quick and beneficial trade deal he is promising, or what in detail it will entail. Commenting on Barnier\u2019s comments, Labour\u2019s <strong>Andrew Gwynne</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson is playing the British public for fools.

The reactionary Brexit Party has all but collapsed since Boris took over. Anti-immigration fervor has calmed. The Tories have also moved back to the economic and social center under Johnson\u2019s leadership. And there is a strategy to this. What Cummings and Johnson believe is that the E.U., far from being an engine for liberal progress, has, through its overreach and hubris, actually become a major cause of the rise of the far right across the Continent. By forcing many very different countries into one increasingly powerful Eurocratic rubric, the E.U. has spawned a nationalist reaction. From Germany and France to Hungary and Poland, the hardest right is gaining. Getting out of the E.U. is, Johnson and Cummings argue, a way to counter and disarm this nationalism and to transform it into a more benign patriotism. Only the Johnson Tories have grasped this, and the Johnson strategy is one every other major democracy should examine.</p> \n   <p>Consider, by contrast, Germany, where the center right is reeling and the extreme-right AfD has 91 seats in the Bundestag. Or, for that matter, France, where the mainstream right has collapsed and Marine Le Pen won 34 percent in the last presidential election. Compare it with the U.S., where the GOP has been overthrown by a far-right insurgency and turned into a disturbingly fascistic personality cult. Or Hungary and Poland, where reactionaries control the entire system. The Tories under Boris, helped in part by the winner-takes-all electoral system, have kept the far right at bay, now favor tax cuts for the poor, have a strong program for climate change, and have proposed an Australian-style immigration policy to defuse native panic. They are not socially conservative in the American sense. And all of this has been made possible by Boris Johnson\u2019s shameless ability to shift and reinvent his politics, betray his allies, lie to the public, and advance his own career. One of those close to him told me that the next group he will betray is the ERG, the hard-right Tory Brexiteers. And if he wins this election by a solid margin and seizes the center, he may force the Labour Party to reexamine how far left it has traveled in the past few years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/zmjjp8/jeremy-corbyn-battle-bus-tour-election-2019\">Jack Shenker for Vice describes a weekend on the campaign trail with Jeremy Corbyn, and explains how he is reshaping politics.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When this election is over and the dust has finally settled, its most important legacy may prove to have little to do with the party leaders themselves \u2013 at least not directly.

Danny, Amsterdam</em></p> \n  <p>We won\u2019t have much recent past data as general elections are usually in May. The conventional wisdom is that winter elections hurt Labour because their traditional voters are less likely to own a car, but this seems outdated. If it were to snow, it seems more likely this would affect the Tories, whose voters are older, and whose \u201cget out the vote\u201d operation is weaker than Labour\u2019s.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: This election has seen a rise of dirty tactics and dishonesty from most of the parties, especially the Conservatives. These include the the fake Fact Checking incident, false smears of other parties and all the lies within adverts on Facebook etc. How can this be allowed and how come not more is being done about this? Andrew, senior designer, London</em></p> \n  <p>Election laws are seriously wanting when it comes to advertising and social media use. It is essentially the Wild West as there is no regulation of it. It is illegal for people to make false statements about candidates but not for parties to present misinformation. The problem is that the winning party in an election has little incentive to make better laws.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T13:18:57.096Z\">at 1.18pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df0e7c18f08f521712b420b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T13:01:34.776Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ian Lavery</strong>, the Labour chair, is speaking at the Labour rally now.

What is the minimum number of seats the Conservatives can have and still realistically expect to govern without having to rely on other parties? Martin, 29, lecturer, Wirral</em></p> \n  <p>The Conservatives need around 320 seats because the DUP are unlikely to play ball because of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal that creates a border down the Irish Sea. No other parties are keen to work with them either. There are 650 MPs \u2013 around seven Sinn Fein who do not take up their seats and four non-voting speakers. Half of that is 319.5 so the Tories are aiming for 320 as their magic number.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: To what extent could young voter turnout sway the election result? Alice, 23, working in tech, Brussels, Belgium</em></p> \n  <p>It could be crucially important. Last time, Labour took Canterbury off the Tories in a shock result attributed to the student vote. Younger voters could make the difference in Labour targets such as Putney and Chingford. Different polls have different predictions for turnout among each age group which partially accounts for wildly varying leads for the Tories of between six and 15 points.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T13:16:50.374Z\">at 1.16pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df0e5f88f081dfdbe400772\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T12:52:10.052Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>At the rally, <strong>Andy McDonald, </strong>the shadow transport secretary, is warming up for Labour.

As well as doing conventional polling (finding a representative survey, and asking people how they will vote), <strong>YouGov</strong> also tried something called a MRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification) model, which involves getting detailed data on how particular demographics vote and then, mapping that against what is know about the demographic make-up of constituencies, trying to predict results on a constituency by constituency basis. In 2017 this was more or less the only polling exercise to predict a hung parliament, and so obviously there has been huge interest in what it is saying this time.</p> \n  <p>Last night YouGov published its second and final MRP poll for this campaign. Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/10/final-2019-general-election-mrp-model-small-\">the YouGov summary </a>by <strong>Anthony Wells.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>YouGov\u2019s latest and final general election MRP model shows the Conservative party headed for an overall majority. Predicted vote shares in our final poll have the Conservatives on 43%, Labour on 34%, the Liberal Democrats on 12% and the Brexit party on 3%.</p> \n   <p>These vote shares translate into 339 seats for the Conservatives, 231 for Labour, 41 for the SNP and 15 for the Liberal Democrats \u2013 giving the Conservatives an overall majority of 28.</p> \n   <p>Like all predictions our model comes with some uncertainty, and the margin of error here could put the final number of Conservative seats from 311 to 367. This means that we absolutely cannot rule out the 2019 election producing a hung parliament - nor can we rule out a larger Conservative majority.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is a chart from <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/10/key-findings-our-final-mrp-poll\">the detailed YouGov analysis</a> showing which seats would change hands under this scenario.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"503f2dbbaf642a638533fc87a72649e2de0cfb9c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/503f2dbbaf642a638533fc87a72649e2de0cfb9c/0_0_643_1012/635.jpg\" alt=\"Seats that would change hands under result forecast by YouGov MRP poll\" width=\"635\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seats that would change hands under result forecast by YouGov MRP poll</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/election_poll_predictions/giv-3902JAGiWcQZe41m/\" data-alt=\"YouGov MRP polling\"> \n   <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/election_poll_predictions/giv-3902JAGiWcQZe41m/\">YouGov MRP polling</a> \n   <figcaption>\n    YouGov MRP polling\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T13:06:07.186Z\">at 1.06pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df0e1848f08f521712b418e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T12:35:24.070Z\">12.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some of your questions so far have been about the Green party and what will happen on 1 February:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: On the subject of getting Brexit done, the PM says we will come out of the EU on 31 January, but what will actually be different on 1 February?

But most EU experts think that this will be another promise that Boris Johnson will have to break (like not extending beyond 31 October) because it will be impossible to negotiate a UK-EU trade deal by the end of next year. If the transition is going to be extended, that decision is going to have to be taken by next summer, and Farage said this would precipitate a crisis. Johnson claims that a vote for the Tories will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, but Farage is probably right in arguing that this claim is bogus. Farage also complained that there had been very little public debate in the campaign about the detail of Johnson\u2019s plans. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They call it the Brexit election. There has been almost no discussion about the withdrawal agreement whatsoever ...</p> \n   <p>If we get a Conservative majority, which I still think we will, we will be back in crisis by May next year as we face extension to the whole process, which has to be done by 1 July ... I know that a botched Brexit, frankly, is barely worth having.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Farage is right to say that Johnson has been able to get through the campaign without his Brexit plan being subject to sustained scrutiny. As an example, yesterday Johnson said at an event: \u201cWe can literally rip up the EU rule book and write a new one for ourselves [after Brexit].\u201d Yet the day before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee6a058f08951c7479d312#block-5dee6a058f08951c7479d312\">when asked by workers about the impact of Brexit on factories dependent on just-in-time supply lines in the north east</a>, Johnson said: \u201cThe thing about the deal we\u2019ve got ... it makes sure we have complete equivalence when it comes to our standards, our industrial requirements and the rest of it.\u201d</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage said a newspaper campaign to get Brexit party candidates to stand down was unworthy of a proper democracy.</strong> Claiming that there had been \u201creal nastiness\u201d in the campaign, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have seen people who want to put themselves forward for election be hounded and bombarded in just the most extraordinary way. Not just horrible abuse on the streets ...</p> \n   <p>Isn\u2019t it amazing an attempt [was] led by a mainstream national newspaper to intimidate people out of standing for public office? That is what has been happening. If this was Bolivia, you would be calling for the United Nations to be brought in. But it\u2019s been happening in this country and it\u2019s still happening today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Farage was referring to the Daily Mail, which <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7670739/Thousands-Daily-Mail-readers-send-letters-Brexit-Party-candidates-urging-stand-down.html\">campaigned for Brexit party candidates to stand down </a>when it was worried they would split the leave vote and damaging Johnson\u2019s chances of winning.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage said that after the election he would write a book about the campaign making the case for proportional representation.</strong> He said it would cover:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Why I think the first past the post electoral system, which might have served us perfectly well in centuries gone by, is no longer fit for purpose, and actually leads to general elections conducted on the basis of endless negativity. \u2018Do you think we\u2019re bad? Look at the other lot. They\u2019re even worse\u2019 ...</p> \n   <p>I do think it\u2019s time for real, fundamental change and political reform. We are living in the 21st century with a 19th century set of institutions. It isn\u2019t working any more. And that bond of trust that needs to exist in a civilised democracy between the electors and those that govern them, that actually has been breaking down over the course of the last few years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One of the ironies of this campaign is that the Brexit party, which is generally seen as a reactionary, rightwing outfit, is the party that is probably doing most in this campaign to champion electoral reform, a cause generally associated with the progressive left. The Liberal Democrats used to be the most vocal advocates of PR. They still support it, but it is not an issue they highlight much. This is probably a consequence of Nick Clegg\u2019s doomed referendum on the alternative vote in 2011, which effectively killed PR as an issue in mainstream politics for the rest of the decade.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21cb1b600e278d1e3dd925e58dde246558765566\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21cb1b600e278d1e3dd925e58dde246558765566/319_0_3875_2326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage speaking in Doncaster this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage speaking in Doncaster this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df0cc0a8f081dfdbe4005e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/heatherstewart\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-11T11:00:50.599Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The second stop of the day for the PM was a brief visit to a catering firm called Red Olive, in the Derby North constituency, where former Labour MP Chris Williamson is standing as an independent after being suspended over antisemitism.</p> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> helped to put the lid on a pie and brush it with egg wash, before placing it in the oven (\u201coven ready\u201d: get it?). </p> \n  <p>He then took another pie, which had already been cooked, out of the oven and displayed it for the cameras.

And taking a swipe at Boris Johnson, who retreated to a fridge in a Yorkshire dairy farm rather than facing questioning, the Labour leader added: \u201cI don\u2019t have to hide in a fridge when somebody comes to asks me a question.\u201d Boris Johnson said the race was getting \u201ctighter and tighter\u201d, urging supporters they have a \u201cnational duty to find every vote to save our country from disaster\u201d. Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, said it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d for the EU to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal with the UK by the end next year. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said it had been \u201ca privilege and honour\u201d to lead the party during the election campaign. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who has been campaigning in Edinburgh, urged Scottish voters to back her party, saying that supporting others \u201crisks helping the Tories\u201d. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage fears that a Conservative majority would see \u201cBrexit sold out\u201d and believes \u201cwe will be back in crisis by May next year as we face extension to the whole process, which has to be done by 1 July\u201d. The Green Party promised that its MPs would respond to the \u201cclimate emergency alarm\u201d. The Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has called for a law to stop politicians lying to voters. The \u201cpresidential\u201d nature of a campaign dominated by the leaders of the two largest parties has been illuminated by research that also reveals how Labour and the Conservatives have hidden away senior figures deemed to be embarrassing or \u201coff message\u201d. Brandon Lewis, the security minister, told the Peston programme that Boris Johnson \u201chas huge empathy and passion to see people get the very best service and care which is why he wants to increase funding for the NHS\u201d following the furore of the prime minister initially refusing to look at a picture of an ill child lying on the floor at Leeds Infirmary. John McDonnell told ITV\u2019s Peston programme he believes Labour will win a majority or \u201cform a minority government and implement our manifesto\u201d without any pacts. He cited the 2017 opinion polls which incorrectly predicted a huge Conservative majority. More than three million women who believe they have been left out of pocket after steep increases to the state pension age have been promised compensation by Labour as part of a \u00a358 billion scheme. On the pledge and criticisms over the party\u2019s manifesto on tackling poverty, shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Peston programme: \u201cThat will be dealt with by progressive taxation. This is not about benefits, it is about entitlement. \u201cWe are ending the benefits freeze, scrapping the Bedroom Tax, introducing a real living wage.\u201d John McDonnell has praised previous Labour government\u2019s domestic policy on the Peston programme. Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson has restated her position that her party would never enter a coalition with either the Conservatives or a Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn. She told ITV\u2019s Peston programme that she could work with another Labour leader however. Thursday\u2019s Times leads on the threat posed by the Brexit Party. Thurday\u2019s Guardian front page The Telegraph is focusing on a similar theme, saying the election is on a \u201cknife edge\u201d. The Financial Times are splashing on polls suggesting the Conservatives\u2019 majority of ten is narrowing. The Metro are also going with election day. Thursday\u2019s front pages are filtering through, starting with the Independent. Jeremy Corbyn, speaking in east London at his last campaign event of the day, told the audience: \u201cTomorrow we\u2019re our knocking on doors like our life depends on it, as the lives of many do.\u201d He recounts enthusiastic Labour events around the country \u201cin the big city, the small places\u201d, adding: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know it from much of the media reporting of the election. It\u2019s commentators speculating on other commentators.\u201d He interrupts shouting from the audience by saying: \u201cNo, no, no, we believe in a free press, I just wish they\u2019d free themselves from the shackles of the billionaires.\u201d Boris Johnson concluded his campaigning by attending a large rally at the Copper Box in Stratford, east London, a venue used during the London 2012 Olympics. The Conservative leader asked if the crowd of several hundred were \u201cpumped up\u201d, \u201cenergised\u201d and \u201cmotivated\u201d - to which they shouted \u201cyes\u201d. Johnson said: \u201cI sincerely hope so everybody.\u201d Listing his manifesto pledges, the prime minister continues with a promise of \u201c50,000 new nurses... 50,000 more nurses I should say\u2026 while the BBC are checking it.\u201d He is referencing his party\u2019s pledge to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-5. Jeremy Corbyn makes his final speech before the country goes to the polls tomorrow. A poll posted this evening by academic Matthew Goodwin. Marina Hyde on the final day of campaigning and \u2018fridge gate\u2019. \u201cWe begin with a fact-check. This general election campaign has officially been going on since around the mid-cretaceous period. \u201cIts final day saw an update to the list of things you shouldn\u2019t keep in the fridge, with the likes of honey, potatoes and avocados now joined by \u201cthe UK prime minister.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s final election rally before the big day. Lord Heseltine on his view of the candidates to become prime minister. The Conservatives told the Andrew Neil Show they do not want to put anyone up for interview the night before the election. Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib has criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, saying the prime minister had \u201cpivoted\u201d back to closer alignment with the EU and away from what had won over his party. He believes Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to stand down in Tory-held seats may have been a mistake. Habib told The Andrew Neil Show: \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we would not have pulled out of so many seats. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, and given where the prime minister is going, we probably shouldn\u2019t have pulled out of all those seats.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn speaking in Bedford this evening courtesy of my colleague Elena Morresi. The BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil asked the Green\u2019s co-leader Sian Berry what the point was of causing \u201cpain\u201d to people from policies including banning gas heating and cutting flights if China continues to pump carbon into the air. Berry said: \u201cThere is a climate emergency, the children are on the streets around the entire globe. \u201cYou cannot argue the UK shouldn\u2019t [act].\u201d She added: \u201cChina needs to come on board with the same reductions. \u201cWhat\u2019s your argument, that we should not bother? That we should not be the climate leaders? \u201cIt is not pain - we are talking about building a better Britain.\u201d Jo Swinson says the Lib Dems are not discussing coalitions. Asked by Andrew Neil whether he has read the report by the Jewish Labour movement, Andy McDonald said he has not read the report in its entirety but feels \u201cincredibly saddened\u201d by the incidents. \u201cBut equally I feel absolutely determined as a member of shadow cabinet... to root this out and Jeremy Corbyn is committed to this cause\u201d. The shadow transport secretary added Corbyn has \u201cmade strides ever since he became leader\u201d, and wants to see anti-Semitism \u201ctackled in wider society\u201d. Andy McDonald, the Labour candidate for Middlesbrough, has responded to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil saying the percentage difference between the Conservatives\u2019 and Labour\u2019s plans on spending for the NHS is tiny. McDonald said: \u201cLook at cancelling nursing bursaries. \u201cWhat a ridiculous thing to do when we need nurses in the NHS.\u201d McDonald said \u201cevery step is counter-intuitive\u201d by the Conservatives, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we need the change.\u201d Speaking in Bedford, Jeremy Corbyn told supporters the Liberal Democrats and Tories took the \u201cpolitical decision to impose austerity on this country.\u201d He said the austerity is evident through the \u201cboarded-up shops, the dead High Streets, the closed youth centres\u201d. And taking a swipe at Boris Johnson, the Labour leader added: \u201cI don\u2019t have to hide in a fridge when somebody comes to asks me a question.\u201d FridgeGate is currently trending on Twitter An IT error has resulted in some people who are not registered to vote being \u201cwrongly informed\u201d that they can take part in the election. The Electoral Commission said a glitch in software used by some councils had led to a \u201csmall number\u201d of ineligible people being told they could vote. The watchdog told the BBC it is working with local authorities affected to ensure those affected do not turn up to vote in error. It is understood the error related to software supplied to councils by Electoral Reform Services, which helps run elections on behalf of local authorities and other organisations. The Electoral Commission says it only became aware of the issue this morning. Senior Conservative sources are distancing the party from acid attack claims in north London, according to BuzzFeed. MPs elected tomorrow night will take part in a security and wellbeing induction session for the first time following a surge in abuse and threats against politicians. MPs will be invited to attend a session in their first week in the role, which a UK Parliament spokesman said will help to \u201censure MPs are kept safe and are able to perform their duties\u201d. It comes after more than 50 MPs chose not to contest the General Election, with four female politicians citing issues of bullying as their reason for standing down. The session is scheduled to take place on December 17 and will cover cyber security, staying safe on and off the parliamentary estate, and wellbeing services. A UK Parliament spokesman said: \u201cThe safety and security of MPs and their staff both on the Parliamentary Estate and elsewhere is an absolute priority. \u201cWe work closely with local police forces, who are responsible for the security of MPs and their staff away from the Parliamentary Estate, to ensure MPs are kept safe and are able to perform their duties. \u201cThe health and wellbeing of everyone working in Parliament is vital. For this reason, we offer a wide range of confidential services, including an on-site nurse, a 24/7 helpline and free professional counselling, to anyone working here, including MPs, peers, their staff and staff working for both Houses.\u201d Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have reverted to core campaigning mode, in terms of message and style, on the final day of an election campaign that has failed to enthuse the public but that could have profound consequences for the nation. In polling terms, there has been very little movement in terms of the gap between the two main parties since the beginning of the campaign (although both the Conservatives and Labour have seen their share of the vote rise significantly, at the expense of the Brexit party and the Lib Dems) and this week\u2019s YouGov MRP poll, which rightly or wrongly is assumed to be the best polling guide to the result, has the Tories heading for a majority of 28. But three weeks ago the same YouGov MRP poll had the Tories on course for a majority of 68. The figures suggest a relatively small shift in headline polling numbers can make a big difference to seat numbers; three weeks ago YouGov had the Tories 11 points ahead, and this week it has the gap at nine points (Tories 43%, Labour 34%). And this week\u2019s MRP analysis suggests that, although a Conservative majority of 28 is the central forecast, Johnson could end up with anything between 311 and 367 seats because of the margin of error - meaning a hung parliament (fewer than 326 seats) is a possibility. Johnson\u2019s favoured mode of campaigning has involved posing for photo opportunity, often in a blue-collar work environment with some Brexit metaphor to hand, and today he has been delivering milk, baking (\u201coven-ready deal\u201d) and doing his bit in a cracker factory. At one point he appeared to take refuge in an industrial fridge to avoid having to talk to Piers Morgan on live TV. Corbyn prefers addressing rallies, and so far he has been speaking in Govan, Middlesbrough, and Rotherham, stressing his commitment to fighting poverty and rescuing the NHS. Jo Swinson has been urging people to vote Lib Dem to \u201cstop Brexit\u201d. And Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, has been arguing that the SNP is the party best placed to defeat the Tories in Scotland. Michel Barnier, the EU chief Brexit negotiator, has said that it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d for the EU to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal with the UK by the end next year. In a private meeting, a recording of which was leaked to the Independent, he said: It is unrealistic that a global negotiation can be done in 11 months, so we can\u2019t do it all. We will do all we can to get what I call the \u2018vital minimum\u2019 to establish a relationship with the UK if that is the time scale. This claim, which is only a marginally blunter version of what he has said in public and which reflects the near-universal consensus in Brussels, undermines Johnson\u2019s claim that he would be able to get a good trade deal negotiated by this time next year. Barnier said one option would to extend the transition period for a year or two. The Conservative party has ruled this out, but the government is likely to come under pressure to do this in the spring (because a decision would have to to be taken by 1 July) and in a speech today Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said that if the Tories won the election, another Brexit crisis would erupt within months. He said: If we get a Conservative majority, which I still think we will, we will be back in crisis by May next year as we face extension to the whole process, which has to be done by 1 July. This was supposed to be the Brexit election. But Johnson, who has done his best to avoid heavyweight media scrutiny, has managed to get to the end of the campaign without having to explain how he will obtain the quick and beneficial trade deal he is promising, or what in detail it will entail. Commenting on Barnier\u2019s comments, Labour\u2019s Andrew Gwynne said: Boris Johnson is playing the British public for fools. He\u2019s hiding in fridges to dodge interviews precisely because his fake Brexit slogans can\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, just like his empty words on the NHS. Johnson\u2019s sell-out Brexit deal will put us on the fast-track to a cliff-edge no-deal Brexit. The Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has called for a law to stop politicians lying to voters. The \u201cpresidential\u201d nature of a campaign dominated by the leaders of the two largest parties has been illuminated by research that also reveals how Labour and the Conservatives have hidden away senior figures deemed to be embarrassing or \u201coff message\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is taking over now. The Conservatives were given more than \u00a33 million in large donations in the fourth week of the election campaign. According to the Electoral Commission\u2019s publication of donations above \u00a37,500, the Tory election war chest was boosted by \u00a33.2 million between November 27 and December 3. Bridgemere UK plc, an umbrella group of real-estate companies and developers, donated \u00a31 million alone to Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign effort. Labour lagged far behind in terms of four-figure donations, accepting \u00a3727,000 in the same period - less than a quarter of what the Tories raked in. The largest single donation received by Labour came from the GMB union, which donated \u00a3290,000 to the campaign to elect Jeremy Corbyn. In week four, the Brexit Party benefited from \u00a3125,000 extra for their campaign, the Liberal Democrats took in an additional \u00a380,000 and the Green Party was given \u00a350,000. Advance Together, a party set up in the wake of the Grenfell Tower blaze to call for more local accountability, also reported receiving \u00a322,750. Overall, the parties reported \u00a34.2 million of donations and \u00a39,171 in loans during the seven-day timeframe. These are from the academic Paula Surridge. Even in an interview with Pink News, Boris Johnson has still refused to apologise for referring to gay men as \u201ctank-topped bum boys\u201d in a column in the 1990s. The Guardian\u2019s latest Politics Weekly podcast is out. Rowena Mason is joined by Jennifer Williams, Will Tanner, and Chris Prosser to attempt to predict what way the election will go tomorrow, and ponder what life might be like when it\u2019s all over. Plus, Heather Stewart rings in to tell us how the prime minister is feeling after what has been a wobbly last campaign week. The Labour party has released figures that it says shows it has won the social media campaign. It says on Facebook Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have achieved 86.2m views on campaign videos, compared to only 24.5m for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. From my colleague Severin Carrell The youth vote may yet turn out to be significant in tomorrow\u2019s general election, but in Cardiff as many as 200 students may not be able to vote because of registration error. Students were urged to register ahead of the November 26 deadline, and told to include their flat number as well as their street address. According to Cardiff council around 200 applications - many from students in halls - were invalid because of incomplete addresses. Students told Wales Online they had filled their details in correctly and claimed there had been no contact from the local authority alerting them to any error. Morgan Cullen, 19, who studies at the University of South Wales, said: I registered online at my university address, typed in my postcode and I clicked my flat number that automatically came up. I then had absolutely no contact from the council to say there was an issue with my address and that it was invalid. I was of course really angry when I found out. I think it could have a massive impact because of how crucial it is for young people to get out and vote. President of the National Union of Students Wales, Rob Simkins, urged the council to intervene to ensure that the affected students are added to the electoral register in time and can vote. \u201cThis is the general election that will define our futures and students are demanding that their voices be heard.\u201d Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has been recorded telling a private meeting that the EU would not be able to conclude a full trade negotiation with the EU by the end of next year, as Boris Johnson claims. As the Independent reports in its scoop, Barnier said: It is unrealistic that a global negotiation can be done in 11 months, so we can\u2019t do it all. We will do all we can to get what I call the \u2018vital minimum\u2019 to establish a relationship with the UK if that is the time scale. This supports the claim made by Nigel Farage in a speech this morning: that the UK will face a Brexit crisis in the spring, when the government comes under pressure to agree an extension to the transition period (that the Tory manifesto rules out). (See 11.35am.) As my colleague Jennifer Rankin points out, this is much the same as what Barnier has been saying in public on this topic, only with a slightly more negative twist. Around 200 people gathered in Dinnington, Rotherham, to see Jeremy Corbyn give a 12 minute stump speech in the rain. Rother Valley has been Labour since its creation in 1918, but YouGov\u2019s MRP poll has it down as a possible Tory gain tomorrow. The Labour leader emerged from his party\u2019s battle bus - for one of six planned campaign visits on Wednesday - to chants of \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. He said: The choice could not be clearer. The choice is, you carry on like this. You carry on with a prime minister you can\u2019t trust. You carry on with a government that won\u2019t tell you the truth, or you elect a Labour government, where we set out page after page in our manifesto of fully-funded, fully-costed, very carefully prepared [policies]. He said the manifesto was the product of the work of \u201cthousands of people in our party and our unions and our communities\u201d. The document\u2019s policies would only bring UK public spending up to the same levels as France and Germany, said Corbyn. \u201cThat\u2019s how far backwards we\u2019ve gone since Margaret Thatcher moved into Downing Street,\u201d he said, to boos from the crowd. \u201cAnd Tony Blair,\u201d said one man. The Labour leader climbed back on the bus to more chants of \u201cOh Jezza, we love you\u201d. \u201cThank you for giving us hope, Jeremy,\u201d shouted one man. On a relatively quiet day - at least, in news terms; there is a lot of campaigning taking place, but not much is being said that has not been said before \u2013 here is a campaign reading list: two features on Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn respectively, from non-Guardian writers. Andrew Sullivan in the New York magazine argues that for all Boris Johnson\u2019s flaws (and Sullivan is quite explicit about them), he is \u201cquietly forging a new conservatism\u201d and could be \u201cpioneering a path for other western parties of the center right confronted by the rise of populist extremism\u201d. [Johnson] has done what no other conservative leader in the west has done: He has co-opted and thereby neutered the far right. The reactionary Brexit Party has all but collapsed since Boris took over. Anti-immigration fervor has calmed. The Tories have also moved back to the economic and social center under Johnson\u2019s leadership. And there is a strategy to this. What Cummings and Johnson believe is that the E.U., far from being an engine for liberal progress, has, through its overreach and hubris, actually become a major cause of the rise of the far right across the Continent. By forcing many very different countries into one increasingly powerful Eurocratic rubric, the E.U. has spawned a nationalist reaction. From Germany and France to Hungary and Poland, the hardest right is gaining. Getting out of the E.U. is, Johnson and Cummings argue, a way to counter and disarm this nationalism and to transform it into a more benign patriotism. Only the Johnson Tories have grasped this, and the Johnson strategy is one every other major democracy should examine. Consider, by contrast, Germany, where the center right is reeling and the extreme-right AfD has 91 seats in the Bundestag. Or, for that matter, France, where the mainstream right has collapsed and Marine Le Pen won 34 percent in the last presidential election. Compare it with the U.S., where the GOP has been overthrown by a far-right insurgency and turned into a disturbingly fascistic personality cult. Or Hungary and Poland, where reactionaries control the entire system. The Tories under Boris, helped in part by the winner-takes-all electoral system, have kept the far right at bay, now favor tax cuts for the poor, have a strong program for climate change, and have proposed an Australian-style immigration policy to defuse native panic. They are not socially conservative in the American sense. And all of this has been made possible by Boris Johnson\u2019s shameless ability to shift and reinvent his politics, betray his allies, lie to the public, and advance his own career. One of those close to him told me that the next group he will betray is the ERG, the hard-right Tory Brexiteers. And if he wins this election by a solid margin and seizes the center, he may force the Labour Party to reexamine how far left it has traveled in the past few years. Jack Shenker for Vice describes a weekend on the campaign trail with Jeremy Corbyn, and explains how he is reshaping politics. When this election is over and the dust has finally settled, its most important legacy may prove to have little to do with the party leaders themselves \u2013 at least not directly. After decades of technocratic stasis during which the main options on the ballot paper were relatively indistinguishable, 2019 represents, for many voters, the first opportunity they\u2019ve ever had to choose between two plausible but radically different options for government. Far from being apathetic, or \u201canti-politics\u201d, that choice has spurred vast numbers of people out into the streets to join rallies, to hand out leaflets, and to knock on doors throughout a cold, wet winter. Most are not even members of the Labour party, and many will never have been involved in any campaigning before. Helping to create the conditions under which that shift was possible \u2013 a move from electoral politics being primarily something that people experience passively from above, to it being something that many now pursue actively from below \u2013 may be Corbyn\u2019s most significant achievement to date. \u201cOf course I\u2019m enjoying the campaign,\u201d Corbyn insists as we pull into his final event at Haverfordwest, and prepare to say goodbye. \u201cI\u2019ve got a new pair of glasses, a trim beard and we\u2019re about to do some communal dancing. We\u2019re absolutely fine.\u201d Losing candidates standing in Dominic Raab\u2019s former constituency may not be invited to deliver speeches after the declaration as council officials try to manage overwhelming interest from the world\u2019s media and the public. The electoral authorities overseeing the count for Esher and Walton have said they will only guarantee that the winner will be able to address the crowd assembled at the count. An Elmbridge borough council spokesperson said: \u201cIf the winning candidate would like to make a short speech, following the result declaration, that is fine.\u201d This decision represents a U-turn, sources close to candidates say. The returning officer\u2019s staff had initially warned on Tuesday that they would break with convention and stop any statements from a stage at the count at Sandown Park Racecourse. Raab is one of the big names who could be unseated in Thursday\u2019s election, and provide Friday with a so-called \u201cPortillo moment\u201d, according to new analysis by YouGov released on Tuesday. Officials say that the council is trying to cope with a series of logistical problems brought on by a demand for access to the count. More than 33 media outlets are seeking accreditation at one of the most keenly anticipated results \u2013 usually Elmbridge Borough council has zero requests for media access for elections in a seat that has been held by the Tories for more than a century. Raab is facing a challenge from Monica Harding, the Lib Dem candidate, in the prosperous, leafy seat. YouGov\u2019s analysis says the foreign secretary\u2019s 23,000-strong majority in Esher and Walton could be overturned by the Liberal Democrats, who are currently just 2% behind him. The Labour leader in Wales, Mark Drakeford, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to a Welsh wrapping present factory (see 3.16pm) as a Christmas gift for the prime minister\u2019s opponents. Drakeford said: His being here is a bit of present for the Labour party. Nothing motivates our voters more than the sight of a genuine Tory. Mr Johnson is a recruiting sergeant for Labour in Wales. I don\u2019t hope to see him here often but him being here will motivate our people. But Drakeford also admitted that Jeremy Corbyn was not going down well with everyone in Wales. He said: Mr Corbyn is a Marmite candidate on the doorstep. When I say that to him, he says: \u2018Don\u2019t forget Marmite is very good for you.\u2019 There are people who are going to vote Labour who are uncertain about Jeremy. But for every one that I meet like that I meet someone else who says the reason they vote Labour is because of Jeremy. That is certainly true of the hundreds of young people who have turned out to help our campaign this time. Drakeford was doing some last-minute campaigning in Bridgend with his party\u2019s candidate, Madeleine Moon. He said this was a \u201cfork-in-the-road\u201d election. Ending up with the Tories would be disastrous for Wales, he said. \u201cMore cuts, more neglect, more focus on things that matter to a few people and don\u2019t matter at all to most people.\u201d The alternative was a Labour government \u201cwith a genuine hope about something different, serious about climate change, determined to invest in our public services, determined to change the nature of our country so it works for the bulk of people rather than being organised around the things that only reward those who have already got more than they will ever know what to do with.\u201d Fifteen former Labour MPs have signed a message for an advert that has been placed in the Manchester Evening News and other regional newspapers urging people not to vote Labour. It says Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to be prime minister. Asked about the message, Corbyn said the ex-MPs should \u201clook themselves in the mirror\u201d and ask if they really want to let in the Tories again. He went on: People who have left the Labour party and decided to join up with the party that has imposed austerity, poverty and injustice on the poorest people in this country should look themselves in the mirror and decide what they are doing. Are they really wanting a Tory government re-elected? I put that question simply to them. But I say this - our party is very big and very strong, very welcoming and very open. Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign took a festive turn as he visited a south Wales firm which is said to be the Queen\u2019s Christmas cracker supplier, the Press Association reports. He helped box up rolls of wrapping paper - a case of putting round tubes in a square hole - before joining staff at IG Design Group in pulling crackers. The PM read out the joke in one of the crackers, asking: \u201cWhat can you make that cannot be seen? The answer is a noise.\u201d As PA reports, the noise of laughter was not heard, so the PM added: \u201cWhat can you get done by Christmas? Brexit.\u201d Some laughter was heard at this point, with Johnson commending those who got the \u201cright answer\u201d. Discarded on the floor nearby was another of the pieces of paper from a cracker, which had as its charade prompt the movie The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\u201d. Here is Paul Williams, the Labour candidate in Stockton South, a Labour-held marginal, welcoming the fact that he has had an endorsement from his Lib Dem opponent. (See 12.23pm.) This move has been backed by the Vote for a Final Say campaign, which wants a second referendum on Brexit. It has released this list of constituencies where it is urging the third-placed candidate to \u201cstep aside\u201d for the person who has the best chance of beating the Tories. (At this point candidates cannot \u201cstep aside\u201d; the ballot papers have been printed, and names cannot be removed. But candidates can vote for other people, and urge their supporters to vote for other people.) The comedian Steve Coogan has said Alan Partridge would have voted for Brexit. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme, Coogan said: Yes, [Partridge] would [have voted leave] because Alan is like one of those people who is very confident. There are lots of people in government actually who are very like Alan Partridge in that they are super confident and not that well informed. Alan Partridge, his points of view and attitude is influenced by the likes of Boris Johnson. As Max Hastings said, Boris Johnson thinks he is Winston Churchill but he is more like Alan Partridge. Brexit was supposed to be all about taking back control. But, as my colleague Jennifer Rankin points out, one of the ironies of the current situation is that at the EU summit taking place tomorrow the person who might end up casting a vote on behalf of the UK will be Charles Michel, the former prime minister of Belgium who is the new president of the European council. Jennifer sent me this explanation of how this will work in practice. This basically means that Charles Michel as president of European council would take any decisions on behalf of the UK. For example, on Thursday the EU may agree an EU-wide net zero carbon emissions target for 2050. Michel would confirm that the UK supports that text in the council conclusions. That\u2019s not controversial as Theresa May signed up the UK in June and it\u2019s already part of UK government policy. In legal terms European council conclusions only have legal standing if adopted by all EU member states. Giving the vote to the president means that the texts still have legal standing, even if a prime minister or president is absent. In ministerial meetings, countries can be replaced by their ambassadors. The UK often does this now. But it\u2019s deemed inappropriate for EU summits, where access is very restricted at certain moments to the leaders and interpreters. It is also worth remembering that under the government\u2019s empty chair policy (not attending some EU meetings), Finland (current holders of the EU rotating presidency) is empowered to cast the UK\u2019s vote (to ensure that a UK no show does not block the EU from moving forward, eg when a unanimity vote take place, or when the QMV is tight). From my colleague Heather Stewart, who is on the Boris Johnson battlebus Earlier I quoted the Brexit party candidate in Doncaster North, Andy Stewart, saying he had been a victim of \u201cracism of opinion\u201d. (See 10.18am.) The Press Association has now filed his quotes. Stewart said, as a mixed-race man, he had seen racism first-hand. But he claimed the abuse he has witnessed in the past month as a Brexit party candidate had been quite different. There\u2019s a new kind of racism about. It\u2019s not for colour, it\u2019s not for creed or race, and it\u2019s not for religion - it\u2019s for opinion. It\u2019s racism of opinion. You are then charged with being of this kind of opinion, and you\u2019re ostracised. People turn around and tell you that your opinion\u2019s not worth anything, you\u2019re charged with being different to other people. Thanks for all your questions Our political team will answer any questions you have about the election results on Friday at 12.30pm. You can ask your question via our form here. A few more questions from readers below: Q: Will the Fixed-term Parliaments Act mean that we can expect all elections to be winter elections from now on or will that act be done away with should Boris get a majority? Avi Smith, 55, Yorkshire Both the Conservatives and Labour have vowed to scrap the FTPA if they win a majority. Regardless, elections default to May under the act so the next election is unlikely to be December again. Q: Some former Tories are running their campaign as independents because they were expelled from the party. How are they faring overall and do they have a chance? It seems to me that in all the electoral reports their campaigns have been a bit overlooked. F Spaak, 40, PR consultant, Twente, the Netherlands They are quite unlikely to win because all of them are running in seats with huge Tory majorities but some surveys suggest they could come second. Q: For those of us who have to work on Friday so need to sleep but also want to catch exciting election moments live, do you have any advice on whether it\u2019s best to stay up late or get up early? Any specific times to look out for? Chloe, 50, self-employed, Bristol It depends how excited you are and able to cope with sleep deprivation. The exit poll published at 10pm will give a good steer about the result. But to be sure which way the result is going you probably would need to stay awake for the first bellwether seats in the early hours of the morning. It will be clear by then whether the Tories are making gains in Labour\u2019s northern heartlands that would give them a majority. By 6am, it should be obvious who has won or whether it looks like a hung parliament unless there really is only a few seats in it. Corbyn says David Cameron once said we are all in it together. But we are not, he says. There are 150 billionaires in the UK. Tax breaks have helped the rich, he says. We are a seriously divided society. Corbyn urges activists to go \u201cflat out\u201d to get people voting. Tomorrow is a chance to elect a government that people can trust, a government that won\u2019t just be working for billionaires, but a government that will be working to improve the life chances of everyone, he says. Corbyn has now finished, and the crowd is chanting: \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at the Labour rally now. He says he is not here to deliver milk, or hide in a fridge. He wants to lead a Labour government that will properly fund the NHS and social care, he says. He praises Andy McDonald\u2019s work as shadow transport secretary, particularly developing plans to bring rail services back into public ownership and to improve bus services. On the NHS, he says he has been contacted by someone whose mum went into A&amp;E on Monday, and who is now still waiting for a bed. And it is only December. What will the NHS crisis be like in January or Febuary. Corbyn says Boris Johnson\u2019s comments on the supposed 40 new hospitals he will build have been \u201ca complete piece of dishonesty\u201d. He does a brief Johnson impression (ruffling his hair and harrumphing) when he mocks Johnson\u2019s response to his first questions on this. He says Johnson eventually gave up claiming there would be 40 new hospitals. Under Labour, the NHS would be \u201cnot for sale\u201d, he says. The crowd chant the phrase. He says Labour figures have had to put up with unbelievable levels of abuse and character assassination during the 51 days of the election campaign. But he won\u2019t do the same thing, he says. If you wish to inhabit the gutter, that\u2019s absolutely fine by me, but I will not be joining you there. Just over 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the general election. Send them in to us here. Q: Are elderly voters less likely to come out and vote in a cold, December election and could this affect the result? Danny, Amsterdam We won\u2019t have much recent past data as general elections are usually in May. The conventional wisdom is that winter elections hurt Labour because their traditional voters are less likely to own a car, but this seems outdated. If it were to snow, it seems more likely this would affect the Tories, whose voters are older, and whose \u201cget out the vote\u201d operation is weaker than Labour\u2019s. Q: This election has seen a rise of dirty tactics and dishonesty from most of the parties, especially the Conservatives. These include the the fake Fact Checking incident, false smears of other parties and all the lies within adverts on Facebook etc. How can this be allowed and how come not more is being done about this? Andrew, senior designer, London Election laws are seriously wanting when it comes to advertising and social media use. It is essentially the Wild West as there is no regulation of it. It is illegal for people to make false statements about candidates but not for parties to present misinformation. The problem is that the winning party in an election has little incentive to make better laws. Ian Lavery, the Labour chair, is speaking at the Labour rally now. He gets the crowd singing \u201cPrime Minister Corbyn\u201d to the \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn tune\u201d. Holding up a copy of the Labour manifesto, he says he calls it the \u201cbook of hope\u201d. This election is not about Brexit, he says. He says it is about the type of society we want to live in. Britain cannot afford another five years of the Tories, or another five days, he says. He says Boris Johnson should be kicked out of Downing Street \u201clike a dog\u201d. Laura Pidcock, the shadow employment minister, is speaking at the Labour rally. She says Labour has campaigned with integrity. Unlike the Tories, its has not resorted to lies, she says. She says there are still people who have not decided how to vote. Labour must show them a better world is possible. She says Labour is campaigning on behalf of the 14.3 million people in poverty, on behalf of the 4 million children in poverty, and on behalf of the Waspi women who are entitled to receive the money they\u2019ve lost. You have been sending in your questions about the general election which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: 326 is the target number of seats for a majority, but it is generally accepted it can be a bit lower than this for a party to still have a working majority. What is the minimum number of seats the Conservatives can have and still realistically expect to govern without having to rely on other parties? Martin, 29, lecturer, Wirral The Conservatives need around 320 seats because the DUP are unlikely to play ball because of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal that creates a border down the Irish Sea. No other parties are keen to work with them either. There are 650 MPs \u2013 around seven Sinn Fein who do not take up their seats and four non-voting speakers. Half of that is 319.5 so the Tories are aiming for 320 as their magic number. Q: To what extent could young voter turnout sway the election result? Alice, 23, working in tech, Brussels, Belgium It could be crucially important. Last time, Labour took Canterbury off the Tories in a shock result attributed to the student vote. Younger voters could make the difference in Labour targets such as Putney and Chingford. Different polls have different predictions for turnout among each age group which partially accounts for wildly varying leads for the Tories of between six and 15 points. At the rally, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, is warming up for Labour. He says opinion is \u201con the move\u201d. Labour can win this election, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is now arriving to address the Labour rally in Middlesbrough. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. From the Labour rally in Middlesbrough Boris Johnson flew from east Midlands to Cardiff airport as he continued his election campaigning in south Wales, the Press Association reports. The PM\u2019s flight took around 40 minutes. He has previously taken short-haul flights on the campaign, including between Doncaster Sheffield airport and Teesside, prompting criticism from Labour and climate campaigners. Opinion polls have generally not had a good record at recent elections, but in 2017 one exercise run by a polling company did prove remarkably successful. As well as doing conventional polling (finding a representative survey, and asking people how they will vote), YouGov also tried something called a MRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification) model, which involves getting detailed data on how particular demographics vote and then, mapping that against what is know about the demographic make-up of constituencies, trying to predict results on a constituency by constituency basis. In 2017 this was more or less the only polling exercise to predict a hung parliament, and so obviously there has been huge interest in what it is saying this time. Last night YouGov published its second and final MRP poll for this campaign. Here is an extract from the YouGov summary by Anthony Wells. YouGov\u2019s latest and final general election MRP model shows the Conservative party headed for an overall majority. Predicted vote shares in our final poll have the Conservatives on 43%, Labour on 34%, the Liberal Democrats on 12% and the Brexit party on 3%. These vote shares translate into 339 seats for the Conservatives, 231 for Labour, 41 for the SNP and 15 for the Liberal Democrats \u2013 giving the Conservatives an overall majority of 28. Like all predictions our model comes with some uncertainty, and the margin of error here could put the final number of Conservative seats from 311 to 367. This means that we absolutely cannot rule out the 2019 election producing a hung parliament - nor can we rule out a larger Conservative majority. And here is a chart from the detailed YouGov analysis showing which seats would change hands under this scenario. Some of your questions so far have been about the Green party and what will happen on 1 February: Q: On the subject of getting Brexit done, the PM says we will come out of the EU on 31 January, but what will actually be different on 1 February? For the ordinary person, and for businesses? Bill Muskett, 66, retired, Cheshire It will mostly be a symbolic exit as the UK will still be in transitional arrangements meaning trading relationships, free movement and links to EU institutions remain until the end of 2020 at least. Johnson has insisted a new immigration system and EU trade deal will be ready by then. If not, he can seek an extension to transition or face a cliff-edge where the UK would trade on WTO terms. Q: Why has the Green party failed to make much impact in this election given the success of XR and acceleration of the climate breakdown? Steve, 57, lecturer, Southend All the smaller parties have been squeezed in this election as the choice between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn is so stark that voters seem to be making decisions based on who they would rather see as prime minister. We\u2019re now on stop two of Jo Swinson\u2019s tour of London and commuter-belt marginals, in Guildford \u2013 where the decision of former Tory MP Ann Milton to stand as an independent could split the Conservative vote tomorrow. The Lib Dem leader was in a small, packed room in a village hall, where she gave assembled activists much the same message as she had half an hour down the road in Horsham \u2013 in such a volatile election, getting out the vote matters hugely. Swinson told me at the last stop that she was hopeful the Lib Dem ground game, buoyed by local election gains in May and a record-high membership, could be crucial. She also said she would enjoy a nervy election night all the more if tactical voting saw the Lib Dems eject some high-profile Brexiter MPs (she began the day in Dominic Raab\u2019s seat): \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that would certainly be the case.\u201d I\u2019m Rowena Mason, deputy political editor for the Guardian, and I will be answering any questions you have on the general election today. I have written about Westminster politics for eight years, covering three elections and two referendums. During this election, I have been tracking the Tories since Boris Johnson\u2019s first stump speech in Birmingham. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Jeremy Corbyn is due to address a Labour rally in Middlesbrough shortly. There is a live feed here. A last-minute push for tactical voting has seen one Lib Dem candidate in a highly marginal seat effectively endorse his Labour opponent, advising local people to support him to avoid the constituency falling to the Conservatives. In a series of tweets, Brendan Devlin said that while he could not support either Labour or Jeremy Corbyn, the incumbent Labour MP, Paul Williams, was \u201can honest, sincere man, and if I needed help, I know he\u2019s reliable and committed to social justice\u201d. He added: To be crystal clear: vote tactically for someone who cares about the NHS and social care. Those are important in Stockton South. The 2017 election saw Williams defeat the Conservatives by just 888 votes, but polling for Thursday\u2019s election puts the Tories marginally ahead. Stockton South is one of the seats being highlighted by Vote for a Final Say, an anti-Brexit campaign group which is urging people to vote tactically, and has called for a series of Labour and Lib Dem candidates to step aside where polling suggests they are in third place in a marginal constituency \u2013 with Devlin among them. As part of a series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm today and Friday. Today, Rowena Mason, deputy political editor for the Guardian, will answer any questions you have on the general election. You can ask your question via our form here. Here is a question from below the line. We published this guide a few days ago. As for when a winner will be announced (assuming there is a winner, and we don\u2019t have a hung parliament), that tends to happen quite late in the night \u2013 nearer dawn than midnight. The broadcasters won\u2019t formally declare a winner until one party has reached 326 seats. But we will get an exit poll at 10pm. Since 1997 these have always been a fairly accurate guide to the final result, and in some recent years they have forecast the final tally precisely. Here are the main points from Nigel Farage\u2019s speech earlier. Farage, the Brexit party leader, said Britain would be \u201cback in [Brexit] crisis by May\u201d because at that point the government would be under pressure to agree to an extension to the Brexit transition. The Conservatives have ruled out in their manifesto extending the transition period beyond December 2020. But most EU experts think that this will be another promise that Boris Johnson will have to break (like not extending beyond 31 October) because it will be impossible to negotiate a UK-EU trade deal by the end of next year. If the transition is going to be extended, that decision is going to have to be taken by next summer, and Farage said this would precipitate a crisis. Johnson claims that a vote for the Tories will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, but Farage is probably right in arguing that this claim is bogus. Farage also complained that there had been very little public debate in the campaign about the detail of Johnson\u2019s plans. He said: They call it the Brexit election. There has been almost no discussion about the withdrawal agreement whatsoever ... If we get a Conservative majority, which I still think we will, we will be back in crisis by May next year as we face extension to the whole process, which has to be done by 1 July ... I know that a botched Brexit, frankly, is barely worth having. Farage is right to say that Johnson has been able to get through the campaign without his Brexit plan being subject to sustained scrutiny. As an example, yesterday Johnson said at an event: \u201cWe can literally rip up the EU rule book and write a new one for ourselves [after Brexit].\u201d Yet the day before, when asked by workers about the impact of Brexit on factories dependent on just-in-time supply lines in the north east, Johnson said: \u201cThe thing about the deal we\u2019ve got ... it makes sure we have complete equivalence when it comes to our standards, our industrial requirements and the rest of it.\u201d Farage said a newspaper campaign to get Brexit party candidates to stand down was unworthy of a proper democracy. Claiming that there had been \u201creal nastiness\u201d in the campaign, he said: I have seen people who want to put themselves forward for election be hounded and bombarded in just the most extraordinary way. Not just horrible abuse on the streets ... Isn\u2019t it amazing an attempt [was] led by a mainstream national newspaper to intimidate people out of standing for public office? That is what has been happening. If this was Bolivia, you would be calling for the United Nations to be brought in. But it\u2019s been happening in this country and it\u2019s still happening today. Farage was referring to the Daily Mail, which campaigned for Brexit party candidates to stand down when it was worried they would split the leave vote and damaging Johnson\u2019s chances of winning. Farage said that after the election he would write a book about the campaign making the case for proportional representation. He said it would cover: Why I think the first past the post electoral system, which might have served us perfectly well in centuries gone by, is no longer fit for purpose, and actually leads to general elections conducted on the basis of endless negativity. \u2018Do you think we\u2019re bad? Look at the other lot. They\u2019re even worse\u2019 ... I do think it\u2019s time for real, fundamental change and political reform. We are living in the 21st century with a 19th century set of institutions. It isn\u2019t working any more. And that bond of trust that needs to exist in a civilised democracy between the electors and those that govern them, that actually has been breaking down over the course of the last few years. One of the ironies of this campaign is that the Brexit party, which is generally seen as a reactionary, rightwing outfit, is the party that is probably doing most in this campaign to champion electoral reform, a cause generally associated with the progressive left. The Liberal Democrats used to be the most vocal advocates of PR. They still support it, but it is not an issue they highlight much. This is probably a consequence of Nick Clegg\u2019s doomed referendum on the alternative vote in 2011, which effectively killed PR as an issue in mainstream politics for the rest of the decade. The second stop of the day for the PM was a brief visit to a catering firm called Red Olive, in the Derby North constituency, where former Labour MP Chris Williamson is standing as an independent after being suspended over antisemitism. Boris Johnson helped to put the lid on a pie and brush it with egg wash, before placing it in the oven (\u201coven ready\u201d: get it?). He then took another pie, which had already been cooked, out of the oven and displayed it for the cameras. Perhaps it represented Theresa May\u2019s deal. \u201cHow can we express this deal more succinctly or more clearly?\u201d he asked. Here is the story from my colleagues Heather Stewart and Aamna Modhin about Boris Johnson\u2019s unconventional approach to avoiding a TV interview this morning. I\u2019m standing in a sunny rugby club car park in Hersham, in the Surrey commuter belt, for the first stop of the Lib Dems\u2019 final election push. They have used both their bright orange battlebuses \u2013 one diesel, one electric \u2013 to bring along Jo Swinson as well as their deputy leader, Ed Davey. The buses will now head off on different routes, but both focusing on London and surrounding commuter towns \u2013 where the party hopes tactical voting could help them overturn big Conservative majorities from 2017. Hersham is in Dominic Raab\u2019s Esher and Walton constituency, where polling shows he is vulnerable to the Lib Dems if enough Labour voters switch sides. Swinson\u2019s brief speech to activists was a summary of the party\u2019s late-campaign message \u2013 rather than arguing she can become PM, the aim is to, as she put it, \u201cStop Brexit, stop Boris\u201d. She exported the activists to make a final push for voters. As with many election events, there were no actual members of the public here \u2013 it was staged in part to buoy local members, but also for the TV and photo optics. Next stop is Guildford, I\u2019m told. Farage says he expects turnout tomorrow to be lower than it was in 2017, when it was 69%. He says he thinks people are fed up of being asked to vote repeatedly. And he says he thinks Labour voters will stay at home because they dislike Jeremy Corbyn. After the election Farage intends to write a short book about the campaign. He says one of the points he will be making is that first-past-the-post needs to go. He says it may have worked in the past, but it does not work now. And he claims it encourages \u201cendless negativity\u201d, because it encourages parties to campaign negatively, instead of focusing on their positive message. He sums up: We are living in the 21st century with a 19th century set of institutions. And that\u2019s it. The Farage speech is over. Nigel Farage is speaking at the campaign event in Doncaster now. (See 10.18am.) He says he expects the Conservatives to win. But he says that he thinks Britain will face by another Brexit crisis in May, when the government comes under pressure to agree to an extension to the transition period. He is now complaining about there being too much nastiness in politics. Brexit party candidates have faced horrible abuse, he claims. Nicola Sturgeon has launched the final day of the Scottish National party\u2019s election campaign with an \u201copen letter\u201d to voters making a direct attack on Boris Johnson\u2019s character and conduct. Setting off at a greengrocers cooperative in Edinburgh South \u2013 a brave choice given the seat is held by Labour with a 15,000-vote majority, Scotland\u2019s largest - Sturgeon hopes to cement her line the SNP is the best choice for anti-Brexit voters in Scotland. The SNP has shifted Sturgeon\u2019s core campaign message away from the heavy focus it first had on promoting a second independence referendum next year. Recent opinion polls have shown the independence message has not been landing with voters; a YouGov poll for the Times last week found backing for independence had fallen five points to 44%, excluding don\u2019t knows. Arguing that SNP candidates are the closest challengers in all 13 seats being defended by the Scottish Conservatives, she put heavy emphasis on Johnson\u2019s personality, and the SNP\u2019s centre-left anti-austerity credentials. Her statement said: Boris Johnson, without question, represents the greatest danger to Scotland of any Tory prime minister in modern times. It is not just the appalling language he has used - about for example, children from single parent families, or working class men - or that he can\u2019t be trusted. Or the lack of compassion when faced with an image of a sick child being treated on the floor. It\u2019s what he wants to do in government for the next five years that confirms why he must be defeated. Tilting heavily at Labour voters, she added: He is a threat to the NHS. He will put many more children into poverty. He will rob young people in Scotland of rights they currently enjoy. He\u2019s a danger to workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. And he will trample all over the Scottish parliament if it gets in his way. YouGov\u2019s final MRP poll, which found the Tories could win 339 seats across the UK, forecast the SNP will win 41 seats, lower than the party\u2019s expectations. It said the Scottish Tories will hold nine, losing four it won in 2017, the Lib Dems hold its four wins in 2017, while Labour could hold five seats, despite repeated polls suggesting it could only retain Edinburgh South. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is due to speak at an event in Doncaster shortly. There is a live feed of the event here. Andy Stewart, the Brexit party candidate in Doncaster, is speaking at the moment, claiming that leave supports are the victims of a form of \u201cracism of opinion\u201d, because people are discriminating against them for what they think. UPDATE: I have posted more on this, with Stewart\u2019s quotes, at 1.51pm. As we reported earlier (see 8.39am), Boris Johnson was seen scurrying for cover earlier this morning when a reporter from ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain tried to get him live on air for an interview with Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. Johnson ended up heading off into what seemed to be a large, industrial fridge. Here is some Guardian video of the incident. Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has promised to swim naked in Loch Ness if the SNP win 50 seats at the election. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, she said conditions were markedly different from 2015, when the SNP won 56 seats, and that she did not expect them to reach 50. In 2017 the SNP won 35 seats. Davidson wrote: I will happily wager to strip naked on the banks of Loch Ness and subject myself to a Hogmanay wild swimming session should such a result occur, safe in the knowledge that my modesty (and others\u2019 eyeballs) will remain unmolested. The YouGov MRP poll released last night, which is thought to be one of the best guides to what might happen in the election, suggested the SNP would win 41 seats. Neale Hanvey, the candidate sacked by the Scottish National party over antisemitic social media posts, will still be announced as the SNP MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath if he wins on Thursday. Hanvey has continued campaigning to win, using the SNP\u2019s yellow colour and typefaces, despite being officially dropped by the party after he admitting two weeks ago to two antisemitic posts, one using material from the Kremlin-funded Sputnik website. Fife council has said because Hanvey was dropped after nominations closed, he will be described as the SNP\u2019s candidate when the results are declared. That raises the stakes for the SNP, since Nicola Sturgeon has been highly critical of Labour\u2019s failure to tackle its antisemitism crisis. Hanvey\u2019s party membership was suspended when he was dropped as its candidate; it still needs to put him through a full disciplinary hearing or allow him to rejoin the party. He wants to be readmitted. Fife council has also said the SNP has not officially told its returning officer Hanvey has been dropped. The council said on Tuesday morning it has only had an email from Hanvey\u2019s SNP election agent, David Barratt, simply saying he was no longer in that post. The SNP disputed that. \u201cFife council was informed on 29 November,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe would expect the returning officer to be fully aware that political parties have no ability under electoral law to withdraw a candidate after the close of nominations.\u201d Although Hanvey has been publicly disavowed by the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Labour officials still believe he could beat the Labour incumbent Lesley Laird, who regained the seat for Labour by a very narrow 259-vote margin in 2017. They say SNP activists have ignored an instruction from Sturgeon to stop campaigning for Hanvey. His Facebook page still carries SNP videos and his leaflets reproduce the ballot paper which shows his name beside the SNP logo. Labour officials believe the SNP has deliberately taken a soft-touch approach to avoid alienating activists. \u201cThey could be so much more robust than they have been,\u201d said one. After the Labour candidate in Falkirk was sacked for antisemitism, every Labour members was stood down. \u201cYou won\u2019t find anyone campaigning for that candidate,\u201d he said. In his speech in Govan Jeremy Corbyn also said that voting Labour was the only way to beat the politics of despair in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has responded on Twitter, arguing that Corbyn is wrong because the SNP are best placed to defeat the Tories in Scotland. Jeremy Corbyn told activists in Glasgow this morning that the country could defeat the politics of despair and division, in a rousing speech as he begins a final day tour of the UK. He said: Our party has suffered the most unbelievable levels of abuse from some of the media and the right in British politics. But our strength our idea our principles and our determination are stronger than ever. But I do think there\u2019s an issue of trust. I\u2019ve set up what the principles of our movement are: that we will never accept racism or discrimination in any form, that we want to create a society that works for everybody. We do not pass by on the other side. Activists were in buoyant mood following the release of YouGov\u2019s second constituency-by-constituency poll overnight, which suggests that \u2013 while the Tories remain the favourites \u2013 the possibility of a hung parliament can not be ruled out. Glasgow was the first stop in a tour that will take Corbyn to the north of England and the Midlands, before ending with a rally in Hoxton, east London tonight. The early campaign stop took place in the constituency of Glasgow South West, where Labour\u2019s Matt Kerr is hoping you overturn the SNP majority of just 60 votes in 2017. The Nationalists\u2019 Chris Stephens, a former trade union official, has held the seat in the SNP landslide of 2015. Activists held up signs reading \u2018scrap universal credit\u2019 as they gathered in front of the Govan Cross Christmas tree, and shouted \u201cThank you Jeremy\u201d. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Aamna Mohdin. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is being interviewed on Today. Q: Dave Merritt, whose son Jack was killed in the London Bridge terror attack, has accused Boris Johnson of exploiting this attack for political purposes. Gove pays tribute to Jack Merritt. And he stresses the importance of rehabilitation. But he says that, particularly in relation to Islamist terrorism, sentencing policy must keep people safe. Q: Dave Merritt says there should have been a dignified response from politicians. Gove says his heart goes out to Merritt. He cannot think what he must be going through. But politicians must answer questions about policy, he says. Q: Was it dignified for the PM, when he was asked to look at a picture of a sick child sleeping on a hospital floor, to ignore it and put the phone in his pocket? Gove says Johnson did look at the photograph. He sent Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to the hospital. Q: He put the phone in his pocket. That was \u201ca single moment of absent-mindedness\u201d, says Gove. Boris Johnson\u2019s first stop in West Yorkshire got off to a shaky start. Johnson was ambushed by Good Morning Britain reporter Jonathan Swain in Leeds before the aide mouthed \u201coh for f***\u2019s sake\u201d. The show\u2019s hosts, Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid, were both shocked by the aide\u2019s reaction. \u201cThe look on his face,\u201d Reid exclaims. During the exchange, reporter Swain asks if Johnson if he will come on the programme and \u201cdeliver on your promise to talk to Piers and Susanna\u201d. When Swain presses the prime minister, stating he is live on the show, Johnson replies to say \u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a second\u201d and walks off, before Piers exclaims \u201che\u2019s gone into the fridge\u201d. Johnson walks inside freezer with his aides. One person can be heard saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a bunker.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very frosty reception we\u2019ve had so far,\u201d Swain said after Johnson disappeared, to which Morgan responds: \u201cThat was heroic work.\u201d UPDATE: Here is some video of the incident. Boris Johnson began the final day of general election campaigning with a chilly pre-dawn visit to a business called Modern Milkman, in the Tory-held constituency of Pudsey, in Yorkshire. He donned an overall and helped load a minibus with crates of milk and orange juice. Journalists were then loaded back on the Get Brexit Done bus and driven to a pleasant residential street in nearby Guiseley, where Johnson made a delivery to one handpicked house, chatting to a delighted resident. Now we\u2019re back on the bus, with another four stops to go today, taking in Wales and Essex before ending the day with a rally in London. John McDonnell has accused the prime minister of using the London Bridge terrorist attack as \u201can opportunity\u201d. The shadow chancellor said: I just wish we have had the Conservatives being honest with us. I just wish we hadn\u2019t been having this gutter politics, fake websites, lies and smears. Speaking on BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme, McDonnell said he wished Boris Johnson had respected the wishes of Jack Merritt\u2019s parents. Meritt was one of two victims of the London Bridge attack, the other being Saskia Jones. Both were involved with the prisoner rehabilitation conference where Usman Khan launched his knife attack. McDonnell added: I wish Boris Johnson had not seen that as, to quote the father of Jack Merritt, as \u2018an opportunity\u2019. I just wish he\u2019d shown sympathy and respect and empathy. I just wish Boris Johnson had shown empathy about a child being treated, suffering from pneumonia lying on a hospital floor. That\u2019s the sort of politics the Conservatives now have under Johnson. When asked about Jonathan Ashworth leaked phone conversation criticising Jeremy Corbyn, McDonnell said Labour\u2019s health spokesman was \u201cjoshing\u201d and criticised the Tory activist friend for leaking the conversation. He was in a joshing mood, that is what he said and I believe him. It\u2019s interesting, it says more about this so-called Conservative friend than Jonathan Ashworth. What sort of friend records a telephone conversation like that and then gives it to a conservative disruptive website?\u201d But that\u2019s the nature of Conservative politics now. That\u2019s what Boris Johnson has dragged the Tory party into. I think it\u2019s dishonourable, I think it\u2019s gutter politics. But it says more about Conservative politics than it does about anything Jonathan Ashworth who has behaved completely properly. The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, has proposed a bill to make lying by politicians a criminal offence. Called the elected representatives (prohibition of deception) bill, under the legislation elected politicians in the European, Westminster and devolved parliaments would face criminal charges if they knowingly mislead the public. The party would seek to introduce a form of the law in the next parliament. Price said: People have lost faith in our politics, and we have a duty to restore it before it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s depressing that it has come to this, but if we need a law to stop politicians from lying then that is what should be in place. Price said he proposed a similar draft law more than 10 years ago, following the Iraq war. Our politics, once again, faces a crisis of confidence thanks to the fake news, fake views and fake figures that have been peddled, particularly by the main two Westminster parties. Over half a century ago we made it illegal for companies to lie to us with the Trade Descriptions Act. Sadly, it looks like now we need the same principle to apply to politicians. Honesty is the most important currency in politics. We have to protect it, before it reaches moral bankruptcy. Remember, the Guardian\u2019s factchecking team is here to help decipher what claims are true and what are false. Boris Johnson\u2019s first stop on the last day of the campaign Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin, taking over the blog from Kate Lyons on the last day of the campaign. Boris Johnson started his day helping load milk and orange juice bottles on to a delivery vehicle in West Yorkshire. He will be crisscrossing around the country, making stops in the Midlands, Wales and London, urging voters to give him the majority he needs to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Last night, YouGov\u2019s second much-hyped constituency-by-constituency poll suggests Labour is two points up, cutting the predicted Tory majority down from 68 seats to 28. YouGov said that while the Tories remain favourites, a hung parliament cannot be ruled out. When asked about the narrowing polls, the prime minister told broadcasters: This could not be more critical, it could not be tighter \u2013 I just say to everybody the risk is very real that we could tomorrow be going into another hung parliament. That\u2019s more drift, more dither, more delay, more paralysis for this country. Pressed on whether he was nervous, Johnson replied: \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for every vote.\u201d The papers today Boris Johnson is up and running, as is the Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart. Other election news at a glance: A woman has claimed her Facebook account was hacked after it was used to post false information claiming a photograph of an ill boy on the floor of a hospital was staged for political purposes. Jeremy Corbyn has dismissed as \u201cbanter\u201d a recording of Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, saying Labour would not win the election. Jo Swinson has accused Boris Johnson of showing \u201can empathy bypass\u201d in his attitude to other people. How was a PM on day release for nicking a phone allowed in a JCB, asks John Crace. Want to vote tactically? We have a region-by-region guide. Huw Edwards has said \u201cthe stakes are very high\u201d for the BBC\u2019s general coverage amid Conservative threats to examine the BBC licence fee and Channel 4\u2019s broadcasting remit after the election. Health secretary Matt Hancock won\u2019t talk to us, say \u201cbullied\u201d doctors at his local hospital in Suffolk. The Conservatives have opened a second investigation into Hastings candidate Sally-Ann Hart, this time for alleged Islamophobia. Here\u2019s Labour\u2019s campaign ad this morning, invoking the Blitz spirit. The day ahead A busy day all round. Johnson will be travelling from Yorkshire to the Midlands, Wales and London. Jo Swinson will be making appearances at a series of rallies. She is targeting Lib Dem seats around Surrey and the London area. Nigel Farage is back on the campaign trail and will be in Yorkshire backed by local prospective parliamentary candidates. Nicola Sturgeon will join SNP candidates on the final day of campaigning in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and Dunbartonshire. Hello and welcome to our politics liveblog, the last of the campaign. This is it, the end is in sight, but not before one final flurry of campaigning effort from all the parties. Labour and the Conservatives are in a frantic scramble for votes as the last day of campaigning begins. Both parties have labelled Thursday\u2019s vote the \u201cmost important in a generation\u201d . Neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn are wasting a moment of their last day. The prime minister will be crisscrossing the country from Yorkshire to the Midlands, Wales and London on Wednesday, delivering his message that the Conservatives need only another 12 seats to win a majority and that only his party can \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Meanwhile, Corbyn will start his day in Scotland before visiting at least five key seats in a whirlwind tour across England, calling for those who are undecided to \u201cvote for hope in this election\u201d. Both sides insist the election remains closely fought and that polls giving the Conservatives a lead could be wrong. The release of YouGov\u2019s second and much-hyped constituency-by-constituency poll suggests this is not just a line from the parties and we are in for a nerve-jangling finish. Compared with the first poll, Labour is two points up, meaning Boris Johnson\u2019s notional majority has been cut from 68 to 28 as his party\u2019s predicted seat count falls by 20 to 339 and Labour\u2019s improves by the same amount to 231. The SNP takes 41 and the Liberal Democrats 15, with some particularly surprising Lib Dem gains predicted. Thanks for travelling this campaign road with us. We\u2019ll bring you all the news today (and of course tomorrow when the vote actually happens).",
