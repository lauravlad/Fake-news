And the icy blast will not help.</p> <p>Newport West has long been a Labour stronghold and was held by the veteran MP, <strong>Paul Flynn,</strong> for 32 years until his death in February. At the 2017 election, Flynn\u2019s majority over the Tories was 5,658. In 1997, Flynn had a 14,357 majority.</p> <p>During the campaign, neither Labour nor the Tories focused on Brexit. The Labour candidate, <strong>Ruth Jones</strong>, was happier talking about how the introduction of universal credit was hitting citizens and about fear of crime in the city. Tory, <strong>Matthew Evans</strong>, was keen to make the election more about controversial plans to build a new motorway in Newport than the EU.<br></p> <p>The city as a whole voted to leave the EU, with 56% backing Brexit, and some have seen the by-election as a test of how both main political parties had been affected by the crisis in Westminster.<br></p> <p>Ukip will be hoping the impasse will lead to their candidate, Welsh assembly member and former Tory MP, <strong>Neil Hamilton</strong>, having a good night. Ukip has finished third in the last three general elections in Newport West.</p> <p>Polling stations close at 10pm and we\u2019re expecting the result some time around 2am on Friday. The venue for the count is the Geraint Thomas National Velodrome of Wales. Reporters have been told to watch out for cyclists if they turn up early and not to walk on the track in high heels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/31/newport-west-byelection-voters-look-away-from-main-parties-for-renewal\">Newport West byelection: voters look away from main parties for renewal</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca643ea8f085a877dffb826\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-04T18:06:30.515Z\">7.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is a minor victory for the Brexiter filibuster: The <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong> bill, which would require the PM to request an article 50 extension and avoid a no-deal Brexit, will remain with the Lords until Monday.</p> <p>Its supporters had wanted to see it fast-tracked through the upper chamber, so that it could become law by the end of today.</p> <p>As the Labour party notes, however, it will be sent back to the Commons in a \u201ctimely fashion\u201d, meaning the delay could yet turn out to have little material effect on the outcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LabourLordsUK/status/1113860670288801793\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Govt Chief Whip announces that following internal discussions, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CooperLetwinBill?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CooperLetwinBill</a> will have 2nd Reading later tonight, with remaining stages taking place on Monday (8th April) in &#39;timely fashion&#39; to allow Commons to consider any Lords amendts</p>&mdash; LabourLordsUK (@LabourLordsUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LabourLordsUK/status/1113860670288801793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-04T18:07:37.036Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ca641238f081da83cc0995b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-04T17:48:30.774Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This could be a major development: Downing Street appears ready to countenance a confirmatory referendum.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, there were conflicting messages on the issue coming from members of the cabinet (see: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/apr/04/brexit-latest-developments-live-hammond-opens-up-cabinet-split-by-saying-mps-should-get-vote-on-second-referendum-live-news?page=with:block-5ca5b2b18f08b611124af972#block-5ca5b2b18f08b611124af972\">9.08am</a>) \u2013 even among those known to privately favour remain.

By April 11, the European council will have concluded and the leaders will have returned to their member states.</p> <p>In the words of the secretary of state the bill could increase the risk of an accidental no-deal exit.

The main uncertainty is quite how long it might be, and quite how easy it would be for the UK to exit early. Last night, on ITV\u2019s Peston, <strong>Philip Hammond</strong>, the chancellor, said the government was \u201chopeful\u201d that any extension would be a maximum, and that if the UK were to pass the withdrawal agreement during the extension period, it would be able to leave immediately.</p> <p>But on the Today programme this morning<strong> Karin Kneissl, </strong>the Austrian foreign minister, gave an interview suggesting this might be wishful thinking. She said she found it hard to imagine the UK being offered an extension beyond 22 May (the day before the European elections), although she also said that she was making that assumption because she thought it unlikely that the UK would take part in those elections. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is very difficult to imagine how an extension going beyond the European elections is feasible. I\u2019m just wondering who is ready to campaign, which British politician is ready to campaign for the European parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>The government has not ruled out taking part in the European elections - Theresa May made that clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/apr/03/brexit-latest-news-live-may-corbyn-meeting-barclay-says-remorseless-logic-of-commons-numbers-is-pushing-uk-towards-softer-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5ca49df28f08b611124af019#block-5ca49df28f08b611124af019\">at PMQs yesterday</a>, and Stephen Barclay <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1113736151691603968\">did so again today </a>- but ministers have not exactly embraced this as a welcome development.</p> <p>In her interview Kneissl also suggested she was not convinced that the EU27 were as united in favour of a long extension as some people assume. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It remains to be seen what kind of cohesion is still available among the EU 27 - I\u2019m not in a position to tell whether there really will be this unanimous readiness to accept</p> </blockquote> <p>Kneissl said she sympathised with President Macron\u2019s view that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/02/no-guarantee-eu-would-grant-long-article-50-extension-says-macron\">the EU must not let itself be held hostage by Brexit. </a></p> <p>In London MPs believe that, if the UK were to take part in the European elections, any object to a long article 50 extension would disappear. But Kneissl said that, if the UK were to elect MEPs only for them to leave later in the year, there would still be a problem. She explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the British participate, but quit the European Union, sometime in [the] autumn, then the elections would have to be redone. So, the one or the other way, [this] could trigger a crisis of legitimacy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kneissl did not elaborate, but she may have referring to the appointment of the president of the European commission who, as a result of the Lisbon treaty, is now appointed by EU leaders taking into account the results of the European elections. It is conceivable that the mandate from the EU27 results could be different from the mandate produced by the EU28, including the UK. The parliament as a whole also has to vote to approve the new European commission, and so it would be arguable that a change in the composition of the parliament might undermine the legitimacy of the commission or its president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75f172dc535f86667d5c41bac865e3bfb49e07e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75f172dc535f86667d5c41bac865e3bfb49e07e0/967_133_3483_2090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karin Kneissl, the Austrian foreign minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karin Kneissl, the Austrian foreign minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Zak/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca5d6328f081da83cc093ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-04T10:02:42.220Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the business for next week announced by<strong> Andrea Leadsom</strong>, the leader of the Commons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsLeader/status/1113743400648552449\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The business for next week will be: <a href=\"https://t.co/Oe4WvmmuIe\">pic.twitter.com/Oe4WvmmuIe</a></p>&mdash; Leader&#39;s Office (@CommonsLeader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsLeader/status/1113743400648552449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca5d4e88f081da83cc09391\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-04T10:00:58.220Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Leadsom unable to tell MPs when next Brexit debate due to be held</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Andrea Leadsom,</strong> the leader of the Commons, has just announced the business for next week.

Now, as a result of Brexit, it has become commonplace - so routine one scarcely notices anymore - but it is worth flagging up anyway, particularly on the highly-charged issued of a second referendum.</p> <p>On ITV\u2019s Peston show last night <strong>Philip Hammond,</strong> the chancellor, did his best to slam the idea back on the table. Arguing that MPs should get a vote on the proposition, he told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve said it\u2019s a perfectly credible proposition. Some ideas have been put forward which are not deliverable, they are not negotiable but the confirmatory referendum idea, many people will disagree with it, I\u2019m not sure there is a majority in parliament for it but it\u2019s a perfectly credible proposition and it deserves to be tested in parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>But his morning, on the Today programme, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> the health secretary, did his best to sweep the proposal back into oblivion. Asked what he thought about a second referendum, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t see how that helps. That isn\u2019t about delivering Brexit ... I have argued many, many times that it would be divisive, it would not be decisive, it doesn\u2019t help us leave the European Union before the European elections, so I am very, very strongly against it ...</p> <p>The point here is to respect the result of the referendum, not to challenge the result of the referendum in another referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, when it was put to him that Hammond had described the idea as \u201ccredible\u201d, Hancock responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well that\u2019s certainly not how I would describe it. But all of use are having to find compromises, and that is hard.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is not even a split between the cabinet\u2019s leave faction and its remain faction. Hammond and Hancock are both remain-voting Brexit pragmatists, although Hammond is at the more militant end of that spectrum.</p> <p>Labour is just as divided on a second referendum, if not more so (Hammond is an outlier - most Tory MPs agree with Hancock on this), and that became clear when Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, was interviewed on the Today programme too.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. For a summary of the day\u2019s major events, click here. And, if you\u2019d like to read more on the Brexit negotiations between the government and the opposition, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart have the story: The elements have not been kind to candidates and party activists in south Wales as voting in the Newport West by-election nears its conclusion. These tweets from Labour supporters summed it up \u2013 monsoon rain, biblical hail. Union-branded raincoats and brollies. There has been concern among the two main parties here \u2013 Labour and the Tories \u2013 that turnout may be low, reflecting many people\u2019s frustration with politics. And the icy blast will not help. Newport West has long been a Labour stronghold and was held by the veteran MP, Paul Flynn, for 32 years until his death in February. At the 2017 election, Flynn\u2019s majority over the Tories was 5,658. In 1997, Flynn had a 14,357 majority. During the campaign, neither Labour nor the Tories focused on Brexit. The Labour candidate, Ruth Jones, was happier talking about how the introduction of universal credit was hitting citizens and about fear of crime in the city. Tory, Matthew Evans, was keen to make the election more about controversial plans to build a new motorway in Newport than the EU. The city as a whole voted to leave the EU, with 56% backing Brexit, and some have seen the by-election as a test of how both main political parties had been affected by the crisis in Westminster. Ukip will be hoping the impasse will lead to their candidate, Welsh assembly member and former Tory MP, Neil Hamilton, having a good night. Ukip has finished third in the last three general elections in Newport West. Polling stations close at 10pm and we\u2019re expecting the result some time around 2am on Friday. The venue for the count is the Geraint Thomas National Velodrome of Wales. Reporters have been told to watch out for cyclists if they turn up early and not to walk on the track in high heels. This is a minor victory for the Brexiter filibuster: The Yvette Cooper bill, which would require the PM to request an article 50 extension and avoid a no-deal Brexit, will remain with the Lords until Monday. Its supporters had wanted to see it fast-tracked through the upper chamber, so that it could become law by the end of today. As the Labour party notes, however, it will be sent back to the Commons in a \u201ctimely fashion\u201d, meaning the delay could yet turn out to have little material effect on the outcome. This could be a major development: Downing Street appears ready to countenance a confirmatory referendum. Earlier in the day, there were conflicting messages on the issue coming from members of the cabinet (see: 9.08am) \u2013 even among those known to privately favour remain. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, appeared to be open to the idea, while the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was unequivocally against it. Here\u2019s the snap verdict on the Varadkar-Merkel presser from the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent, Lisa O\u2019Carroll: The Tories\u2019 deputy chairman, James Cleverly, has been appointed a Brexit minister; one of a host of junior ministerial appointments just announced by Number 10. The Queen has been pleased to approve the following appointments: Justin Tomlinson MP to be a minister of state at the Department for Work and Pensions. James Cleverly MP to be a parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department for Exiting the European Union. Seema Kennedy MP to be a parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department of Health and Social Care. Andrew Stephenson MP to be a parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Will Quince MP to be a parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department for Work and Pensions. Kevin Foster MP to be a parliamentary under secretary of state (unpaid) at the Wales Office and an assistant government whip (paid). He will also be a parliamentary secretary (unpaid) at the Cabinet Office while Chloe Smith MP is on maternity leave. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, have both stressed that Theresa May will need to be able to explain to EU leaders next week why they should agree to extend article 50 again. At a joint press conference in Dublin Varadkar said: Matters continue to play out in London and I think we need to be patient and understanding of the predicament that they are in. But of course, any further extension must require and must have a credible and realistic way forward. And Merkel said: We do hope that the intensive discussions that are ongoing in London will lead to a situation by next Wednesday, when we have a special council meeting, where Prime Minister Theresa May will have something to table to us on the basis of which we can continue to talk. We want to stand together as 27. Until the very last hour - I can say this from the German side - we will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit; Britain crashing out of the European Union. But we have to do this together with Britain and with their position that they will present to us. They spoke after talks in London between Labour and the government on a possible Brexit compromise broke up, with both sides being relatively non-committal about progress, but a further meeting planned for tomorrow. (See 5.22pm and 5,28pm.) Pro-Brexit peers have been been accused of filibustering in the House of Lords where they have already dragged out for more than six hours a debate on a business motion to allow the fast-tracking of the Yvette Cooper bill requiring the PM to request an article 50 extension. Lord Forsyth, the Tory former cabinet minister, said that ignoring normal rules to expedite legislation in this way was the route to \u201ctyranny\u201d. (See 12.20pm) Peers who support the bill have had to use closure motions, which are normally only used in exceptional circumstances, to speed up proceedings. There have already been 12 votes, all of which supporters of the bill have won very comfortably. Originally it was hoped the bill would clear the Lords tonight, but now there is talk that it may be delayed until Monday. Labour peers are blaming the \u201cERG in ermine\u201d. Senior MPs who oppose Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal have met to discuss how to stop No 10 \u201cstitching up\u201d crucial votes that will decide how the UK leaves the European Union. A leaked EU document lays bare for the first time the differences in how British nationals will be treated by the bloc\u2019s member states after a no-deal Brexit, with two countries emphasising that requests to stay could be rejected on public order and security grounds. Cabinet ministers have been told they must set in motion new plans to keep planes flying to North America, as well as keeping British troops legally in Bosnia, in case the EU forces a no-deal exit. The House of Commons has been suspended for the day after water began pouring into the chamber from the ceiling, soaking a section of the press gallery. Concerns were raised about the \u201cinfiltration\u201d of Dominic Grieve\u2019s local Conservative association by 200 new members in the months leading up to his attempted ousting, leaked party emails reveal. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Ireland is stepping up its no deal planning with customs officers being station on ferries and at ports from tomorrow. \u201cCustoms Officers will be talking with truck drivers as they wait to embark the ferry, and will also be available on-board a number of sailings. Customs Officers are available to help drivers who may have concerns or questions about what they need to do post Brexit, and to help them understand what the changes will be for them as they move through Irish ports,\u201d officials said. Businesses, as in the UK, have been told that if the export or import to the UK they need to register for customs. Exporters to the EU, which route their freight through the \u201cUK landbridge\u201d have also been told they \u201cwill face new rules and processes under the customs transit procedure\u201d Q: What assurances can you give there will be no hard border in Ireland? Varadkar says, if there is a no-deal, whatever challenges Ireland face will be seen as shared challenges with the EU. And they are challenges we are up to, he says. Merkel says EU leaders know what is at stake, and what needs to be solved. She says she has every confidence in the taoiseach. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Merkel says she cannot answer speculative questions about what will happen next. But she knows there is a vast majority of MPs in the Commons opposed to no-deal. Q: Do you think the Commons vote last night will increase the hopes of a deal? Merkel says she is following developments in the UK with great interest. Last night\u2019s vote was very interesting, she says. She says she is waiting to see what May offers next week. She hopes that there can be an orderly Brexit. Varadkar says he thinks the vote was significant. Parliament is sovereign, and if MPs want to rule out no-deal, that is significant. But he says MPs have looked at 12 options, and rejected them all. (Actually, the eight indicative votes last week, and the four this week, included duplicate votes, so the total number of options rejected was not quite 12.) Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is speaking now. She says Ireland will be particularly affected by Brexit. She says Germany will stand with Ireland. It was very moving meeting people who will be affected by changes to the border, she says. She says she understands from her own experience in east Germany the importance of borders. She says she wants good relations with the UK after Brexit. The EU will have a lot of common ground with the UK, she says. She says she hopes that the intensive discussions in London will led to a situation by Wednesday next week where Theresa May will have something to table. She says she will work to the very last hour to try to stop the UK crashing out. She says the European elections have complicated this. Leo Varakdar and Angela Merkel are holding their press conference in Dublin now. Varadkar, the Irish PM, says as German chancellor Merkel must be seven times as busy as he is. He says he is very grateful to her for coming to Dublin. He says their talks have focused on Brexit. He thanks Merkel for Germany\u2019s support. He says at the last EU summit EU leaders agreed to give the UK extra time. Matters are still playing out in London, he says. He says the EU must be patient. But any proposal from the UK for another extension must involve \u201ca credible and realistic way forward\u201d. Varadkar says UK must offer \u2018credible and realistic way forward\u2019 to justify further article 50 extension. And Downing Street has issued its own statement about the talks with Labour. A spokesperson said: Today both sets of negotiating teams met for four and a half hours of detailed and productive technical talks in the Cabinet Office, supported by the civil service. The government and the opposition hope to meet again tomorrow for further work to find a way forward to deliver on the referendum, mindful of the need to make progress ahead of the forthcoming European council. A sandwich lunch, with fruit, was served, we have also been told. The Labour party has issued a short statement about today\u2019s talks with the government on a possible Brexit compromise. A spokesperson said; Today both sets of negotiating teams met for four and a half hours in the Cabinet Office for detailed technical discussions. These talks are continuing and the teams are planning to meet again. The Labour team was led by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and the government team by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister. This is from Leo Varakdar, the Irish prime minister, on Angela Merkel\u2019s visit. Varadkar and the German chancellor are due to make a press statement at around 5.30pm. Sir Oliver Letwin, who passed the original Commons amendment that created time for the Yvette Cooper bill to be passed, is in the House of Lords watching the debate, the BBC\u2019s Alex Partridge reports. As part of her effort to consult with MPs over Brexit, Theresa May agreed to see the Labour MP Rupa Huq, who went to Number 10 to lobby for a second referendum. Huq told May that she would vote for her deal if it were tied to a referendum. She said: I said that it would be a huge climbdown for me, but I would let her deal go through - and there\u2019s at least 100 like me - if it was subject to a confirmatory referendum. May told Huq was opposed to the idea, saying the result of the referendum had to be honoured. \u201cI was saying \u2018that was three years ago, you need to check\u2019,\u201d Huq said. Huq said she left the meeting \u201cstill not much the wiser\u201d about which of May\u2019s red lines would change in an effort to get a deal through. The Brexiter filibustering operation in the House of Lords may be partially succeeding, Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam reports. Back in the Lords the Ridley closure motion was passed by 224 votes to 80 - a majority of 144. Peers are now voting on the Ridley amendment itself. This is the 10th vote of the day. At the weekend Michael Roth, the German deputy foreign minister, described Brexit as a \u201cshitshow\u201d. He may be right metaphorically but thankfully, and despite rumours earlier, this is not quite true yet as a factual description of the predicament at Westminster. Peers are now voting on a closure motion to end the debate on the Ridley amendment. Peers have now defeated the Noakes amendment by 234 votes to 106 - a majority of 128. They are now debating an amendment from Viscount Ridley, a Conservative, again objecting to the fast-track procedure being used for the Cooper bill. The government/Labour talks aimed at arriving at a Brexit compromise have wrapped up for the day, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports. In her statement after cabinet on Wednesday Theresa May said, if she could not strike a deal with Labour, she would hold another series of indicative votes in the Commons. She implied she wanted this wrapped up before the EU summit next Wednesday. But now, according to Kuenssberg it looks as though this might be another Brexit deadline that gets mixed. Back in the Lords the closure motion has been passed by 229 votes to 77 - a majority of 152. That is the seventh victory in a row for peers backing the Cooper bill. It is the lowest vote today on the anti-Cooper side - perhaps suggesting a few of the opponents of the bill have had enough for the day. At a briefing in Brussels earlier Jyrki Katainen, a European commision vice president, said a no-deal Brexit was now highly likely. He declared: Following the latest developments, a no-deal scenario is highly likely. Let there be no doubt whatsoever a no-deal scenario would be extremely costly and disruptive. The economic consequences would have a significant impact on the UK and to a lesser extent to the EU. Violeta Bulc, the transport commissioner, said that the EU had carried out extensive preparations for no-deal and that \u201cthese are now all completed for the area of transport.\u201d But she said the measures could not \u201cmitigate the overall impact\u201d of a no-deal scenario, nor would they compensate for a lack of stakeholder preparedness. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Back in the Lords, peers are voting again - for the seventh time. It is on a closure motion on the Noakes amendment. (See 3.13pm.) But on the World at One the shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, said he thought the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the parliamentary Labour party favoured a second referendum. There was probably a majority in favour in the shadow cabinet too, he claimed. Labour said that, even if Theresa May agreed to back Labour\u2019s Brexit plan, it should still be put to the public. He said Labour would not be talking to the government \u201cif there wasn\u2019t the possibility that Labour party policy - which is to take this back to the public on any deal that is agreed by parliament - couldn\u2019t be pursued and enacted.\u201d In 2017 Lewis resigned from the shadow cabinet so that he could vote against the legislation allowing the government to trigger article 50. Twenty five Labour MPs have written a letter to Jeremy Corbyn urging him not to back a second referendum on Brexit. \u201cIf the option of a customs union arrangement could be put before parliament, we see a Labour Brexit deal within reach,\u201d they say. Signatories included veteran backbenchers Sir Kevin Barron, Dennis Skinner and Ronnie Campbell, former minister Caroline Flint and MPs for Leave-voting areas of the North and Midlands including Gloria De Piero, Sarah Champion and Gareth Snell. The Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan has the text. The letter includes the claim that, in every English region outside London, leaving the EU without a deal is more popular than staying in. But Channel 4 News\u2019 Krishnan Guru-Murthy says this poll has been misrepresented, because it was based on a question that did not include leaving with a deal as an option. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has arrived in Dublin for Brexit talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar. As the Press Association reports, Merkel was greeted by Mr Varadkar at Farmleigh House. Her visit is viewed as a sign of her solidarity with Ireland as the Brexit saga rumbles on. Their discussions are set to focus on the latest developments from the UK, ahead of the special European Council meeting next week. ]Prior to their sit-down, Merkel will take part in a round-table discussion with 15 people from Northern Ireland and the border area about the impact a no-deal scenario could have on their lives. It will include some victims of violence, as well as farmers and business people. The Commons has now adjourned for the rest of the day because the leak of water into the chamber. Peers voted down the True amendment by 248 votes to 122 - a majority of 126. They are now debating another amendment to the business motion, from the Conservative peer Lady Noakes, saying fast-tracking the Cooper bill is unnecessary because \u201cthe prime minister has already indicated her intention to ask for a delay in the date for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union\u201d. Here\u2019s a question from BTL. What happens if the EU says no to a further article 50 extension? The Cooper bill does not say the UK must have an article 50 extension. It just says the prime minister must give MPs the chance to vote for one, and that if they do, the PM must request one. The EU can always say no. Within government there is a widespread assumption that the EU will grant an extension of some sort (although, if the Austrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl\u2019s comments are anything to go by - see 12.01pm - it could end up being considerably shorter than people expect.) But if the EU were to refuse an extension on Wednesday evening, the UK would be heading for a no-deal Brexit on Friday 12 April. Theresa May would still be able to avert that revoking article 50 before the deadline. Alternatively, she could try to get the deal through parliament on the Thursday and hope for a last-minute rethink from the EU. The Cooper bill would not make a no-deal Brexit illegal. Back in the House of Lords, where at least the plumbing is still functional and the ceiling is still holding up (see 2.51pm), the closure motion has been passed by 249 votes to 97 - a majority of 152. Peers are now voting on the True amendment. (See 1.57pm.) The Brexit plotlines are getting ever more preposterous. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. Lord Foulkes, the Labour peer and former minister, has just moved a closure motion (a motion that \u201cthe question be now put\u201d) to wrap up the debate on the True amendment. Under House of Lords rules Lord Fowler, the Lord Speaker, has to read out a spiel saying that a closure motion is a \u201cmost exceptional procedure\u201d before allowing the vote. It is effectively a polite reminder to peers, saying that moving closure motions without good reason is an abuse. But it does not work with Foulkes, and he insists on pressing the motion to a vote. That means this \u201cmost exceptional procedure\u201d has now been used three times today already to break the Brexiter filibuster. Northern Ireland could be left with a milk lake if the EU enforces its regulations about the origin of ingredients in butter and cheese in a no-deal Brexit, it has emerged. A senior EU official has confirmed that if the UK crashes out of the bloc in nine days time controls will have to be in place on \u201cday one\u201d on milk and other animal products coming from Northern Ireland. They say it will \u201cbe difficult\u201d to say how the giant co-operatives that currently exist on the south of the border could continue to do daily milk collections picking up both milk from farms on both sides of the frontier. They will also see a 19p EU tariff slapped on the payment they get per litre of milk almost doubling the current 26p per litre cost, warned bosses at Dairy UK. \u201cIf there is no deal next week, it won\u2019t be good whichever way you look at it,\u201d said Mike Johnston, Northern Ireland director of Dairy UK. It\u2019s a bit like a Thatcher cabinet reunion in the House of Lords this afternoon. As well as Ken Baker (see 2.20pm), Nigel Lawson and Michael Howard have both now spoken in the debate against the moves to fast-track the Yvette Cooper bill. Lawson did not hold back. He said: I have served in parliament for 45 years and there has never been an instance of constitutional vandalism on the scale that we are witnessing today, and at the present time more generally. Lord Baker, the Conservative former cabinet minister, intervened in the Lords debate a few minutes ago to say that closure motions in the Lords were an abuse of procedure. He said: Curtailment of debate in this House is a very serious matter ... I would just remind [peers[ what JS Mill wrote in On Liberty. He was the one who warned democracy against the tyranny of the majority. He thought that that was the greatest threat to democracy. There is a clear majority on the benches opposite that this bill should pass. This is a minority on this side of the house. And to silence the minority is against very much the principles of ... JS Mill. He would not have approved that at all ... This is an abuse of majority power power and really this house should not be sanctioning this. Lord True ended up speaking for about half an hour as he moved his amendment criticising the plan to fast-track the Cooper bill through the upper house. (See 1.57pm.) He argued that freedom was at risk if peers like himself were not allowed to use the full range of procedural options to hold up scrutiny of a bill. He said: The privilege I have in being [a member of the Lords] is to speak for freedom. And one of the things that defines the freedom of this house are its free procedures, the right of us all to put down an amendment and have it heard, not closed; the right of us all to put down a motion, and have it closed, not waived away. These things may seem small, they may seem arcane to those on the outside, but for me they are a small part of freedom, and I have always wished to live and concluded my life in that. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has told the Holyrood parliament that she conducted talks with Theresa May yesterday in the spirit of compromise but that \u201call I really got in return was why she disagreed with me\u201d. Referring to Wednesday\u2019s emergency meeting, she said that she had had \u201cvery constructive talks\u2019 with Jeremy Corbyn but that she had found the prime minister unable to set out where she was willing to compromise. Quizzed by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard about Scotland\u2019s readiness for a no-deal, she said that the Scottish government resilience committee would be meeting this afternoon but warned: No matter how much planning it will not be possible to mitigate every impact of a no deal Brexit. She added that she had \u201cbroad assurances\u201d from pharmaceutical companies that Scotland does have six weeks\u2019 worth of medicines in storage but that such plans needed to be kept under constant review giving the changing dates of potential exit. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie set out his anxiety that a hasty Brexit agreement between Corbyn and May could then be unpicked by a future Brexiteer prime minister: Sturgeon said that this was a concern that she had \u201cexpressed strongly\u201d to Corbyn. She added that, while it wasn\u2019t clear to her which way the Labour party would go on a second referendum, it was \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d not to end up with \u201ca cobbled together least worst option\u201d and that whatever compromise was reached must be put back to the people: \u201cI want to see a people\u2019s vote in all circumstances.\u201d The Lord Forsyth amendment was rejected by 251 votes to 123 - a majority of 128. Peers are now debating the next amendment to the Hayter business motion, from the Conservative peer Lord True. It says that using a fast-track process to approve the Cooper bill is not \u201cin keeping with the traditions and procedures of the House of Lords, its proper scrutinising role or its function as a safeguard of the constitution\u201d. True says that the Lords is not fulfilling its proper function if it is just there to say \u201cYes, sir\u201d to the House of Commons. He says he is not a great tweeter, but he has been looking at the tweets from Lady Hayter, the Labour deputy leader in the Lords who has proposed the motion to allow the Cooper bill to be fast-tracked. He says that in February she posted a tweet complaining about a suggestion the the Lords should have just 10 days to consider the EU withdrawal agreement bill. From the Labour peer and fierce anti-Brexiter Lord Adonis The closure motion has been approved, by 227 votes to 111 - a majority of 116. Peers are now voting on Lord Forsyth\u2019s main amendment to the Hayter business motion. It says the normal Lords procedures should apply to the Cooper bill, instead of the fast-track ones proposed by Hayter. You can read the Hayter motion and the amendments to it here. After the Forsyth amendment, there are six more from Brexiters. At this rate, if peers try to debate all of them, and they are all subject to a closure motion vote and then a vote on the motion, this process could drag on half the afternoon. This is from Nikki da Costa, the former director of legislative affairs at Downing Street, on the first Cooper-related vote in the Lords. (See 12.45pm.) In the House of Lords peers are now on their third Cooper-related procedural vote. This time they are voting on a second closure motion, moved by the crossbencher Lord Warner. He is moving the closure motion (which curtails this stage of the debate) because he believes the Tory Brexiters are filibustering. Downing Street still will not say whether Theresa May is relaxing her red line of being against a customs union in talks with Jeremy Corbyn. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general and a Brexiter, has signalled he could live with one. In response, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said: I think [Cox] was setting out his view. The PM\u2019s view in relation to these issues is that we approach these discussions constructively. Asked whether No 10 agreed with Cox that the UK could enter a customs union with a view to getting out of it later, he said: I think his comments were reflecting the fact that there will be different parliaments to this one in generations to come. No 10 also suggested peers should think carefully before passing the Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin\u2019s bill to protect against a no-deal Brexit, arguing that asking parliament to approve any extension to article 50 could actually increase the risk of no-deal by accident. Downing Street did not exactly endorse the filibuster in the Lords by Conservative peers but said it still strongly opposes the bill. The complicated argument is that previously Theresa May would have been able to simply negotiate an extension with the EU and accept it with royal prerogative powers, but now she has to get parliament to agree with the length of the extension. (See 12.38pm.) It is a slightly false argument as parliament is pretty certain to accept any extension that means there will not be a no-deal Brexit. In the Lords the supporters of the Cooper bill have won a second vote. A move to hold up the bill proposed by the Tory Lord Forsyth has been defeated by 254 votes to 94 - a majority of 160. In the Lords the closure motion has passed by 239 votes to 118 - a majority of 121. That means peers are now winding up this part of the debate - a procedural one relating to the fast-tracked timetable for the Cooper bill. Although this was not technically a vote on the bill, the numbers probably roughly reflect the number of peers in favour and against the bill. In other words, the opponents of the bill are outnumbered two to one. Peers are now voting on a motion from Lord Forsyth saying that the whole house should go into committee. This is a move to hold up proceedings. Downing Street claims the Cooper bill could increase the chances of a no-deal Brexit. This is what the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the lobby briefing, repeating an argument made by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, in the Commons debate yesterday. The spokesman said: If passed, this bill would place a severe constraint on the government\u2019s ability to negotiate an extension and reflect this new date in UK statute books by April 12. On Wednesday next week, the European council could propose an extension of an alternative length to that put forward by parliament, and under the bill the prime minister would have to return on Thursday April 11 to put that proposal to the house. By April 11, the European council will have concluded and the leaders will have returned to their member states. In the words of the secretary of state the bill could increase the risk of an accidental no-deal exit. The bill is going to go through the House of Lords today. I\u2019m sure the House of Lords will want to look at the issues that the secretary of state [Barclay] has raised. It is all kicking off in the Lords now. Unlike in the House of Commons, debates in the House of Lords do not get subject to a formal timetable, saying that they must wind up within a certain amount of time. In theory they can go on forever, although in practice there is normally an informal agreement about when a debate will end. But there is a process in the Lords which allows a peer to move a closure motion, to halt a debate and move to a vote. It does not get used very often, and it is only supposed to be applied in extremis, to prevent time-wasting. But we\u2019ve just had one, and peers are voting on it now. With Brexiter peers expected to launch a filibuster on the Cooper bill, there could be several more today. In the House of Lords peers have just started debating Lady Hayter\u2019s business motion (see 10.06am), changing the schedule in the upper house so that the Yvette Cooper bill, requiring the PM to demand an article 50 extension, can go through all its Lords stages by the end of today. But some Brexiter peers are determined to resist the attempts to railroad the bill through the Lords. Lord Forsyth, the Conservative former cabinet minister, is one of the peers leading the opposition, and he has just told the house that suspending standing orders to fast-track a bill in this way could lead to \u201ctyranny\u201d. He explained: [The bill] was actually passed [in the Commons] by one vote. And that one vote came from someone wearing a tag because they were released from prison. The noble lord says \u201cFor goodness sake\u201d. But this is a major constitutional matter. It was passed by one vote. The speeches were limited to two minutes in the other place because of the guillotine. He had a go at me the other day because I said this practice of suspending our standing orders will lead to tyranny. He mocks me. He said, \u201cTyranny, how ridiculous.\u201d All that lies between us and tyranny is that we respect the conventions of both houses. Why do we do that? Because it is our constitution. At Westminster it is generally assumed that EU leaders at their summit on Wednesday next week will offer the UK a long article 50 extension. The main uncertainty is quite how long it might be, and quite how easy it would be for the UK to exit early. Last night, on ITV\u2019s Peston, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said the government was \u201chopeful\u201d that any extension would be a maximum, and that if the UK were to pass the withdrawal agreement during the extension period, it would be able to leave immediately. But on the Today programme this morning Karin Kneissl, the Austrian foreign minister, gave an interview suggesting this might be wishful thinking. She said she found it hard to imagine the UK being offered an extension beyond 22 May (the day before the European elections), although she also said that she was making that assumption because she thought it unlikely that the UK would take part in those elections. She said: It is very difficult to imagine how an extension going beyond the European elections is feasible. I\u2019m just wondering who is ready to campaign, which British politician is ready to campaign for the European parliament. The government has not ruled out taking part in the European elections - Theresa May made that clear at PMQs yesterday, and Stephen Barclay did so again today - but ministers have not exactly embraced this as a welcome development. In her interview Kneissl also suggested she was not convinced that the EU27 were as united in favour of a long extension as some people assume. She said: It remains to be seen what kind of cohesion is still available among the EU 27 - I\u2019m not in a position to tell whether there really will be this unanimous readiness to accept Kneissl said she sympathised with President Macron\u2019s view that the EU must not let itself be held hostage by Brexit. In London MPs believe that, if the UK were to take part in the European elections, any object to a long article 50 extension would disappear. But Kneissl said that, if the UK were to elect MEPs only for them to leave later in the year, there would still be a problem. She explained: If the British participate, but quit the European Union, sometime in [the] autumn, then the elections would have to be redone. So, the one or the other way, [this] could trigger a crisis of legitimacy. Kneissl did not elaborate, but she may have referring to the appointment of the president of the European commission who, as a result of the Lisbon treaty, is now appointed by EU leaders taking into account the results of the European elections. It is conceivable that the mandate from the EU27 results could be different from the mandate produced by the EU28, including the UK. The parliament as a whole also has to vote to approve the new European commission, and so it would be arguable that a change in the composition of the parliament might undermine the legitimacy of the commission or its president. Here is the business for next week announced by Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced the business for next week. It is all routine, and mostly Brexit-related secondary legislation. She has not announced any Brexit indicative votes, or another vote on the withdrawal agreement. But Leadsom says that the government\u2019s talks with Labour on Brexit are underway, and she says the business may have to change. She also tells MPs that the Commons might have to sit next Friday. And it may have to sit on the Monday and Tuesday of the following week, she says. According to an interesting article by Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen, what finally turned Theresa May against a no-deal Brexit was fear of what this might mean for the union. In Brexit questions Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, asks if Stephen Barclay agrees that, unless MPs vote for it, a no-deal Brexit will not happen. Barclay says the fact that MPs voted down the PM\u2019s deal last week means that any article 50 extension now is at the discretion of the EU. Back in Brexit questions the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson asks about Philip Hammond\u2019s comments about a second referendum. Are we about to see another U-turn? Kwasi Kwarteng, the Brexit minister, says it is government policy to honour the result of the first referendum. This issue of a second one is a \u201cred herring\u201d, he says. A motion has been tabled in the House of Lords for Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill to be rushed through the second chamber in a single day, allowing it to become law by the end of today, the Press Association reports. The move was put forward by Labour\u2019s deputy leader in the Lords, Lady Hayter of Kentish Town. But it was countered by several amendments from Conservative peers demanding the bill should be dealt with in the normal way, which would effectively delay its passage beyond next week\u2019s EU summit. UPDATE: Here is the Hayter motion. In the Commons Labour\u2019s Stephen Timms says it is now \u201cinconceivable\u201d that the UK could pass a Brexit deal before the EU summit next Wednesday, meaning a long article 50 extension will be inevitable. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Brexit minister who is replying, says given what we have seen in the last few weeks, he would not describe anything as inconceivable. Back in the Commons Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, asks if ministers will comply with the Yvette Cooper bill, which would require the PM to ask for an article 50 extension. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, says ministers comply with the law. That is in the ministerial code, he says. But he says Pennycook is getting ahead of himself. He says the bill has not passed the Lords, and it contains flaws. Pennycook then asks what would happen if the EU were to offer a different article 50 extension from the one proposed by the government. Barclay says Pennycook should not assume the Lords will pass the bill. It only passed the Commons by one vote, he says, and he says the main constitutional experts in the Lords will want to look at it closely. As mentioned earlier (see 9.08am), Labour\u2019s Brexit divisions were also on display on the Today programme this morning. Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, was on representing Labour and she was asked if she agreed with Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, that any Brexit deal that Jeremy Corbyn agreed with Theresa May should be put to a public vote. Chakrabarti replied: As you know, the public vote became part of our policy at our party conference last autumn. It became part of our policy for the purposes of breaking deadlock. That\u2019s the purpose of it. It is not an end in itself. It\u2019s a process thing, not a substance thing. The presenter, Mishal Husain, responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean. It was a simple question, whether you agree with Emily Thornberry or not. Should any deal agreed by parliament be subject to a public vote? Chakrabarti tried again. Her second reply was more positive about the prospect of a second referendum, but still quite a long way from a firm endorsement of the Thornberry position. Chakrabarti said: I think it will depend on the level of support. It really depends on whether it is required to break a deadlock ... I think Emily has got a point in that, because it\u2019s five to midnight and because we haven\u2019t broken a deadlock, a public vote - or, my preference by the way, which is a general election, which is another form of public vote - these options become much more significant, and possibly even necessary. In Brexit questions Robin Walker, the Brexit minister, has just confirmed that a second referendum is not government policy. In the Commons Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is taking questions. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asks Barclay about the government\u2019s plans for indicative votes. Will the government choose the options? Or will MPs get the chance to suggest ideas too? Barclay says this is no longer simply a matter for parliament. Because of the vote on Friday, which the government lost, the EU gets to decide if there will be an extension. It used to be unusual to hear members of the cabinet disagree with each other in public. Now, as a result of Brexit, it has become commonplace - so routine one scarcely notices anymore - but it is worth flagging up anyway, particularly on the highly-charged issued of a second referendum. On ITV\u2019s Peston show last night Philip Hammond, the chancellor, did his best to slam the idea back on the table. Arguing that MPs should get a vote on the proposition, he told the programme: I\u2019ve said it\u2019s a perfectly credible proposition. Some ideas have been put forward which are not deliverable, they are not negotiable but the confirmatory referendum idea, many people will disagree with it, I\u2019m not sure there is a majority in parliament for it but it\u2019s a perfectly credible proposition and it deserves to be tested in parliament. But his morning, on the Today programme, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, did his best to sweep the proposal back into oblivion. Asked what he thought about a second referendum, he said: I don\u2019t see how that helps. That isn\u2019t about delivering Brexit ... I have argued many, many times that it would be divisive, it would not be decisive, it doesn\u2019t help us leave the European Union before the European elections, so I am very, very strongly against it ... The point here is to respect the result of the referendum, not to challenge the result of the referendum in another referendum. Then, when it was put to him that Hammond had described the idea as \u201ccredible\u201d, Hancock responded: Well that\u2019s certainly not how I would describe it. But all of use are having to find compromises, and that is hard. This is not even a split between the cabinet\u2019s leave faction and its remain faction. Hammond and Hancock are both remain-voting Brexit pragmatists, although Hammond is at the more militant end of that spectrum. Labour is just as divided on a second referendum, if not more so (Hammond is an outlier - most Tory MPs agree with Hancock on this), and that became clear when Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, was interviewed on the Today programme too. I will post some extracts from her interview soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Stephen Barclary, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 10.00am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement on next week\u2019s Commons business. 10.45am: Violeta Bulc, the European transport commissioner, holds a press conference on Brexit preparedness. Afternoon: Peers are expected to debate the Yvette Cooper bill requiring the PM to seek an article 50 extension. The proceedings could run late into the evening. 3pm: Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, meets Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, in Dublin. They are due to make a press statement at 5.30pm. Also a government team headed by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, will spend the day in talks with a Labour team headed by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Until the very last hour \u2013 I can say this from the German side \u2013 we will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Asked what will happen next week if the UK does not ratify May\u2019s Brexit deal, the chancellor said she could not answer speculative questions and that the EU must respect the debate in Westminster. Her visit came amid continued flux in Westminster where the House of Lords debated a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit. It will remain with the Lords until Monday after squeaking through the House of Commons by one vote on Wednesday night. Despite the public expression of solidarity from the EU\u2019s powerhouse, Ireland is coming under mounting pressure from EU members to show how it will avoid a hard border while protecting the integrity of the single market. With Merkel looking on, Varadkar vowed that Ireland would not become a \u201cback door\u201d for third-country goods into the EU but ducked a question about where Ireland would impose checks if not on the border. \u201cIn event of a no-deal, it\u2019s not possible quite frankly to have a clear plan because there are so many different possibilities and hypotheticals,\u201d he said. That left open the prospect of checks in the Irish Sea. Merkel\u2019s visit \u2013 her first to Ireland since 2014 \u2013 came amid increasingly dire warnings of the consequences of a no-deal departure, with EU officials saying controls will have to be in place on day one for milk and other animal products coming from Northern Ireland, raising the spectre of a \u201cmilk lake\u201d. Irish authorities are becoming increasingly alarmed that tens of thousands of businesses that trade with the UK via ports in Dublin and Rosslare are not ready for a no-deal departure. \u201cIf these are perishable goods they run the risk of losing that load because they will be turned away,\u201d Lynda Slattery, the head of the revenue service\u2019s Brexit unit, told RTE.",

      "bodyText": "Social media executives could be held personally liable for harmful content distributed on their platforms, leaked plans for a long-awaited government crackdown obtained by the Guardian reveal. There has been growing concern about the role of the internet in the distribution of material relating to terrorism, child abuse, self-harm and suicide, and ministers have been under pressure to act. Under plans expected to be published on Monday, the government will legislate for a new statutory duty of care, to be policed by an independent regulator and likely to be funded through a levy on media companies. The regulator \u2013 likely initially to be Ofcom, but in the longer term a new body \u2013 will have the power to impose substantial fines against companies that breach their duty of care and to hold individual executives personally liable. The debate has been sharpened in recent months by the case of the British teenager Molly Russell and issues raised by the Christchurch shootings. Molly\u2019s parents said she killed herself partly because of self-harm images viewed on social media. The scope of the recommendations is broad. As well as social media platforms such as Facebook and search engines such as Google they take in online messaging services and file hosting sites. Other proposals in the online harm white paper include: \u2022 Government powers to direct the regulator on specific issues such as terrorist activity or child sexual exploitation. \u2022 Annual \u201ctransparency reports\u201d from social media companies, disclosing the prevalence of harmful content on their platforms and what they are doing to combat it. \u2022 Co-operation with police and other enforcement agencies on illegal harms, such as incitement of violence and the sale of illegal weapons. An Ofcom survey last year found that 45% of adult internet users had experienced some form of online harm and 21% had taken action to report harmful content. In a joint foreword, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Jeremy Wright, say it is time to move beyond self-regulation and set clear standards, backed up by enforcement powers. Companies will be asked to comply with a code of practice, setting out what steps they are taking to ensure that they meet the duty of care \u2013 including by designing products and platforms to make them safer, and pointing users who have suffered harm towards support. The code of practice is also likely to include the steps companies will be expected to take to combat disinformation, including by using fact-checking services, particularly during election periods, and improving the transparency of political advertising. Regulated firms will be expected to comply with the code of practice \u2013 or explain what other steps they are taking to meet the duty of care. However, many questions are left to the regulator to determine. Theresa May has repeatedly raised the issue of online harm, and the government has gradually shifted its position, from favouring voluntary self-regulation to backing tougher enforcement. The white paper has repeatedly been delayed. Whitehall sources said the government had been holding it back for several reasons including difficulties finding \u201cappropriate legal advice\u201d due to Brexit. Labour\u2019s Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said: \u201cLabour have been calling for a new regulator with tough powers to bring social media companies into line for the last year. The public and politicians of all parties agree something must be done to force them to take responsibility for the harms, hate speech and fake news hosted on their platforms, and the plans for personal liability are promising.\u201d But he said \u201csome major concerns remained\u201d, including the fact it could take years to implement. \u201cThey also do nothing to tackle the overriding data monopolies causing this market failure and nothing to protect our democracy from dark digital advertising campaigners and fake news.\u201d Wright\u2019s predecessor, Matt Hancock, took an increasingly robust approach to the issue of regulating the internet, which for some years after its creation was regarded as effectively beyond the writ of governments. With just months or even weeks left of her premiership, May is keen to show that she has made progress in a series of domestic policy areas. The death of 14-year-old Russell in 2017 has had a strong impact on the white paper. Her father launched a passionate campaign earlier this year to highlight the fact that self-harm and suicide were widely promoted on Instagram, a fact that he felt contributed to her death. In January, Hancock, now the health secretary, called on social media firms to remove such content, saying he was specifically moved to issue the demand by Russell\u2019s case. The Christchurch shootings in March also left their mark on the debate. The attacker used Facebook Live to stream the killings in progress, with thousands watching the attack as it occurred and millions more seeing the video as it was uploaded across the internet over the following day. That highlighted the specific difficulties in regulating live content on the internet, where the standard \u201cnotice and takedown\u201d practice enshrined in EU law is tricky to apply. By the time Facebook was officially notified about the live stream, a suspect had already been arrested, and the video had been downloaded to be shared elsewhere. The white paper addresses those problems, calling on the regulator to outline specific procedures that companies need to take to keep livestreamed material off the internet, but does not suggest an answer beyond embracing technology as part of the solution. Regulation of the internet has gradually become popular, even among the companies that would be regulated. In late March, the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg issued a public call for international regulation of the web on four fronts: political advertising, data portability, privacy and harmful content. \u201cI\u2019ve come to believe that we shouldn\u2019t make so many important decisions about speech on our own,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe will shortly publish a white paper which will set out the responsibilities of online platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not. We have heard calls for an internet regulator and to place a statutory \u2018duty of care\u2019 on platforms, and have seriously considered all options.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s deputy leader in the House of Lords has accused Tory Brexiters of organising a filibuster to try to halt the progress of a backbench bill to stop a no-deal Brexit, a move she said had the tacit support of the government. Opposition peers defeated several Tory backbench bids to block the progress of the bill but lengthy speeches and procedural devices were likely to significantly slow down proceedings. Lady Hayter, the Labour peer steering the bill to extend article 50 through the Lords after its narrow victory in the Commons late on Wednesday night, said the bill would not stop Brexit but would prevent a no-deal scenario. \u201cIt\u2019s been passed by the Commons \u2026 we should not be trying to hold it up,\u201d Hayter told Sky News. \u201cThere is unfortunately a filibuster being organised by Conservatives to try to talk out this bill, they are getting a bit of support, in fact quite a lot of support from the government, which I think is fairly shameful.\u201d The European Union (withdrawal) (no 5) bill, tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Oliver Letwin, squeaked through the House of Commons by the tiniest margin \u2013 just one vote. Speaking later in the Lords, Hayter said the government had lost the support of the House of Commons and was refusing to follow the instructions of the Lords to proceed with the bill, to chants of \u201csit down\u201d from the Tory benches opposite. \u201cThe bill can only have effect if we deal with it today so that it can receive royal assent in time for the EU council to consider the application for an extension,\u201d she said. Lord Forsyth, the Conservative former cabinet minister, one of the peers leading the opposition, said suspending standing orders to fast-track a bill in this way could lead to \u201ctyranny\u201d. He also criticised how it was passed in the Commons by just one vote, including the vote of the former Labour MP Fiona Onasanya, a convicted criminal wearing an electronic tag. \u201cThis is a major constitutional matter. It was passed by one vote,\u201d he said. After other peers admonished Forsyth, he continued: \u201cAll that lies between us and tyranny is that we respect the conventions of both houses. Why do we do that?

The House of Lords is expected to sit until the early hours of the morning, with Labour peers saying they are prepared to sit all night if necessary to ensure the bill passes all stages in a single sitting. MPs in the Commons sat until midnight to pass the bill through its second reading, committee stage and third reading in a single day, after a lengthy procedural debate about whether it should proceed at all. Labour sources are confident the bill has the support to pass through the Lords despite fierce opposition from pro-Brexit Tory peers. Downing Street said peers should think carefully before passing the Cooper-Letwin bill to protect against a no-deal Brexit, arguing that asking parliament to approve any extension to article 50 could actually increase the risk of a no-deal Brexit by accident. No 10 did not explicitly endorse the filibuster in the Lords by Conservative peers but asked them to scrutinise it thoroughly. \u201cIf passed, this bill would place a severe constraint on the government\u2019s ability to negotiate an extension and reflect this new date in UK statute books by 12 April,\u201d Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cOn Wednesday next week, the European council could propose an extension of an alternative length to that put forward by parliament, and under the bill the prime minister would have to return on Thursday 11 April to put that proposal to the house. \u201cBy 11 April, the European council will have concluded and the leaders will have returned to their member states.

      "bodyText": "The House of Lords has announced plans for a streamlined and more effective system to combat allegations of bullying and harassment after criticism over the action taken against the former Liberal Democrat peer Anthony Lester. Lester, who was accused of sexually harassing a woman, quit the upper house in December, after a convoluted procedure in whichpeers blocked a suspension imposed against him, with some questioning the credibility of the alleged victim. The new system would replace the privileges and conduct committee, made up of 16 peers, with a new conduct committee. This would have nine members \u2013 five backbench or crossbench peers, and four lay people, all with equal voting rights. The revamp, outlined in a report by the existing privileges and conduct committee, would also change the code of conduct for members of the Lords to add explicit provisions on bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct. Other changes would include allowing complaints to be made via email or an independent helpline rather than only in writing. Under the current system, while an investigation into alleged misconduct is undertaken by Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, the upper house\u2019s commissioner for standards, recommendations for a sanction are made by a subcommittee on Lords\u2019 conduct. Appeals are made to the privileges and conduct committee \u2013 as happened with Lester, who maintains his innocence \u2013 and any sanction is subject to a debate and vote in the Lords. The debate about Lester, who was accused of trying to pressure a woman into having sex with him by promising to make her a baroness, led some peers to question the alleged victim\u2019s credibility, prompting one female peer to walk out of the chamber in horror. Under the proposed new system the commissioner for standards would decide on wrongdoing and on any necessary sanctions, with the new conduct committee acting as the appeal body for the peer against whom the allegations were made and the complainant. Another recommendation is that while the Lords would vote on conduct committee reports and on sanctions against members found to have breached conduct rules this should happen without a debate. John McFall, the former Labour MP and senior deputy speaker in the Lords who chairs the privileges and conduct committee, said the report marked \u201ca significant change in the way the house will deal with allegations of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct against members\u201d. He said: \u201cIt will ensure we have an appropriate system to respond to complaints of that nature that everyone can feel confident in.\u201d The measures would most likely be amended after the publication of an independent report into bullying and harassment in the Lords by the barrister Naomi Ellenbogen, McFall said. He said: \u201cHowever, the proposals we are putting forward today represent a step change in improving how we handle allegations of bullying and harassment and making those processes more independent of members of the house. I hope this will reassure staff and others that they can feel confident to report inappropriate behaviour if it occurs.\u201d",

His contribution to the lives of millions of our children has been simply immense. If we leave Europe, his hitherto guaranteed right to call the UK his home is under threat. Can we imagine how this affects his life, how it makes him feel? And how do we feel that such a circumstance might yet come to pass in our country? This man is a treasured friend to us and to our children. We have to think again, and think hard.</p> <p>The European Union, as we know it now, was created after the second world war by France and Germany to ensure peace and prosperity. There was a determination that war should be no more. They had good enough reason. In the preceding 300 years there had been many wars between these two countries, the last two catastrophic, not just to them, but to us in the UK, and to people all over the world. There has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/23/the-eus-part-in-70-years-of-peace-in-europe\" title=\"\">peace in Europe</a> since, mostly. And democracy, mostly. And for many people, though not enough, there has also been great prosperity. Peace and prosperity and democracy \u2013 these are fine aims for us and our children.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/may-corbyn-brexit-talks-solution-mps-final-say\">Look past the May-Corbyn Brexit talks. There\u2019s another solution | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a democracy people are entitled to change their minds. That\u2019s the point of it. In an election we vote in a government, and if we feel they have let us down, not running the country as we would like, then at the next election we can vote them out again. </p> <p>The same must be true, surely, whether the democratic process takes the form of an election or a referendum. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/25/britains-1975-europe-referendum-what-was-it-like-last-time\" title=\"\">referendum in 1975</a>, 67% voted to stay in Europe. In 2016, 52% voted to leave. If we can change our minds after that first referendum, after circumstances have changed and upon reflection, then we can also change our minds now, after the second one, after circumstances have changed and upon reflection. And that to my mind is what we should now do, in order to save ourselves from ever greater decline and division.</p> <p>We have had almost three years now of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/08/brexit-toxic-environment-divided-country-malicious-abuse\" title=\"\">bitter debate</a>, toxic to national unity, to the national psyche, as deeply depressing, unpleasant and dishonest as the referendum itself. We blame the prime minister. We blame the government. We blame parliament. We should not. We have brought this on ourselves. This is a self-inflicted wound that will not heal, until we can agree to settle our differences, or simply agree to disagree. </p> <p>That we find ourselves a deeply troubled country is hardly surprising. After all we are a family going through a divorce. The referendum told us we must. We are the children in this divorcing family, and we are riven by it. There are those who blame Europe for most of our ills. Many are rightly angry at the unfairness of our society and lay it all at the door of Europe. They were encouraged to do so during the referendum campaign \u2013 a campaign which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/30/gove-johnson-under-fire-vote-leave-fine-appeal-dropped\" title=\"\">a travesty of democracy</a>. They are suffering through these bitter times, and are simply longing for the process of divorce to be over. They were given hope: hope of finding better jobs, of improved living conditions. This was the way to put the Great back into Britain, to renew national pride, to recover our lost sovereignty, to rediscover our Shangri-La.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9724fb8354376bf47d3c78ecc77fda3f4f3dd10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9724fb8354376bf47d3c78ecc77fda3f4f3dd10/0_164_5313_3187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher endorses staying in Europe in 1975\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In the referendum in 1975, 67% voted to stay in Europe.

Floyd/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some, though, still feel part of this family of European nations, despite all its idiocies, its squabbles, despite some awkward relatives. We know the benefits of peace and prosperity it has brought us. We are used to Europe now. It is home, as Britain is our home. And now we might be leaving. At the same time, we feel increasingly alienated from our fellow countrymen and women, and traumatised at the prospect of the breakup of the family. We feel the country has lost its way. </p> <p>There will be a life after this divorce. But how will it be? Leave or remain, half the country will be greatly hurt. It is our insensitivity to the immense hurt all this has caused to the rest of the European family of nations that I have found most shameful. Right from the start of negotiations we insisted on playing it the haughty way. We are the fifth biggest economy in the world. Europe will roll over and do our bidding to keep our business. We can dictate our terms for the divorce. The trouble, we soon discovered, is that Europe too has its pride, and they don\u2019t like being talked down to or dictated to any more than we do. They bite back. That\u2019s what happens in divorces.</p> <p>And after the divorce? Well, there are two stories. Either we leave, and the Shangri-La land of milk and honey beckons, or we stay in Europe and play our full part in creating a reformed Europe that we and so many in Europe would like to see.</p> <p>I prefer the latter choice. We have fought well enough in the past for a free Europe. So let us stay, and work to achieve a better Europe. I choose this way because of the children. We should remember that <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/how-did-young-people-vote-brexit-referendum/\" title=\"\">more than 70% of young voters</a> in the referendum wanted to stay in. </p> <p>The umbrella of peace in Europe is protection for the young in an ever more threatening world.

Two European nations, Ireland and the UK, determined between them that war should be no more, and Europe helped to create an atmosphere in which peace could begin and prosper.

      "bodyText": "For 37 years, Axel Scheffler, the German-born illustrator of The Gruffalo, has made his home and his career in Britain. His contribution to the lives of millions of our children has been simply immense. If we leave Europe, his hitherto guaranteed right to call the UK his home is under threat. Can we imagine how this affects his life, how it makes him feel? And how do we feel that such a circumstance might yet come to pass in our country? This man is a treasured friend to us and to our children. We have to think again, and think hard. The European Union, as we know it now, was created after the second world war by France and Germany to ensure peace and prosperity. There was a determination that war should be no more. They had good enough reason. In the preceding 300 years there had been many wars between these two countries, the last two catastrophic, not just to them, but to us in the UK, and to people all over the world. There has been peace in Europe since, mostly. And democracy, mostly. And for many people, though not enough, there has also been great prosperity. Peace and prosperity and democracy \u2013 these are fine aims for us and our children. In a democracy people are entitled to change their minds. That\u2019s the point of it. In an election we vote in a government, and if we feel they have let us down, not running the country as we would like, then at the next election we can vote them out again. The same must be true, surely, whether the democratic process takes the form of an election or a referendum. In the referendum in 1975, 67% voted to stay in Europe. In 2016, 52% voted to leave. If we can change our minds after that first referendum, after circumstances have changed and upon reflection, then we can also change our minds now, after the second one, after circumstances have changed and upon reflection. And that to my mind is what we should now do, in order to save ourselves from ever greater decline and division. We have had almost three years now of bitter debate, toxic to national unity, to the national psyche, as deeply depressing, unpleasant and dishonest as the referendum itself. We blame the prime minister. We blame the government. We blame parliament. We should not. We have brought this on ourselves. This is a self-inflicted wound that will not heal, until we can agree to settle our differences, or simply agree to disagree. That we find ourselves a deeply troubled country is hardly surprising. After all we are a family going through a divorce. The referendum told us we must. We are the children in this divorcing family, and we are riven by it. There are those who blame Europe for most of our ills. Many are rightly angry at the unfairness of our society and lay it all at the door of Europe. They were encouraged to do so during the referendum campaign \u2013 a campaign which was a travesty of democracy. They are suffering through these bitter times, and are simply longing for the process of divorce to be over. They were given hope: hope of finding better jobs, of improved living conditions. This was the way to put the Great back into Britain, to renew national pride, to recover our lost sovereignty, to rediscover our Shangri-La. Some, though, still feel part of this family of European nations, despite all its idiocies, its squabbles, despite some awkward relatives. We know the benefits of peace and prosperity it has brought us. We are used to Europe now. It is home, as Britain is our home. And now we might be leaving. At the same time, we feel increasingly alienated from our fellow countrymen and women, and traumatised at the prospect of the breakup of the family. We feel the country has lost its way. There will be a life after this divorce. But how will it be? Leave or remain, half the country will be greatly hurt. It is our insensitivity to the immense hurt all this has caused to the rest of the European family of nations that I have found most shameful. Right from the start of negotiations we insisted on playing it the haughty way. We are the fifth biggest economy in the world. Europe will roll over and do our bidding to keep our business. We can dictate our terms for the divorce. The trouble, we soon discovered, is that Europe too has its pride, and they don\u2019t like being talked down to or dictated to any more than we do. They bite back. That\u2019s what happens in divorces. And after the divorce? Well, there are two stories. Either we leave, and the Shangri-La land of milk and honey beckons, or we stay in Europe and play our full part in creating a reformed Europe that we and so many in Europe would like to see. I prefer the latter choice. We have fought well enough in the past for a free Europe. So let us stay, and work to achieve a better Europe. I choose this way because of the children. We should remember that more than 70% of young voters in the referendum wanted to stay in. The umbrella of peace in Europe is protection for the young in an ever more threatening world. Look at how that umbrella has helped bring peace on the island of Ireland. Two European nations, Ireland and the UK, determined between them that war should be no more, and Europe helped to create an atmosphere in which peace could begin and prosper. But peace, like marriage, like friendship, has to be worked at, can never be taken for granted. It is time now to think again. And I am not the only one. Remember, 48% of us voted to stay in Europe. Six million of us this week echoed that by signing a petition. And then there was the recent march of the families in London. Hundreds of thousands of people walking in peaceful protest, declaring their fervent wish to remain in Europe. This was not an angry mob. This was a serious protest, but full of good humour. This was Britain at its best, at its greatest. So let us end these intractable and angry divorce proceedings, for our children\u2019s sake. They hope for a future in Europe, to create a world of peace and reconciliation, to tread ever more softly on our planet. It will be their world. Let\u2019s listen to them, follow them. We need to revoke article 50, pause, think, and then not rush ahead. We need to do this for Scheffler and others like him. We need to try to commit to this marriage, to make it work better for us, for our children, and for Europe. And if in 10 years or so, there are many of us who still feel Europe is not home to us, then we can think again. Nothing is for ever. I hope and believe our children will make it work. We must give them the chance. \u2022 Michael Morpurgo is an English author, poet, playwright and librettist",

There have been times in Britain\u2019s modern history when trade policy has really mattered, breaking parties and swinging elections. To that list can now be added the question of whether Britain should be in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/01/brexit-would-uk-be-better-off-in-or-out-of-the-customs-union\" title=\"\">customs union</a> with the European Union.</p> <p>Business certainly thinks so. Leaving the customs union would give Britain freedom to negotiate its own trade deals but this, according to the country\u2019s most powerful employers\u2019 organisation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/business-leaders-warn-of-supertanker-gb-heading-for-the-rocks\" title=\"\">the CBI</a>, is not why people voted for Brexit. That was primarily about money and immigration rather than a desire for the local supermarket to be able to stock hormone-treated US beef.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn seems to agree. When the Labour leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/jeremy-corbyn-under-pressure-to-back-public-vote-on-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">sat down for talks with Theresa May</a>, his argument was that Britain should be part of a customs union with the EU. The use of the indefinite article is important. Labour is talking about <em>a</em> customs union rather than <em>the</em> customs union.</p> <p>Perhaps this is just as well, since there is precious little evidence that the current arrangement serves the interests of Britain all that well.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Customs unions or trade liberalisation deals matter a whole lot less than the underlying shape of an economy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Support for a customs union is based on the belief that it makes sense for the UK to aim to minimise friction as much as possible in trade with its biggest trading partner: no tariffs, no quotas, no customs posts, no border checks, unimpeded supply chains. Outside of the customs union, UK firms would have more forms to fill in, more red tape to disentangle. They would be disadvantaged in the way that American, Chinese and Japanese exporters to the EU currently are.</p> <p>No question, the customs union certainly makes it easier for multinational companies to ship parts and semi-finished goods backwards and forwards across the Channel. But the real test of the worth of the current system is whether it has done anything to improve Britain\u2019s trade performance.</p> <p>Overseas business done by UK companies can be divided into four categories: exports of goods to the EU, exports of services to the EU, exports of goods to the rest of the world, and exports of services to the rest of the world.</p> <p>Given that the customs union mostly affects physical trade goods, it might be thought that goods exports to the EU would be the best-performing category of the four. In fact, it is comfortably the worst, not just in recent years but over the past two decades, during which time exports have grown by just 0.2% on average. That\u2019s actually worse than growth in goods exports to the rest of the world (up 3.3% a year).</p> <p>The UK\u2019s record in services has been much better. Exports to non-EU countries have grown by 5.6% a year for the past two decades, while services exports to the EU have increased by 5.2% a year.</p> <p>Since the late 1990s, a deficit in goods with the EU of \u00a36bn a year has ballooned into a deficit of \u00a395bn a year. What\u2019s more, the two goods sectors where the UK runs its biggest trade deficit with the EU are motor vehicles and food and drink, the ones that get the most protection from tariffs. Per head of population, the UK\u2019s deficit in goods with the EU is bigger than the US\u2019s bilateral deficit with China, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/21/us-china-trade-trump-says-tariffs-on-beijing-may-linger\" title=\"\">which Donald Trump is so fired up about</a>.</p> <p>In part, that\u2019s due to the EU\u2019s miserable growth performance, but there\u2019s more to it than that. Despite all the form-filling they have to do, Chinese, American, Indian and Brazilian goods exports to the EU have increased faster than Britain\u2019s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/theresa-may-labour-brexit-old-strategy\">Is May\u2019s offer to Labour sincere? Here\u2019s why the answer is probably not | Tom Kibasi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Certain conclusions can be drawn from this. The customs union works well for German carmakers and French farmers, who have a captive market for their products, but has not delivered anything like the same benefits for the UK.</p> <p>Those who argue that Britain would be better off negotiating its own trade deals have a point, because the EU is not especially interested in liberalising where it is weak but the UK is strong \u2013 services. As the Bank of England <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-paper/2018/mind-the-current-account-gap\" title=\"\">has noted</a>, trade in services is more restricted than it is in goods, which helps explain why countries that specialise in services \u2013 such as Britain and the US \u2013 tend to run persistent current account deficits.</p> <p>But perhaps the most important conclusion is that customs unions or trade liberalisation deals matter a whole lot less than the underlying shape of an economy. In spite of all the barriers, Britain runs surpluses in services, both to the EU and the rest of the world, because it is good at banking, insurance, law, architecture and consultancy. If the UK wants to export more goods it needs to be better at manufacturing things that overseas customers want to buy.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2019 to clarify a reference to \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d in a possible UK-EU customs union.

      "bodyText": "The Corn Laws. The tariff reform debate of the early 20th century. Imperial preference in the 1930s. There have been times in Britain\u2019s modern history when trade policy has really mattered, breaking parties and swinging elections. To that list can now be added the question of whether Britain should be in a customs union with the European Union. Business certainly thinks so. Leaving the customs union would give Britain freedom to negotiate its own trade deals but this, according to the country\u2019s most powerful employers\u2019 organisation, the CBI, is not why people voted for Brexit. That was primarily about money and immigration rather than a desire for the local supermarket to be able to stock hormone-treated US beef. Jeremy Corbyn seems to agree. When the Labour leader sat down for talks with Theresa May, his argument was that Britain should be part of a customs union with the EU. The use of the indefinite article is important. Labour is talking about a customs union rather than the customs union. Perhaps this is just as well, since there is precious little evidence that the current arrangement serves the interests of Britain all that well. Support for a customs union is based on the belief that it makes sense for the UK to aim to minimise friction as much as possible in trade with its biggest trading partner: no tariffs, no quotas, no customs posts, no border checks, unimpeded supply chains. Outside of the customs union, UK firms would have more forms to fill in, more red tape to disentangle. They would be disadvantaged in the way that American, Chinese and Japanese exporters to the EU currently are. No question, the customs union certainly makes it easier for multinational companies to ship parts and semi-finished goods backwards and forwards across the Channel. But the real test of the worth of the current system is whether it has done anything to improve Britain\u2019s trade performance. Overseas business done by UK companies can be divided into four categories: exports of goods to the EU, exports of services to the EU, exports of goods to the rest of the world, and exports of services to the rest of the world. Given that the customs union mostly affects physical trade goods, it might be thought that goods exports to the EU would be the best-performing category of the four. In fact, it is comfortably the worst, not just in recent years but over the past two decades, during which time exports have grown by just 0.2% on average. That\u2019s actually worse than growth in goods exports to the rest of the world (up 3.3% a year). The UK\u2019s record in services has been much better. Exports to non-EU countries have grown by 5.6% a year for the past two decades, while services exports to the EU have increased by 5.2% a year. Since the late 1990s, a deficit in goods with the EU of \u00a36bn a year has ballooned into a deficit of \u00a395bn a year. What\u2019s more, the two goods sectors where the UK runs its biggest trade deficit with the EU are motor vehicles and food and drink, the ones that get the most protection from tariffs. Per head of population, the UK\u2019s deficit in goods with the EU is bigger than the US\u2019s bilateral deficit with China, which Donald Trump is so fired up about. In part, that\u2019s due to the EU\u2019s miserable growth performance, but there\u2019s more to it than that. Despite all the form-filling they have to do, Chinese, American, Indian and Brazilian goods exports to the EU have increased faster than Britain\u2019s. Certain conclusions can be drawn from this. The customs union works well for German carmakers and French farmers, who have a captive market for their products, but has not delivered anything like the same benefits for the UK. Those who argue that Britain would be better off negotiating its own trade deals have a point, because the EU is not especially interested in liberalising where it is weak but the UK is strong \u2013 services. As the Bank of England has noted, trade in services is more restricted than it is in goods, which helps explain why countries that specialise in services \u2013 such as Britain and the US \u2013 tend to run persistent current account deficits. But perhaps the most important conclusion is that customs unions or trade liberalisation deals matter a whole lot less than the underlying shape of an economy. In spite of all the barriers, Britain runs surpluses in services, both to the EU and the rest of the world, because it is good at banking, insurance, law, architecture and consultancy. If the UK wants to export more goods it needs to be better at manufacturing things that overseas customers want to buy. \u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor \u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2019 to clarify a reference to \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d in a possible UK-EU customs union. The wording has been qualified to make clear this is a hoped-for benefit among supporters of a customs union.",
