Meanwhile, in Manchester, Change UK MPs Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry addressed the People\u2019s Vote and Remain rally, though later than billed after being delayed by train problems. Umunna told the crowd that many of his family members from continental Europe were still grieving over the EU referendum result and it was \u201cdisgusting and reprehensible\u201d how remainers were being dismissed.

Burrows had been out campaigning and said people were ready to vote for a new party who would make a stand against Brexit. In central London, the Liberal Democrat party leader, Sir Vince Cable, cited British Steel and Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 businesses he said were struggling at least in part because of Brexit \u2013 as examples of factors he believed had motivated people to turn towards his party and its pro-remain position. Cable added that the Brexit process was harming the health service and attacked those who have advocated falling back on World Trade Organization rules, saying he was unsure exactly how many of them understand what that meant. He told supporters that Lib Dem MEPs would provide a \u201csolid block of liberal people who will stand firm against the rise of xenophobia, populism, sometimes outright racism and fascism that we\u2019re now getting across Europe\u201d.

The People\u2019s Vote campaign also dismissed May\u2019s offer of a vote on a second referendum.</li> \n   <li><strong>Several parties held rallies for their supporters.</strong> The Brexit party\u2019s event was addressed by Nigel Farage, who said victory for his side would \u201ckill off\u201d a second Brexit referendum. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, reiterated that his party\u2019s campaign was as much about stopping Brexit as about getting his candidates elected to public office, while Change UK\u2019s Anna Soubry urged her former Tory colleagues to put country before party.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues <strong>Heather Stewart</strong>, <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> and <strong>Peter Walker</strong> have the full story:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/may-offers-mps-vote-on-second-referendum-in-new-brexit-deal\">May\u2019s final effort to win backing falls flat as MPs reject \u2018new' Brexit deal</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-21T23:32:54.196Z\">at 12.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ce46dae8f0807b455f85b0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-21T21:30:23.593Z\">10.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Liberal Democrats have been holding a rally tonight.

Here are some thoughts.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) May has offered MPs a vote on a second referendum - which, in symbolic terms, is quite significant.</strong> Until now she firmly resisted the idea the idea that the government might schedule a vote on this, and last week, when cross-party talks broke down, May implied one reason was because Labour was insisting on a second referendum.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) But, in practical terms, this offer means much less than it sounds.</strong> During the EU withdrawal agreement bill\u2019s passage, someone was bound to table an amendment calling for a second referendum, and so all (or almost all) May is doing is timetabling a vote that would have happened anyway. She has not promised Tory MPs a free vote on this.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) May has also promised to legislate for a referendum if MPs vote for one.</strong> The two do not necessarily go together; it was easy to imagine MPs voting for a second referendum, but the government then holding up the legislation required to make it happen.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) But May did not explain how she would stop a future Conservative leader blocking second referendum legislation, or repealing it. </strong>(A new Tory leader should be in office before the autumn, and it is unlikely the Brexit bill would be law by then, even if it passed its second reading. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/17/brexit-latest-news-developments-express-regret-but-not-surprise-as-cross-party-talks-reportedly-set-to-be-wound-up-live-news?page=with:block-5cde94bd8f08ea3978d885dc#block-5cde94bd8f08ea3978d885dc\">Labour has already said such a bill would need more time.) </a>Given how pro-Brexit the Conservative party membership is, it is hard to imagine anyone getting elected as leader if they sound keen on implementing a second referendum.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) May\u2019s customs offer is much narrower than her second referendum one. </strong>She is not proposing a government vote on a permanent customs union, which is what Labour wants, even though she is proposing a vote on a second referendum. Why? Presumably because, while May must be reasonably confident that the Commons would vote against a second referendum, she must be worried that MPs would back a permanent customs union. (As with the second referendum, there would probably be a vote on this anyway, because Labour would table an amendment. But May is only committing to accept the result if MPs vote for the temporary customs union idea she mentioned in her speech.)</p> \n  <p><strong>6) May seems to have resolved the question about whether to hold indicative votes before the second reading vote on the bill, or after (assuming it gets defeated) by deciding to hold the indicative votes <em>within</em> the bill. </strong>The referendum vote offer and the customs union vote offer seem all that is left of her indicative votes plan.</p> \n  <p>May\u2019s argument to Labour MPs that, if they want a second referendum, they need to vote for her bill is a plausible one. It is a case that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/17/brexit-latest-news-developments-express-regret-but-not-surprise-as-cross-party-talks-reportedly-set-to-be-wound-up-live-news?page=with:block-5cdec0a48f08d2b474ebdb5c#block-5cdec0a48f08d2b474ebdb5c\">Nick Boles MPs was making powerfully at the end of last week. </a>But, with opposition to her deal already so entrenched, it feels as if she may have left it too late.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-21T17:03:53.866Z\">at 6.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ce421538f08cb61833734bc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-21T16:04:11.412Z\">5.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">What May said in her speech on customs</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And this is what May said in her speech on customs.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now the government has already put a proposal which delivers the benefits of a customs union but with the ability for the UK to determine its own trade and development policy.</p> \n   <p>Labour are both sceptical of our ability to negotiate that and don\u2019t believe an independent trade policy is in the national interest.

Will the Tories\u2019 Lord of Misrule do a deal with Nigel Farage or try to win over the One Nation Conservatives who yesterday launched a new grouping in parliament?</p> \n   <p>After the EU elections, the momentum in the Tory leadership contest will be with the hard Brexiteers, but many of those who know Mr Johnson best think he will ultimately back away from taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. One ally describes it as the \u201cNixon to China\u201d strategy for ending the Brexit mess, arguing that only a politician with an unassailable reputation among their supporters can reach an agreement that involves compromise.</p> \n   <p>Some believe he could even back a second referendum to get a mandate without risking his entire premiership on a general election. It is an idea that he has toyed with in the past. When I interviewed him in 2015 he told me he was \u201cvery interested\u201d in a second referendum if people initially voted to Leave as a way of negotiating a better relationship with the EU. \u201cI love our friends and partners in Brussels, I understand quite deeply the way they do things, they are not remotely interested in you unless you tell them no,\u201d he explained.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/20/boris-johnson-no-10-labour-back-remain\">But Polly Toynbee at the Guardian thinks that, if Johnson becomes PM, he will call an early election.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What happens when [Johnson] wins? He can\u2019t get no deal through this parliament, but at Halloween the UK is due to crash out willy-nilly, without some deal agreed. The Calais border would clang shut and so would the Irish border, firing up demands for a united Ireland referendum, with the Scots likely to follow suit with Indyref2. As everything seizes up, Britain would have only the feckless Johnson to cope with a pile-up of calamities in fuel, food, medicines, visas, lorry queues and a plunging pound.</p> \n   <p>Johnson has no plan: his foresight goes no further than winning the prize of Downing Street. If he had the impulse control to visualise consequences, would he want to win on a no-deal pledge? Before 31 October, Labour would table a vote of no confidence and Tory One Nation MPs would back it to bring down their own government, and call an election. Seeing that inevitability, Johnson will surely call an election himself, shortly after reaching No 10. At risk of becoming the shortest serving prime minister of all time, he will be tanked up with vaunting hubris. Farage will bid to strip off Tory votes and seats (and some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> ones too), while the Liberal Democrats syphon away remain and moderate voters. In the best scenario, the Armageddon that awaits may turn out to be the fate of Johnson and the Tory party for years to come, but not of the country as a whole.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a49f9918-7ae0-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560\">Robert Shrimsley at the Financial Times (paywall) says the Euro elections campaign shows the remain parties are not ready for a second referendum.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For if one thing has emerged from the European parliamentary election in which his party looks set to win the most seats, it is that the forces of remain have some major lessons to learn if they are to have any chance of winning the second referendum for which they are so actively agitating. The stakes may also be higher. Until recently, advocates of a second vote did not expect a no-deal Brexit to be one of the options. It is now hard to imagine how it cannot be. </p> \n   <p>Not only is Mr Farage likely to win this weekend, he has also won the fight to define Brexit as a clean break. He turned the battle into an issue of keeping faith with a democratic vote and positioned himself as the true force for change in the UK. With speed, social media and clarity of purpose, his start-up party has dominated the campaign. Britain\u2019s version of Emmanuel Macron turns out not to be Chuka Umunna and Change UK but Mr Farage and the Brexit party.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ce3da318f0807b455f854ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-21T11:00:16.449Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From ITV\u2019s<strong> Paul Brand</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1130788259284619266\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cabinet cars lined up ready to go.

Five Star members were discussing and voting on policy and nominating and electing each other to run for office while being steeped in party propaganda, all on a single online platform. This made supporters feel as if the movement\u2019s identity was emerging organically from their online interactions, while Casaleggio and Grillo could guide those interactions with messaging from above. What\u2019s more, the \u201cmovement\u201d was dominated by a private company owned by Casaleggio. Five Star was in many ways less like a political party than a publicly traded company in which members were voting shareholders, but Casaleggio had the controlling stake ...</p> \n   <p>If Casaleggio\u2019s ambition was to replace parliament with direct democracy, Farage\u2019s ambition seems, in the first instance, to destroy the Conservative party. Farage declined to speak to me for this article, but [Arron] Banks told me that the Brexit party and Leave.EU, which is still very much active, were pursuing a sort of pincer movement on the Tories. (He also denied to me that he is a \u201cmystery donor\u201d to the Brexit party.) \u201cLeave.EU goes behind enemy lines, blowing up their bridges, causing mass mayhem in the Tory party, while the Brexit party can come in head-on, into their face,\u201d he said.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is the full article.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/21/brexit-party-nigel-farage-italy-digital-populists-five-star-movement\">Building the Brexit party: how Nigel Farage copied Italy's digital populists</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ce3beed8f08cb6183372fb6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-21T09:15:50.295Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday<strong> David Davis,</strong> the former Brexit secretary, said that, having voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal in the last Commons debate, at the end of March, he would now revert to voting against it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/20/brexit-latest-news-developments-may-fresh-bid-to-get-tories-to-back-brexit-bill-faltering-as-david-davis-says-hes-now-voting-against-live-news?page=with:block-5ce258c08f088c3e913d9a16#block-5ce258c08f088c3e913d9a16\">He said he opposed the EU withdrawal agreement bill because it would tie the hands of May\u2019s successor.</a></p> \n  <p>Now <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, the chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, is also turning against May\u2019s deal.

May is trying to construct a Commons majority for her bill. But the cabinet itself is deeply divided, and those divisions have been on full display this morning.</p> \n  <p><strong>Philip Hammond,</strong> the chancellor and probably the leading pro-European in government, has been arguing for a long time that a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster. But tonight he is escalating his campaign against that option, with a speech to the CBI annual dinner in London in which he will dismiss this as a plan being championed by the \u201cpopulist right\u201d that would be both economically damaging and politically illegitimate. According to an extract released in advance, he will say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On the populist right, there are those who now claim that the only outcome that counts as a truly legitimate Brexit is to leave with no deal. </p> \n   <p>Let me remind them: the 2016 Leave campaign was clear that we would leave with a deal. </p> \n   <p>So to advocate for no deal is to hijack the result of the referendum, and in doing so, knowingly to inflict damage on our economy and our living standards. </p> \n   <p>Because all the preparation in the world will not avoid the consequences of no deal. </p> \n   <p>So I will continue to fight, in the face of this polarisation, for a negotiated Brexit - an outcome that respects the British people\u2019s decision to leave, while recognising that there is no mandate for a no-deal exit, and that we have an absolute obligation to protect Britain\u2019s jobs, businesses and future prosperity. </p> \n   <p>But we need to be clear that if we do not resolve this issue in the next few weeks, there is a real risk of a new prime minister abandoning the search for a deal, and shifting towards seeking a damaging no-deal exit as a matter of policy ... to protect an ideological position which ignores the reality of Britain\u2019s economic interests and the value of our union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As the Times reports <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/philip-hammond-leads-attack-on-boris-johnson-over-brexit-lj28ns55c\">in its splash</a>, this is being seen as a pre-emptive attack on Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary who is the favourite in the forthcoming Tory leadership contest.

Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: The prime minister set out a series of changes she said she was willing to make to her Brexit deal to get it through parliament. They included, perhaps most notably, the offer of a vote on a potential second referendum. You can read a more comprehensive summary of that here. The proposal was immediately panned by key Westminser figures. The Labour leadership insisted it did not represent a meaningful change and hard Brexit-supporting Tories and the DUP indicated they had little or no intention of voting for it. The People\u2019s Vote campaign also dismissed May\u2019s offer of a vote on a second referendum. Several parties held rallies for their supporters. The Brexit party\u2019s event was addressed by Nigel Farage, who said victory for his side would \u201ckill off\u201d a second Brexit referendum. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, reiterated that his party\u2019s campaign was as much about stopping Brexit as about getting his candidates elected to public office, while Change UK\u2019s Anna Soubry urged her former Tory colleagues to put country before party. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Heather Stewart, Rowena Mason and Peter Walker have the full story: The Liberal Democrats have been holding a rally tonight. Addressing the audience, the party\u2019s leader, Vince Cable, cited British Steel and Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 businesses he said were struggling at least in part because of Brexit \u2013 as examples of factors he believed had motivated people to turn towards his party and its pro-remain position. Cable added that the Brexit process was also harming the health service and attacked those who have advocated falling back on World Trade Organization rules, saying he was unsure exactly how many of them understand what that meant. He told supporters Lib Dem MEPs would provide a \u201csolid block of liberal people who will stand firm against the rise of xenophobia, populism, sometimes outright racism and fascism that we\u2019re now getting across Europe\u201d. He closed by summarising the party\u2019s plans for the final days of campaigning, including his planned debate with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, whom he referred to as \u201cMr Trump\u2019s little helper\u201d. The Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, vowed to \u201ckill off any chance of a second referendum\u201d. More than 3,000 supporters filled the Olympia conference centre this evening, with speeches frequently punctuated with heckling. There were boos when Farage name-checked Jean-Claude Juncker, louder boos for Donald Tusk and louder still for Guy Verhofstadt. But the biggest boo was reserved for mention of a People\u2019s Vote. Farage told the audience: If we win on Thursday, we kill off any chance of them forcing a second referendum on us because they know they would lose. Former Conservative supporters were easy to find. Ian Gregory, a former Tory voter, said he was supporting Farage\u2019s party because \u201cthe Tories were losing their space\u201d in the electoral landscape. They struggle to keep up with the pace of change. Politics is changing and you have to adapt and they are just too slow. We are at an inflection point in history, maybe the same as the 1920s. Here\u2019s a little more from Nigel Farage\u2019s speech this evening: Farage is addressing the audience now: The former Czech Republic prime minister, V\u00e1clav Klaus*, was one of three warm up acts at the Brexit Party\u2019s last hustings, which is taking place in a packed Olympic conference centre in London. He told Nigel Farage\u2019s supporters they had \u201cmany friends\u201d in his country. You should give the rest of Europe a good example. Many Europeans need it, and many Europeans are waiting for it. Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP who is running for the Brexit Party in the South West constituency, earlier raised cheers and boos on cue in a pantomime-style question and answer warm-up by the former Conservative MP. Our game on Thursday is twofold: We have to send a message which will terrify Westminster; [to send a message] which they can only interpret in one way: That their future depends on Britain\u2019s future being outside the EU. Her second message was: \u201cWe are not going away\u201d. Widdecombe raised a loud boo when she name-checked Guy Verhofstadt, whose aides joked they had turned Britain into a \u201ccolony\u201d in a recent Belgian documentary. He thinks we are a colony. Well, colonies have a disconcerting habit of revolting. *We originally reported here that the former Czech politician appearing tonight was V\u00e1clav Havel. It was, in fact, V\u00e1clav Klaus. Havel died in 2011. In Manchester, Anna Soubry tells remain supporters they can be proud of all the Change UK candidates and says it is absolutely imperative for campaigners to get out and canvass votes before Thursday. This is the beginning of the change that must happen in our country and change is coming. She is predicting that the main parties will go in to meltdown and urges the Conservatives to do the right thing, adding: Make no mistake that what is going to happen over the next few months ... is that Mrs May is going to go. God help us if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister ... he is on the threshold of Number 10. Now is the time for everyone to show courage and to put their country first ... One nation conservatives \u2013 you are better working with your neighbours ... which is the European Union. The Electoral Commission has carried out its visit to the Brexit Party\u2019s office to conduct a review of the systems the party has in place to receive funds, it\u2019s said. That was done as part of the commission\u2019s \u201cactive oversight and regulation of these rules\u201d, not as part of a formal investigation of the party. A spokeswoman has said the commission has not \u201cseen evidence of electoral offences, but the law in this area is complex and we want to satisfy ourselves that the pParty\u2019s systems are robust\u201d. And she said the intervention of Gordon Brown had no bearing on the Electoral Commission\u2019s work. Last week\u2019s meeting with the Brexit Party was an opportunity to meet with representatives of this newly formed party. Today\u2019s visit is about taking a closer look at the systems the party has in place to receive funds. It gives us active oversight of the rules and this includes helping those regulated to understand them and to ensure there are systems in place to comply with them. As a newly registered party running a national election campaign, who have put information into the public domain about the level of their fundraising, it is right and proper for the regulator to be in regular contact with the Brexit Party. We have been talking to the party since it registered, discussing the rules and the party\u2019s systems. But, recently, we have seen significant public concern about the way the party raises funds. We have not seen evidence of electoral offences, but the law in this area is complex and we want to satisfy ourselves that the party\u2019s systems are robust. Our regulatory work during this campaign \u2013 for the European Parliamentary elections \u2013 has not deviated from our usual approach. We are an independent and impartial organisation which is accountable to Parliament. We regulate as is proportionate to the issue, regardless of a party\u2019s politics. Our decision to visit is not related to comments made by the former prime minister. Chuka Umunna has begun to speak, revealing that many of his family members from continental Europe are still grieving over the EU referendum result. He calls for a People\u2019s Vote to remain in the European Union. Brexit goes beyond politics, it is about who we are. This is about a lot more than politics or ideologies. It is about me personally, about my family ... about who we are as people. What I find so disgusting and reprehensible is the way that my community is dismissed as a liberal, metropolitan elite ... it is disgusting. Don\u2019t call the people in my community some Waitrose-shopping, latte-drinking elite ... many people in my community live in poverty ... nobody has a monopoly on grievance. Loads of communities have been left behind ... the only difference is that we did not feel that leaving the European Union would change things. Urge everyone, if you want to stop this madness, [to] vote for Change UK on Thursday. Another erstwhile supporter of May\u2019s deal turns against her: It is maybe worth noting that Johnson is also on record as saying he hopes to replace May in Number 10. At the Manchester rally, 57-year-old Andrew Graystone \u2013 whose expression of solidarity with his local Muslim community after the Christchurch attacks went viral \u2013 gets rapturous applause. There was a murmur of agreement across the room as he says the damage done by Brexit would take a generation to repair. He said: I am Manchester through and through. My son is a nurse and wife works with refugees. Six weeks ago, I woke up to the terrible news to the shootings and I thought about how my Muslim friends might feel and it made sense to walk to my local mosque in Levenshulme with a sign that said: \u2018You are my friends, I will keep watch while you pray\u2019. That photograph was shared millions of times, 50,000 personal messages \u2013 a torrent of goodwill and hopefulness ... overwhelmingly, British people want to live in peace with their neighbours and communities of co-operation. The vast majority of people want to build bridges and not walls; want a new kind of politics with a new leadership. There is yet more reaction coming in to May\u2019s offer via various reporters in Westminster. And yet more of it constitutes bad news for the prime minister: Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna were delayed to the Manchester People\u2019s Vote and Remain rally in the city\u2019s Technology Centre due to train problems. Their supporters were buoyed as they waited though, by a \u2018retro\u2019 playlist that included the songs Let You Love Me, by Rita Ora, and Sweet But Psycho, by Ava Max. Mark Burrows and Nick Foss, both aged 58, carried placards as they accompanied Elisabeth Knight, who is standing for Change UK in the North West constituency. Burrows has been out campaigning and said people were ready to vote for a new party who would make a stand against Brexit. There is a lot of goodwill from remainers about Change UK because they see it as a force that can make things happen. It is an alternative that will make something radical happen. Dan Price, engineer and local councillor from Warrington who left the Labour party for the same reasons Chuka Umunna and some others did, has taken to the stand. Five weeks ago, I was a member of the Labour party. After years of Brexit fudge, I left the Labour party ... I could no longer look my constituents in the eye. I was inspired by the bravery of the Change UK candidates who sacrificed their careers and put their country first. I am a proud Northern, English, British and European. Brexiteers and Westminster have failed us. The former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, who has previously voted for May\u2019s deal, has dismissed her latest plan. And it has gone down no better with senior figures in the hard Brexit-supporting ERG: The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is due to address the CBI\u2019s annual dinner, which is due to start around now. It was reported earlier that he planned to say a no-deal Brexit would damage the economy. Now, shortly before he\u2019s due to give the speech, a further extract emerges in which he drives home the point that fiscal imprudence is not a look that most Conservatives would like to be seen in. He plans to say: Fiscal responsibility is a proud boast of Conservative governments and I know that, in the coming months, my colleagues will want to protect that reputation \u2013 and so will resist the ever-present temptation to write cheques the country cannot afford. We must not undo a decade of hard work by the British people by making unfunded commitments that would send our national debt soaring; leave the economy vulnerable to future shocks; burden future generations and waste billions on interest payments. People must know they can trust Conservatives with the public finances. Earlier, we reported that he planned to attack the idea on the \u201cpopulist right\u201d that a no-deal Brexit was the only acceptable form of Brexit (see 9.23am). An extract revealed that he planned to say: On the populist right, there are those who now claim that the only outcome that counts as a truly legitimate Brexit is to leave with no deal. Let me remind them: the 2016 Leave campaign was clear that we would leave with a deal. So, to advocate for no deal is to hijack the result of the referendum and, in doing so, knowingly to inflict damage on our economy and our living standards. Because all the preparation in the world will not avoid the consequences of no deal. So I will continue to fight, in the face of this polarisation, for a negotiated Brexit; an outcome that respects the British people\u2019s decision to leave, while recognising that there is no mandate for a \u201cno-deal\u201d exit; and that we have an absolute obligation to protect Britain\u2019s jobs, businesses and future prosperity. But we need to be clear that, if we do not resolve this issue in the next few weeks, there is a real risk of a new prime minister abandoning the search for a deal, and shifting towards seeking a damaging no-deal exit as a matter of policy \u2026 in order to protect an ideological position which ignores the reality of Britain\u2019s economic interests and the value of our Union. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has put out this statement in response to Theresa May\u2019s speech. He said: The prime minister\u2019s last ditch attempt to get her withdrawal agreement through the Commons without a confirmatory referendum attached is doomed to failure. Her authority is draining away. Unless and until the government concedes that a people\u2019s vote must be in the legislation, she will not win our support. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. There is a rule in journalism that, if someone frames a headline in the form of a question, it is normally best to assume the answer is no. But in this case, if you read Laura Kuenssberg\u2019s blog, you will find that this is a rare example of a question mark being used to understate what an article is saying, not overstate it. Here\u2019s an extract. The diplomatic way of describing the situation tonight? Compromising when no one else is interested in consensus is impossible. The more brutal political interpretation - Theresa May\u2019s mishandling of this whole situation has, over many, many months, pulled her deeper and deeper down into a quagmire of her own creation. An attempt at this stage to ask others for understanding to help her escape is just too late - far, far too late. Now some Conservative minds are turning to whether she can stay on to have this vote at all. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has dismissed Theresa May\u2019s offer to let MPs have a vote on a second referendum. It has put this statement from the Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett, who supports its campaign. She said: The prime minister\u2019s last-ditch effort to force through her deal is no more likely to succeed than her previous attempts. Today she tried to spice up the same old deal with a series of supposedly new concessions, but then admitted she had no way of guaranteeing that she could deliver any of them. MPs will be rightly weary of offers from a Prime Minister who is about to resign and will probably be replaced by a hard-line successor. It would be very dangerous to vote through a deal to leave the European Union without any clear idea of our eventual destination \u2013 a blindfold Brexit that would only prolong uncertainty for families, businesses and parliament. And her effort to persuade MPs who support a people\u2019s vote that they need to back her or lose the chance to give the public the final say, were contradicted by the prime minister herself when she said that failure to agree her deal could result in a new public vote and the possibility that the UK stayed in the EU. (See 4.27pm.) Rejecting this hotchpotch offer will show once and for all there is no stable majority for any form of Brexit without handing the decision back to the people. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, may be tweeting this as an \u201camusing aside\u201d ... But Theresa May\u2019s offer of a vote on a second referendum does rather contradict Ruth Davidson\u2019s election publicity, which has been loudly proclaiming that a vote for the Scottish Tories means \u201cno more referendums\u201d. Less than 48 hours before the polls open, it can only add to Scottish Tory fears that Nigel Farage is about to halt their resurgence in Scotland. These are from the Tory MP Simon Clarke, another backbencher who is abandoning Theresa May having supported her at MV3, or meaningful vote 3 - the third vote on the withdrawal agreement (which, pedants will remember, the government claimed wasn\u2019t a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, but never mind.) Responding to Theresa May\u2019s speech, Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s leader at Westminster, said the \u201cfundamental flaws\u201d with her deal remained. In a statement he said: We will examine the legislation closely when the bill is finally published but the fundamental flaws of the draft withdrawal agreement treaty itself remain unchanged. Many of the proposals on the backstop serve as an attempt through domestic law to mitigate a bad deal whereas the focus should be on getting a better deal. The only positive vote in the House of Commons on Brexit was the Brady amendment which called for alternative arrangements to the backstop to be implemented in the treaty and other changes to remove the current threats posed by the backstop. That still remains the best way forward to a stable majority in the House of Commons which would deliver Brexit and protect the Union. That is what this or a new prime minister must address. We will have to await the publication of the text of the bill to see what the proposals actually mean but the fact is that the fatal flaws of the draft treaty remain. Ireland welcomed Theresa May\u2019s renewed commitment to uphold the deal struck with the EU in December 2017 to ensure no visible border in Ireland. Her promise to find legally binding \u201calternative arrangements\u201d for the Irish border by the end of 2020 to obviate the need for the backstop was seen as welcome political rhetoric in Ireland \u201cif it helps get the deal over the line\u201d. Neale Richmond, the government party Brexit spokesman in the senate said: We welcome any measures that can see that brought through Westminster as we\u2019ve agreed to bring it through the European structures. The reality is that it is highly unlikely the UK government will come up with an alternative given that the backstop was created to meet the challenges created by Theresa May\u2019s voluntary red lines on the single market and customs union. Lisa Chambers, opposition Brexit spokeswoman, pointed out that people had been trying to find alternatives for the last two years and had been unable. She said: What is the likelihood of alternative arrangements miraculously appearing before the end of 2020? If they existed, you would think they would already be on the table. Here is the statement from Jeremy Corbyn responding to Theresa May\u2019s speech. The prime minister\u2019s proposal tonight seems to be largely a rehash of the government\u2019s position in the cross party talks that failed to reach a compromise last week. On key elements - customs, market alignment and environmental protections - what the prime minister calls her new Brexit deal is effectively a repackaging of the same old bad deal, rejected three times by parliament. We will of course look seriously at the details of the withdrawal agreement bill when it is published. But we won\u2019t back a repackaged version of the same old deal - and it\u2019s clear that this weak and disintegrating government is unable deliver on its own commitments. Theresa May could afford to lose some Tory MPs who previously backed her agreement if, at the same time, she were picking up more Labour MPs. But there is no evidence that she is. If anything, it\u2019s the opposite. The Labour MP Lisa Nandy is one of the backbenchers Downing Street hoped might be won over. Nandy was a strong supporter of the Gareth Snell amendment that the government has adopted. (See 3.51pm.) But, according to ITV\u2019s Paul Brand, Nandy is still opposed to the bill. In a clip for broadcasters Jeremy Corbyn said Labour could not support this bill because it was basically a \u201crehash\u201d of what had been offered before. Here is another Tory MP for Alex Wickham\u2019s list. (See 5.44pm.) BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has found 10 Tory MPs who voted for the deal last time, but who are now going to vote against. Theresa May\u2019s speech is going down badly. Here are three Conservative MPs who all voted for her deal in the third vote on it, at the end of March, who are now going to vote against Andrew Percy From Robert Halfon From Zac Goldsmith Theresa May gave her speech the title \u201cNew Brexit Deal\u201d and in it she identified 10 ways in which she was changing her Brexit offer to MPs. Most of these simply reiterated concessions that have already been announced, at various points, over the last six months. See 3.51pm for a summary of what was already on the table. Perhaps the language on workers\u2019 rights is a bit stronger - today May proposed a workers\u2019 rights bill that \u201cguarantees workers\u2019 rights will be no less favourable than in the EU\u201d - but essentially items 1-7 on her 10-point list (see 4.43pm), and item 10 were already in the bag. But what May said about a second referendum (see 4.59pm) and about customs (see 5.04pm) was new. Here are some thoughts. 1) May has offered MPs a vote on a second referendum - which, in symbolic terms, is quite significant. Until now she firmly resisted the idea the idea that the government might schedule a vote on this, and last week, when cross-party talks broke down, May implied one reason was because Labour was insisting on a second referendum. 2) But, in practical terms, this offer means much less than it sounds. During the EU withdrawal agreement bill\u2019s passage, someone was bound to table an amendment calling for a second referendum, and so all (or almost all) May is doing is timetabling a vote that would have happened anyway. She has not promised Tory MPs a free vote on this. 3) May has also promised to legislate for a referendum if MPs vote for one. The two do not necessarily go together; it was easy to imagine MPs voting for a second referendum, but the government then holding up the legislation required to make it happen. 4) But May did not explain how she would stop a future Conservative leader blocking second referendum legislation, or repealing it. (A new Tory leader should be in office before the autumn, and it is unlikely the Brexit bill would be law by then, even if it passed its second reading. Labour has already said such a bill would need more time.) Given how pro-Brexit the Conservative party membership is, it is hard to imagine anyone getting elected as leader if they sound keen on implementing a second referendum. 5) May\u2019s customs offer is much narrower than her second referendum one. She is not proposing a government vote on a permanent customs union, which is what Labour wants, even though she is proposing a vote on a second referendum. Why? Presumably because, while May must be reasonably confident that the Commons would vote against a second referendum, she must be worried that MPs would back a permanent customs union. (As with the second referendum, there would probably be a vote on this anyway, because Labour would table an amendment. But May is only committing to accept the result if MPs vote for the temporary customs union idea she mentioned in her speech.) 6) May seems to have resolved the question about whether to hold indicative votes before the second reading vote on the bill, or after (assuming it gets defeated) by deciding to hold the indicative votes within the bill. The referendum vote offer and the customs union vote offer seem all that is left of her indicative votes plan. May\u2019s argument to Labour MPs that, if they want a second referendum, they need to vote for her bill is a plausible one. It is a case that Nick Boles MPs was making powerfully at the end of last week. But, with opposition to her deal already so entrenched, it feels as if she may have left it too late. And this is what May said in her speech on customs. Now the government has already put a proposal which delivers the benefits of a customs union but with the ability for the UK to determine its own trade and development policy. Labour are both sceptical of our ability to negotiate that and don\u2019t believe an independent trade policy is in the national interest. They would prefer a comprehensive customs union - with a UK say in EU trade policy but with the EU negotiating on our behalf. If we are going to pass the withdrawal agreement bill and deliver Brexit, we must resolve this difference. As part of the cross-party discussions the government offered a compromise option of a temporary customs union on goods only, including a UK say in relevant EU trade policy and an ability to change the arrangement, so a future government could move it in its preferred direction. We were not able to agree this as part of our cross-party talks \u2013 so it is right that parliament should have the opportunity to resolve this during the passage of the bill and decide between the government\u2019s proposal and a compromise option. This is what May said in her speech about a second referendum. For the record, this is what she said about a second referendum I have also listened carefully to those who have been arguing for a Second Referendum. I have made my own view clear on this many times. I do not believe this is a route that we should take, because I think we should be implementing the result of the first referendum, not asking the British people to vote in a second one. But I recognise the genuine and sincere strength of feeling across the house on this important issue. The government will therefore include in the withdrawal agreement bill at introduction a requirement to vote on whether to hold a second referendum. This must take place before the withdrawal agreement can be ratified. And if the House of Commons were to vote for a referendum, it would be requiring the government to make provisions for such a referendum \u2013 including legislation if it wanted to ratify the withdrawal agreement. So to those MPs who want a second referendum to confirm the deal: you need a deal and therefore a withdrawal agreement bill to make it happen. Here is the section from May\u2019s speech in which she summed up her offer as a 10-point plan. So our New Brexit Deal makes a ten-point offer to everyone in Parliament who wants to deliver the result of the referendum. One - the government will seek to conclude alternative arrangements to replace the backstop by December 2020, so that it never needs to be used. Two - a commitment that, should the backstop come into force, the government will ensure that Great Britain will stay aligned with Northern Ireland. Three - the negotiating objectives and final treaties for our future relationship with the EU will have to be approved by MPs. Four - a new workers\u2019 rights bill that guarantees workers\u2019 rights will be no less favourable than in the EU. Five - there will be no change in the level of environmental protection when we leave the EU. Six - the UK will seek as close to frictionless trade in goods with the EU as possible while outside the single market and ending free movement. Seven - we will keep up to date with EU rules for goods and agri-food products that are relevant to checks at border protecting the thousands of jobs that depend on just-in-time supply chains. Eight - the government will bring forward a customs compromise for MPs to decide on to break the deadlock. Nine - there will be a vote for MPs on whether the deal should be subject to a referendum. And ten \u2013 there will be a legal duty to secure changes to the political declaration to reflect this new deal. All of these commitments will be guaranteed in law \u2013 so they will endure at least for this parliament. Q: Some of your MPs seem to be opposed to this because it is you asking them to back it. What do you say to those who say you should step aside now? May says this is not about her. If it were about her, the UK would be leaving, she says. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: You came into office committed to delivering Brexit and to bring the Tories together. How successful have you been? May says she admitted in her speech she has not delivered Brexit. Q: If MPs vote for a confirmatory referendum, will it happen? And if MPs vote to stay in a customs union permanently, will you implement that? May says she is not proposing a vote on a permanent customs union. She is proposing one on a temporary customs union. A future government would then be able to decide what happened in the future. Q: Will you publish the bill before the recess? May says it will be published \u201cin the next few days\u201d. May says EU withdrawal agreement bill will be published shortly. Q: Do you want a Brexiter to replace you, or will that just prolong the conflict? Nice try, says May. She says she will not comment on the leadership contest. That is a matter for the Conservative party. May is now taking questions. Q: The opposition parties say they will not vote for this. Isn\u2019t this too late? May urges MPs to look at the detail of the bill. It will be published, she says. She has compromised, she says. Q: If you lose the vote, can you confirm you will resign? That was last week\u2019s news, says May. She made a statement with the chair of the 1922 Committee. May says this deal will set the groundwork for life outside the EU. But in future, Britain will be able to choose how it develops. Some will want it to move closer to the EU. Others will want it to move further away. Future governments will be able to decide, she says. She says over the next two weeks the government will try to get MPs to back this deal. Tomorrow she will make a statement to MPs, she says. She says she has compromised. It is up to MPs to compromise too, she says. May says this is a great time to be alive. Britain can make a success of the 2020s and 2030s. But it will not do that if it remains stuck in the Brexit impasse, she says. She says, with the right Brexit deal, she can end this debate. She says the UK will have opportunities outside the EU. And it will be able to do even more if it has a deal. It can protect trade, and protect security partnerships. This is a huge opportunity for the UK, she says - out of the EU, out of every closer union, free to do things differently. May says this opportunity is practical and deliverable. But it is \u201cslipping away from us\u201d, she says. May says, if MPs approve her deal, they can get Brexit done. May says, if MPs vote down the bill, they will be voting to reject Brexit. Some MPs think there will be a no-deal Brexit. But parliament will do everything it can to stop that. So in practice MPs will be choosing a second referendum or a general election, she says. May says MPs will be left with second referendum or general election if they vote down her deal. May sums up the changes she is announcing. There are 10 of them. (I will post the list in full later.) Turning to the issue of a second referendum, May says she is opposed. But she recognises that some MPs want one. May says her Brexit bill will include a requirement to hold a vote on whether or not to have a second referendum. May says this means, if MPs want a second referendum, they must vote for the bill. May says customs is the most difficult area. She says many people who voted to leave want to retain close trading links with the EU, just as many who voted remain, like herself, are excited by the trade opportunities offered by Brexit. May says the government and opposition both want \u201cas close as possible to frictionless trade\u201d at the EU border. She says the government has its own plan. (She seems to be referring to the facilitated customs arrangement plan.) Labour wants a customs union, she says. She says the government offered a temporary customs arrangement. Labour and the government could not agree. So parliament should resolve this, she says. May says government will let parliament decide what to do about customs. May says she is committed to maintaining workers\u2019 rights. There will be a new workers\u2019 rights bill to ensure workers get rights that are very bit as good as, or better than, EU rights. There will be a new office to uphold environmental standards. She says the new bill will oblige the government to keep trade in goods with the EU as frictionless as possible. May says she backed the plan from Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell, two Labour MPs, for MPs to have to approve the negotiating terms for the UK-EU trade deals. May says she tried to reach a deal with Labour. Those talks did not succeed, but she will not give up. She has listened to MPs, and today she is making a serious offer to MPs. She says she wants the Conservative party to stay united. Nine out of 10 Conservative MPs have agreed the deal. She says MPs backed the Brady amendment. May says she will put the government under a legal obligation to seek alternative arrangements to the backstop by December 2020. May says she will also legislate to stop a future government splitting Northern Ireland off from Britain in regulatory terms. May says delivering Brexit has proved \u201ceven harder than I anticipated\u201d. She says the way to deliver Brexit is to deliver a good deal with the EU. That is what she proposed in her pitch for the Conservative leadership, and in her 2017 election manifesto. Labour\u2019s said much the same, she says. She says she has tried hard to deliver this. At first she tried to deliver this with Conservative votes. She even offered to give up the job she loved. She says at the end of March if just 30 MPs had voted differently, the Brexit deal would have passed. Theresa May is speaking now. She say her job was and is to deliver Brexit. And she wants a country that works for everyone, she says. From the Independent\u2019s Andrew Woodcock From my colleague Heather Stewart The European parliament will investigate Nigel Farage for failing to declare lavish expenses funded by Arron Banks, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. Theresa May is due to start delivering her Brexit speech any minute now. She is speaking at a venue in London. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. From Sky\u2019s Jon Craig This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. In her speech this afternoon Theresa May is expected to argue that the version of her Brexit deal contained in the EU withdrawal agreement bill is a new one because of the various changes and concessions it contains. But in fact May and the government have already announced multiple minor amendments to her Brexit offer since MPs started debating it before Christmas to address the concerns of her critics. It is not clear yet whether she will be unveiling proposals that are genuinely new, or whether she will just be aggregating what it already on the table. Here is a summary of what has already been offered On Ireland and the backstop On 9 January, when MPs resumed the first debate on the Brexit deal, the government said it was accepting an amendment from the Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire imposing six new conditions in relation to Northern Ireland and the backstop. They included MPs having the right to decide whether to trigger the backstop, or extend the transition instead, and, in the event of the backstop being introduced, the government having a duty \u201cto have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements one year after the Northern Ireland backstop coming into force\u201d. On the same day the government published plans for what it described as the \u201cStormont lock\u201d (pdf). It runs to 13 pages and it includes proposals for the Northern Ireland assembly to have a \u201cstrong role\u201d in backstop provisions becoming law, and for there to be no regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in mattes covered by the backstop. At the end of January, in a Brexit debate after the deal was voted down for the first time, the government accepted an amendment from the Tory MP Sir Graham Brady saying the Commons required \u201cthe Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d. And in March, in her speech opening the debate when MPs voted on her deal for the second time, May made three specific commitments to legislate to put some of the \u201cStormont lock\u201d measures into law. Workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections In a Brexit debate in January, after her deal was defeated for the first time, May said the government would do more to protect workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards after Brexit. She virtually quoted word for word an amendment tabled by the Labour MP John Mann saying that, if the EU strengthens rights after Brexit, the Commons should also consider whether to match the new Brussels rules. In a letter to Jeremy Corbyn in February, May also said the government was \u201cprepared to commit to asking parliament\u201d if it wanted to match the new EU laws if it beefed up workers\u2019 rights or environmental protection after Brexit. Role of parliament in Brexit trade talks On 29 March, on the day of the third Commons debate on the Brexit deal, the government said it would accept an amendment tabled by the Labour MP Gareth Snell saying MPs would be able to vote to set the negotiating mandate for the next phase of the Brexit talks. By the standards of Conservative in-fighting, this is rather minor, but it still tells you something about the state of the party that MPs are talking about each other in public like this. Here is the Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns in a Twitter spate with two pro-European colleagues, Sir Nicholas Soames and Antoinette Sandbach. Chuka Umunna, the spokesperson for Change UK, had a phone-in with LBC this morning. During the phone-in, he argued that Brexit was to blame for the problems facing British Steel. He explained: Over 20,000 jobs in the supply chain and what are the two reasons which are being cited as creating difficulties for what was a company in profit? First of all the fall of the value of the pound after the referendum vote has made the products that British Steel sells more expensive and this is what the company has said. And, secondly, because of Brexit uncertainty they are not facing the same orders. Umunna also said, if Boris Johnson were to become prime minister, his reaction would be: \u201cGod help us.\u201d He explained: [Johnson is] an incredibly divisive figure. I don\u2019t think a lot of people will forgive him for some of the things that the vote leave campaign did and I think he has shown himself to be a complete opportunist who\u2019s all about Boris Johnson and not about the national interest ... If his record as foreign secretary is anything to go by, that guy should not be allowed anywhere near 10 Downing Street. Today the Guardian has published a long read about how Nigel Farage has modelled his Brexit party on the Italian populist party, the Five Star Movement (M5S). Coincidentally, Farage has told the Press Association that he is tempted not to stand as a candidate in the general election because Beppe Grillo, the M5S leader, did not stand for parliament either. Asked if he would seek a parliamentary seat, Farage said: I guess so. I\u2019ll have to, won\u2019t I? It will be my duty as leader. Although I\u2019m very tempted not to because Beppe Grillo didn\u2019t stand in the Italian elections. What he did was tour Italy supporting the Five Star candidates and, guess what, they won. There are many different ways to approach this. I would see it as my duty to stand but there is an argument that I could do more good for the party by not. This is from Sky\u2019s Kate McCann. In the urgent question in the Commons earlier on British Steel, which is on the brink of collapse putting 5,000 jobs at risk, Andrew Stephenson, the business minister, said the government \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d in supporting the UK steel industry. He said: I can reassure the house that, subject to strict legal bounds, the government will leave no stone unturned in its support for the steel industry ... We can only act within the strict bounds of what is legally possible under domestic and European law. I can assure the house we will continue to do whatever is in our power to support the UK steel industry and those who work in the sector. Stephenson said \u00a3291m has been paid in \u201ccompensation\u201d to the steel sector since 2013 to help make energy costs \u201cmore competitive\u201d. He added: \u201cWe have also published a timeline of upcoming projects every year to enable steel businesses to plan for future demand.\u201d These are from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. Presumbably those four options were the four customs union options set out in this leaked document. The Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole has posted these on what he says are the concessions in the EU withdrawal agreement bill. And here is more from the Number 10 lobby briefing. I posted a snap summary at 1.12pm. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that the EU withdrawal agreement bill, which will be the latest format in which MPs are asked to vote on what has been described as Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, would contain some \u201csignificant new aspects\u201d. He implied that the bill would include compromises from the government. Asked if there would be compromises in it, he said: The prime minister has said that, if we are going to find a way through this, there will have to be compromise on both sides. The spokesman confirmed that today\u2019s cabinet meeting was not just about rubber-stamping a draft text of the bill. The text of the bill is now being finalised on the basis of what was agreed at today\u2019s meeting. The spokesman said the cabinet meeting was characterised by \u201ca clear determination to find a way of passing the withdrawal agreement bill\u201d. This is what he said in response to a question about the tone of today\u2019s meeting. The spokesman sidestepped a question about whether the text of the bill had been agreed unanimously. \u201cYou know how this works,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister sums up at the end of the meeting. Then she will set out the government position.\u201d The spokesman would not say when the text of the bill would be published. But he indicated that that would not happen before Thursday at the earliest. The spokesman said May was making her speech outside the Commons this afternoon because Commons business for the day had already been scheduled. (MPs and the Speaker object when policy announcements of this kind are made outside the chamber, and May will probably come under pressure to make a statement in the Commons tomorrow, where MPs will be able to question her on the details.) The spokesman said the government\u2019s view was that leaving the EU without a deal remained a \u201cplausible outcome\u201d and that planning for no-deal was continuing. When it was put to the spokesman that Philip Hammond, the chancellor, in his CBI speech argues that no-deal would be a betrayal of the 2016 vote to leave (because the leave campaign said there would be a deal - see 9.23am), the spokesman said it was a \u201csimple fact\u201d that the question on the ballot paper was about leaving the EU. The spokesman said that cabinet also discussed President Trump\u2019s state visit. Ministers were told what the programme would be. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. And we have news ... Theresa May will give a speech this afternoon setting out details of what Number 10 is describing as the \u201cnew\u201d Brexit deal that will be put to a vote in the Commons in the first week of June. Cabinet spent two hours discussing the plans, which will be set out in the EU withdrawal agreement bill, and finalising what they will entail. May will say more in her speech at 4pm. Commenting on the cabinet discussion, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: Cabinet discussed the new deal which the government will put before parliament in order to seek to secure the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union. The discussions included alternative arrangements, workers\u2019 rights, environmental protections and further assurances on protecting the integrity of the UK in the unlikely event that the backstop is required. The prime minister said that \u201cthe withdrawal agreement bill is the vehicle that gets the UK out of the European Union and it is vital to find a way to get it over the line.\u201d And the prime minister will be setting out further details on the way forward in a speech this afternoon. I will post more details from the lobby briefing in a moment. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has been using Treasury questions to restate his opposition to a no-deal Brexit, HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh reports. I\u2019m off to the Downing Street lobby briefing now. I will post again after 1pm. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Cabinet has wrapped up after almost three hours. Here are three columns in today\u2019s papers that are worth reading. Rachel Sylvester at the Times (paywall) suggests that if Boris Johnson becomes PM, he could end up agreeing to a second referendum. The interesting question is, if Mr Johnson does get to No 10 will he double down on the right-wing populism that has made him so appealing to the Tory right, or will he betray the Brexiteers who got him elected in an attempt to reconnect with the voters? Will the Tories\u2019 Lord of Misrule do a deal with Nigel Farage or try to win over the One Nation Conservatives who yesterday launched a new grouping in parliament? After the EU elections, the momentum in the Tory leadership contest will be with the hard Brexiteers, but many of those who know Mr Johnson best think he will ultimately back away from taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. One ally describes it as the \u201cNixon to China\u201d strategy for ending the Brexit mess, arguing that only a politician with an unassailable reputation among their supporters can reach an agreement that involves compromise. Some believe he could even back a second referendum to get a mandate without risking his entire premiership on a general election. It is an idea that he has toyed with in the past. When I interviewed him in 2015 he told me he was \u201cvery interested\u201d in a second referendum if people initially voted to Leave as a way of negotiating a better relationship with the EU. \u201cI love our friends and partners in Brussels, I understand quite deeply the way they do things, they are not remotely interested in you unless you tell them no,\u201d he explained. But Polly Toynbee at the Guardian thinks that, if Johnson becomes PM, he will call an early election. What happens when [Johnson] wins? He can\u2019t get no deal through this parliament, but at Halloween the UK is due to crash out willy-nilly, without some deal agreed. The Calais border would clang shut and so would the Irish border, firing up demands for a united Ireland referendum, with the Scots likely to follow suit with Indyref2. As everything seizes up, Britain would have only the feckless Johnson to cope with a pile-up of calamities in fuel, food, medicines, visas, lorry queues and a plunging pound. Johnson has no plan: his foresight goes no further than winning the prize of Downing Street. If he had the impulse control to visualise consequences, would he want to win on a no-deal pledge? Before 31 October, Labour would table a vote of no confidence and Tory One Nation MPs would back it to bring down their own government, and call an election. Seeing that inevitability, Johnson will surely call an election himself, shortly after reaching No 10. At risk of becoming the shortest serving prime minister of all time, he will be tanked up with vaunting hubris. Farage will bid to strip off Tory votes and seats (and some Labour ones too), while the Liberal Democrats syphon away remain and moderate voters. In the best scenario, the Armageddon that awaits may turn out to be the fate of Johnson and the Tory party for years to come, but not of the country as a whole. Robert Shrimsley at the Financial Times (paywall) says the Euro elections campaign shows the remain parties are not ready for a second referendum. For if one thing has emerged from the European parliamentary election in which his party looks set to win the most seats, it is that the forces of remain have some major lessons to learn if they are to have any chance of winning the second referendum for which they are so actively agitating. The stakes may also be higher. Until recently, advocates of a second vote did not expect a no-deal Brexit to be one of the options. It is now hard to imagine how it cannot be. Not only is Mr Farage likely to win this weekend, he has also won the fight to define Brexit as a clean break. He turned the battle into an issue of keeping faith with a democratic vote and positioned himself as the true force for change in the UK. With speed, social media and clarity of purpose, his start-up party has dominated the campaign. Britain\u2019s version of Emmanuel Macron turns out not to be Chuka Umunna and Change UK but Mr Farage and the Brexit party. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand Normally on a Tuesday, when the cabinet is meeting, the regular Downing Street lobby briefing takes place at 12pm. But today\u2019s has been delayed, because cabinet has over-run. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. A disorderly Brexit would threaten the loss of skilled manufacturing jobs and millions of pounds of investment, a new study suggests. As the Press Association reports, research by the GMB union indicated that manufacturing employs 2.5m workers and contributes \u00a3118bn a year to the economy. The industry also supports another five million jobs in areas including the supply chain, said the GMB. GMB national officer Jude Brimble said: These figures show what is at stake in the European elections. The prospect of a chaotic Brexit is sending a chill throughout manufacturing. We have already seen job losses and paused investment in foundational industries such as food manufacturing, car production and ceramics. The situation will only get worse if we end up with a rushed and disorderly Brexit. That\u2019s why it is vital that politicians from all parties rule out a no-deal Brexit that would be devastating for our manufacturing and export industries. And while we\u2019re on the subject of Boris Johnson, LabourList has a survey of more than 4,000 of its readers in which overwhelmingly they name Johnson as the greatest threat to Labour. As Sienna Rodgers reports: With Theresa May set to reveal her departure date next month, the Conservative party is expected to hold a leadership contest over the summer. Asked which of the potential candidates would be most difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to beat in a general election, 45.2% of our readers picked Johnson. Given the opportunity to choose just one candidate, a huge 72% of 4,478 respondents then named the former foreign secretary as the possible Tory leadership contender who \u201cwould be most damaging to the country as prime minister\u201d. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is seen as clearly on the right of the Conservative party, has confirmed that he is backing Boris Johnson for leader (see 10.35am) even though last night Johnson aligned himself firmly with the one nation tradition in the party. He posted this on Twitter. As Jack Blanchard reports in his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe, the timing of Johnson\u2019s tweet made it particularly interesting. Blanchard says: Both Newsnight\u2019s Nick Watt and the Times\u2019 Sam Coates report that dozens of MPs from [Conservative one nation group] could yet throw their weight behind Johnson if he rediscovers the liberal-Tory values that won him two terms as mayor of London. A senior figure involved confirmed this to Playbook. \u201cAren\u2019t we all \u2014 in theory \u2014 Brexiteers now?\u201d the source said. \u201cWe want candidates to work with us to shape policy moving forward. Not just on Brexit but on everything \u2026 The whole contest will be a big test for Boris to prove he actually can unite the party in the way he says he can.\u201d Last night\u2019s TV: Nick Watt broke the story of Boris\u2019 potential new chums on Newsnight at 10.57 p.m. \u201cI understand they are giving very serious consideration to backing a Brexiteer as the next leader of the Conservative party,\u201d Watt said, of the 60-strong group of moderate MPs. \u201cThe thinking is \u2018no\u2019 to somebody like Dominic Raab, because he seems far too keen on a no-deal Brexit, but a possible \u2018yes\u2019 to Boris Johnson. They would essentially be saying to him \u2018look, if you give us an undertaking that you will really try for a deal over about a period of 12 to 18 months, then we would look [at you] very seriously. In other words, if you don\u2019t jump straight into no deal.\u201d Watch the clip. I wonder who was watching? A whole nine minutes later at 11.06 p.m., Johnson was suddenly tweeting his support for the \u201cone nation\u201d manifesto. \u201cAgree with all of this,\u201d Boris announced. \u201cOne nation values have never been more important.\u201d What on earth could have prompted this show of love? These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on today\u2019s cabinet. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, has confirmed that he is backing Boris Johnson for next Conservative leader, talkRadio\u2019s Ross Kempsell reports. The Guardian has just published a long read by Darren Loucaides about how Nigel Farage has modelled the Brexit party on the Italian populist party, the Five Star Movement. Here is an extract. In Milan, Farage was struck by how [Gianroberto] Casaleggio was using social media and the internet to create a new model for political communications. Five Star members were discussing and voting on policy and nominating and electing each other to run for office while being steeped in party propaganda, all on a single online platform. This made supporters feel as if the movement\u2019s identity was emerging organically from their online interactions, while Casaleggio and Grillo could guide those interactions with messaging from above. What\u2019s more, the \u201cmovement\u201d was dominated by a private company owned by Casaleggio. Five Star was in many ways less like a political party than a publicly traded company in which members were voting shareholders, but Casaleggio had the controlling stake ... If Casaleggio\u2019s ambition was to replace parliament with direct democracy, Farage\u2019s ambition seems, in the first instance, to destroy the Conservative party. Farage declined to speak to me for this article, but [Arron] Banks told me that the Brexit party and Leave.EU, which is still very much active, were pursuing a sort of pincer movement on the Tories. (He also denied to me that he is a \u201cmystery donor\u201d to the Brexit party.) \u201cLeave.EU goes behind enemy lines, blowing up their bridges, causing mass mayhem in the Tory party, while the Brexit party can come in head-on, into their face,\u201d he said. And here is the full article. Yesterday David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said that, having voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal in the last Commons debate, at the end of March, he would now revert to voting against it. He said he opposed the EU withdrawal agreement bill because it would tie the hands of May\u2019s successor. Now Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, is also turning against May\u2019s deal. Or, rather, hardening up his opposition to it. He voted against it in the first two votes, but voted in favour at the third opportunity because he was worried that the alternative might be no Brexit. Now, however, he is hinting he will vote against the bill because, like Davis, he does not want it to constrain a new Tory leader. This is from the Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby says there are at least seven ERG members who voted for May\u2019s deal reluctantly at the third opportunity who are now planning to revert to voting against. UPDATE: Here is another quote from the Jacob Rees-Mogg podcast. He said: As we have already delayed, it\u2019s hard to see any point in having a bill which fails to avoid the European elections, fails to get us out on time, fails to get the process going in the way that might have worked with a new leader coming in, because Mrs May said that if it went through she would go. The Electoral Commission has said it will visit the Brexit party offices today to review whether it is complying with electoral law in the way it handles donations. It announced the visit after Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, called for an investigation. Speaking on LBC this morning, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, accused the commission of acting in \u201cbad faith\u201d. He explained: We went to visit them last week. They said we had all the right procedures in place. We asked them for a letter to confirm that, they failed to give it. Now, in an act of bad faith, clearly politically-motivated, despite the fact we had invited them to our offices. Last week, they were two busy to see us. This week, 48 hours before a national election, they are coming into our office. Farage also claimed the established parties were \u201cterrified\u201d of the Brexit party. They are absolutely terrified, because what they are seeing is ... people are saying, not just they will vote for the Brexit party on Thursday in the European election, but a huge percentage of them saying they will do so in a general election. And that\u2019s what\u2019s got [the established parties] scared. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said she expected Labour to vote against Theresa May\u2019s EU withdrawal agreement bill. She said that the bill would be defeated and that it would be like May performing the \u2018last rites\u2019 over her premiership. She said: It\u2019s almost a piece of political theatre. It is almost as though she needs to have a dignified way of leaving. It\u2019s like it\u2019s her moment when she will resign when she doesn\u2019t get this bill through. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s setting up her own political version of the last rites. She does not, she cannot realistically expect to see this get through without fundamental changes and we are not getting fundamental changes, from everything I hear. So we we\u2019re going to vote against it. A man has been charged with common assault and criminal damage after Nigel Farage had a milkshake thrown at him while on a walkabout in Newcastle city centre, the Press Association reports. Theresa May is chairing cabinet this morning, where ministers will discuss the EU withdrawal agreement bill that will get put to a vote in the first week of June. May is trying to construct a Commons majority for her bill. But the cabinet itself is deeply divided, and those divisions have been on full display this morning. Philip Hammond, the chancellor and probably the leading pro-European in government, has been arguing for a long time that a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster. But tonight he is escalating his campaign against that option, with a speech to the CBI annual dinner in London in which he will dismiss this as a plan being championed by the \u201cpopulist right\u201d that would be both economically damaging and politically illegitimate. According to an extract released in advance, he will say: On the populist right, there are those who now claim that the only outcome that counts as a truly legitimate Brexit is to leave with no deal. Let me remind them: the 2016 Leave campaign was clear that we would leave with a deal. So to advocate for no deal is to hijack the result of the referendum, and in doing so, knowingly to inflict damage on our economy and our living standards. Because all the preparation in the world will not avoid the consequences of no deal. So I will continue to fight, in the face of this polarisation, for a negotiated Brexit - an outcome that respects the British people\u2019s decision to leave, while recognising that there is no mandate for a no-deal exit, and that we have an absolute obligation to protect Britain\u2019s jobs, businesses and future prosperity. But we need to be clear that if we do not resolve this issue in the next few weeks, there is a real risk of a new prime minister abandoning the search for a deal, and shifting towards seeking a damaging no-deal exit as a matter of policy ... to protect an ideological position which ignores the reality of Britain\u2019s economic interests and the value of our union. As the Times reports in its splash, this is being seen as a pre-emptive attack on Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary who is the favourite in the forthcoming Tory leadership contest. Johnson and other Brexiters have argued that a no-deal Brexit would be acceptable. But this morning, in an interview on the Today programme, Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter leader of the Commons, rejected Hammond\u2019s argument. A no-deal Brexit should be an option, she said. She told the programme: I continue to support the prime minister to get her withdrawal agreement through. It is leaving the European Union and, so long as it continue to be leaving the European Union, I continue to support it. What I do think is for any negotiation to succeed, you have to be prepared to walk away. And, in addition, the legal default position is that on 31 October the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal. I would like us to have a deal. I think it\u2019s very important that we do. But, in the event that we get to the end of October and it\u2019s not possible to get a deal, I think leaving the European Union is the most important thing of all, delivering on the will of the people. As a democrat, that is what we have to do. Leadsom was responding to a question about whether she would be willing to accept no-deal \u201cwhen\u201d she ran for Tory leader. She did not challenge the premise of the question, implicitly confirming that she will be a candidate. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 10am: Education ministers Nick Gibb and Nadhim Zahawin give evidence to the Commons education committee on special educational needs. 10am: The MPs Anna Soubry and Wes Streeting give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about Islamophobia. 10.30am: Sharon White, the head of Ofcom, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee. 11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: MPs begin debating the parliamentary buildings (restoration and renewal) bill. 1pm: Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, gives a speech. At some point today the Electoral Commission is visiting the Brexit party offices to review whether it complies with electoral law on donations. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "body": "<p>We are writers. We are your writers, the United Kingdom\u2019s writers. We write the TV shows on UK screens and the books on UK shelves. We are part of the bubbling soup of the creative industries \u2013 along with games, film, theatre and the rest \u2013 which together are worth \u00a310m an hour to this country. In fact, the UK publishes more books per head than any other nation on Earth, and millions of UK citizens believe they will one day join us and write the book they have inside them \u2013 and lots of them will.</p> <p>That is possible in part because books printed here, in English, can be sold into Europe as easily as at home. Exports account for 60% of UK publishing revenues, and 36% of physical book exports go to Europe, and that is only the most straightforward concern about what will happen. It\u2019s fashionable among politicians to sneer at the creative industries, but our work is work just like anyone else\u2019s, and like anyone else\u2019s it can only happen if we get paid. Without any idea of what Brexit might look like, it\u2019s impossible to know exactly what we might lose. A tenth? A fifth? A third of what we live on? We\u2019ll have to make compromises. Should we ditch part of the beginning, the middle, or the end of the story? Would audiences prefer not to know whose fault it all is, how the crime was solved, or who\u2019s still standing at the end?</p> <p>In TV it\u2019s even starker; rules on tax funding for production could mean we\u2019re simply excluded from projects filming in Europe. And that\u2019s already happening as companies \u2013 from the US and elsewhere, not just from the EU \u2013 prepare for Brexit. It\u2019s not just writers. It\u2019s whole crews: carpenters, props, sparks and riggers. It\u2019s our globally renowned visual effects industry being thrown on the fire.</p> <p>It seems to us that the same question is facing every industry and every person in the UK: what will you choose to lose? Because we used to hear about the advantages of Brexit. We used to hear about the bright future, the extra money, the opportunities. Now the advocates of Brexit just assure us that it won\u2019t be as bad as the last world war.</p> <p>What will we choose to lose from the NHS? Apart from one in 10 doctors and thousands of nurses? What will the north-east choose to lose? Apart from 10,000 jobs already. What will the British car industry choose to lose? Apart from Honda and Nissan and the other companies which have already gone. What will science choose to lose? Apart from funding, staff and investment? What will farming choose to lose? Apart from 97% of our export market for lamb, and this summer\u2019s fruit crop.</p> <p>We are the people who spend our lives making things that are not true seem believable, and we don\u2019t think Brexit is even a good effort. In the elections for the European parliament, and the referendum which seems almost inevitable, we want to urge everyone to vote to stay in the EU \u2013 unless they know what they are choosing to lose, for themselves and everyone they know, and are happy with that. We choose a better environment, better healthcare, better food, more working protections, bigger markets, more jobs. We choose friendship and peace and better days.

      "bodyText": "We are writers. We are your writers, the United Kingdom\u2019s writers. We write the TV shows on UK screens and the books on UK shelves. We are part of the bubbling soup of the creative industries \u2013 along with games, film, theatre and the rest \u2013 which together are worth \u00a310m an hour to this country. In fact, the UK publishes more books per head than any other nation on Earth, and millions of UK citizens believe they will one day join us and write the book they have inside them \u2013 and lots of them will. That is possible in part because books printed here, in English, can be sold into Europe as easily as at home. Exports account for 60% of UK publishing revenues, and 36% of physical book exports go to Europe, and that is only the most straightforward concern about what will happen. It\u2019s fashionable among politicians to sneer at the creative industries, but our work is work just like anyone else\u2019s, and like anyone else\u2019s it can only happen if we get paid. Without any idea of what Brexit might look like, it\u2019s impossible to know exactly what we might lose. A tenth? A fifth? A third of what we live on? We\u2019ll have to make compromises. Should we ditch part of the beginning, the middle, or the end of the story? Would audiences prefer not to know whose fault it all is, how the crime was solved, or who\u2019s still standing at the end? In TV it\u2019s even starker; rules on tax funding for production could mean we\u2019re simply excluded from projects filming in Europe. And that\u2019s already happening as companies \u2013 from the US and elsewhere, not just from the EU \u2013 prepare for Brexit. It\u2019s not just writers. It\u2019s whole crews: carpenters, props, sparks and riggers. It\u2019s our globally renowned visual effects industry being thrown on the fire. It seems to us that the same question is facing every industry and every person in the UK: what will you choose to lose? Because we used to hear about the advantages of Brexit. We used to hear about the bright future, the extra money, the opportunities. Now the advocates of Brexit just assure us that it won\u2019t be as bad as the last world war. What will we choose to lose from the NHS? Apart from one in 10 doctors and thousands of nurses? What will the north-east choose to lose? Apart from 10,000 jobs already. What will the British car industry choose to lose? Apart from Honda and Nissan and the other companies which have already gone. What will science choose to lose? Apart from funding, staff and investment? What will farming choose to lose? Apart from 97% of our export market for lamb, and this summer\u2019s fruit crop. We are the people who spend our lives making things that are not true seem believable, and we don\u2019t think Brexit is even a good effort. In the elections for the European parliament, and the referendum which seems almost inevitable, we want to urge everyone to vote to stay in the EU \u2013 unless they know what they are choosing to lose, for themselves and everyone they know, and are happy with that. We choose a better environment, better healthcare, better food, more working protections, bigger markets, more jobs. We choose friendship and peace and better days. We choose Europe.

Populist parties are expected to take up to a third of the parliamentary seats in Thursday\u2019s vote, with Matteo Salvini\u2019s League in contention to be the largest single party, and Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) overtaking Emmanuel Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche in some polls. Cooperation among the fractious far-right forces is far from assured, but those at the centre of an alliance Salvini is trying to craft with Le Pen, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s Law and Justice party (PiS) in Poland view climate action as a potential barrier to fossil fuel-led growth. With key decisions looming on EU emissions targets, fears are growing that rightwingers could block or water down EU climate action. Alexander Carius, the director of the Berlin-based Adelphi Institute thinktank, said: \u201cClimate policy is going to be the new battleground between the democratic centre and rightwing populists attacking institutions and questioning the scientific foundation of decision-making.

The extreme-right Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) bloc had the most negative voting record of any grouping in the last parliament on 22 climate proposals analysed in the study. Salvini\u2019s League voted against almost all key climate proposals in the last parliament, while RN rejects the United Nations framework convention on climate change as a \u201ccommunist project\u201d. Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, like Ukip in the UK, denies climate change, arguing that \u201cCO2 is not a pollutant, but an indispensable component of all life\u201d. The RN has adopted a green patriotism stance, prioritising a localism vision of Europe as \u201cthe first ecological civilisation\u201d over emissions reductions. The party strongly opposes wind energy. Last week, French politicians demanded an inquiry into links between Le Pen\u2019s RN and Donald Trump\u2019s electoral strategist, Steve Bannon, who has described wind turbines as \u201cbird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes\u201d. The backdrop to the EU poll has been one of escalating school climate strikes and protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion. Surveys show more than three-quarters of Europeans want politicians to prioritise the climate crisis. But populists have profited from the backlash created when such action has targeted poorer constituencies. Many environmental NGOs believe the greater threat to climate policy comes from centrist and traditional hard-right parties, which have a weak climate record. The Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout said that although the climate crisis would become a more polarised debate in the next parliament, \u201cthe real challenge will be with the Christian Democratic right\u201d. \u201cThe European People\u2019s party usually does deals with the Socialists and Democrats but that will likely not be possible this time, as those two blocs won\u2019t have a majority.

      "body": "<p>One day in January 2015, Nigel Farage gave his senior adviser, Raheem Kassam, an unusual bit of news. \u201cOn Monday, we\u2019re going to Milano,\u201d he said. (Farage always pronounced it \u201cMil-<em>ar</em>-no\u201d, much to Kassam\u2019s amusement.) \u201cI was like: \u2018What? Why?\u2019\u201d Kassam said. Farage, who was then the leader of the anti-European Union party Ukip, explained that they were going to sit down with Gianroberto Casaleggio. Kassam whipped out his phone and quickly Googled \u201cCasaleggio\u201d \u2013 he had never heard of him.</p> <p>Farage described Casaleggio to Kassam as the \u201cgenius behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\" title=\"\">Five Star</a>\u201d, the Italian political party that won a 25% vote share in 2013, the first national elections it had ever contested. Nothing like this had happened before in modern Italian politics. Casaleggio and the comedian Beppe Grillo, who was famous in Italy for his rabble-rousing live shows, had founded the movement just four years earlier. They had largely built the Five Star Movement online, with remarkably little money or mainstream media attention.</p> <p>Five Star was only one step toward Casaleggio\u2019s long-term ambition: to supplant parliament with an online democracy where citizens, highly informed through the internet, could fashion policy directly. Farage had \u201calways been interested\u201d in direct democracy, Kassam said, and in \u201cturning everything over to the internet\u201d. But Farage was more impressed by the fact that, after just a few years, Casaleggio\u2019s largely online movement was on the verge of becoming Italy\u2019s biggest political party. He wanted to know how Casaleggio had done it \u2013 and then to replicate its success.</p> <p>In Milan, Farage was struck by how Casaleggio was using social media and the internet to create a new model for political communications. Five Star members were discussing and voting on policy and nominating and electing each other to run for office while being steeped in party propaganda, all on a single online platform. This made supporters feel as if the movement\u2019s identity was emerging organically from their online interactions, while Casaleggio and Grillo could guide those interactions with messaging from above. What\u2019s more, the \u201cmovement\u201d was dominated by a private company owned by Casaleggio. Five Star was in many ways less like a political party than a publicly traded company in which members were voting shareholders, but Casaleggio had the controlling stake.</p> <p>Farage left Milan \u201cvery excited\u201d about bringing Five Star\u2019s style of digital democracy to the UK, Kassam said. So did Farage\u2019s ally Liz Bilney, who was also present at the Milan meeting and went on to found the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU. \u201cIf I was starting Ukip today,\u201d Farage told the political scientists Matthew Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo around that time, \u201cwould I spend 20 years speaking to people in village halls or would I base it on the Grillo model? I know exactly what I would do.\u201d Farage and his colleagues in the Brexit movement had been converted.</p> <p>The Milan meeting represented a surprising new alignment in European politics \u2013 between Farage\u2019s blokey nationalism and the digitally savvy direct democracy of the ostensibly left-leaning Five Star Movement. Over the next four years, Farage would apply the lessons he learned from Casaleggio first to the Brexit referendum and then to a new party of his own, pursuing his own political goals under the guise of direct democracy. Although Casaleggio died of brain cancer in 2016, his son, Davide, and Grillo continued to steer the Five Star Movement towards the populist right, pushing eurosceptic messages about sovereignty and immigration. Today, Five Star is the largest party in the Italian parliament and governs in an alliance with the far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/09/how-matteo-salvini-pulled-italy-to-the-far-right\" title=\"\">Lega party</a>.</p> <p>\u201cCasaleggio was looking down the line,\u201d Claudio Messora, a popular blogger who was head of communications in Five Star\u2019s Brussels office, told me. \u201cHe predicted a Five Star government in Italy and a Nigel Farage government in London \u2013 and so a new Rome-London axis.\u201d This axis would be united over its opposition to the establishment, both domestically and in the EU.</p> <p>But the Milan meeting was also an important moment in a larger shift: toward the emergence of a new form of populism, in which demagogues use digital tools and corporate structures to direct mass movements. \u201cAs long as you are liking them, as long as you\u2019re a fan, as long as you follow them, they don\u2019t need really to account for what they do,\u201d said Paolo Gerbaudo, an Italian political sociologist at King\u2019s College London who studies how political parties use the internet. He added: \u201cWhat users/members/customers are given is basically a window-dressing of participation.\u201d</p> <p>In March 2019, three months after leaving Ukip, his political home of 25 years, Farage launched the Brexit party. Ditching the tweed suits and pints of bitter that were his signature during the Ukip years, Farage has set out to lead a modern political movement. Farage\u2019s new party has embraced slick digital ads and promised to save democracy by giving power back to the people. Supporters can apply to be candidates via an online portal, and the party has jettisoned traditional structures and hierarchies. Similarly to how Five Star is structured, the Brexit party is a registered company striving to look like a web-based mass movement \u2013 but it is controlled from the top by Farage.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brexit party is the virtual carbon copy of the Five Star Movement,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/arron-banks\" title=\"\">Arron Banks</a>, Farage\u2019s long-time supporter and collaborator, told me. \u201cWhat the Five Star did, and what the Brexit party is doing, is having a tightly controlled central structure, almost a dictatorship at the centre,\u201d he went on. \u201cIf you have a tightly controlled structure, then the crazies can\u2019t take over.\u201d</p> <p>The Brexit party\u2019s Facebook page already has 120,000 followers, almost five times more than the new remain-supporting party Change UK, and it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/18/labour-panic-remain-voters-switch-to-lib-dems\" title=\"\">several points ahead</a> of the other UK parties in European election polls. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the growth of the Five Star Movement, from its inception, with absolute fascination,\u201d Farage recently told the Telegraph, adding: \u201cLook at what we\u2019re already doing in four weeks \u2013 we\u2019re doing the same kind of thing.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By the mid-2000s, it had come to seem obvious to the man behind Five Star\u2019s philosophy that representative democracy was past its sell-by date. Casaleggio believed this outmoded form of government was destined to be replaced by a global web-based democracy that removed the pesky middle-men of politics \u2013 politicians themselves. \u201cHe had this very strong conviction, this belief, that the internet was all about disintermediation,\u201d said Filippo Pittarello, a former employee of Casaleggio who now works in Five Star\u2019s Brussels office. No longer would shops stand between consumers and producers, publishers between readers and authors, bankers between investors and entrepreneurs. \u201cEvery single aspect of the organisation of society that was not direct would be disrupted by the internet,\u201d Pittarello continued. \u201cSo why not politics?\u201d</p> <p>In 2005, through a blog fronted by Grillo, <a href=\"http://www.beppegrillo.it/\" title=\"\">beppegrillo.it</a>, Casaleggio put this philosophy into practice. The blog dispensed what Casaleggio and Grillo called \u201ccounter-information\u201d as an antidote to the \u201cfake news\u201d they said was peddled by the traditional media, which was dominated in Italy by the seemingly immovable prime minister and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi. The blog also invited readers to debate the country\u2019s countless problems.</p> <p>It was ostensibly out of this online discussion that Five Star\u2019s original policy positions emerged when the party formally launched in 2009: renewable energy, sustainable transport, internet access for all and a universal basic income. Although the party claimed to be neither right nor leftwing, Five Star\u2019s policies attracted many supporters disillusioned with the Italian left, which, like Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour, had swung to the centre. Five Star\u2019s central message was its condemnation of what it saw as the country\u2019s overpaid, corrupt political establishment \u2013 right and left alike.</p> <p>By putting an online platform at the heart of its operations, Five Star was way ahead of other political parties in Italy \u2013 many of which barely had a functioning website. As the movement grew, the party seemed to entrust an increasing number of decisions to party members through online ballots and crowdsourced policies. At the same time, many Five Star members treated Grillo\u2019s blog as an oracle of truth. As a result, Casaleggio, who created and managed the blog, could use it to exert enormous sway over the movement.</p> <p>Casaleggio \u201cwas more a man of the right than the left\u201d, said Claudio Messora, who first met Casaleggio in 2008. \u201cIn terms of the political animal he was, he was definitely predisposed in that direction.\u201d Several friends and former staff of Casaleggio told me that he was against open immigration and that he strongly disliked Italy\u2019s left. Casaleggio claimed his politics were neither fascist nor socialist, but in fact they seemed to revere both the imperial and the revolutionary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3faf0d73ac2ca38f68905d938d885b25f77d4936\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3faf0d73ac2ca38f68905d938d885b25f77d4936/0_255_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Serrano/Agf/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a video he made in 2008 called Gaia: The Future of Politics, he imagined a world in which the shadowy conspiracies that currently rule the world \u2013 freemasons, the Bilderberg Group and so forth \u2013 would succumb to an era of worldwide internet democracy. At the same time, the video imagined the annihilation of billions of people following a total war, and held up Genghis Khan\u2019s horseback courier network and Mussolini\u2019s radio broadcasts as examples of the great march of disintermediation.</p> <p>Compared to Casaleggio\u2019s vision of a future without parliaments, Farage\u2019s embrace of direct democracy was more limited \u2013 it largely boiled down to crusading for the referendum on British membership of the EU. At the time of Five Star\u2019s launch in 2009, the main thing the two parties seemed to have in common was a taste for anti-establishment rhetoric. Both parties blamed political elites for the deepening financial crisis, which had caused unemployment to soar in Italy as well as the UK, and capitalised on the public\u2019s growing mistrust of mainstream parties. But despite their outward differences, the parties that Casaleggio and Farage built influenced one another and grew in similar directions.</p> <p>\u201cThe way Casaleggio saw it, the messaging and how Five Star won support was similar to Farage,\u201d Messora said. Both parties claimed to be struggling against entrenched powers and taking back control for the people. Farage claimed referendums could address the disconnect between politicians and ordinary people and argued for the right of recall, whereby constituents would have more power to force out their MP. Five Star called itself a \u201cmovement of citizens\u201d; Farage said Ukip\u2019s supporters were the \u201cPeople\u2019s Army\u201d.</p> <p>Both movements were also moulded around strong, sometimes ostentatiously crude personalities. Footage from the European parliament doesn\u2019t tend to go viral, but videos of Farage\u2019s floor speeches got hundreds of thousands of views and attracted the attention of Casaleggio and Grillo. \u201cYou have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk,\u201d Farage said in a tirade at the new European council president Herman Van Rompuy in 2010. \u201cWho are you? I\u2019d never heard of you. No one in Europe had ever heard of you!\u201d For his part, in 2007, Grillo held a series of \u201cV Day\u201d rallies at which he and his followers shouted <em>vaffanculo!</em> \u2013 \u201cgo fuck yourself!\u201d \u2013 at the political establishment. (The rallies were meticulously planned by Casaleggio in Milan.)</p> <p>Grillo and Farage saw each other as kindred spirits. \u201cI\u2019ve followed him online,\u201d Grillo told CNBC in 2013. \u201cHe is an extraordinary orator \u2026 a real eurosceptic.\u201d David Cameron had recently promised an EU referendum for the first time, bringing Farage\u2019s decades-long campaign closer to fruition. \u201cThis looks to me like real democracy,\u201d Grillo remarked. Farage praised Five Star and Grillo, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s modern,\u201d Farage told journalist Alessio Pisan\u00f2 a couple of months after Grillo\u2019s CNBC interview. \u201cIt was a protest movement to begin with, but what I\u2019ve been observing is that he\u2019s been developing a narrative, a story, which is very, very eurosceptic.\u201d</p> <p>Farage also admired the way Five Star\u2019s appeal to disaffected voters on the left had helped it during Italy\u2019s 2013 general election. Ahead of the 2014 European elections, Farage believed that Ukip could win a majority of Britain\u2019s seats if the party reached beyond the right-left divide. In an attempt to appeal to Labour\u2019s northern heartlands, Farage combined his usual message \u2013 about EU idiocy and waste \u2013 with talk of how industrial communities had been left behind. But he also stoked fears about immigration and said the EU\u2019s free-movement policy was a threat to national sovereignty. Five Star took no official position on immigration, but Grillo was increasingly critical of the EU and blogposts on beppegrillo.it began to talk about \u201csovereignty\u201d, too.</p> <p>In 2014, Ukip and Five Star formed a new, anti-establishment bloc in the European parliament. Farage thought the two parties \u201ccould have fun causing a lot of trouble for Brussels\u201d. The new coalition \u2013 which also included a smattering of MEPs from the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats and other smaller eurosceptic parties, as well as a rebel MEP from Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front (now National Rally) \u2013 was presented as a \u201cloose alliance\u201d that existed merely to give each party more individual sway within the EU. (\u201cBeing outside an official group meant counting for nothing,\u201d Messora explained. \u201cIt would mean no money, no time speaking in the chamber.\u201d) But it was more than a marriage of convenience. Five Star and Farage increasingly shared a philosophy. Soon they would share an electoral strategy as well.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Five Star\u2019s unofficial headquarters at the time of its rapid growth was on Via Morone, a quiet street in an exclusive district in the heart of Milan. Here, behind a set of heavy wooden doors, was the home of Casaleggio Associates, the private company through which Gianroberto Casaleggio and then his son, Davide, orchestrated the party\u2019s electoral successes.</p> <p>Although Casaleggio designed Five Star to look like a member-led movement, he set the party\u2019s course from the beginning. Casaleggio Associates not only managed Grillo\u2019s blog; today it also runs Five Star\u2019s digital operations and controls the valuable data being generated on Five Star\u2019s online platform by the party\u2019s snowballing membership. According to two recent investigations by the Italian data protection authority, the Five Star digital platform <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/davide-casaleggio-5stars-rousseau-platform-lashes-out-over-political-motivated-data-protection-fine/\" title=\"\">was breaching</a> European data protection laws by tracking Five Star members in individually identifiable ways.</p> <p>Casaleggio was far ahead of other political parties in using this data to help shape Five Star\u2019s messaging, which he fed back to supporters through Grillo\u2019s blog, and increasingly through social media. The very tools that were supposedly giving members control over the movement were allowing Casaleggio to exert control over them. With a thoughtfully crafted blogpost, he could intervene in the movement\u2019s internal debates, bolstering certain positions and dampening others down. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a long-time project of social engineering, using the web,\u201d said Jacopo Iacoboni, who has written two books on Five Star\u2019s rise. The first detailed how Casaleggio had begun to experiment with manipulating online consensus back in the 1990s, as the CEO of an Italian tech company that sold business tools for managing employees. He believes the way Five Star has used data is far more radical, in some ways, than what had happened in the Trump or Brexit campaigns. \u201cIn the UK and with Trump, the campaigns were, at least formally, separated from the web company running their data \u2013 think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a>, Aggregate IQ,\u201d Iacoboni said. But the Five Star case is unique, he said: \u201cA web company which creates a party, with the owner directly possessing all the data.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"75dc76ae8688df532ee0127faf02ee218b027b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75dc76ae8688df532ee0127faf02ee218b027b75/0_59_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy\u2019s deputy prime ministers Luigi Di Maio of Five Star Movement, left, and Matteo Salvini of Lega in Rome earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy\u2019s deputy prime ministers Luigi Di Maio of Five Star Movement, left, and Matteo Salvini of Lega in Rome earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio Frustaci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the most dramatic example of the top-down control that Casaleggio exerted over the movement was the way he choreographed the party\u2019s decision in 2014 to align with Ukip in the European parliament. Many observers and even members of the party had assumed that Five Star was ultimately a progressive movement, so when the possibility of allying with Ukip came up, many Five Star members were appalled. \u201cFarage\u2019s party disgusts me,\u201d Giulia Sarti, one of Five Star\u2019s MPs, told the Italian newspaper La Stampa. Many vocal Five Star members wanted to ally with the Greens instead.</p> <p>On Grillo\u2019s blog, Casaleggio responded with a deluge of posts idolising Farage and criticising the Greens. One post rather fantastically claimed that Ukip, too, was essentially a progressive movement, which rejected any form of \u201cracism, sexism or xenophobia\u201d \u2013 even though Ukip members with offensive views had poured out of the woodwork in that year\u2019s European elections. Another post argued that Ukip had a \u201ccoherent and principled opposition to foreign imperialist wars\u201d in contrast to \u201cthe leaders of the Greens and the liberals, who screamed in favour of the war in Libya\u201d. Ukip\u2019s campaign for a referendum on EU membership was heralded as an example of its support for direct democracy.</p> <p>True to its supposed values, Five Star put to an online ballot the final decision on which European alliance to join. But the post that introduced that ballot left little doubt as to which way members were expected to vote. \u201cIt was clearly in favour of the Ukip solution,\u201d Marco Zanni, who had been elected as a Five Star MEP that May, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a real democratic referendum.\u201d In the end, about 80% of Five Star members who voted opted to ally with Farage. Grillo\u2019s blog hailed the decision as a new milestone in direct democracy. At Casaleggio\u2019s request, said Filippo Pittarello, the Five Star staff member, Farage changed the name of his Ukip-led alliance from Europe of Freedom and Democracy to Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy.</p> <p>Orchestrating the alliance with Ukip was in many ways a test case for Five Star\u2019s model of digital democracy. When Farage and Kassam visited Casaleggio Associates in Milan in 2015, Casaleggio and Davide were busy upgrading Five Star\u2019s online platform to a more advanced system they called Rousseau \u2013 which would allow members to propose laws and debate and edit them online. Rousseau also made it easier for members to put themselves forward as candidates and decide who would stand. But Kassam was most struck by the extent to which the Italians were amassing and analysing data from all these activities to hone the party\u2019s strategy.</p> <p>Three years later, Five Star would use the approach it had taken to establishing the Ukip bloc to ally with another rightwing party. When Five Star and Matteo Salvini\u2019s Lega formed an all-populist Italian government in 2018, both Farage and Steve Bannon hailed it as the newest revolt against the establishment \u2013 following in the footsteps of Brexit and Trump. \u201cIn 2015, @Nigel_Farage and I went to see the now departed Gianroberto Casaleggio, the man behind Italy\u2019s 5 Star Movement,\u201d Kassam, who was also close to Bannon, tweeted on the day of the Italian elections. \u201cPeople thought we were nuts, toying around the fringes.\u201d But the truth is that Five Star had been the trailblazer.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Before Farage visited Casaleggio Associates in Milan in January 2015, he wasn\u2019t exactly tech-savvy. \u201cWhen I first met Nigel, he barely knew how to turn on a computer,\u201d said Alexandra Phillips, who became Ukip\u2019s head of media in 2013 and is now an MEP candidate for the Brexit party. But it didn\u2019t take an IT whiz to see how far advanced Five Star was when it came to its use of data and the internet. Between the European elections in 2014 and the UK general election in 2015, \u201cwe were creating masses and masses of data\u201d, Kassam said of Ukip \u2013 from people signing up through the website and from its growing social media following. In contrast to Five Star, though, almost no one at Ukip\u2019s notoriously chaotic HQ was digging through this treasure trove.</p> <p>Farage and Kassam thought Ukip should be taking data just as seriously as the Italians were. After the general election \u2013 in which Ukip won nearly 4m votes \u2013 Kassam claims that Farage intended to put him in charge of a new digital platform, Ukip4M.com, which would regularly poll members, give them more of a say in the party and weaponise Farage\u2019s movement by encouraging voters to turn into activists. But Ukip, beset by tensions between Farage and the party\u2019s national executive council, fell into civil war, scuppering Farage\u2019s plans for the party.</p> <p>Another major opportunity to use the knowledge they had gleaned from Casaleggio would arise soon enough \u2013 in the Brexit referendum. In November 2015, Arron Banks officially launched Leave.EU at an event with Richard Tice (now the chairman of the Brexit party) and Liz Bilney, the Farage ally who had attended the Milan meeting and served as Leave.EU\u2019s CEO.</p> <p>Bilney, who oversees Banks\u2019s portfolio of other businesses, showed me a report she had sent to Banks after the Milan meeting. It describes a timeline of key events in web-based politics: the use of the events platform Meetup.com by Howard Dean\u2019s campaign for US president in 2004; the 2008 Obama campaign\u2019s focus on small, grassroots donations; and finally, Five Star\u2019s use of Grillo\u2019s blog to promote direct democracy. Five Star\u2019s lively online debates and tweetable messaging had boosted its membership and its voter turnout, and the Casaleggios spoke a lot about crowdfunding, of making calls to action and fuelling donations around that rallying cry.</p> <p>Like Farage, Bilney believed there was an opening for a British party to do the same. \u201cIssue: there is not currently any party in the UK with any true internet presence,\u201d her report begins. To emulate Five Star, she placed online engagement at the heart of Leave.EU\u2019s campaign. Instead of a target audience passively absorbing a message from party leaders, followers were made to feel they were part of a conversation and a movement \u2013 a strategy often used by brands, too. As Bilney put it, the goal was to \u201cupgrade\u201d a follower to a paying \u201csupporter\u201d through staying in touch regularly, hitting them with varied, dynamic content and keeping them engaged.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken learnings from business, because if you look at insurance, you want people to renew their policies,\u201d Bilney said. \u201cAnd I would apply that same principle with an organisation or a party \u2026 you wouldn\u2019t want the members to drop off. But if you don\u2019t talk to your members, and you don\u2019t engage your members, they drop off.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01c56c87390d8c8e09108a8468cdbd5aa57553d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01c56c87390d8c8e09108a8468cdbd5aa57553d7/0_116_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage campaigning in Rochester in 2014, in the kind of country attire that was his signature.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage campaigning in Rochester in 2014, in the kind of country attire that was his signature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banks hired the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which later worked on the Trump campaign, to help the Leave.EU team generate messages and track which ones did best. By the time the referendum came around, Leave.EU was winning the online arms race. Although the Electoral Commission conferred official status on rival campaign group Vote Leave, Leave.EU was getting more online interactions and more engagement than anyone else, reaching up to 15 million people weekly.</p> <p>As Banks watched Leave.EU grow, he believed it could be more than a one-off campaign. He wanted to turn it into a long-term movement, like Five Star. A few months before the referendum, he emailed Farage to suggest Farage \u201csubtly delink\u201d from Ukip \u201cand we will start building Leave.EU\u201d. He even offered to put up \u00a310m \u201cto develop a popular political movement along the lines of Beppe Grillo\u2019s incredibly successful Five Star Movement in Italy\u201d, he writes in his book The Bad Boys of Brexit. Banks also had a new website built for Leave.EU that would replicate some of the features of Five Star\u2019s Rousseau.</p> <p>But Farage decided to bide his time. Given that the new prime minister, Theresa May, had promised to deliver Brexit, it seemed sensible to wait. Any new movement could be born out of the ashes of a failed deal, Alexandra Phillips, the Brexit party candidate, said \u2013 and Farage could portray himself as coming to the rescue to save Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cNigel would say that the market has to be right for us,\u201d Banks told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of trying to start a fire in a wet forest. But now the forest is tinder dry.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Farage publicly launched the Brexit party this March, he presented it as a response to May\u2019s failure to secure a Brexit deal. In reality, its roots stretch back much further \u2013 at least to the meeting Bilney and he had with Casaleggio in Milan four years earlier.</p> <p>If Casaleggio\u2019s ambition was to replace parliament with direct democracy, Farage\u2019s ambition seems, in the first instance, to destroy the Conservative party. Farage declined to speak to me for this article, but Banks told me that the Brexit party and Leave.EU, which is still very much active, were pursuing a sort of pincer movement on the Tories. (He also denied to me that he is a \u201cmystery donor\u201d to the Brexit party.) \u201cLeave.EU goes behind enemy lines, blowing up their bridges, causing mass mayhem in the Tory party, while the Brexit party can come in head-on, into their face,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Since its launch, the Brexit party has reportedly attracted more than 100,000 supporters paying \u00a325 each. Farage claims they are the main source of the party\u2019s funding. Donations to the Five Star Movement go to a private association run by Davide Casaleggio; similarly, donations to the Brexit party go to a private company. Online donations to the party, which are collected via PayPal, are impossible to scrutinise. Political parties can only accept donations over \u00a3500 if they\u2019re from the UK, and must report both the sources of the funding and how it\u2019s spent. With the Brexit party, it\u2019s not clear who\u2019s giving how much money or where it\u2019s going. (On Monday, the Electoral Commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/20/electoral-commission-visit-brexit-party-offices-funding-gordon-brown-paypal\" title=\"\">announced</a> it would be visiting the Brexit party\u2019s offices to \u201cto conduct a review of the systems it has in place to receive funds\u201d.)</p> <p>If the Brexit party continues to follow the Five Star model, this week\u2019s European elections and trying to push through Brexit may be only its first steps. Five Star is continuing to grow its network of anti-establishment partners. Ahead of the European elections, it has courted France\u2019s Yellow Jacket protesters, offering to help them stand candidates for office. It has announced a new European group with an eclectic mix of eurosceptics, nationalists and populists. It has also pushed its messaging and data-gathering further, reportedly requesting that its elected representatives hand over access to their personal social media accounts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/09/how-matteo-salvini-pulled-italy-to-the-far-right\">How Matteo Salvini pulled Italy to the far right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At times, Farage has acknowledged that he is not leading a political party. \u201cWe\u2019re running a company, not a political party, hence our model of registered supporters, and the fact that the chairman Richard Tice and I are not afraid to make decisions,\u201d he recently told the Telegraph.

      "bodyText": "One day in January 2015, Nigel Farage gave his senior adviser, Raheem Kassam, an unusual bit of news. \u201cOn Monday, we\u2019re going to Milano,\u201d he said. (Farage always pronounced it \u201cMil-ar-no\u201d, much to Kassam\u2019s amusement.) \u201cI was like: \u2018What? Why?\u2019\u201d Kassam said. Farage, who was then the leader of the anti-European Union party Ukip, explained that they were going to sit down with Gianroberto Casaleggio. Kassam whipped out his phone and quickly Googled \u201cCasaleggio\u201d \u2013 he had never heard of him. Farage described Casaleggio to Kassam as the \u201cgenius behind Five Star\u201d, the Italian political party that won a 25% vote share in 2013, the first national elections it had ever contested. Nothing like this had happened before in modern Italian politics. Casaleggio and the comedian Beppe Grillo, who was famous in Italy for his rabble-rousing live shows, had founded the movement just four years earlier. They had largely built the Five Star Movement online, with remarkably little money or mainstream media attention. Five Star was only one step toward Casaleggio\u2019s long-term ambition: to supplant parliament with an online democracy where citizens, highly informed through the internet, could fashion policy directly. Farage had \u201calways been interested\u201d in direct democracy, Kassam said, and in \u201cturning everything over to the internet\u201d. But Farage was more impressed by the fact that, after just a few years, Casaleggio\u2019s largely online movement was on the verge of becoming Italy\u2019s biggest political party. He wanted to know how Casaleggio had done it \u2013 and then to replicate its success. In Milan, Farage was struck by how Casaleggio was using social media and the internet to create a new model for political communications. Five Star members were discussing and voting on policy and nominating and electing each other to run for office while being steeped in party propaganda, all on a single online platform. This made supporters feel as if the movement\u2019s identity was emerging organically from their online interactions, while Casaleggio and Grillo could guide those interactions with messaging from above. What\u2019s more, the \u201cmovement\u201d was dominated by a private company owned by Casaleggio. Five Star was in many ways less like a political party than a publicly traded company in which members were voting shareholders, but Casaleggio had the controlling stake. Farage left Milan \u201cvery excited\u201d about bringing Five Star\u2019s style of digital democracy to the UK, Kassam said. So did Farage\u2019s ally Liz Bilney, who was also present at the Milan meeting and went on to found the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU. \u201cIf I was starting Ukip today,\u201d Farage told the political scientists Matthew Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo around that time, \u201cwould I spend 20 years speaking to people in village halls or would I base it on the Grillo model? I know exactly what I would do.\u201d Farage and his colleagues in the Brexit movement had been converted. The Milan meeting represented a surprising new alignment in European politics \u2013 between Farage\u2019s blokey nationalism and the digitally savvy direct democracy of the ostensibly left-leaning Five Star Movement. Over the next four years, Farage would apply the lessons he learned from Casaleggio first to the Brexit referendum and then to a new party of his own, pursuing his own political goals under the guise of direct democracy. Although Casaleggio died of brain cancer in 2016, his son, Davide, and Grillo continued to steer the Five Star Movement towards the populist right, pushing eurosceptic messages about sovereignty and immigration. Today, Five Star is the largest party in the Italian parliament and governs in an alliance with the far-right Lega party. \u201cCasaleggio was looking down the line,\u201d Claudio Messora, a popular blogger who was head of communications in Five Star\u2019s Brussels office, told me. \u201cHe predicted a Five Star government in Italy and a Nigel Farage government in London \u2013 and so a new Rome-London axis.\u201d This axis would be united over its opposition to the establishment, both domestically and in the EU. But the Milan meeting was also an important moment in a larger shift: toward the emergence of a new form of populism, in which demagogues use digital tools and corporate structures to direct mass movements. \u201cAs long as you are liking them, as long as you\u2019re a fan, as long as you follow them, they don\u2019t need really to account for what they do,\u201d said Paolo Gerbaudo, an Italian political sociologist at King\u2019s College London who studies how political parties use the internet. He added: \u201cWhat users/members/customers are given is basically a window-dressing of participation.\u201d In March 2019, three months after leaving Ukip, his political home of 25 years, Farage launched the Brexit party. Ditching the tweed suits and pints of bitter that were his signature during the Ukip years, Farage has set out to lead a modern political movement. Farage\u2019s new party has embraced slick digital ads and promised to save democracy by giving power back to the people. Supporters can apply to be candidates via an online portal, and the party has jettisoned traditional structures and hierarchies. Similarly to how Five Star is structured, the Brexit party is a registered company striving to look like a web-based mass movement \u2013 but it is controlled from the top by Farage. \u201cThe Brexit party is the virtual carbon copy of the Five Star Movement,\u201d Arron Banks, Farage\u2019s long-time supporter and collaborator, told me. \u201cWhat the Five Star did, and what the Brexit party is doing, is having a tightly controlled central structure, almost a dictatorship at the centre,\u201d he went on. \u201cIf you have a tightly controlled structure, then the crazies can\u2019t take over.\u201d The Brexit party\u2019s Facebook page already has 120,000 followers, almost five times more than the new remain-supporting party Change UK, and it is several points ahead of the other UK parties in European election polls. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the growth of the Five Star Movement, from its inception, with absolute fascination,\u201d Farage recently told the Telegraph, adding: \u201cLook at what we\u2019re already doing in four weeks \u2013 we\u2019re doing the same kind of thing.\u201d * * * By the mid-2000s, it had come to seem obvious to the man behind Five Star\u2019s philosophy that representative democracy was past its sell-by date. Casaleggio believed this outmoded form of government was destined to be replaced by a global web-based democracy that removed the pesky middle-men of politics \u2013 politicians themselves. \u201cHe had this very strong conviction, this belief, that the internet was all about disintermediation,\u201d said Filippo Pittarello, a former employee of Casaleggio who now works in Five Star\u2019s Brussels office. No longer would shops stand between consumers and producers, publishers between readers and authors, bankers between investors and entrepreneurs. \u201cEvery single aspect of the organisation of society that was not direct would be disrupted by the internet,\u201d Pittarello continued. \u201cSo why not politics?\u201d In 2005, through a blog fronted by Grillo, beppegrillo.it, Casaleggio put this philosophy into practice. The blog dispensed what Casaleggio and Grillo called \u201ccounter-information\u201d as an antidote to the \u201cfake news\u201d they said was peddled by the traditional media, which was dominated in Italy by the seemingly immovable prime minister and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi. The blog also invited readers to debate the country\u2019s countless problems. It was ostensibly out of this online discussion that Five Star\u2019s original policy positions emerged when the party formally launched in 2009: renewable energy, sustainable transport, internet access for all and a universal basic income. Although the party claimed to be neither right nor leftwing, Five Star\u2019s policies attracted many supporters disillusioned with the Italian left, which, like Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour, had swung to the centre. Five Star\u2019s central message was its condemnation of what it saw as the country\u2019s overpaid, corrupt political establishment \u2013 right and left alike. By putting an online platform at the heart of its operations, Five Star was way ahead of other political parties in Italy \u2013 many of which barely had a functioning website. As the movement grew, the party seemed to entrust an increasing number of decisions to party members through online ballots and crowdsourced policies. At the same time, many Five Star members treated Grillo\u2019s blog as an oracle of truth. As a result, Casaleggio, who created and managed the blog, could use it to exert enormous sway over the movement. Casaleggio \u201cwas more a man of the right than the left\u201d, said Claudio Messora, who first met Casaleggio in 2008. \u201cIn terms of the political animal he was, he was definitely predisposed in that direction.\u201d Several friends and former staff of Casaleggio told me that he was against open immigration and that he strongly disliked Italy\u2019s left. Casaleggio claimed his politics were neither fascist nor socialist, but in fact they seemed to revere both the imperial and the revolutionary. In a video he made in 2008 called Gaia: The Future of Politics, he imagined a world in which the shadowy conspiracies that currently rule the world \u2013 freemasons, the Bilderberg Group and so forth \u2013 would succumb to an era of worldwide internet democracy. At the same time, the video imagined the annihilation of billions of people following a total war, and held up Genghis Khan\u2019s horseback courier network and Mussolini\u2019s radio broadcasts as examples of the great march of disintermediation. Compared to Casaleggio\u2019s vision of a future without parliaments, Farage\u2019s embrace of direct democracy was more limited \u2013 it largely boiled down to crusading for the referendum on British membership of the EU. At the time of Five Star\u2019s launch in 2009, the main thing the two parties seemed to have in common was a taste for anti-establishment rhetoric. Both parties blamed political elites for the deepening financial crisis, which had caused unemployment to soar in Italy as well as the UK, and capitalised on the public\u2019s growing mistrust of mainstream parties. But despite their outward differences, the parties that Casaleggio and Farage built influenced one another and grew in similar directions. \u201cThe way Casaleggio saw it, the messaging and how Five Star won support was similar to Farage,\u201d Messora said. Both parties claimed to be struggling against entrenched powers and taking back control for the people. Farage claimed referendums could address the disconnect between politicians and ordinary people and argued for the right of recall, whereby constituents would have more power to force out their MP. Five Star called itself a \u201cmovement of citizens\u201d; Farage said Ukip\u2019s supporters were the \u201cPeople\u2019s Army\u201d. Both movements were also moulded around strong, sometimes ostentatiously crude personalities. Footage from the European parliament doesn\u2019t tend to go viral, but videos of Farage\u2019s floor speeches got hundreds of thousands of views and attracted the attention of Casaleggio and Grillo. \u201cYou have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk,\u201d Farage said in a tirade at the new European council president Herman Van Rompuy in 2010. \u201cWho are you? I\u2019d never heard of you. No one in Europe had ever heard of you!\u201d For his part, in 2007, Grillo held a series of \u201cV Day\u201d rallies at which he and his followers shouted vaffanculo! \u2013 \u201cgo fuck yourself!\u201d \u2013 at the political establishment. (The rallies were meticulously planned by Casaleggio in Milan.) Grillo and Farage saw each other as kindred spirits. \u201cI\u2019ve followed him online,\u201d Grillo told CNBC in 2013. \u201cHe is an extraordinary orator \u2026 a real eurosceptic.\u201d David Cameron had recently promised an EU referendum for the first time, bringing Farage\u2019s decades-long campaign closer to fruition. \u201cThis looks to me like real democracy,\u201d Grillo remarked. Farage praised Five Star and Grillo, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s modern,\u201d Farage told journalist Alessio Pisan\u00f2 a couple of months after Grillo\u2019s CNBC interview. \u201cIt was a protest movement to begin with, but what I\u2019ve been observing is that he\u2019s been developing a narrative, a story, which is very, very eurosceptic.\u201d Farage also admired the way Five Star\u2019s appeal to disaffected voters on the left had helped it during Italy\u2019s 2013 general election. Ahead of the 2014 European elections, Farage believed that Ukip could win a majority of Britain\u2019s seats if the party reached beyond the right-left divide. In an attempt to appeal to Labour\u2019s northern heartlands, Farage combined his usual message \u2013 about EU idiocy and waste \u2013 with talk of how industrial communities had been left behind. But he also stoked fears about immigration and said the EU\u2019s free-movement policy was a threat to national sovereignty. Five Star took no official position on immigration, but Grillo was increasingly critical of the EU and blogposts on beppegrillo.it began to talk about \u201csovereignty\u201d, too. In 2014, Ukip and Five Star formed a new, anti-establishment bloc in the European parliament. Farage thought the two parties \u201ccould have fun causing a lot of trouble for Brussels\u201d. The new coalition \u2013 which also included a smattering of MEPs from the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats and other smaller eurosceptic parties, as well as a rebel MEP from Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front (now National Rally) \u2013 was presented as a \u201cloose alliance\u201d that existed merely to give each party more individual sway within the EU. (\u201cBeing outside an official group meant counting for nothing,\u201d Messora explained. \u201cIt would mean no money, no time speaking in the chamber.\u201d) But it was more than a marriage of convenience. Five Star and Farage increasingly shared a philosophy. Soon they would share an electoral strategy as well. * * * Five Star\u2019s unofficial headquarters at the time of its rapid growth was on Via Morone, a quiet street in an exclusive district in the heart of Milan. Here, behind a set of heavy wooden doors, was the home of Casaleggio Associates, the private company through which Gianroberto Casaleggio and then his son, Davide, orchestrated the party\u2019s electoral successes. Although Casaleggio designed Five Star to look like a member-led movement, he set the party\u2019s course from the beginning. Casaleggio Associates not only managed Grillo\u2019s blog; today it also runs Five Star\u2019s digital operations and controls the valuable data being generated on Five Star\u2019s online platform by the party\u2019s snowballing membership. According to two recent investigations by the Italian data protection authority, the Five Star digital platform was breaching European data protection laws by tracking Five Star members in individually identifiable ways. Casaleggio was far ahead of other political parties in using this data to help shape Five Star\u2019s messaging, which he fed back to supporters through Grillo\u2019s blog, and increasingly through social media. The very tools that were supposedly giving members control over the movement were allowing Casaleggio to exert control over them. With a thoughtfully crafted blogpost, he could intervene in the movement\u2019s internal debates, bolstering certain positions and dampening others down. \u201cThis is a long-time project of social engineering, using the web,\u201d said Jacopo Iacoboni, who has written two books on Five Star\u2019s rise. The first detailed how Casaleggio had begun to experiment with manipulating online consensus back in the 1990s, as the CEO of an Italian tech company that sold business tools for managing employees. He believes the way Five Star has used data is far more radical, in some ways, than what had happened in the Trump or Brexit campaigns. \u201cIn the UK and with Trump, the campaigns were, at least formally, separated from the web company running their data \u2013 think Cambridge Analytica, Aggregate IQ,\u201d Iacoboni said. But the Five Star case is unique, he said: \u201cA web company which creates a party, with the owner directly possessing all the data.\u201d Perhaps the most dramatic example of the top-down control that Casaleggio exerted over the movement was the way he choreographed the party\u2019s decision in 2014 to align with Ukip in the European parliament. Many observers and even members of the party had assumed that Five Star was ultimately a progressive movement, so when the possibility of allying with Ukip came up, many Five Star members were appalled. \u201cFarage\u2019s party disgusts me,\u201d Giulia Sarti, one of Five Star\u2019s MPs, told the Italian newspaper La Stampa. Many vocal Five Star members wanted to ally with the Greens instead. On Grillo\u2019s blog, Casaleggio responded with a deluge of posts idolising Farage and criticising the Greens. One post rather fantastically claimed that Ukip, too, was essentially a progressive movement, which rejected any form of \u201cracism, sexism or xenophobia\u201d \u2013 even though Ukip members with offensive views had poured out of the woodwork in that year\u2019s European elections. Another post argued that Ukip had a \u201ccoherent and principled opposition to foreign imperialist wars\u201d in contrast to \u201cthe leaders of the Greens and the liberals, who screamed in favour of the war in Libya\u201d. Ukip\u2019s campaign for a referendum on EU membership was heralded as an example of its support for direct democracy. True to its supposed values, Five Star put to an online ballot the final decision on which European alliance to join. But the post that introduced that ballot left little doubt as to which way members were expected to vote. \u201cIt was clearly in favour of the Ukip solution,\u201d Marco Zanni, who had been elected as a Five Star MEP that May, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a real democratic referendum.\u201d In the end, about 80% of Five Star members who voted opted to ally with Farage. Grillo\u2019s blog hailed the decision as a new milestone in direct democracy. At Casaleggio\u2019s request, said Filippo Pittarello, the Five Star staff member, Farage changed the name of his Ukip-led alliance from Europe of Freedom and Democracy to Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy. Orchestrating the alliance with Ukip was in many ways a test case for Five Star\u2019s model of digital democracy. When Farage and Kassam visited Casaleggio Associates in Milan in 2015, Casaleggio and Davide were busy upgrading Five Star\u2019s online platform to a more advanced system they called Rousseau \u2013 which would allow members to propose laws and debate and edit them online. Rousseau also made it easier for members to put themselves forward as candidates and decide who would stand. But Kassam was most struck by the extent to which the Italians were amassing and analysing data from all these activities to hone the party\u2019s strategy. Three years later, Five Star would use the approach it had taken to establishing the Ukip bloc to ally with another rightwing party. When Five Star and Matteo Salvini\u2019s Lega formed an all-populist Italian government in 2018, both Farage and Steve Bannon hailed it as the newest revolt against the establishment \u2013 following in the footsteps of Brexit and Trump. \u201cIn 2015, @Nigel_Farage and I went to see the now departed Gianroberto Casaleggio, the man behind Italy\u2019s 5 Star Movement,\u201d Kassam, who was also close to Bannon, tweeted on the day of the Italian elections. \u201cPeople thought we were nuts, toying around the fringes.\u201d But the truth is that Five Star had been the trailblazer. * * * Before Farage visited Casaleggio Associates in Milan in January 2015, he wasn\u2019t exactly tech-savvy. \u201cWhen I first met Nigel, he barely knew how to turn on a computer,\u201d said Alexandra Phillips, who became Ukip\u2019s head of media in 2013 and is now an MEP candidate for the Brexit party. But it didn\u2019t take an IT whiz to see how far advanced Five Star was when it came to its use of data and the internet. Between the European elections in 2014 and the UK general election in 2015, \u201cwe were creating masses and masses of data\u201d, Kassam said of Ukip \u2013 from people signing up through the website and from its growing social media following. In contrast to Five Star, though, almost no one at Ukip\u2019s notoriously chaotic HQ was digging through this treasure trove. Farage and Kassam thought Ukip should be taking data just as seriously as the Italians were. After the general election \u2013 in which Ukip won nearly 4m votes \u2013 Kassam claims that Farage intended to put him in charge of a new digital platform, Ukip4M.com, which would regularly poll members, give them more of a say in the party and weaponise Farage\u2019s movement by encouraging voters to turn into activists. But Ukip, beset by tensions between Farage and the party\u2019s national executive council, fell into civil war, scuppering Farage\u2019s plans for the party. Another major opportunity to use the knowledge they had gleaned from Casaleggio would arise soon enough \u2013 in the Brexit referendum. In November 2015, Arron Banks officially launched Leave.EU at an event with Richard Tice (now the chairman of the Brexit party) and Liz Bilney, the Farage ally who had attended the Milan meeting and served as Leave.EU\u2019s CEO. Bilney, who oversees Banks\u2019s portfolio of other businesses, showed me a report she had sent to Banks after the Milan meeting. It describes a timeline of key events in web-based politics: the use of the events platform Meetup.com by Howard Dean\u2019s campaign for US president in 2004; the 2008 Obama campaign\u2019s focus on small, grassroots donations; and finally, Five Star\u2019s use of Grillo\u2019s blog to promote direct democracy. Five Star\u2019s lively online debates and tweetable messaging had boosted its membership and its voter turnout, and the Casaleggios spoke a lot about crowdfunding, of making calls to action and fuelling donations around that rallying cry. Like Farage, Bilney believed there was an opening for a British party to do the same. \u201cIssue: there is not currently any party in the UK with any true internet presence,\u201d her report begins. To emulate Five Star, she placed online engagement at the heart of Leave.EU\u2019s campaign. Instead of a target audience passively absorbing a message from party leaders, followers were made to feel they were part of a conversation and a movement \u2013 a strategy often used by brands, too. As Bilney put it, the goal was to \u201cupgrade\u201d a follower to a paying \u201csupporter\u201d through staying in touch regularly, hitting them with varied, dynamic content and keeping them engaged. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken learnings from business, because if you look at insurance, you want people to renew their policies,\u201d Bilney said. \u201cAnd I would apply that same principle with an organisation or a party \u2026 you wouldn\u2019t want the members to drop off. But if you don\u2019t talk to your members, and you don\u2019t engage your members, they drop off.\u201d Banks hired the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which later worked on the Trump campaign, to help the Leave.EU team generate messages and track which ones did best. By the time the referendum came around, Leave.EU was winning the online arms race. Although the Electoral Commission conferred official status on rival campaign group Vote Leave, Leave.EU was getting more online interactions and more engagement than anyone else, reaching up to 15 million people weekly. As Banks watched Leave.EU grow, he believed it could be more than a one-off campaign. He wanted to turn it into a long-term movement, like Five Star. A few months before the referendum, he emailed Farage to suggest Farage \u201csubtly delink\u201d from Ukip \u201cand we will start building Leave.EU\u201d. He even offered to put up \u00a310m \u201cto develop a popular political movement along the lines of Beppe Grillo\u2019s incredibly successful Five Star Movement in Italy\u201d, he writes in his book The Bad Boys of Brexit. Banks also had a new website built for Leave.EU that would replicate some of the features of Five Star\u2019s Rousseau. But Farage decided to bide his time. Given that the new prime minister, Theresa May, had promised to deliver Brexit, it seemed sensible to wait. Any new movement could be born out of the ashes of a failed deal, Alexandra Phillips, the Brexit party candidate, said \u2013 and Farage could portray himself as coming to the rescue to save Brexit. \u201cNigel would say that the market has to be right for us,\u201d Banks told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of trying to start a fire in a wet forest. But now the forest is tinder dry.\u201d * * * When Farage publicly launched the Brexit party this March, he presented it as a response to May\u2019s failure to secure a Brexit deal. In reality, its roots stretch back much further \u2013 at least to the meeting Bilney and he had with Casaleggio in Milan four years earlier. If Casaleggio\u2019s ambition was to replace parliament with direct democracy, Farage\u2019s ambition seems, in the first instance, to destroy the Conservative party. Farage declined to speak to me for this article, but Banks told me that the Brexit party and Leave.EU, which is still very much active, were pursuing a sort of pincer movement on the Tories. (He also denied to me that he is a \u201cmystery donor\u201d to the Brexit party.) \u201cLeave.EU goes behind enemy lines, blowing up their bridges, causing mass mayhem in the Tory party, while the Brexit party can come in head-on, into their face,\u201d he said. Since its launch, the Brexit party has reportedly attracted more than 100,000 supporters paying \u00a325 each. Farage claims they are the main source of the party\u2019s funding. Donations to the Five Star Movement go to a private association run by Davide Casaleggio; similarly, donations to the Brexit party go to a private company. Online donations to the party, which are collected via PayPal, are impossible to scrutinise. Political parties can only accept donations over \u00a3500 if they\u2019re from the UK, and must report both the sources of the funding and how it\u2019s spent. With the Brexit party, it\u2019s not clear who\u2019s giving how much money or where it\u2019s going. (On Monday, the Electoral Commission announced it would be visiting the Brexit party\u2019s offices to \u201cto conduct a review of the systems it has in place to receive funds\u201d.) If the Brexit party continues to follow the Five Star model, this week\u2019s European elections and trying to push through Brexit may be only its first steps. Five Star is continuing to grow its network of anti-establishment partners. Ahead of the European elections, it has courted France\u2019s Yellow Jacket protesters, offering to help them stand candidates for office. It has announced a new European group with an eclectic mix of eurosceptics, nationalists and populists. It has also pushed its messaging and data-gathering further, reportedly requesting that its elected representatives hand over access to their personal social media accounts. At times, Farage has acknowledged that he is not leading a political party. \u201cWe\u2019re running a company, not a political party, hence our model of registered supporters, and the fact that the chairman Richard Tice and I are not afraid to make decisions,\u201d he recently told the Telegraph. But, like Casaleggio and Grillo before him, Farage is also claiming to offer a new form of politics. \u201cWe are going to directly liaise and have votes amongst our registered supporters to shape policy and shape our future direction,\u201d Farage told listeners on LBC radio last week. \u201cWe will produce policy on the basis of what our supporters think.\u201d This is the language of the new brand of digital populism, in which the director of a private company portrays his firm as the vessel for a democratic mass movement. At another point Farage said to the audience: \u201cThis is going to be the most open political party you\u2019ve ever seen in Britain.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",
