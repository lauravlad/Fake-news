The ABC\u2019s commercial arm rents out studios and other spaces to corporate types for functions \u2013 but in this case the company rented a studio then spread out and took over the lobby too.</p> <p>An ABC spokeswoman said: \u201cIt was a standard arrangement by Studios and Media Production, which hires out spare studios and other production resources. In this case a company hired the space for a corporate presentation to its own staff. It had an allocated area just outside the studio entrance to serve tea, coffee and lunch, and, of its own accord, set up signage and a product display. When the ABC became aware of it we contacted the company and they arranged to have the signage and display removed.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fairfax\u2019s furniture sell-off</strong></h2> <p>The old Fairfax Media is being dismantled bit by bit.

The Nine Entertainment company has commissioned Macquarie Capital to find a buyer for the papers, which include the Canberra Times, the Newcastle Herald, the Examiner, the Border Mail, the Courier and Illawarra Mercury, the Land, Queensland Country Life, and Stock and Land.

      "bodyText": "The Daily Telegraph gave the paediatrician Paul Bauert a huge slap for likening asylum seekers on Nauru to Jews at Auschwitz \u2013 but the tabloid made a rather tasteless comparison itself along the way. \u201cThe main problem these people have is a lack of meaning, a lack of any end to what\u2019s going on, a lack of certainty,\u201d Bauert had said about the asylum seekers on Nauru. \u201cEven those that finally knew they were about to be condemned to the gas chamber at least found some sense of relief in knowing what was happening.\u201d The medico later apologised. To illustrate the story the Daily Telegraph ran a large graphic featuring a photo of sunny Nauru superimposed with a list of all the reasons the island is better than Auschwitz. The comparison was made more stark by an inclusion of a black-and-white photograph of children liberated from Auschwitz in 1945. Clearly a failed attempt at humour, the graphic said the offshore processing centre was better because, unlike the Auschwitz prisoners, the asylum seekers have television, air conditioning and can even open businesses. All right at the ABC Regular ABC consumers aren\u2019t surprised to hear the free-market views of the Centre for Independent Studies aired regularly, and it\u2019s not just because the Radio National presenter Tom Switzer is the executive director of the conservative thinktank, as well as the host of Between the Lines. Like the Institute of Public Affairs, the CIS has a significant footprint at Aunty. On one recent weekend three representatives of the centre were on air, in three separate Radio National programs. The Right Rev Robert Forsyth, a senior fellow at the CIS, appeared on God Forbid, a religion program hosted by James Carleton; Carlos d\u2019Abrera, a psychiatrist and research associate at the CIS, was on Amanda Vanstone\u2019s Counterpoint to discuss the libertarian view on homelessness; and the John Bonython lecture hosted by Switzer at the centre last year was featured on Big Ideas. The lecture by the Brexit supporter Daniel Hannan was titled How Identity Politics Are Undoing the Enlightenment. Nick Cater, a former editor of the Weekend Australian and now executive director of the Menzies Research Centre, also made an appearance on the show. This week Eugenie Joseph, a senior policy analyst at the CIS, was a panellist on Big Ideas. A few months ago Wayne Swan said the right had invested \u201chuge sums of money\u201d on getting a seat at the table of ideas. Labor\u2019s federal president said the Institute of Public Affairs had revenue of $6.1m in 2016-17 and had raised $29.9m since 2009, and the CIS had revenue of $3.9m in 2016-17 and had raised $25.9m. \u201cWhich means that since the global financial crisis, those two organisations alone have raised over $55m to argue for less government, less financial regulation, less power for working people, less equality and less action to combat climate change,\u201d he said. An RN spokesman said the network\u2019s program teams \u201censure they follow the ABC\u2019s editorial policies\u201d. Fatal attraction After our story last week about the veteran Canberra commentator Paul Bongiorno being targeted by Gerard Henderson in his Media Watch Dog column nine times in 2018, we smiled at this image and headline of Hendo on the Australian\u2019s website. Supplementary questions ABC employees who walked into work at their Ultimo headquarters on Wednesday could be excused for thinking they were at a pharmaceutical trade fair. \u201cThe future of personalised medicine is here,\u201d said one banner. In the lobby staff were accosted by marketing material for the nutritional and therapeutic supplements company BioCeuticals, which is owned by Blackmores. Staffers told Weekly Beast there were billboards, flyers and offers of seminars and DNA testing. What was going on? Had the ABC lobby been sold off to commercial entities? Well, partly. The ABC\u2019s commercial arm rents out studios and other spaces to corporate types for functions \u2013 but in this case the company rented a studio then spread out and took over the lobby too. An ABC spokeswoman said: \u201cIt was a standard arrangement by Studios and Media Production, which hires out spare studios and other production resources. In this case a company hired the space for a corporate presentation to its own staff. It had an allocated area just outside the studio entrance to serve tea, coffee and lunch, and, of its own accord, set up signage and a product display. When the ABC became aware of it we contacted the company and they arranged to have the signage and display removed.\u201d Fairfax\u2019s furniture sell-off The old Fairfax Media is being dismantled bit by bit. This week came news the regional and rural newspaper division had been put up for sale by its new owner Nine, and the signage at the front of the Pyrmont offices of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Financial Review was being redone. The Nine Entertainment company has commissioned Macquarie Capital to find a buyer for the papers, which include the Canberra Times, the Newcastle Herald, the Examiner, the Border Mail, the Courier and Illawarra Mercury, the Land, Queensland Country Life, and Stock and Land. Suffice to say, staff on those papers are worried. After-dark confession The Sky News AM Agenda presenter Laura Jayes, who also hosts First Edition with Kieran Gilbert, was frank in her assessment of the Sky After Dark lineup when she appeared on a panel at an Online News Association event at the Twitter headquarters in Sydney. Sitting alongside Nine\u2019s Chris Uhlmann, BuzzFeed\u2019s Alice Workman and the New York Times\u2019 Damien Cave, Jayes admitted that opinion was the lifeblood of Sky News Australia, and it didn\u2019t pretend to be balanced. \u201cI think the people watching our opinion shows already have pretty firm ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re watching opinion to have their own views reinforced, not to get a full, healthy diet of opinions across the political landscape. But that\u2019s part of what we do. From 5am to midnight you\u2019re going to get a whole bunch of different perspectives.\u201d This week Jayes showed that there are different opinions on Sky \u2013 before 6pm \u2013 when she said it wasn\u2019t true that the medical evacuation bill allowed rapists and murderers to come to Australia.",

But, more broadly, today\u2019s mission for Maurizio Sarri\u2019s team is to show unity of purpose, sharpness and actual dignity in the wake of Sunday\u2019s 6-0 spanking by Manchester City. That defeat was merely the most damnable of a run in which they have also been trounced 4-0 at Bournemouth and 2-0 at Arsenal. Can they end their terrible away form today? Or at least score their first away goal of the year? If they can\u2019t, then expect more calls for Sarri to be replaced by someone more flexible and/or more able to motivate this odd squad. On the other hand, a rousing win might convince a few more people that Sarri knows how to pull this lot together and should be given more support.<br></p> <p>Malmo began this season in the Champions League before being eliminated in the preliminary stages by Vidi, who were later eliminated themselves and wound up meeting Chelsea in the group stages of this competition, where they were pesky opponents (losing 1-0 at Stamford Bridge and gaining a 2-2 at home, the only match Chelsea have not win in this competition this season). Having dropped into the Europa league, Malmo have had a decent European campaign, finishing second in their group below Genk but above Besiktas and Sarpsborg. They are a hard-working and well organised unit under manager Uwe R\u00f6sler and haven\u2019t lost any of their last eight home European matches. Their best player is said to be 36-year-old Markus Rosenberg (zero goals in 28 appearances for West Brom half a decade ago). It would, of course, be wrong to underestimate the hosts yadda yadda blah blah blah. Anything less than a Chelsea win here would be embarrassing for the Premier League crew. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T18:47:51.129Z\">at 6.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here is tonight\u2019s match report: \u201cWe played a good match against a very physical team. We were only at risk in setpieces and were in control of the match. We deserved to win by more. But I am happy because we played with confidence and that wasn\u2019t really very easy after the last match.\u201d \u201cWe conceded a goal on a mistake. That can happen. But the level of attention was very god for 90 minutes. So I am very happy but we know very well that we have to gain qualification in the next match. I am always confident but sometimes we\u2019ve had the wrong approach to matches os we need to be careful in every match.\u201d Azpilicueta\u2019s verdict: \u201cAfter that tough defeat last Sunday it was important to start well. We were in control at 2-0 and had chances to have a more comfortable result but they scored. So we still have to play next Thursday. In the second half we had control of the game so it was frustrating to concede a goal and not go to Stamford bridge with a better result ... Chelsea is all about winning. Sunday was unacceptable. We\u2019ve had our reaction but we need consistency.\u201d Here, courtesy of Hakan Burden, are the lyrics (and translation!) to the Dirty Old Town song that Malmo wins were signing throughout much of the second half. Thanks Hakan. Min far han sa, att i Malm\u00f6 stad Spelar ett lag, som \u00e4r s\u00e5 j\u00e4vla bra F\u00e4rgen \u00e4r bl\u00e5, den \u00e4r vacker som f\u00e5 Kom h\u00e4r min p\u00e5g, s\u00e5 kommer du f\u00f6rst\u00e5 (My father said, in Malm\u00f6 city There is a team, so fucking pretty The colour is blue, a colour so grand Come here my boy, and you\u2019ll understand) Chelsea have their first away win of 2019, one foot in the last 16 of the Europa League and some self-respect back after Sunday\u2019s spanking by Man City. This was a deserved win and a broadly satisfactory performance, although there were still sloppy lapses, notably from Barkley and David Luiz, who both did some fine things as well. 90+2 min: Barkley gets caught in possession in midfield and suddenly Malmo pile forward on the counter. Chelsea regroup quickly enough to suppress the mini-revolt, but Sarri is furious on the sidelines: one severe ear-bashing on the way for Barkley, you fancy. 90+2 min: Giroud has a blast from a difficult angle after a pass by his usual accomplice, Hazard. The keeper makes a good save with his feet. 90 min: Chelsea are playing smart now, keeping the ball deftly. Malmo have three more minutes to find an equaliser but don\u2019t look capable of getting the ball. 88 min: Chelsea have the ball where they want it - deep in opposing territory - and look happy to just keep it there. \u201cDavid Luiz is killing this team with yet another run forward followed by a poor pass followed by him not getting back in time to prevent goal on the break,\u201d snorts Rob Coughlin. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating.\u201d 86 min: Malmo attack down the right, Vindheim helping it on to Rosenberg. David Luiz clears the incoming cross. Chelsea substitution: Hudson-Odi on, Pedro off. Malmo fans are signing a chant to the tune of Dirty Old Town. Anyone know their words? 82 min: That goal has infused Malmo with new belief. Suddenly this look like being a far more awkward last 10 minutes for Chelsea, who seemed to be cruising just a couple of minutes ago. Malmo looked out for the count but have suddenly hit a powerful blow thanks to a rapid counter-attack! Rosenberg did well to collect the ball wide on the right and then pick out Christansen scampering through the middle, with Kovacic struggling to keep up. And Christiansen touch one touch before slotting the ball past the advancing Kepa from 16 yards! 75 min: It look as though Kante has not, in fact, gone in as the central linchpin. Kovacic has been moved there instead and Kante is at his now familiar berth on the right. Sarri really doesn\u2019t trust his passing. Chelsea substitution: Kant\u00e9 on, Jorginho off. Kant\u00e9 as a central defensive midfielder? What is Sarri thinking!? Chelsea substitution: Hazard on, Willian off. 71 min: Willian releases Giroud with a cheeky quick freekick over the top of the dozing Swedish defender. Giroud tries to sweep it into the net with an acorbatic volley but slices it badly, eliciting jeers from the crowd. Malmo substitutions: Strandberg and Lewicki on, Antonsson and Traustason off. 69 min: Another classy Chelsea attack ends with Barkley teeing up Pedro, who tries to curl into the far corner from the edge of the box. Again a defender gets a touch on it - Vindheim, to be precise - and the ball drifts just wide for a corner. 67 min: Malmo are looking weary as Chelsea turn the screw. 66 min: Barkley makes a jagged run infield from the left and the slips a pass into Giroud at the edge of the area and continues his run in anticipation of a return ball. Giroud duly obliges and Barkley is in with another scoring opportunity - but his shot is deflected over the bar by a lunging defender for a corner! 64 min: Chelsea are starting to swish it up now. Lots of nice one-touch passing and Willian, in particular, is playing with a flourish. 62 min: Sarri spoke beforehand about introducing Hazard and Higuain with about 15 minutes left but there\u2019s no need for him to do that now. Let\u2019s have another look at Hudson-Odoi instead. A lovely counter-attacking goal! Barkley led the charge from midfield before feeding Willian to his left. The Brazilian ran into the box, danced past a defender and aimed a low pass to Giroud, who helped the ball into the net from close range with an artful flick! 56 min: The pressure keeps coming from Malmo. A corner is cleared to the edge of the area, where Traustason arrives to unleash a fierce shot. David Luiz does well to nod it just wide of the post for another corner. 55 min: Pressure growing from Malmo. Azpilicueta has to make another important intervention to stop Rosenberg from collecting a clever through by by Bachirou, who had broke from midfield by playing foxy one-two with a teammate. 53 min: Corner to Malmo following a well worked attack. Azpilicueta had to put a low cross from the left behind. Malmo botch the corner. 52 min: Pedro leads a promising Chelsea counter-attack, fizzing a low pass into the feet of Giroud, who tries to hold off the defender and take the ball as he swivels. But he gets it wrong and clumps into the defender instead, conceding a freekick. 50 min: Bengsston aims a good diagonal pass towards Vindheim, who has momentarily got the wrong side of Emerson. But the forward miscontrols and Emerson takes advantage. 48 min: Giroud lays the ball back nicely to Jorginho, who considers opening fire from 25 yards but then turns to his right and slides the ball out to Azpilicueta, whose low cross is cleared. 47 min: David Luiz snuffs out the first hint of danger from the hosts in the second half, albeit thanks to a suspiciously soft fall under slight pressure. The ref awards a freekick. 46 min: Here we go again. Neither side made any changes during the interval. Barkley\u2019s goal on the half hour, following a mistake at the back by Malmo, has put Chelsea in a comfortable position. They controlled much of the first period but Malmo remain a threat because of their organisation, athleticism and gumption. Sarri will be confident, however, that if his team avoid daft mistakes, they will see this through and perhaps even add to their goal tally. 42 min: Chelsea are steadying things down, circulating the ball with slow precision. All very annoying for Malmo. 40 min: This is impressive from Malmo. They\u2019re putting Chelsea under a lot of pressure, winning the ball back with frenetic pressing and then attacking with robust directness. 36 min: After Kovacic is harshly penalised, Malmo flight over a freekick from near the left-hand corner flag. There follows mayhem in the Chelsea box! Twice Malmo players try to divert the pinging ball towards goal, and twice Chelsea manage to bundle it away. But only at the expensive of a corner. Rosenberg misses the ball when given a free header in front of goal, then Azpilicueta blocks a follow-up shot from the edge of the area. 34 min: Malmo do not look discouraged and the crowd remain in full voice. Christiansen tries to crank up the volume even louder by letting fly from nearly 30 yards. It takes a nick off a Chelsea player on its way over the bar, giving the hosts a corner. 32 min: Untidy play at the back by Chelsea, first by Azpilicueta and then by Pedro, who rather casually played a pass towards a Malmo forward. Fortunately for Chelsea they were able to scramble and crowd out the player before he got off a meaningful shot from 16 yards. Pedro curled over a routine cross from the right. Bengsston made a mess of trying to cut it out, missing the ball completely. Barkley reacted quickly to take the dropping ball under control and then sort out his feet and slot into the net from eight yards. 27 min: A foul on Emerson down the left gives Chelsea another freekick in a dangerous position. William aims for Giroud at the back post. But the ref blows for a foul before the ball even reaches him, David Luiz apparently having pushed a defender in the box. 25 min: That\u2019s is better from Chelsea! William makes gains down the left and then delivers an excellent cross towards the back post. Giroud takes it down on his chest but is then outmuscled by Bengsston, who steps in and ushers the ball to safety. Excellent defending. 24 min: Chelsea spend a couple of minutes probing but can find no gap in the diligent home defence. 22 min: Splendid control by Kovacic in midfield, followed by an equally fine pass wide to Pedro on the right. But the Spaniard\u2019s cross on the run undoes all that, the ball sailing harmlessly in the goalkeeper\u2019s grateful arms. 20 min: A snappy buildup by Chelsea, until Kovacic loses possession on the edge of the Malmo box after making a good run to collect a pass from Giroud. 17 min: Malmo are, as advertised, well organised and strong and dynamic. They\u2019re really pestering Chelsea when Sarri\u2019s side have possession and are quick to launch attacks when they get it. 15 min: There\u2019s a hint of spite creeping into this contest: lots of pesky little fouls and various players are showing signs of frustration. 13 min: An oafish challenge by Christiansen on Barkley gives Chelsea a freekick wide on the left. He curls over an in-swingers that David Luiz meets about seven yards out. The defender\u2019s efforts goes wide, and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway, as he was offside. 11 min: Barkley pounces on a misplaced pass at the back by Malmo. Then his shot from 20 yards is deflected out for a corner by Nielsen. 8 min: Kovacic gives the ball away in midfield with a sloppy pass. Suddenly Malmo break forward. Antonsson lumbers towards the box, with Kovacic in hot pursuit, before going down under a challenge by David Luiz at the edge of the area. The ref waves play on and it looks the right decision, as Antonsson ran into David Luiz rather than the other way round. 6 min: A smart short corner by Chelsea results in Willian pinging a low pass towards Giroud, who peels away from his marker near the front post and tries to sidefoot the ball goalwards from eight yards. But there are too many bodies in the way and his shot lacks power. 5 min: Emerson and Willian combine nicely down the left before flipping a pass forward for Barkley, who scampers to reach it at the byline. He pulls the ball back, hoping to find Giroud, but a Malmo defender get to it first and clears. 3 min: Chelsea knock the ball around midfield, as much to settle themselves as anything else. 1 min: Malmo win a corner almost immediately, as a shot from the left by Rieks deflects out off Azpilicueta. They take it short to Safari, who dodges past William and then crosses to the far post. Jorginho makes an important block at the expense of another corner. 1 min: Malmo get the game going. Before kickoff there is a well observed minute\u2019s applause in tribute to Emiliano Sala. Here come the teams. The stadium is full to its 24,000 capacity with people making commendable noise and some setting of red firecrackers. As for the teams, Chelsea are wearing an all yellow kit, while Malmo are wearing an outfit that looks jarringly close to Manchester City\u2019s home kit. Those are their usual colours but, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say they\u2019re trolling Chelsea. Regarding the City defeat: \u201cWe discussed it of course with the staff and players. But this discussion has to remain between the staff and players. He\u2019s asked whether the Europa League is now the season\u2019s priority: \u201cWe need to fight also in the Premier League because our target is the top four. We are very close. Europa League is a very difficult competition but we will try. This is a difficult match against a very solid team.\u201d About today\u2019s team selection he says: \u201cThe thinking is that we have to play four or five very important matches so we have to change. Today I prefer to have very strong players on the bench for the last 20-25 minutes.\u201d One London club has already lost today, as Arsenal went down 1-0 at Bate Borisov. Elsewhere, Sevilla, Internazionale and Benfica all enjoyed impressive away wins. Travelling Chelsea fans hoping to get over their repulsion at their team\u2019s performance in Manchester may have chosen to visit some of the Malmo\u2019s attraction before kickoff. The Disgusting Food Museum, for instance, where visitors are \u201cchallenged to reassess their perception of what is and isn\u2019t palatable\u201d. Exhibits include maggot-infused cheese from Italy, ammonia-scented shark from Iceland and, perhaps, Ngolo Kante on the right wing. Sarri has made five changes to the lineup that started Sunday\u2019s humiliation in Manchester, but there\u2019s still no place for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Malmo: Dahlin; Safari, Rieks, Bachirou, Traustason, Christiansen, Bengtsson, Nielsen, Vindheim, Antonsson, Rosenberg Subs: Melicharek, Larsson, Binaku. Lewwicki, Strandberg, Ahmedhozic, Gall Chelsea: Kepa; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Christensen, Emerson; Kovacic, Jorginho, Barkley; Pedro, Giroud, Willian Subs: Cabellero, R\u00fcdiger, Kant\u00e9, Higuain, Hazard, Hudson-Odi, Zappacosta Referee: A Kulbakov (Bul) Technically, this first leg is about Chelsea trying to set themselves up well for next week\u2019s home leg and, they hope, safe passage into the last 16 of the Europa League. But, more broadly, today\u2019s mission for Maurizio Sarri\u2019s team is to show unity of purpose, sharpness and actual dignity in the wake of Sunday\u2019s 6-0 spanking by Manchester City. That defeat was merely the most damnable of a run in which they have also been trounced 4-0 at Bournemouth and 2-0 at Arsenal. Can they end their terrible away form today? Or at least score their first away goal of the year? If they can\u2019t, then expect more calls for Sarri to be replaced by someone more flexible and/or more able to motivate this odd squad. On the other hand, a rousing win might convince a few more people that Sarri knows how to pull this lot together and should be given more support. Malmo began this season in the Champions League before being eliminated in the preliminary stages by Vidi, who were later eliminated themselves and wound up meeting Chelsea in the group stages of this competition, where they were pesky opponents (losing 1-0 at Stamford Bridge and gaining a 2-2 at home, the only match Chelsea have not win in this competition this season). Having dropped into the Europa league, Malmo have had a decent European campaign, finishing second in their group below Genk but above Besiktas and Sarpsborg. They are a hard-working and well organised unit under manager Uwe R\u00f6sler and haven\u2019t lost any of their last eight home European matches. Their best player is said to be 36-year-old Markus Rosenberg (zero goals in 28 appearances for West Brom half a decade ago). It would, of course, be wrong to underestimate the hosts yadda yadda blah blah blah. Anything less than a Chelsea win here would be embarrassing for the Premier League crew.",

The hosts, who are seeking a record 12th successive victory, have won the championship three times since Gatland took over but they are two points behind England after two rounds and, with their rivals finishing with Italy and Scotland at home \u2013 two teams who have not won at Twickenham in the Six Nations era \u2013 defeat would leave Wales all but playing for the runners-up position. \u201cNo disrespect to a very good Scotland side but playing at Twickenham is a tough ask for any side,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThe reality is we need to win to have a chance of winning the title. If we don\u2019t, we will be playing for second place. \u201cI think emotions are pretty high at the moment and we are still nine days away from the game. We are under no illusions about what\u2019s coming and know we need to play better than we have in the two games we\u2019ve played, because we have not really fired a shot yet. I\u2019d like to think, given what this match brings, that will look after itself come kick-off time.\u201d England lost their last three matches in the 2018 championship but have started this year at a thunderous pace, achieving a bonus-point victory over the champions, Ireland, in Dublin before overwhelming France at Twickenham. \u201cEngland are a good side who have kicked more than any other team in their two games,\u201d said Jenkins, who kicked the winning conversion at Wembley 20 years ago when Wales denied England a grand slam. \u201cWhile you have to try to minimise what they do, you have to impose your own gameplan as well. The reality is there will be a fair bit of kicking next week: England play most of their rugby in the opposition\u2019s half through their kicking game or powerful runners. We have to be ready for that and try to find grass.\u201d Wales have released the full-back Leigh Halfpenny to the Scarlets for their league game at Treviso on Saturday. The full-back has just returned to full training after three months out with concussion and is unlikely to be involved against England.",

Wass puts over a nice cross from the right but it\u2019s just too far ahead of Sobrini, who half looks like he pulls up in stretching. 90 mins + 1: Gameiro\u2019s effort from the right side of the area is deflected behind by Brown, who has at least knocked the \u2018give the ball away in really dangerous situations\u2019 wheeze on the head in the second-half. 90 mins: Hmmm: weird one. Celtic should probably have a penalty after Weah, circling under a high cross at the back post, is barged in the back from Lato. No dice though, despite the extra official being roughly three yards away. Three minutes of added time. 89 mins: Toljan gets a yellow card for wrapping his arms around Guedes, and putting him on the floor. 88 mins: For maybe the fourth or fifth time in the second-half, Forrest has darted down the right and skimmed over a cross, only for it to be easily cleared because a) the cross was bad and b) there have only been one or two Celtic attackers in the area. 87 mins: Burke is penalised for...as far as I can tell blocking the ball with his stomach. Even if the referee thought there were hands involved, the ball was struck at him from roughly nine inches away. 85 mins: Celtic try to thread their way through the Valencia defence, but it ain\u2019t happening lads. 82 mins: The first booking of the evening goes to Burke, for a high boot in the mush of an admittedly stooping Garay. Which of course is what Brummies call Mr Lineker. And then just like that, Kondogbia receives the second yellow card about 50 seconds later, for taking far too long about the free-kick. He\u2019ll now be suspended for the second leg. 81 mins: Forrest takes the ball to the byline on the right and clips over a cross, but Wass just gets there before any of Celtic\u2019s attackers and glances the header away. 80 mins: Valencia have a corner from the left. Gameiro finds an indecent amount of space at the near post but sends his header well over. 78 mins: Right-back Piccini seems to twang his groin, so in what can only be described as an act of tactical disdain, Marcelino brings forward Kevin Gameiro on his his stead. There\u2019s a reshuffle, which includes Wass moving from left wing to right-back. 77 mins: Brown plays a nice pass out to Eduoard on the left, but he cuts infield, then cuts further infield, and tries an implausible shot when there were better options available. 74 mins: Brown is possibly a little lucky to get away with a couple of fouls on Kondogbia: as they\u2019re waiting for a corner there\u2019s some pushing, ending with Brown flicking a hand into the Frenchman\u2019s face. They\u2019re given a talking to, but no more, and when the corner is eventually delivered Brown does that thing where you lean into your opponent when they jump for the ball, meaning Kondogbia is sent crashing to the turf. 73 mins: Piccini wanders into the box from the left, skipping around Izaguirre like he\u2019s a training cone, and it\u2019s only a half-hearted cross which prevents the situation getting worse for Celtic. 71 mins: Edouard gets down the left and fires in a low cross which causes a brief bout of panic in the Valencia defence, but not for that long: Lato hooks it clear. 69 mins: Piccini tries to set Soler away down the right, but the flag goes up. Valencia seem happy enough with 2-0, but really they had Celtic in a corner and could really kill the tie off if they wanted. 67 mins: Kondogbia tries to shoulder-charge Edouard, bounces off the Celtic man and for some reason is awarded a free-kick. 65 mins: I\u2019ve been trying to work out Celtic\u2019s formation since those substitutions. The best I can do is a midfield diamond with Weah tucking behind Edouard and Burke, and Forrest as the right-sided midfielder but really playing as a winger. It\u2019s...bold, but then again they have to be. And it has resulted in a more purposeful performance. 63 mins: Sub for Valencia: Cheryshev is off, and Goncalo Guedes is on. 62 mins: Celtic continue to pass out from the back, badly. Again, they\u2019re lucky to get away with it as Izaguirre tackle-passes the ball from danger, but they have to either realise that they\u2019re not good enough to do this against Valencia, or to more carefully pick their opportunities. 61 mins: More positive intent: Forrest gets down the right, he curls over a cross which is half-headed away, only as far as Weah on the edge of the box. He tries a shot, but sends it way over. Still, mild progress. 60 mins: Edouard shows a little positive intent, picking the ball up on the left and running towards the box. He runs into Garay right on the edge: one of those where you\u2019re not quite sure how the defender could get out of the way, but probably also a foul. However, the referee decides it is not. 58 mins: Here are those subs: Weah replaces Scott Sinclair, while Edouard takes the place of Ryan Christie. 57 mins: Subs ahoy for Celtic: at least two of them, with Tim Weah and Odsonne Edouard receiving instructions from Brendan Rodgers. Too late? Maybe, but at least they\u2019re trying something. 56 mins: Celtic have a shot. After a fashion. McGregor takes aim from about 25 yards out but puts it into the stands, where an enterprising young lad quickly squirrels the ball underneath his seat. Good lad. 55 mins: Sobrino begins a chase down the right touchline for the ball and possibly a run on goal, but he\u2019s tugged back by McGregor, who is probably lucky not to be booked. 53 mins: Going to be a long half an hour or so for Celtic, this. Chasing shadows will barely cover it. 51 mins: Close to goal three, as Piccini makes his way into the box from the right and shoots, but Bain saves at the near post. 48 mins: Simple really. Wass shoves the ball down the line to Cheryshev, he makes tracks then hits an absolutely perfect cross into the middle where Sobrino meets the ball on the full, and smacks it straight through Bain. Men against boys. Game over. Probably tie over. 46 mins: It takes Celtic roughly 20 seconds to give the ball away in their own half. Again, they\u2019re lucky nothing much is made of it. The teams are heading back out for the second-half, and one of them is going to be slightly different: Valencia are bringing on Francis Coquelin - remember that guy? - for Parejo. Since the Spaniards\u2019 playmaker was the best player on the pitch in the first half, that either means he\u2019s injured or they reckon the game is basically won so they don\u2019t need him for the second 45. That\u2019s the first goal Celtic have conceded this year, and the first goal Bain has let in since displacing Craig Gordon in the team after the last Old Firm game. But, to repeat, Celtic will probably be happy it\u2019s only 1-0. At various points this has carried a strong \u2018men against boys\u2019 vibe. Valencia are at least two or three classes above Celtic, even with a few key men absent. To repeat: their only real concern might be that they\u2019re not further ahead. Peeeeeeeep. 45 mins: Rodgers looks concerned on the touchline, and he\u2019s right to. Bain plays a suicidal pass out to Toljan who has little choice but to blindly hoof the ball out of play. One minute of added time. 44 mins: The only real surprise is that Valencia aren\u2019t further ahead at this stage. 42 mins: Celtic give the ball away again, but this time a more prosaic incident deep in the Valencia half. Parejo brings it forward and plays a delicious pass through to Sobrino who is free behind the Celtic defence, and has the time to wait for Cheryshev, to whom he squares the ball for the tap-in. Celtic claim offside, but nothing doing there. That had been coming. 40 mins: More sloppy passing, as this time Simunovic has the choice between passing to McGregor or Boyata, but just puts the ball between the two. Again, they get away with it. As lax as this is from Celtic, Valencia might be pretty concerned that they haven\u2019t yet taken advantage of it. 38 mins: Forrest cuts in from the right and runs through a couple of challenges, but his attack is halted by a brilliant sliding challenge from Parejo. The crowd wail for a foul, but that was perfectly-timed. 37 mins: A rare attack from Celtic: McGregor feeds Sinclair, who brings the ball forwards on the break, threads the needle with a delicately placed pass which sets Burke free behind the defence, but the pass was just, just, just too strong and Neto emerges from his box to beat Burke to the ball. 35 mins: Brown puts in the thunking (fair) challenge to win the ball, but in keeping with the rest of his performance promptly gives the ball away. He\u2019s lucky that Wass\u2019s cross was poor and easily cleared. 33 mins: Valencia simply not allowing Celtic to pass out from the back. Bain has to be sharp about getting rid of the ball under pressure, and then can only hoof the ball out of play. 30 mins: Valencia continue to be more threatening going forwards: Wass spreads the ball left to Wass, who is flagged offside, but that was marginal at best. 27 mins: One thing that\u2019s been pretty obvious so far is that these Celtic players aren\u2019t used to being pressed so quickly: Brown\u2019s issues we\u2019ve mentioned, but Izaguirre then cedes possession after being closed down. Meanwhile Forrest is the latest to give away a free-kick, going in late on Lato. Still no bookings. Marcelino might burst shortly. 26 mins: Wass hits a half-volley from way out that dribbles through to Bain. Meanwhile Marcelino\u2019s ire at the \u2018physical\u2019 side of the game continues, as Sobrino spends some time on the turf after Simunovic levers him to the floor. Celtic have been lucky to get away with some of these. 25 mins: Brown has having quite a game so far: he\u2019s already nearly assisted two Valencia goals, and now he shanks what should have been a relatively simple pass out for a throw. 21 mins: Brown apologised to Bain for that ropey pass, but there was really no need: do you really think the young keeper was going to bawl the granite-faced midfielder out? 20 mins: Eeesh, Celtic come this close to donating a goal to Valencia: Brown plays a pass theoretically back to Bain, but he was lucky the keeper had his head on and reacted in time to clear, because Cheryshev was bloody close to intercepting that. 18 mins: Brilliant save! Soler hooks a cross over from the right, Sobrino flicks it on at the near post and Wass, arriving at the back stick, gives his neck muscles the full Les Ferdinand and sends the ball towards the top corner. But Bain flings himself to his left and paws it away: it wasn\u2019t right in the corner, but plenty of people thought it was in, Marcelino among them. 16 mins: Sinclair does nicely to skip past Piccini but, having beaten him once, decides he liked the feeling so much he tried it again. He manages that, but checking back inside took the momentum out of his run and the attack peters out. 14 mins: In quick succession, Scott Sinclair and Burke display why forwards shouldn\u2019t try too hard to help out their defence by taking out Soler and Diakhaby respectively with late challenges. Marcelino is, quite understandably, not especially impressed about the rough housing, particularly as neither Celtic player was booked. 11 mins: Christie finds a bit of space on the left, but after feeding infield to Burke, his touch is heavy and the attack breaks down. 9 mins: Parejo sweeps a pass infield for Kondogbia, but Christie bumbles in and knocks him over like a drunk teenager taking out a lamp while pretending to their parents they\u2019re completely sober. 8 mins: The atmosphere in the stands sound more or less like you\u2019d expect from Parkhead on a European night, but the performance hasn\u2019t quite matched that so far. You sort of expected Celtic to go for it, hell for leather, but they haven\u2019t done that so far. 5 mins: First effort on goal for Celtic: McGregor picks the ball up just to the left of centre outside the box, he runs to just right of centre and hits a low shot, but there\u2019s not much power in it and it\u2019s fairly close to Neto, who dives not too far to his left and saves. 3 mins: Scott Bain plays a terrible pass looking for...Brown, I think. It\u2019s intercepted by Sobrino but luckily for the young goalie the attack is eventually snuffed out. 2 mins: James Forrest drives towards and then into the box and goes down with more than a hint of shove from Lato, but the referee gives it a good look and says no penalty. 1 min: Celtic get us away. Oli Burke knocks the kick-off back to Scott Brown but Celtic promptly give the thing away. There\u2019s now a minute\u2019s silence for Emiliano Sala. Seems like it\u2019s observed pretty nicely. And now, the game. Brendan gives Marcelino a big hug. Marcelino looks a little bit uncomfortable about the whole thing. Maybe he\u2019s just not a PDA guy. The singing of \u2018You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u2019 has commenced. The players are assembling in the tunnel. Scott Brown looks like he\u2019s about to beat up one of the Easter Island statues. The good news for Celtic is their evening probably can\u2019t go as badly as Arsenal\u2019s did... Elsewhere, it\u2019s not going well for Arsenal. Follow the last ten minutes of their game against BATE Borisov with Rob Smyth here. Meanwhile here\u2019s something we can almost certainly all enjoy: Sergio Ramos has been called to the headmaster\u2019s office. Here\u2019s what Brendan Rodgers had to say ahead of this game. These two have met twice in this tournament, or iterations thereof, before. Once was in 2001/02, when both legs were won 1-0 by the home side (naturally Henrik Larsson scored one delicious goal) then Valencia prevailed on penalties. The two managers involved that day were Martin O\u2019Neill and Rafa Benitez: what price would you have got for them to be managing Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United 17 years later, eh? The other game was way back in 1962/63, when they faced each other in the Fairs Cup and Celtic were absolutely hosed, 4-2 in the first leg meaning the 2-2 in the return was of no use whatsoever. Still, because it\u2019s quite a novelty that the footage is here and freely available, here\u2019s highlights of that 2-2 anyway. No Gabriel. I am bereft. Celtic Bain, Toljan, Boyata, Simunovic, Izaguirre, Forrest, McGregor, Brown, Sinclair, Christie, Burke. Subs: Gordon, Hayes, Edouard, Lustig, Weah, Ajer, Johnston. Valencia Neto, Piccini, Garay, Diakhaby, Toni Lato, Carlos Soler, Parejo, Kondogbia, Wass, Sobrino, Cheryshev. Subs: Jaume, Goncalo Guedes, Gameiro, Lee, Coquelin, Torres, Centelles. Referee: Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania) How\u2019s your 2019 going? I\u2019d wager it\u2019s not as good, or as consistent, as Celtic\u2019s. Seven domestic games played, seven games won, zero goals conceded and 21 goals scored. A neat average of 3-0 a game (that they\u2019ve only actually won two of those games 3-0 spoils things a little, but you can\u2019t have everything), which has extended their lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership to six points. Now though, to Europe. And even though they\u2019re playing Valencia, you might fancy their chances: Brendan Rodgers has been talking them up, as you might expect, pointing out that \u201ctheir recent results tell you everything about the level they are at.\u201d They may have got a draw with Barcelona the other week, but they\u2019re eighth in La Liga and arguably not pulling up too many trees there. It\u2019s a tempter to think they could do something, mind. The question for the neutral is this: how much do you want Celtic to go far in the Europa League? This may very much depend on how much of a Brendan apologist you are, because if you find him unbearably self-satisfied now, imagine what he\u2019ll be like if he wins a European trophy. He\u2019ll get an extra coat of shine on his teeth to celebrate. Anyway, this should be decent game. Not just because agent of chaos Gabriel Paulista might be fit to play. Either way, stick around. Kick-off: 20.00 GMT",

The situation for diesel exhausts is similar.

Enforcement is down to each country, but we are still waiting.

      "bodyText": "If your car seatbelt was designed to work in a test, but not an accident, it would be a major moral failure by the manufacturer and perhaps grounds for prosecution. The situation for diesel exhausts is similar. Last week, the European court of auditors found diesel cars had been designed to pass ever tighter exhaust tests, but caused much more air pollution on our roads. Some produced 50% more carbon dioxide (CO2) and more than 10 times as many nitrogen oxides (NOx). Extra CO2 affects the climate, but avoids climate taxes, and the extra NOX harms our health. Enforcement is down to each country, but we are still waiting. The EU has launched legal action against Spain, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK for not prosecuting Volkswagen for selling cars with cheat software. Seven different companies have recalled more than 10m vehicles, but the limited data available on these fixes suggests the impact on NOx is small. The court voiced fears that manufacturers would find new ways to \u201coptimise\u201d vehicles to beat tighter tests on new cars. Sales of new diesels have plummeted along with the secondhand market. We need car industry honesty to re-establish trust in order to move forward.",

That led some of the more pro-EU Tories to warn her she cannot rely on the right of her party.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Reacting to the defeat, Downing Street chose to point the finger at the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who opposed the government\u2019s motion.</strong> Number 10 said Corbyn had \u201cput partisan considerations ahead of the national interest\u201d and voted to \u201cmake no deal more likely\u201d.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> and <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> have the full story:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/14/theresa-may-defeated-on-brexit-again-as-erg-tories-abstain\">Theresa May defeated on Brexit again as ERG Tories abstain</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c65cd55e4b071a680340ba3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T20:21:01.360Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Valentine\u2019s Day plans have not prevented the ERG\u2019s deputy chair, <strong>Steve Baker</strong>, from responding to Harrington\u2019s comments.

At issue this week were the words in the prime minister\u2019s bland motion, part of which reiterated \u201cits support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January\u201d. That \u201capproach\u201d to Brexit included the vacuous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexit-backstop-amendment-would-give-may-enormous-firepower\">Graham Brady amendment</a>, which required the government to replace the backstop by alternative arrangements. But the house\u2019s approach on 29 January also included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/amendments-to-may-statement-brexit-bill\">Caroline Spelman amendment</a>, which rejected leaving the EU with no deal. Both were passed but, to the fanatics, only Brady was acceptable. This explained why, at the very start of Thursday\u2019s debate, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had to confirm to David Davis that the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March if there is \u2013 as some fanatics hope \u2013 no deal. That brief exchange encapsulated the haplessness of recent Commons Brexit proceedings, because it was both misguided and unavailing. The assurances made no difference.

Snap analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some Commons votes have very clear consequences - either legislative or political (like a no-confidence vote). Others are rather harder to interpret. Today\u2019s was very definitely in the second category, but that does not mean it does not matter (calling it \u201csymbolic\u201d does not particularly help) and this may turn out to be a significant moment in the Brexit saga. Here is a snap analysis of what it means.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) May will find it much harder now to argue that she has got a Commons majority behind her Brexit strategy. </strong>Two weeks ago she secured a majority for the Brady amendment. Today\u2019s vote has not entirely reversed that \u2013 Brady would probably still pass, if there were another vote today \u2013 but it shows that some of the Tories who backed Brady were not willing to to do so if that was combined with a suggestion that a no-deal Brexit should be off the table.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) The debate showed that MPs were only able to unite behind Brady because they could not agree what it meant. </strong>This became apparent during the opening of the debate (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/14/brexit-latest-news-developments-debate-vote-amendments-fox-tells-potential-tory-rebels-they-will-undermine-pms-negotiation-if-she-loses-key-vote-politics-live?page=with:block-5c656ec8e4b05934c2e32fba#block-5c656ec8e4b05934c2e32fba\"> 2.31pm)</a> when Tory Brexiters were saying the Malthouse compromise should be official government policy, but Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, refused to concede this.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) EU leaders, who were already extremely reluctant to offer much to the UK in terms of backstop concessions because they could not be sure what might get through parliament, will now almost certainly feel even less inclined to engage.</strong> It is hard to see the point in doing a deal with a leader who cannot get what she agrees through parliament.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) New government evidence about how damaging a no-deal Brexit might be will have to be published soon.</strong> That was the last-minute concession announced by Chris Heaton-Harris. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/14/brexit-latest-news-developments-debate-vote-amendments-fox-tells-potential-tory-rebels-they-will-undermine-pms-negotiation-if-she-loses-key-vote-politics-live?page=with:block-5c659cd2e4b071a680340921#block-5c659cd2e4b071a680340921\">4.47pm.) </a>If it says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/13/brexit-latest-news-developments-pmqs-olly-robbins-wrong-to-claim-may-will-use-threat-of-extending-article-50-to-pass-deal-barclay-says-politics-live?page=with:block-5c643467e4b00ef6acc6d4a1#block-5c643467e4b00ef6acc6d4a1\">what Anna Soubry thinks it will say,</a> this will strengthen the hand of those MPs arguing that no deal should be ruled out \u2013 although there is a lot of evidence suggesting that the public at large are less concerned about these warnings.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) May\u2019s defeat raises questions about the competence of the government\u2019s management of parliamentary business.</strong> Leavers and remainers were saying this morning that, if the government had consulted more widely when drafting its motion, the defeat could easily have been averted. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/14/brexit-latest-news-developments-debate-vote-amendments-fox-tells-potential-tory-rebels-they-will-undermine-pms-negotiation-if-she-loses-key-vote-politics-live?page=with:block-5c65504ae4b05934c2e32d8d#block-5c65504ae4b05934c2e32d8d\">11.32am.)</a> And it is also arguable that the government, instead of offering Soubry what she wanted, would have been better letting her put her amendment to a vote. It would have been defeated, but at least it would have lost on an issue where it was willing to lose. On the plus side, there would have been no vote on the main motion, meaning no split with the ERG and no prospect of the vote two weeks ago being arguably reversed.

Some British parliamentarians say that we want to trap them in a permanent limbo. But it is not true. The EU is interested in moving to the next phase as soon as possible and starting a new relationship with the United Kingdom.

So, as a public service, here is quick recap. </p> \n  <p>There are two sorts of Brexit debate on the schedule at the moment: a so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d (MV), a vote intended to approve a deal with the EU; and what some are calling a \u201cnext steps\u201d (NS) debate, a debate scheduled because the MV was not passed, allowing MPs to vote on amendments about what should happen next, or \u201cplan B\u201d.</p> \n  <p>We have had one MV so far. That was on 15 January, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/15/brexit-vote-parliament-latest-news-may-corbyn-gove-tells-tories-they-can-improve-outcome-if-mays-deal-passed-politics-live?page=with:block-5c3e5492e4b03740e8745909#block-5c3e5492e4b03740e8745909\"> it led to Theresa May\u2019s deal being voted down by a record majority of 230. </a>And we have had one NS debate on 29 January, which led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/29/brexit-vote-commons-latest-news-developments-liam-fox-says-may-now-saying-withdrawal-deal-text-must-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c510ab0e4b0fbf19bc3c0fc#block-5c510ab0e4b0fbf19bc3c0fc\">May winning a vote on the Brady amendment </a>(saying her deal should be passed, subject to the backstop being replaced) but losing a vote on the Spelman amendment (a non-binding one ruling out no deal).</p> \n  <p>Today we have got NS2. As <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> reports in her overnight preview (see below) May faces the risk of defeat on the main motion because Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group may not support her. A defeat would have no direct, practical effect, but it would nevertheless amount to a serious setback. After NS1, May was able to tell the EU that she had secured a Commons majority for at least something. A defeat today would imply that that majority has gone, which could leave Brussels wondering whether May is in a position to get anything through parliament.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/hardline-brexiters-threaten-to-vote-down-theresa-mays-motion\">Hardline Brexiters threaten to vote down Theresa May's motion</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>In this process MV debates are more important than NS ones. Today\u2019s NS vote (NS2) could turn out to be quite significant, but NS3, which is due to take place on Wednesday 27 February, will be much more decisive, because this will be when Tory pro-Europeans could unite with the opposition to pass the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/12/brexit-latest-news-developmens-mays-statment-mps-need-to-hold-our-nerve-may-to-tell-mps-as-leadsom-hints-uk-softening-call-for-deal-to-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c6307dce4b042feedcbc84b#block-5c6307dce4b042feedcbc84b\">Yvette Cooper amendment designed to allow MPs to vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit.</a> This may also be the moment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/labour-mp-submits-plan-for-referendum-on-brexit-deal\">when Labour frontbenchers resign if Jeremy Corbyn does not firmly back a second referendum.</a></p> \n  <p>With most observers now thinking MV2 will not take place until March, possibly after the EU summit and only days before Brexit day on 29 March, there is also a chance that we may even get NS4 or NS5 debates in early March too.</p> \n  <p>I hope that\u2019s all clear.</p> \n  <p>Downing Street is still hoping to persuade the ERG to back the government in the vote this afternoon. On the Today programme this morning <strong>Liam Fox</strong>, the Brexiter international trade secretary said that if Tories did not back May, they would undermine her in the Brexit negotiations with Brussels. </p> \n  <p>He said that some MPs saw voting as an \u201cacademic and ideological purity exercise\u201d but that in reality this was about \u201cthe raw politics of negotiation and ... about sending signals about continuity and trustworthiness in negotiation.\u201d He explained:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What we say is looked at and listened to by those that we are negotiating with. They will be looking to see whether parliament is showing consistency because in the debates and the votes we had recently there were two things: one was that parliament said we don\u2019t want there to be no deal, and that we will sign up to the prime minister\u2019s deal if we are able to get changes to the Irish backstop.</p> \n   <p>Our European partners will be watching our debate and listening today to see if they get the impression that if they were to make those concessions, parliament would definitely deliver on that ...</p> \n   <p>I think that there\u2019s a danger that we send the wrong signals and I think that we need to understand that the public want us to leave the European Union but they would prefer us to leave the European Union with a deal. And therefore parliament has got a duty to ensure that we send the correct signals that represent those views of the British people and represent them to those we are negotiating with.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>After 10.30am:</em> Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, announces next week\u2019s Commons business.</p> \n  <p><em>11pm: </em>Various Labour MPs are due to speak at a Love Socialism Hate Brexit event in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>After 11.30am:</em> MPs start the Brexit debate.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, so thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day: Theresa May suffered a humiliating defeat in the Commons over her approach to Brexit. MPs rejected her motion by a majority of 45 and, while the defeat will have no practical effect, it will make it harder for the prime minister to argue to the EU that she has a Commons majority behind her Brexit strategy. A significant number of the most hardline Eurosceptics in May\u2019s own party abstained on the vote. The hard Brexit-supporting ERG were unhappy that the government\u2019s motion appeared to rule out a no-deal Brexit. That led some of the more pro-EU Tories to warn her she cannot rely on the right of her party. Reacting to the defeat, Downing Street chose to point the finger at the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who opposed the government\u2019s motion. Number 10 said Corbyn had \u201cput partisan considerations ahead of the national interest\u201d and voted to \u201cmake no deal more likely\u201d. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot have the full story: Valentine\u2019s Day plans have not prevented the ERG\u2019s deputy chair, Steve Baker, from responding to Harrington\u2019s comments. This from ITV News\u2019 Paul Brand: The business minister, Richard Harrington, has accused members of the Tory European Research Group (ERG) of \u201ctreachery\u201d over Brexit. Harrington hit out at the ERG, which is headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, as he suggested members should defect to Nigel Farage\u2019s new party because they are not Conservatives. Referring to the ERG, the minister told the House magazine: The prime minister has done a pretty good job of standing up to them up till now, but they were drinking champagne to celebrate her losing her deal and I regard that as being treachery. I read that Nigel Farage is setting up a new party called \u2018Brexit\u2019 and, if I were them, I\u2019d be looking at that because that seems to reflect their views more than the Conservative party does. They should read carefully what that party\u2019s got to offer, because in my view they\u2019re not Conservatives. There are people who are very solid and stringent in their views and if I were they I would be looking at a party that seems designed for them \u2013 Nigel Farage\u2019s party. Harrington, who backed Remain in the referendum, said it would give the ERG pleasure if ministers who shared his views on Brexit resigned. If we all resigned what would then happen? If I were in the ERG, it would give me a lot of pleasure to see us resign. But we can\u2019t give in to a minority of a minority, which is what the ERG are. Harrington also dismissed the so-called Malthouse compromise, which is intended to try to bridge Tory divisions on Brexit. It\u2019s basically regurgitated Canada Plus, which we know is not at all suited to our close relationship with the European Union, plus a bit of glorified number plate recognition kit, which they\u2019ve got there anyway. I think it\u2019s just fanciful nonsense. Some in her own party are advising Theresa May she cannot rely on the ERG and should find another way altogether. Jessica Elgot has an insight into how Number 10 may be going about plotting its course from here: Here is some more analysis of the result. From the Guardian And here is an extract from the Guardian editorial. A large part of what is so reckless about this process is that the row between the fanatics and the government centres on rightwing dogmas not facts. At issue this week were the words in the prime minister\u2019s bland motion, part of which reiterated \u201cits support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January\u201d. That \u201capproach\u201d to Brexit included the vacuous Graham Brady amendment, which required the government to replace the backstop by alternative arrangements. But the house\u2019s approach on 29 January also included the Caroline Spelman amendment, which rejected leaving the EU with no deal. Both were passed but, to the fanatics, only Brady was acceptable. This explained why, at the very start of Thursday\u2019s debate, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had to confirm to David Davis that the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March if there is \u2013 as some fanatics hope \u2013 no deal. That brief exchange encapsulated the haplessness of recent Commons Brexit proceedings, because it was both misguided and unavailing. The assurances made no difference. This is hopeless stuff for matters of such importance. It reeks of failure. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston And here is an extract from Peston\u2019s Facebook post. So this is how it will probably now play out. On February 27, the PM may finally and pre-emptively \u2013 before any vote on the so-called Cooper/Letwin amendment \u2013 surrender to MPs\u2019 lobbying and agree to ask the EU for a Brexit delay. Some of her close associates tell me that she could do this, although it would mean defying all precedent and deliberately facing down her ERG Brexiter MPs - who would go berserk. The alternative would be for her to continue to maintain a formal position of opposing a delay to Brexit. But if she continues to insist that a no-deal Brexit on 29 March is the default position, that would lead 15 or so ministers, including a minimum of three in the cabinet (Rudd, Gauke, Clark) to resign \u2013 because they are so implacably opposed to a no-deal Brexit that they would insist on voting for the Cooper/Letwin amendment, whose effect would be to force her to sue the EU for a Brexit delay. Either way, by the end of February the PM will probably be in a position of knowing that any talks that are still going on to tweak her Brexit deal must be combined with a request for a Brexit delay. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth And here is an extract from Forsyth\u2019s blog. The EU will argue that this result shows that even with changes to the backstop, May couldn\u2019t get a deal through. They\u2019ll therefore become more forceful in their attempt to urge her to come to an arrangement with Jeremy Corbyn on a customs union. The ERG have, ironically, made it less likely that May will get anything significant on the backstop and increased the chances of the UK ending up in a customs union with the EU. From the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Here is the Conservative pro-European Sarah Wollaston on the result. And here is the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn on the number of Tories who did not vote on the main motion. Most of them probably deliberately abstained, although the Commons does not distinguish between people who make a conscious decision not to vote and those who do not vote because they are paired, or absent for some other reason. Some 41 Labour MPs defied the whip and voted for the SNP amendment saying article 50 should be extended, despite being under orders to abstain. They were joined by two Conservatives: Ken Clarke and Sarah Wollaston. The full list is here. And Kate Hoey was the one Labour MP who joined the Tories in voting against the SNP motion. Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Tory Brexiter, described the result as a \u201cfiasco\u201d for the government. He told Sky News: It\u2019s an unfortunate fiasco that the government\u2019s clumsiness created. I don\u2019t know why the government doesn\u2019t consult a bit more widely before they table these motions. There are 110 eurosceptic Tory MPs who helped defeat the withdrawal agreement \u2013 not one of us was consulted. He played down the significance of the result, saying: We don\u2019t attach much significance to it. What matters is the votes in a fortnight\u2019s time when the government has continued to pursue changes to the backstop. Industry leaders have reacted with dismay to the latest Brexit defeat for the prime minister, warning of the damage being caused to business, the Press Association reports. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said: The defeat of the government motion tonight will increase fears among food and drink manufacturers that there is now a diminishing prospect of rescue from the catastrophe of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit. London Chamber of Commerce and Industry\u2019s chief executive, Colin Stanbridge, said: As the clock ticks down, the economic indicators drop down. Uncertainty is continuing to do real-term damage to businesses, which is why they are crying out for politicians to stop grandstanding, agree a way forward, and move on to the future trading negotiations with the EU. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said tonight\u2019s vote would increase pressure on Theresa May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. He said: The vote this evening demonstrates a complete failure of Theresa May\u2019s Tory government and parliament\u2019s rejection of more reckless time-wasting as they drag us closer and closer to the cliff-edge. Theresa May\u2019s brinkmanship may seem to her as a clever tactic in trying to force MPs to support her deal, but tonight parliament rejected this ploy. The reality is the prime minister\u2019s political game in refusing to take no deal off the table is having a serious effect on people\u2019s day-to-day lives. The Liberal Democrats have campaigned for a people\u2019s vote for over two years. Tonight\u2019s defeat of the government makes clear it is long overdue that the prime minister took no deal off the table, and offered the public a final say on Brexit with the option to remain in the EU. Anna Soubry, the Conservative pro-European, described the result as a \u201cbody blow\u201d to Theresa May. Soubry said: The prime minister has been dealt yet another body blow. This is really serious stuff. What is happening is a profound lack of leadership from the very top of government. This lack of leadership means there is no guidance on this, there is no grasping of the reality of the situation we are in. She also said that ministers who opposed a no-deal Brexit had to vote for this at the end of the month, in the vote scheduled for 27 February, even if that meant resigning. She told the BBC: We have a Conservative party - the party of business, of economic competence and prosperity - gambling with the real lives of my constituents, their futures, their jobs, their children and grandchildren. This is outrageous and, from the Conservative party in particular, it is not acceptable any longer. In two weeks\u2019 time, everybody has got to show some backbone, stop saying things in private, say it in public, and resign if you need to resign. How MPs voted on the government motion. For (258) Conservatives (243) DUP (10) Independents (2): Frank Field and Stephen Lloyd Labour (4): Ian Austin, Sir Kevin Barron, Jim Fitzpatrick and John Mann These figures add up to 259, but the Commons authorities gave the figure as 258. Against (303) Labour (244) SNP (35) Lib Dems (11) Conservatives (5): Peter Bone, Sir Christopher Chope, Philip Hollobone, Anne Marie Morris and Sarah Wollaston Plaid Cymru (4) Independents (3): Sylvia Hermon, Jared O\u2019Mara, and John Woodcock Greens (1): Caroline Lucas You can read the full division lists for all three votes tonight here. I will post the key numbers shortly. Some Commons votes have very clear consequences - either legislative or political (like a no-confidence vote). Others are rather harder to interpret. Today\u2019s was very definitely in the second category, but that does not mean it does not matter (calling it \u201csymbolic\u201d does not particularly help) and this may turn out to be a significant moment in the Brexit saga. Here is a snap analysis of what it means. 1) May will find it much harder now to argue that she has got a Commons majority behind her Brexit strategy. Two weeks ago she secured a majority for the Brady amendment. Today\u2019s vote has not entirely reversed that \u2013 Brady would probably still pass, if there were another vote today \u2013 but it shows that some of the Tories who backed Brady were not willing to to do so if that was combined with a suggestion that a no-deal Brexit should be off the table. 2) The debate showed that MPs were only able to unite behind Brady because they could not agree what it meant. This became apparent during the opening of the debate (see 2.31pm) when Tory Brexiters were saying the Malthouse compromise should be official government policy, but Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, refused to concede this. 3) EU leaders, who were already extremely reluctant to offer much to the UK in terms of backstop concessions because they could not be sure what might get through parliament, will now almost certainly feel even less inclined to engage. It is hard to see the point in doing a deal with a leader who cannot get what she agrees through parliament. 4) New government evidence about how damaging a no-deal Brexit might be will have to be published soon. That was the last-minute concession announced by Chris Heaton-Harris. (See 4.47pm.) If it says what Anna Soubry thinks it will say, this will strengthen the hand of those MPs arguing that no deal should be ruled out \u2013 although there is a lot of evidence suggesting that the public at large are less concerned about these warnings. 5) May\u2019s defeat raises questions about the competence of the government\u2019s management of parliamentary business. Leavers and remainers were saying this morning that, if the government had consulted more widely when drafting its motion, the defeat could easily have been averted. (See 11.32am.) And it is also arguable that the government, instead of offering Soubry what she wanted, would have been better letting her put her amendment to a vote. It would have been defeated, but at least it would have lost on an issue where it was willing to lose. On the plus side, there would have been no vote on the main motion, meaning no split with the ERG and no prospect of the vote two weeks ago being arguably reversed. (See 3.39pm.) 6) Today\u2019s votes suggest that the debate due on Wednesday 27 February (see 9.19am) may end up being a decisive moment for Brexit. It is important to remember that today\u2019s debate essentially postponed key decisions; there was no vote on giving parliament the power to rule out a second referendum, and no vote on a second referendum. But those Tories planning to back the Yvette Cooper amendment and bill giving the Commons the power to rule out no deal will be emboldened \u2013 especially when they read the Number 10 statement implying May is attentive to MPs who want to keep no deal as an option (see 6.23pm) - and during the debate it became clear that Labour MPs determined to vote for a second referendum won\u2019t wait much longer (eg, see 2.55pm.) Downing Street has released this statement about the result. A spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn yet again put partisan considerations ahead of the national interest \u2013 and yet again, by voting against the government\u2019s motion, he is in effect voting to make no deal more likely. While we didn\u2019t secure the support of the Commons this evening, the prime minister continues to believe, and the debate itself indicated, that far from objecting to securing changes to the backstop that will allow us to leave with a deal, there was a concern from some Conservative colleagues about taking no deal off the table at this stage. The motion on 29 January remains the only one the House of Commons has passed expressing what it does want \u2013 and that is legally binding changes to address concerns about the backstop. The government will continue to pursue this with the EU to ensure we leave on time on 29 March. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in his point of order after the result was announced. Tonight\u2019s vote shows there\u2019s no majority for the prime minister\u2019s course of action, and yet again her government has been defeated. The government cannot keep on ignoring parliament or ploughing on towards 29 March without a coherent plan. She can\u2019t keep on just running down the clock and hoping that something will turn up that will save her day and save her face. This is from the Conservative MP Nick Boles, who is one of those in his party determined to do whatever he can to avoid a no-deal Brexit. In the Commons Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, claims that there is a majority in the Commons for the Malthouse compromise. Jeremy Corbyn rises to make a point of order. He says Theresa May should be here in person. It is surprising that she is not. He says should come back to the Commons and tell people what her plan is. MPs have delivered a significant blow to May\u2019s authority by rejecting her Brexit motion by 303 votes to 258 \u2013 a majority of 45. The defeat will have no practical effect, but it will reverse the modest achievement she achieved two weeks ago when she secured a majority for a Brexit motion. Seeing how hard she is finding it to maintain a Commons majority, EU leaders may feel even less inclined to offer her Brexit concessions than they already were. The government has lost, the cheering in the chamber suggests. One ERG Tory who is abstaining is Sir Bernard Jenkin. We can tell, because while other MPs are voting, he is on Sky News being interviewed live. He says these votes are not very important, or binding. But a lot of colleagues felt they were being \u201ctaken for a ride\u201d, he says. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, says Labour\u2019s decision to abstain on the SNP motion shows the Labour leadership \u201ccould be gearing up top be the midwives of a Tory Brexit\u201d. MPs are now voting on the government motion. I have quoted it already, but here it is again. That this house welcomes the prime minister\u2019s statement of 12 February 2019; reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January 2019 and notes that discussions between the UK and the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop are ongoing. The SNP amendment has been defeated by 315 votes to 93 - a majority of 222. Just like the Conservative party and Labour, the ERG are also split, This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. And this is from Business Insider\u2019s Adam Payne. More than 20 Labour MPs are voting with the SNP for an article 50 extension (see 5.22pm), my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Here is Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall on the results of the first vote. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh says some Labour MPs will defy orders to abstain and vote with the SNP for article 50 to be extended. Labour has more or less called for article 50 to be extended anyway - at PMQs last week, standing in for Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said \u201cthe sensible, cautious thing to do at this late stage is to seek a temporary extension of article 50 so that we have time to see whether the negotiations succeed\u201d - but the party is wary of being seen as wanting to delay Brexit and Corbyn himself, and party officials, are reluctant to confirm that Labour is formally proposing article 50 extension at this point. MPs are now voting on the SNP amendment. Here is the full text. Line 1, leave out from \u201chouse\u201d to end and add \u201crequires that a minister of the crown immediately begin negotiations with the European council to extend the period specified under article 50(3) of the treaty on European Union by no fewer than three months from 29 March 2019, and bring forward an appropriate amendment to section 20 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 to facilitate this change.\u201d. The Labour amendment has been defeated by 322 votes to 306 - a majority of 16. Here is the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth on what a government defeat on the main motion would mean. Anna Soubry has confirmed she is definitely pulling her amendment. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. See 3.39pm for an explanation as to why the Soubry amendment represented a potential escape hatch for the government. Here is the text of the Labour amendment. Line 1, leave out from \u201cHouse\u201d to end and add \u201crequires by 27 February 2019 a minister of the crown either (a) to move another motion under Section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or (b) to make a written statement declaring that there is no longer an agreement in principle in the negotiations with the European Union and to move no later than that date an amendable motion on how the government proposes to proceed.\u201d. MPs are now voting on the Labour amendment. We are now expecting three votes - this one, the one on the SNP amendment, and then the vote on the main motion. With the ERG abstaining on the main motion, there is now a good chance that the government will lose. The ERG has decided to abstain on the main government motion, an ERG source has announced. Chris Heaton-Harris, a Brexit minister, is now winding up for the government. He says he understands and respects Caroline Spelman\u2019s position. She is right to say the best way to avoid a no deal is to vote for the PM\u2019s deal, he says. Talking about the Anna Soubry amendment, he says there is a long-standing commitment that the government does not publish official advice. But he says the government is happy to meet Soubry, find the information that she wants and then publish that. Anna Soubry intervenes. She welcomes the offer. If the government does not comply, she can bring her amendment back, she says - implying she will withdraw her amendment. Soubry implies she will withdraw her amendment after government offers to publish the contents of the no-deal economic impact assessment she wants published. Back in the Commons, Chapman says Labour thinks MPs should get a vote on the Labour Brexit plan. If that does not happen, there should be a public vote, she says. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason on the outcome of the European Research Group meeting about the vote. Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister, is now winding up for Labour. MPs need to be honest, she says. She says they are not closer to breaking an impasse that must be broken. The government\u2019s motion is divorced from reality, she says. She says people living by the Irish border still do not know if that border will stay as as open as it is in 44 days\u2019 time. She says the country is in a crisis of the Tory party\u2019s making. Yet the government motion, saying how the Commons should respond, just says \u201cdiscussions between the UK and the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop are ongoing\u201d. She says the motion asks MPs to reiterate their support for the Brady amendment. But Labour will not do that, because it is not in the national interest. Theresa May is running down the clock, in the hope that the passage of time and a few reassurances can overturn a majority of 230. And Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, has posted a good thread on Twitter about what the EU thinks about what is taking place in London. It starts here. And here are two of her tweets. Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, has told a committee in the Irish parliament that his government is ramping up no-deal planning, the Irish Times\u2019 Simon Carswell reports. Mark Harper, the Conservative former chief whip, says he does not see any chance of the EU shifting until its summit starting on Thursday 21 March. If there is no agreement, the UK will have to choose between leaving without a deal and not leaving. He says delay does not solve the problem, because it just postpones the decision. And some of those pushing for an extension of article 50 want Brexit cancelled, he says. Here are some more extracts from speeches earlier in the debate, taken from the Press Association. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, said that Stephen Barclay\u2019s speech reminded him \u201cof a very badly written play in which some of the actors didn\u2019t seem to know their lines\u201d. He said hoping for changes to the backstop was pointless. The Malthouse compromise was seized upon like a thirsty man grabs at a drink in the desert and yet I fear it is a mirage. Because we all know the search for alternative arrangements didn\u2019t start two weeks ago, it\u2019s been going on for about two years. We are careering towards the cliff, she\u2019s at the wheel, and the Cabinet are sitting in the back seat. And at some point they are going to have to decide to lean over and take the steering wheel off her. Because if that doesn\u2019t happen then a no-deal Brexit might come to pass. And the Conservative Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash said he could not vote for the government motion because it was contradictory (because it implicitly endorses the amendment passed two weeks ago ruling out no deal, and the PM\u2019s statement keeping this open as an option). He said: We\u2019re now truly entering the world of George Orwell\u2019s Ministry of Truth. In his book 1984 Orwell said doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one\u2019s mind simultaneously and expecting both of them. This double motion is doublethink in action and I cannot possibly vote for it. The Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves thinks the Tory whips may be happy to see the Anna Soubry amendment going through. See 3.39pm for more on why that might be. Back in the Commons David TC Davies, the Tory Brexiter, says people who voted leave have been depicted as uneducated bigots. He says claims about what might happen under a no-deal Brexit have been Project Fear. People claim food will run out. But they also claim that farmers will be put out of business by cheap food imports, he says. He says these claims are ludicrous. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. John Peet, the Economist\u2019s political and Brexit editor, has posted a good Twitter thread on today\u2019s debate. It starts here. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European, says Britain would be better off staying in the EU. He says threatening to leave without a deal is like a three-year-old threatening to hold their breath unless they get the present they want. He says the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit. He says he does try to support the government. But he says his ability to support it could soon \u201crun out completely\u201d if it continues to act in this \u201ccrazy fashion\u201d. That seems to be a hint that he might resign the Tory whip over Brexit. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston claims that a government defeat on the Soubry motion (see 3.39pm) could still \u201cshred\u2019\u201d Theresa May\u2019s authority, because publication of the no-deal assessment would undermine her claim that leaving with no deal remains an option. But, according to HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, some in the ERG do not see it that way, because they think voters do not believe the no-deal warnings. For the record, here is the government motion being debated today. That this House welcomes the prime minister\u2019s statement of 12 February 2019; reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on 29 January 2019 and notes that discussions between the UK and the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop are ongoing. And here is the Anna Soubry motion. As I said earlier (see 12.27pm), this one seems to have a good chance of passing. Line 1, leave out from \u201cHouse\u201d to end and add \u201cinstructs the government within seven days to publish in full the most recent official briefing document, relating to business and trade, on the implications of a no-deal Brexit presented to cabinet.\u201d. But what I should also have pointed out earlier is that, if the Soubry amendment passes, then there will be no vote on the government motion. That is because it is not an amendment that adds text to the end of a motion; it is an amendment that effectively re-writes the whole thing - \u201cLine 1, leave out from \u201cHouse\u201d to end and add\u201d etc etc. The bad news for the government is that this means to story from tonight\u2019s debate could end up being a straight government defeat (albeit on something that would not de-rail government strategy - it is not hard to guess what the government\u2019s no-deal impact analysis will say, not least because no deal was covered in the impact analysis published in November). But, on the plus said, not having a vote on the main motion would mean that May would avoid a vote on an issue that would expose a split between the government and the ERG backbenchers. And if there is no vote on the main motion, the votes two weeks ago would still stand. Critics would not be able to say that MPs had voted down a motion reiterating something they voted for just two weeks ago. Here is more on the latest ERG thinking. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio. Henry Smith, a Tory Brexiter, is speaking now. He says if a referendum were held, which could overturn the result of the 2016 vote, the UK could see the sort of civil unrest seen recently in France. Here are some extracts from some of the earlier speeches in the debate. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, criticised the government for appeasing the European Research Group. He said: The government has pursued one of the factions on our side of the house, we have a kind of breakaway party within a party, a bit like Momentum really, they\u2019ve got their leader, they\u2019ve got their chief whip. Peter Grant, the SNP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said that extending article 50 (which is what the SNP amendment proposes) was essential. He said: The extension of article 50 has become an urgent prerequisite for anything else. We don\u2019t have time to spend tabling motions and having debates, we don\u2019t have time to spend developing substantial legislation, whether it\u2019s substantial legislation about a customs union, about a people\u2019s vote, or anything else. We don\u2019t have time unless we stop the clock. Dominic Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary because he could not support May\u2019s deal, said he might not back the government in the vote later because he was not satisfied that the government was taking the Malthouse compromise seriously. He said: We have heard nothing about whether [the Malthouse compromise] has been formally tabled with our EU friends and partners. I understand it has been raised and discussed with Michel Barnier but has a document, a written version of this, actually been shared? This was the basis on which the Brady amendment was adopted and I think it is a legitimate question to ask. At the moment I am struggling with the idea of voting for the principled motion but I will listen very carefully to the further assurances ministers will give in winding up because I would rather be in a position of supporting the government. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper said she was worried the government was living in \u201ca fantasy world\u201d. She said: If we don\u2019t do something sensible like [rule out no deal] it\u2019s like we\u2019re just all living in a fantasy world in which we talk about alternative arrangements ... we say something is going to come along and sort it out and it just doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re all standing around admiring the finery of the emperor\u2019s new clothes and actually the emperor is running around stark naked and everyone is laughing at us - or at least they would be if it wasn\u2019t so sad. Dame Caroline Spelman, the Conservative pro-European, says Midlands MPs like herself have been sounding the alarm about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on manufacturing. And she says says there are thousands of Britons living on the continent who receive ongoing medical care. They could lose that under a no-deal Brexit, she says. She says the government says it is trying to negotiate reciprocal healthcare. But there is no guarantee that these new arrangements will be passed in time, and some of them may have to come back to the UK. She says she will vote for the government motion. But she is not happy about the way Stephen Barclay interpreted it, she says. He is implying that the amendment (her amendment) passed two weeks ago ruling out no deal does not count. Chris Leslie, the Labour pro-European, says he does not understand why Labour is not calling for a second referendum now. He says the party seems to have regressed; two weeks ago the Labour motion did mention a public vote, but today\u2019s does not. He says he feels that people who want a second referendum \u201care being played for fools by the leadership of the Labour party\u201d. UPDATE: Here is a direct quote. The idea that the Labour party is not together and arguing against this tragedy, this disaster, it is for me entirely heartbreaking. When I see the amendment put down by the Labour frontbench and I do no longer see those words \u2018option of a public vote\u2019, which was there on 29 January, I think to myself \u2018why are we regressing in our party\u2019s policy passed at September conference?\u2019 I applaud [Geraint Davies and Sarah Wollaston] who have tried to put this question - Labour party policy - on to the order paper today. This new euphemism of \u2018options on the table\u2019 is absolutely not acceptable and I certainly feel we are being played for fools by the leadership of the Labour party on this particular issue. By now we should have reached the stage of a public vote. Nobody can explain to me seriously ... why we are not at that particular stage right now. The truth is that the party political system is shattered. It is broken and letting this country down at a crucial time. I believe that it is a moment we needed leadership but what we are seeing sadly is party political calculations, party political advantage, tragically putting themselves ahead of the national interest. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former Cabinet Office minister, is speaking now. (I will post excerpts from some of the speeches I missed while posting the summary of the opening of the debate shortly.) He says he expected today\u2019s debate to be relatively routine, but in fact it has been very revealing, he says. He says the exchanges at the start of the debate \u2013 he seems to be referring in particular to Stephen Barclay\u2019s response to David Davis (see 2.31pm) \u2013 were \u201crather horrifying\u201d. He says they have driven him to a conclusion he has gradually been forming. When the chips are down, [Theresa May] will actually prefer to do what some of my esteemed colleagues prefer, and to head for the exit door without a deal, which the secretary of state informed us is the policy of Her Majesty\u2019s government in the event that her deal has not succeeded. That is terrifying fact. What was significant about the Brady amendment passed two weeks ago is that it managed to unite the Conservative party behind a Brexit proposition. Only eight Tories voted against. But managing to come up with a Brexit stance acceptable to remainers and leavers in the party is much harder than it looks and, in his speech opening the debate, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, struggled considerably. He arrived armed with a no-deal assurance intended to go down well with the hardliners in the European Research Group, and some conciliatory language about the so-called Malthouse compromise, which is viewed as the holy grail by some Brexiters. But quite quickly it became apparent that he was not giving them quite as much as they wanted. And, in the second half of his speech, after he tacked towards leave, remainers in the party started standing up in the chamber to complain. It is not clear yet what will happen in the vote on the main motion, but Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs at Number 10, concluded after hearing Barclay\u2019s speech that the government was in real trouble. Sir Keir Starmer, Barclay\u2019s shadow, was responding for Labour and the opening of his speech, which focused on the folly of Theresa May thinking that she will be able to achieve changes to the Brexit deal now which have eluded her for weeks, was excellent. But Labour is also a party deeply divided over Brexit and towards the end he faced strong criticism from some Labour pro-Europeans who want the party to commit to a second referendum now. He was unable to give them the assurances they wanted to hear, just as he also struggled to explain why Labour was at once accepting the need for a backstop while having reservations about it. Here are the main points. Barclay insisted that the government was willing to leave the EU on 29 March without a deal. Earlier this week Olly Robbins, Theresa May\u2019s chief Brexit adviser, suggested in a conversation overheard in Brussels, that this would not be an option. Barclay was responding to a question from the Brexiter David Davis who asked for an assurance that the UK would still leave on 29 March in the event of May not getting an acceptable deal. Barclay replied: I\u2019m very happy to give [Davis] that assurance. This seemed designed to mollify the ERG Brexiters who do not want to back the main government motion because it implicitly endorses the vote two weeks ago ruling out no deal. Davis seemed happy with what he heard. But Barclay refused to say that the Malthouse compromise was now official government policy. Two Tory Brexiters, Charlie Elphicke and Owen Paterson, asked him to give this commitment. Barclay said that May has promised to engage seriously with the plan, and he said this included \u201cinvesting civil service resource in exploring its viability and its acceptability to the [Northern Ireland] community as a whole\u201d. He also said he had discussed the idea with the EU. But he refused to describe it as official government policy, and he said that Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, had raised doubts about it. Barclay was strongly criticised by Tory remainers for saying a no-deal Brexit remained an option, even though MPs voted to reject it two weeks ago. Justine Greening, the former education secretary, said the government could not \u201cpick and choose\u201d which votes it supported, describing this approach as \u201cfundamentally wrong and anti-democratic\u201d. And Dame Caroline Spelman, the former environment secretary who tabled the motion ruling out no deal passed by MPs two weeks ago, said that if the government did not give that vote as much respect as the vote for the Brady amendment, that would be \u201ccontemptuous of this house\u201d. Starmer said the government\u2019s search for an alternative to the backstop was pointless. He told MPs: The simple and painful truth is this: if there had been a viable alternative to the backstop there would never have been a backstop. He described the Labour amendment as being on putting a \u201chard stop\u201d on May\u2019s Brexit strategy. He said: Labour\u2019s amendment today is intended to put a hard stop to running down the clock. It says that on 27 February the government must put a deal to the house for its approval or bring an amendable motion so the house can take control of what happens next and it\u2019s essential that we do so. Starmer used to be director of public prosecutions and a \u201chard stop\u201d is a police term for what happens when a car carrying a suspect is halted, often by armed officers. But Labour\u2019s version, presumably, would not involve firearms. According to ITV\u2019s Paul Brand, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the ERG, is saying Brexiters are unlikely to vote against the government on the main motion tonight. But Brand concedes the ERG has not taken a final position. It is worth pointing out that \u201cvoting against\u201d is not the same as supporting. On the basis of this quote, the ERG could end up abstaining on the main motion, which could lead to the government being defeated. And this is from Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee. This is from the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, is speaking now. I will post a summary of the main points from the opening of the debate shortly, and catch up with Clarke speech a bit later. A European Research Group source says it will be meeting at 4pm to decide how it will vote at 5pm. (With three amendments, and then a vote on the main motion, all the voting should be over by around 6pm.) Starmer says further steps should be taken, beyond what is in Labour\u2019s amendment. He backs the Yvette Cooper amendment and bill designed to allow MPs to vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Labour\u2019s Gareth Snell asks what would happen if article 50 was extended for more than three months. Would the UK participate in the European elections? Starmer says the EU would agree an extension up to the start of July, because then the UK would not need to participate in those elections. He says it is not policy to participate in them. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw says the party is leaving it too late to back a people\u2019s vote. Starmer says Labour put its Brexit plan in its letter to Theresa May. That has been well received by business leaders and by the EU. May has replied in non-committal terms. He says he won\u2019t discuss what is happening in the cross-party talks, because they are confidential. Labour\u2019s Chris Leslie says, at the party conference, Starmer took the applause when he said a second referendum was an option. Leslie says Labour should commit to one at the next available opportunity. Starmer says he thinks everyone knows what he thinks about a second referendum. Sarah Wollaston, the Tory pro-European, asks at what point Jeremy Corbyn will unequivocally back a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Starmer says the Labour amendment today would put a \u201chard stop\u201d to the Brexit process. At the point Labour would take a position. It would consider what views were in the Commons. Starmer says the Spelman amendment passed two weeks ago, ruling out no deal, should be just as binding on the government as the Brady amendment. Phillip Lee, a Conservative pro-European, asks what Labour would do if the UK faces a no-deal Brexit at the end of March. Starmer says Labour agreed a position at its party conference. He says the party agreed it would do whatever was necessary to avoid a hard deal. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley asks if it is Labour\u2019s position that there must be legally binding changes to the backstop. Starmer says Labour has concerns about the backstop. But it also accepts that need for a backstop. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from Northern Ireland, says there is confusion about Labour\u2019s position. Starmer says he knows how important this is. Labour accepts a backstop is inevitable, notwithstanding its concerns. Starmer says threatening to leave on 29 March without a deal is not a credible negotiating position. He says MPs have heard the warnings from Airbus and Nissan about the impact of a no-deal. Yesterday Ford said no deal would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the car industry. Alex Chalk, a Tory, says if Labour takes these warnings seriously, it should have voted for May\u2019s deal. Starmer says Tories did not vote for the deal either. And Conservative MP, including Theresa May, only voted for the Brady amendment because it demanded changes to the deal. Starmer says Labour\u2019s amendment is designed to put a \u201chard stop\u201d to Brexit. It says either May has to agree a deal by 27 February, or else the Commons will move on to something else. Shailesh Vara, a Conservative, says the UK is negotiating the biggest business deal in its history. It has to hold its nerve, and not rule out a no deal, because the EU will give in at the last minute, he says. Starmer says he wants to let Vara down gently. The UK is just not prepared for a no-deal Brexit, he says. There are people in custody who could not be extradited under a no-deal Brexit. Starmer says Tories used to complain that publishing impact assessments would undermine the UK\u2019s negotiating position, and they were wrong. They used to complain publishing the legal advice would undermine the UK\u2019s negotiating position, and they were wrong. Now the Tories are saying the same about ruling out a no-deal Brexit. The SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins asks if Labour will back the SNP amendment calling three-month extension to article 50 so that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Starmer says he is sympathetic to this argument. He says Labour will be backing the Yvette Cooper amendment (due to be debated on 27 February, not today) designed to allow MPs to vote to block a no-deal Brexit. On the prospect of May taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March without a deal, he says: \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d He says he does not think May would actually agree to a no-deal Brexit. Labour\u2019s Chuka Umunna says the problem is May\u2019s refusal to face down \u201cthe party within a party\u201d that is the ERG. Starmer agrees. The SNP\u2019s Angus MacNeil says the Malthouse compromise is the \u201cMalthouse fantasy\u201d. Starmer says the government has not adopted this as its policy position. The simple and painful truth is this. If there had been a viable alternative to the backstop, there would not have been a backstop. Starmer says the EU and the UK \u201csearched and searched and searched\u201d for an alternative to the backstop but could not find one. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden says all these \u201calternative arrangements\u201d are just \u201cBrexit unicorns\u201d. Isn\u2019t the government just hoping Chancellor Merkel will come to the rescue and throw Ireland under the bus? Starmer says he agrees. Starmer says May has spent \u201cweeks and weeks and weeks trying to negotiate changes to the backstop ... and she has got absolutely nowhere\u201d. He says the idea that the vote on 29 January gave clarity is \u201cfor the birds\u201d. Uniting around a proposition that means different things to different people does not help, he says. He says May has called for either a time limit to the backstop, or a unilateral exit mechanism, or alternative arrangements. The first two options have been repeatedly ruled out by the EU. And the third is undefined. He says Barclay gave the game away. If the Malthouse compromise was really viable, Barclay would say the government was adopting it as policy. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is now responding for Labour. He says it is obvious what May is up to. She is pretending to make progress, while running down the clock. He says in December May pulled the vote on her deal, promising to make progress on the backstop. That was 66 days ago. May went back to the EU, but \u201creturned with nothing\u201d. All she got was \u201cwarm words\u201d from the EU, and letter repeating existing commitments. May lost the vote on 15 January. Then she promised again to get changes to the backstop. But, when MPs voted on this on 29 January, May voted against the deal she had negotiated, he says. He says anyone who has spoken to the EU will now how much that did to damage trust. Barclay says MPs need to give the government more time. It is time for MPs to hold their nerve, he says. And that is it. He has finished. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn has a good summary of the state of play so far. Barclay says the EU has said it will not re-open the withdrawal agreement. But it has also said that it wants a deal, he says. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from Northern Ireland, asks Barclay to confirm that the government has no intention of replacing the backstop, which is essential for Northern Ireland. Barclay says the government is discussing what to do next with it. Owen Paterson, the Tory Brexiter, says the Brady amendment said the backstop should be replaced. Can Barclay confirm the Malthouse compromise is now government policy, and that civil servants will work it up into legally binding text. Barclay says he has already said the government is taking this proposal, and that it has discussed it with the EU, but that Barnier has doubts about whether it could be implemented on time. Barclay says the government will get civil servants to look into the viability of using alternative arrangements to replace the backstop. He says he raised the possibility of using alternative arrangements to replace the backstop in his talks with Michel Barnier. But Barnier was sceptical about whether this could be done in time. Charlie Elphicke, a Tory Brexiter, asks if the so-called Malthouse compromise is now government policy. Barclay says he has already taken this forward in his talks with the EU. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, intervenes. He points out that Donald Tusk said on Twitter yesterday that he had not received concrete proposals from the UK. (See 9.28am.) Barclay says you should be cautious of what is put on Twitter. He says these ideas have been put forward to the EU. Dame Caroline Spelman intervenes. She says the government motion endorses the Commons decision from two weeks ago. Two amendments were passed that night \u2013 one of which was hers, ruling out a no-deal Brexit. She accuses Barclray of being contemptuous of the views of the Commons. Barclay says the government respects the views of the house. But he says he was just trying to set out the legislative position. Justine Greening. the Tory pro-European, says the Commons voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit. She says the government cannot just pick and choose which votes it accepts. Barclay says he has just set out the position as agreed by cabinet, and the legal position. He says the Commons vote two weeks ago, for the Caroline Spelman amendment, does not change government policy. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP, asks Barclay if he is saying that the government will really go ahead with a no-deal Brexit on 29 March, regardless. She says this would have damaging security consequences. Barclay says the government\u2019s position has not changed. It is committed to getting a deal, he says. He says he thinks a no-deal Brexit would be disruptive \u2013 more so than some of his colleagues. But the legal position is that the UK will leave on 29 March, he says. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is opening the debate now. Here is Sky\u2019s Kate McCann on an exchange Barclay had with David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, a few minutes ago. John Bercow\u2019s decision to call the Anna Soubry amendment is significant, because its supporters think they have enough votes to get it through. These are from Labour\u2019s Chuka Umunna, who is a co-backer of the amendment with Soubry. And this is from Dan Sabbagh. John Bercow, the speaker, says he is calling three amendments: Labour\u2019s, the SNP\u2019s and Anna Soubry\u2019s. (See 10.45am.) That means there will not be a vote on an amendment proposing a second referendum, or on an amendment proposing indicative votes. The business motion for the debate has gone through on the nod. Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra makes a point of order, and suggests Theresa May should be here to open the debate, or at least listen to the opening of the debate, in person. Bercow says there is no need for May to be here. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle is raising a point of order about today\u2019s debate. She says people say today\u2019s motion is non-binding. But when she first became an MP, the government took all motions seriously. She says she deplores the way people are now trying to claim some motions are binding and some are not. Sir Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, says his committee produced a report on this very subject. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he is conscious of a concern on this front. Ken Clarke, the father of the house, has said the same, based on his 48 years\u2019 experience in the Commons. Bercow says some votes are just an expression of opinion, and some are genuinely binding; they are orders, \u201ceffective\u201d on the government. He says there will be a debate today, and subsequent debates too. If there is an appetite in the Commons for further debate, \u201cthat appetite will be met\u201d, he says. Ken Clarke rises. He says he accepts the point about different types of motion, but he says a vote that expresses the views of the Commons on a matter of policy should be binding. The Brexit debate will start very soon. John Bercow, the Speaker, is just taking points of order first. Members of the European Research Group do not always agree on political tactics and they may well split today. At the moment they are saying different things. I have been told just now by one of them that the ERG will decide later at a meeting how it will vote. But others are saying it will abstain. This is from Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs at Number 10, on today\u2019s debate. This is from the Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. At the lobby briefing this morning Downing Street restated its call for MPs to back the government motion, to show Brussels parliament has united around a position, the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar reports. And it insisted that a no-deal Brexit was still an option, despite MPs voting to reject this two weeks ago. On BBC News this morning Sir Bernard Jenkin, a leading Tory Brexiter and a supporter of the European Research Group, criticised Downing Street for not consulting Conservative backbenchers before tabling today\u2019s motion. \u201cThe lack of consultation has not improved the atmosphere of trust,\u201d he said. From the other end of the Conservative spectrum on Europe, Nicky Morgan, who is planning to vote for the government this afternoon, is making exactly the same point. This is from Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra. This morning the Guardian splashed on a story saying Jeremy Corbyn faces up to 10 resignations from the Labour frontbench if he fails to back a second referendum. In a blog that is attracting considerable interest at Westminster this morning, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says the looming Labour split may come very soon. Although, as she also points out, it may not .... Here is an extract. It\u2019s no secret that a small group of Labour MPs has been discussing for many months whether to leave the party, and if so, when and how. For any MP, this is a huge decision. For many of them, whatever their tribe, their political party is like part of their family, certainly a huge part of the fabric of their lives. But there\u2019s a rising expectation that under stress, a small-ish group of Labour MPs might be ready to say goodbye to that, and quite soon ... Some of those involved have talked in the last 24 hours as if it is inevitably going to happen, and maybe in the next few days. Others are far more cagey, and are dousing expectations. But there is a detectable sense among those who have been discussing departure for many many months, that if they are ever going to do it, then the moment is coming soon, perhaps very, very soon. There are now 10 proper amendments to the government\u2019s Brexit motion on the Commons order paper (pdf), plus an amendment to the Labour amendment. Here is a quick list summarising them: 1) The Labour amendment setting 27 February as the deadline for Theresa May to get a deal. 2) A Ken Clarke amendment saying there should be a ballot, allowing MPs to choose from a range of Brext options using the alternative vote system (ie, with the least popular being eliminated, until one option has got more than 50% support). 3) An Angus Brendan MacNeil amendment saying article 50 should be revoked. 4) An Anna Soubry amendment saying the government should publish its official advice about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. 5) A Sarah Wollaston amendment saying MPs should vote on various Brexit options, and that if more than one is approved, all approved options should be put to the public in a referendum. 6) A Plaid Cymru amendment calling for an extension of article 50 and a referendum. 7) The Geraint Davies amendment backing a deal, subject to changes in line with Labour\u2019s demands and subject to it being put to the public in a referendum. 8) The SNP amendment calling for article 50 to be delayed for at least three months. 9) A Lib Dem amendment saying, if there is no deal by 27 February, May should ask to extend article 50 to allow for a referendum. 10) The Roger Godsiff amendment calling for a three-option referendum. We probably won\u2019t find out which amendments are going to be called (ie, put to a vote) until the start of the debate. It is up to John Bercow, the speaker, to decide. He will call the Labour one and then probably several others (perhaps Anna Soubry\u2019s, the SNP\u2019s, and either Ken Clarke or Sarah Wollaston\u2019s, but that is just my guess). The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford has been explaining why the party has tabled an amendment to today\u2019s motion requiring the UK government to begin immediate negotiations with the European council to extend article 50 by no less than three months. He told BBC Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme that it was \u201cthe height of irresponsibility to be dangling this threat of crashing out without a deal\u201d. He added: \u201cParliament has the chance to instruct the government to act and it must do so.\u201d Meanwhile, the first minster, Nicola Sturgeon, has said that the Scottish government has stepped up its preparations for a no-deal Brexit. Speaking after a meeting of the Scottish cabinet in Glasgow yesterday, she told BBC Scotland that it was \u201creckless and negligent\u201d for the UK government to refuse to rule out no-deal, adding: But we appear to be dealing with a UK government that\u2019s prepared to act recklessly and negligently. Therefore as of today we have stepped up our no-deal planning. We don\u2019t think it should be inevitable, we\u2019ll do everything in our power to help rule that out. But we would not be doing our job properly if we didn\u2019t properly plan as best we can, because not all of the consequences will be able to be mitigated. Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister who is now deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents around 50 hardline Tory Brexiters who are threatening not to back the government this afternoon, has responded to Liam Fox\u2019s claim (see 9.19am) that they will undermine the government\u2019s negotiating strategy if they rebel. There is an inherent contradiction in Baker\u2019s argument. On the one hand, he is implying that today\u2019s vote does not really matter: \u201cnon-binding motion\u201d, \u201cstorm in a teacup\u201d, are the EU really watching anyway? (Actually, they are; the key EU players are following domestic UK politics very, very closely at the moment.) But, on the other hand, he is saying that even implicitly agreeing that a no-deal Brexit is not an option is unacceptable. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has given an interview to the Spanish newspaper El Pais in the course of which he said that Brexit would leave the UK a middling economy stuck in the Atlantic, \u201ctoo small to appear on the world stage on its own\u201d. Here are the key extracts. P. El Brexit ha sido la otra gran sacudida. Hay quien interpreta que la UE quedar\u00e1 debilitada con la salida de Reino Unido. R. Quien va a salir debilitado del Brexit es Reino Unido. Ya se est\u00e1 debilitando, es un pa\u00eds menguante si se compara a hace dos o tres a\u00f1os. Se va a convertir en una econom\u00eda de tama\u00f1o intermedio en un lugar del oc\u00e9ano Atl\u00e1ntico. No es ni EE UU ni la UE. Es demasiado peque\u00f1o para presentarse en la escena mundial por s\u00ed solo. P. \u00bfCree que se puede alcanzar un acuerdo antes del 29 de marzo? R. Mi impresi\u00f3n es que la bola avanza hacia el precipicio y todo el mundo grita que se pare, pero nadie hace nada para pararla, al menos, desde el lado brit\u00e1nico. Algunos parlamentarios brit\u00e1nicos dicen que queremos atraparles en un limbo permanente. Pero no es verdad. A la UE le interesa pasar cuanto antes a la siguiente fase y comenzar una nueva relaci\u00f3n con Reino Unido. Pero dado el empe\u00f1o de May en renegociar la salvaguarda irlandesa, no s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo va a terminar esto y si podremos evitar un Brexit duro, que ser\u00eda devastador para Reino Unido. And here is a translation, mostly from Google Translate, but with some tidying up from me to make it more colloquial. Q: Brexit has been the other great shock. Some people think that the EU will be weakened by the departure of the United Kingdom. A: It is the UK that will be weakened. It is already weakening; it is on the wane compared to two or three years ago. It is going to become a middling economy stuck in the Atlantic Ocean. It is neither the US nor the EU. It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own. Q: Do you think an agreement can be reached before March 29? A: My impression is that the ball is advancing towards the precipice and everyone is screaming stop, but nobody is doing anything to prevent it, at least from the British side. Some British parliamentarians say that we want to trap them in a permanent limbo. But it is not true. The EU is interested in moving to the next phase as soon as possible and starting a new relationship with the United Kingdom. But given May\u2019s efforts to renegotiate the Irish backstop, I do not know how this will end and whether we can avoid a hard Brexit. It would be devastating for the UK. Remember, the Netherlands is one of the UK\u2019s closest allies in the EU (a point that Rutte also makes in the interview, when he says the departure of the UK means his country will have to replace it as the leading champion of free trade and open markets in the union). The Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge says that Rutte\u2019s comments are partly explained by Dutch domestic politics. This is what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, posted on Twitter last night. With another big Brexit debate coming today, you could be forgiven for getting confused over what all these debates and votes are about. So, as a public service, here is quick recap. There are two sorts of Brexit debate on the schedule at the moment: a so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d (MV), a vote intended to approve a deal with the EU; and what some are calling a \u201cnext steps\u201d (NS) debate, a debate scheduled because the MV was not passed, allowing MPs to vote on amendments about what should happen next, or \u201cplan B\u201d. We have had one MV so far. That was on 15 January, and it led to Theresa May\u2019s deal being voted down by a record majority of 230. And we have had one NS debate on 29 January, which led to May winning a vote on the Brady amendment (saying her deal should be passed, subject to the backstop being replaced) but losing a vote on the Spelman amendment (a non-binding one ruling out no deal). Today we have got NS2. As Rowena Mason reports in her overnight preview (see below) May faces the risk of defeat on the main motion because Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group may not support her. A defeat would have no direct, practical effect, but it would nevertheless amount to a serious setback. After NS1, May was able to tell the EU that she had secured a Commons majority for at least something. A defeat today would imply that that majority has gone, which could leave Brussels wondering whether May is in a position to get anything through parliament. In this process MV debates are more important than NS ones. Today\u2019s NS vote (NS2) could turn out to be quite significant, but NS3, which is due to take place on Wednesday 27 February, will be much more decisive, because this will be when Tory pro-Europeans could unite with the opposition to pass the Yvette Cooper amendment designed to allow MPs to vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit. This may also be the moment when Labour frontbenchers resign if Jeremy Corbyn does not firmly back a second referendum. With most observers now thinking MV2 will not take place until March, possibly after the EU summit and only days before Brexit day on 29 March, there is also a chance that we may even get NS4 or NS5 debates in early March too. I hope that\u2019s all clear. Downing Street is still hoping to persuade the ERG to back the government in the vote this afternoon. On the Today programme this morning Liam Fox, the Brexiter international trade secretary said that if Tories did not back May, they would undermine her in the Brexit negotiations with Brussels. He said that some MPs saw voting as an \u201cacademic and ideological purity exercise\u201d but that in reality this was about \u201cthe raw politics of negotiation and ... about sending signals about continuity and trustworthiness in negotiation.\u201d He explained: What we say is looked at and listened to by those that we are negotiating with. They will be looking to see whether parliament is showing consistency because in the debates and the votes we had recently there were two things: one was that parliament said we don\u2019t want there to be no deal, and that we will sign up to the prime minister\u2019s deal if we are able to get changes to the Irish backstop. Our European partners will be watching our debate and listening today to see if they get the impression that if they were to make those concessions, parliament would definitely deliver on that ... I think that there\u2019s a danger that we send the wrong signals and I think that we need to understand that the public want us to leave the European Union but they would prefer us to leave the European Union with a deal. And therefore parliament has got a duty to ensure that we send the correct signals that represent those views of the British people and represent them to those we are negotiating with. Here is the agenda for the day. After 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, announces next week\u2019s Commons business. 11pm: Various Labour MPs are due to speak at a Love Socialism Hate Brexit event in the Commons. After 11.30am: MPs start the Brexit debate. John Bercow, the speaker, will announce which amendments will be put to a vote. 5pm: MPs start voting on the Brexit amendments. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on the Brexit debate. I will post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is set to face intense pressure from remain-minded Conservative MPs to finally face down hardline Brexiters in her party after a planned restatement of a departure strategy agreed two weeks ago by the Commons was defeated. Abstentions by MPs from the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) played a big part in seeing the government motion voted down after the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, was unable to persuade them it did not take a no-deal departure off the table. While May loyalists scrambled to play down the importance of the vote, privately MPs and even some ministers were furious at the ERG and insistent the prime minister had to change course in the coming days. \u201cThere is a degree of wishful thinking going on that the EU can ever do enough to satisfy the Brexit extremists,\u201d one minister said. \u201cShe wants to try to square the circle and it\u2019s just not looking likely. She has a choice: seek the agreement across the House or the country will be out without a deal. They don\u2019t compromise, they never have.\u201d Ahead of another promised government Brexit motion at the end of the month, a number of ministers are known to be considering voting for amendments that could meaningfully stop no deal or extend article 50, such as one proposed previously by Yvette Cooper. \u201c[May] is worried about splitting the party but the party could split either way,\u201d the minister said. \u201cShe should be worried about our side of the party. In parliament there is nowhere else for the ERG to go but there is potentially somewhere else for the remain wing to go, we are more likely to trigger a realignment.\u201d A cabinet source said: \u201cOnce again the ERG have made life hell for the prime minister and put their own fantasies in the way of pragmatic politics.\u201d One former minister said the \u201cfake consensus\u201d in the party around the Brady amendment had been exposed by Wednesday night\u2019s vote. \u201cIt was never going to last. She has to pick. Either she\u2019s serious about doing a no deal if necessary, in which case she\u2019s a Ukip prime minister, and keeps the ERG onside but fractures the rest of the party, or she rules it out and she\u2019s a Conservative PM but loses the ERG. At the moment she\u2019s nowhere and pleasing no one. It\u2019s about choices. And she won\u2019t make one.\u201d Others were as outspoken in public. After the defeat Nick Boles, the Grantham MP who has been central to efforts to prevent no deal, tweeted: \u201cMaybe, just maybe, the penny will now drop with prime minister and her chief whip that the hardliners in the ERG want a no-deal Brexit and will stop at nothing to get it.\u201d Tory MP Heidi Allen said it was clear the Eurosceptics were now intending to force a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThe ERG, as many of us have been saying to the prime minister for well over a year now, are in control and always have been,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir game plan has been unwavering from the beginning in its determination to achieve no deal. Parliament must be given the opportunity to take control of the process and try and coalesce around a softer Brexit position. If this is not possible, as is highly likely, we must put the question back to the public.\u201d Anna Soubry, an anti-Brexit Tory MP, said she was \u201cabsolutely delighted\u201d the government agreed to release details of cabinet briefings on the consequences of no deal, meaning she could withdraw her amendment seeking this. But Soubry told the BBC: \u201cWhat an absolute fiasco this is. It\u2019s a lack of leadership in both of our broken parties, and frankly we need a different, better way of doing politics in this country, and we need it now.\u201d Brexiter Tories blamed the defeat on what one, Bernard Jenkin, called \u201cthe government\u2019s clumsiness\u201d. Steve Baker, deputy chair of the ERG, used a point of order after the vote result to urge May to devote her efforts to pushing the so-called Malthouse compromise, a plan drawn up by a series of Conservative MPs to circumvent the controversial Irish border backstop through as-yet-unknown technology to avoid customs checks. James Cleverly, a Conservative party vice-chair and a key May loyalist, insisted that MPs and the EU should read \u201cnot very much\u201d into the vote. \u201cThe more significant votes were the votes we had last month which showed that the House didn\u2019t agree with the first draft of the withdrawal agreement, made the point that the backstop was where the difficulty lay, and that if she were able to make amendments around the backstop, that would be something that would probably command a majority,\u201d he told the BBC. The complex and precarious choreography for the government was obvious from the start of the opening speech in the debate, by Barclay. While the mass of Tory MPs were happy with the main element of the motion \u2013 tasking May with seeking a revised departure deal \u2013 the other amendment passed a fortnight ago, which sought to rule out no deal, was worrying Brexiters. In what seemed like a planned move, Barclay\u2019s predecessor as Brexit secretary, David Davis, intervened in the speech to seek reassurance Brexit would happen on 29 March, whatever the circumstances. Barclay said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to do that. While this was intended to mollify the ERG it prompted angry interventions from other Conservatives, including Caroline Spelman, whose amendment two weeks ago had sought to stop no deal. It would be \u201ccontemptuous of this house\u201d if Barclay sought to erase the vote for her amendment, Spelman said. Justine Greening, the former education secretary, also raised her concerns: \u201cThe reality is that the vote against no deal in this house was more convincingly passed, including with cross-party support, than the vote to have the prime minister go back and negotiate on alternative arrangements.

It says there will be almost no scope for environmental flows unless it rains, and the focus will be \u201con providing drought refuges and avoiding irreversible loss of species\u201d. The authority also warns that there are almost no reserves of environmental water in the northern basin and that, as a result of above-average temperatures and low inflows over successive years, some important wetlands and floodplain forests have not received water for long periods. Conditions in the lower Darling are particularly severe and the length and duration of cease-to-flow events have skyrocketed since 2000, the report says. It acknowledges this is due to extraction by irrigators upstream as well as climate.</p> <p><strong>Michaelia Cash\u2019s former chief of staff, Ben Davies, said in a statement to police </strong><strong> that an employee of the union regulator told him police were set to raid the offices of the Australian Workers Union</strong><strong>,</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/14/former-michaelia-cash-staffer-says-union-regulator-employee-tipped-him-off-about-awu-raid\"> a court has heard</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 15 February. Top stories The outlook for the Murray-Darling basin is \u201cextremely challenging\u201d, particularly in the north, according to the authority\u2019s outlook for the next year. It says there will be almost no scope for environmental flows unless it rains, and the focus will be \u201con providing drought refuges and avoiding irreversible loss of species\u201d. The authority also warns that there are almost no reserves of environmental water in the northern basin and that, as a result of above-average temperatures and low inflows over successive years, some important wetlands and floodplain forests have not received water for long periods. Conditions in the lower Darling are particularly severe and the length and duration of cease-to-flow events have skyrocketed since 2000, the report says. It acknowledges this is due to extraction by irrigators upstream as well as climate. Michaelia Cash\u2019s former chief of staff, Ben Davies, said in a statement to police that an employee of the union regulator told him police were set to raid the offices of the Australian Workers Union, a court has heard. Davies gave evidence in federal court on Thursday. His former boss, Cash, is due to appear in the witness stand for the civil trial today. The union is seeking to quash an investigation into historic donations it made to GetUp, a probe launched by the Registered Organisations Commission launched in October 2017. Cash was forced to front the Senate to address her previous claim that only one member of her staff had been involved in the leaks \u2013 and that her former media adviser David De Garis had learned about the raids from a \u201cmedia source\u201d. A day of high drama in Canberra culminated with the Senate president withdrawing the parliamentary pass of Pauline Hanson\u2019s senior adviser, James Ashby, after his altercation on Wednesday night with former One Nation senator Brian Burston. Burston vowed to refer the scuffle to police and to seek a restraining order against Ashby, but also offered an apology for smearing blood on the door of Hanson\u2019s office that evening. It\u2019s not the first time Ashby has courted controversy in his colourful career. And, after a day of political intrigue, insults and time-wasting, Katherine Murphy\u2019s writes that it\u2019s hard to capture \u201cthe precise form of unhinging that is playing out\u201d in the final days of the 45th parliament. World Theresa May has suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of hardline Brexit supporters who refused to support her approach to leaving the EU. A group of Eurosceptics led by Jacob Rees-Mogg abstained on a government motion because they were unhappy that it appeared to rule out a no-deal Brexit. May was not present for the House of Commons defeat, by 303 votes to 258, in which she again lost control of her party in the crucial final weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU on 29 March. The former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe has said top Trump administration officials talked seriously about removing Donald Trump from office just months after he become president. McCabe said there were meetings at the justice department to discuss whether he could be removed under the 25th amendment. The UK security minister has said he would not put officials\u2019 lives at risk to rescue UK citizens who went to Syria and Iraq to join Islamic State, insisting \u201cactions have consequences\u201d. The statement comes after Shamima Begum, one of three pupils from London who joined Isis four years ago, told the Times she wanted to return to the UK. The creators of a revolutionary AI system that can write news stories and works of fiction \u2013 dubbed \u201cdeepfakes for text\u201d \u2013 have taken the unusual step of not releasing their research publicly, for fear of potential misuse. The company, backed by Elon Musk, say they need more time to consider the ramifications of the technological breakthrough, and the consequences of it falling into the wrong hands. An experimental drug that bolsters ailing brain cells has raised hopes of a treatment for memory loss, poor decision making and other mental impairments that often strike in old age. Tests in the lab showed that old animals had far better memory skills half an hour after receiving the drug, and after two months brain cells which had shrunk in the animals had grown back, scientists found. Opinion and analysis Zo\u00eb Foster Blake is a 38-year-old powerhouse who is responsible for nine books, two kids, 600,000 Instagram followers and a cult skincare line \u2013 but says she never set out to achieve so much. So why has this this beauty and love guru captured the hearts of Australian millennial women \u2013 and will she ever allow herself a break? \u201cI need to see a therapist, because I want to know where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a chronic over-busyness. If I have a void I have to fill it ... I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy; I wish I could just stop sometimes.\u201d Brigid Delaney only spent 70 nights at home last year, so upon returning to her property she decided to host some drinks for the neighbours. Then finds out what has been happening at her house while she\u2019s been away, and happened there before she owned it. \u201cMy neighbours were such innocents. Why did I have to taint this piece of rural paradise with these weird, horny guests?\u201d Sport Since the shock decision nearly a month ago to sack Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, the timbre of conversation surrounding women\u2019s football in Australia has degenerated precariously. But Saturday\u2019s W-League grand final between Sydney FC and Sam Kerr\u2019s Perth Glory will put focus back on the football and give the players a chance to return to centre stage, after a lamentable few weeks for the game, writes Richard Parkin. Caster Semenya\u2019s lawyers said the 800m Olympic champion is \u201cunquestionably a woman\u201d, who will be fighting for her right to compete internationally without \u201cunnecessary medical intervention\u201d when she appears at the court of arbitration for sport in a landmark case next week. The IAAF fears athletes with differences of sexual development and transgender competitors could dominate the sport. Our football cartoonist again turns his hand to the case of Hakeem al-Araibi, and the heroic efforts of Craig Foster in securing the refugee footballer\u2019s release from a Thai prison. Thinking time: Pansexual, the freedom to love as you please Rigid definitions of sexuality are on the way out as a younger generation embraces a \u201cnever say never\u201d approach to sex and gender. The pansexual revolution has seen sexual fluidity become mainstream; last year \u201cpansexual\u201d briefly became the online dictionary Merriam-Webster\u2019s most searched word of the day. So what is it and how does it work? Gaby Hinsliff reports. \u201cI always describe my sexuality as: \u2018If you\u2019ve got nice hair and pretty eyes, I\u2019m down for it,\u2019\u201d explains Jezz Palmer, a 26-year-old editor working in historical publishing. \u201cIt\u2019s not that gender doesn\u2019t matter, because it can be important, but it\u2019s a bit of an afterthought. It\u2019s just like, \u2018Oh, hello.\u2019 \u2026 It took me a while to figure it out.\u201d Media roundup A ministerial inquiry will investigate claims of bullying at Royal Prince Alfred hospital, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The inquiry comes amid increasing levels of concern about the exploitation of junior doctors. The front page of the NT News reports that a child abuse or neglect incident is recorded every 21 minutes in the territory, with abuse cases rising between 2017 and 2018. Eighty per cent of reports relate to welfare concerns for Indigenous children, the paper says. The ABC and the West Australian report on a dramatic start to the trial of the accused Claremont serial killer Bradley Robert Edwards. Prosecutors are hoping to present \u201cextreme pornography\u201d as evidence against Edwards, who is accused of murdering three women. Coming up Two 21-year-old men charged over the jail stabbing of the drug kingpin Tony Mokbel are due to appear at Geelong magistrates court today. Each is charged with attempted murder, intentionally causing serious injury and causing serious injury intentionally in circumstances of gross violence. The NSW Labor leader, Michael Daley, will announce his support for regulation to protect workers in the so-called gig economy.

But at least one likely outcome is becoming clearer: the Bank of England would not make things worse by cranking up interest rates.</p> <p>The idea that it might was a strange notion entertained by Threadneedle Street last November as it sketched various scenarios for the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union. In the most hellish projection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/28/bank-of-england-says-no-deal-brexit-would-be-worse-than-2008-crisis\">GDP was seen as falling by 8%</a>, meaning a worse recession than the one that followed the 2008-09 financial crisis.</p> <p>But, critically, this 8% catastrophe assumed that the Bank would react to the decline in the pound after a no-deal Brexit by raising interest rates to combat the surge in inflation. Indeed, a Bank rate at 5.5%, a monstrous leap from the current 0.75%, was imagined.</p> <p>This plotline for rates always looked absurd. A no-deal outcome would surely require the Bank to deploy common sense and look beyond its inflation-fighting mission. Protecting jobs and growth would become the priority, as its fuller mandate allows, meaning no short-term increases in the cost of borrowing.</p> <p>Thank goodness, then, that Gertjan Vlieghe, one of the Bank\u2019s rate-setters, is alert to the point. \u201cIn the case of a no-deal scenario I judge that an easing or an extended pause in monetary policy is more likely to be the appropriate policy response than a tightening,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/14/brexit-has-cost-uk-economy-at-least-80bn-since-vote-bank-of-england-rate-setter\">he said in a speech on Thursday</a>. Well, quite.</p> <p>Governor Mark Carney has been unfairly criticised at times for his comments on Brexit, but that November document was not his finest hour. Even his colleagues now seem to think the \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario, with interest rate soaring, was over-egged. A no-deal exit would be bad enough; there was no need to exaggerate.</p> <h2>AstraZeneca finally proves it was right to reject Pfizer</h2> <p>See, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/pfizer-failed-takeover-bid-astrazeneca\">AstraZeneca was right to give Pfizer\u2019s bid the brush-off</a> back in 2014. The UK pharmaceutical giant is now achieving sales growth again, for the first time in a decade, just as chief executive Pascal Soriot promised it would. In the final quarter of 2018, products sales improved 8%, helped by a big boost from the new cancer drugs Tagrisso and Lynparza.</p> <p>It\u2019s taken a very long time, sceptics might counter, which would be a fair point. The shares, up 7% on Thursday, have only just cleared \u00a360 convincingly, whereas Pfizer was talking about offering \u00a355-ish half a decade ago. Take account of the time value of money, as investment bankers put it, and you could construct an argument that shareholders would have been better off taking Pfizer\u2019s cash and shares.</p> <p>But that would be the wrong way to look at things. Drug development is a long-term game. It can take a decade to get an early-stage compound from the lab to the market, and the reinvention of AstraZeneca\u2019s pipeline should be judged over similar horizons. The group was clobbered by the patent expiry on the former blockbuster cholesterol drug Crestor; recovery was never going to arrive quickly.</p> <p>Back in 2014, Soriot\u2019s main promise was that the group could achieve annual sales of $45bn (\u00a335bn) in 2023, which still sounds slightly hopeful given that the tally for 2018 was $22bn. But he\u2019s sticking to the target and, as the now-rising share price indicates, the market thinks AstraZeneca will at least get close now that it has new drugs on the market with more to follow.</p> <p>Soriot remains one of the FTSE 100\u2019s most over-rewarded bosses - his \u00a39.4m in 2017 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/astrazeneca-shareholders-revolt-again-over-executive-pay\">\u00a313m in 2016</a> were rewards for success before it had happened, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/astrazeneca-rocked-by-shareholder-revolt-over-executive-pay\">as rebellious investors rightly argued</a>. But that commercial success may now finally be appearing (heaven knows what he\u2019ll collect when it does), which is clearly good news for the UK life sciences industry.</p> <p>AstraZeneca still has to convert its new sales momentum into extra profit, and then reward patient shareholders with a better dividend. But rejecting Pfizer was definitely the correct choice.</p> <h2>Stick to making bridges and widgets, not bad acronyms</h2> <p>Oh dear, the venerable Engineering Employers\u2019 Federation, or EEF, is rebranding. It wishes to be known as Make UK in future. Are the engineers trying to invoke Trump-style visions of making the UK great again, or have they succumbed to the horrible habit of turning verbs into nouns? Whatever the explanation, the new name is ugly.</p> <p>The EEF is clearly not a student of newspaper style either. On second mention, Make UK can become MUK, as in \u201cWhere there\u2019s MUK, there\u2019s brass\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>.</strong></p>",

Indeed, a Bank rate at 5.5%, a monstrous leap from the current 0.75%, was imagined. This plotline for rates always looked absurd. A no-deal outcome would surely require the Bank to deploy common sense and look beyond its inflation-fighting mission. Protecting jobs and growth would become the priority, as its fuller mandate allows, meaning no short-term increases in the cost of borrowing. Thank goodness, then, that Gertjan Vlieghe, one of the Bank\u2019s rate-setters, is alert to the point. \u201cIn the case of a no-deal scenario I judge that an easing or an extended pause in monetary policy is more likely to be the appropriate policy response than a tightening,\u201d he said in a speech on Thursday. Well, quite. Governor Mark Carney has been unfairly criticised at times for his comments on Brexit, but that November document was not his finest hour. Even his colleagues now seem to think the \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario, with interest rate soaring, was over-egged. A no-deal exit would be bad enough; there was no need to exaggerate. AstraZeneca finally proves it was right to reject Pfizer See, AstraZeneca was right to give Pfizer\u2019s bid the brush-off back in 2014. The UK pharmaceutical giant is now achieving sales growth again, for the first time in a decade, just as chief executive Pascal Soriot promised it would. In the final quarter of 2018, products sales improved 8%, helped by a big boost from the new cancer drugs Tagrisso and Lynparza. It\u2019s taken a very long time, sceptics might counter, which would be a fair point. The shares, up 7% on Thursday, have only just cleared \u00a360 convincingly, whereas Pfizer was talking about offering \u00a355-ish half a decade ago. Take account of the time value of money, as investment bankers put it, and you could construct an argument that shareholders would have been better off taking Pfizer\u2019s cash and shares. But that would be the wrong way to look at things. Drug development is a long-term game. It can take a decade to get an early-stage compound from the lab to the market, and the reinvention of AstraZeneca\u2019s pipeline should be judged over similar horizons. The group was clobbered by the patent expiry on the former blockbuster cholesterol drug Crestor; recovery was never going to arrive quickly. Back in 2014, Soriot\u2019s main promise was that the group could achieve annual sales of $45bn (\u00a335bn) in 2023, which still sounds slightly hopeful given that the tally for 2018 was $22bn. But he\u2019s sticking to the target and, as the now-rising share price indicates, the market thinks AstraZeneca will at least get close now that it has new drugs on the market with more to follow. Soriot remains one of the FTSE 100\u2019s most over-rewarded bosses - his \u00a39.4m in 2017 and \u00a313m in 2016 were rewards for success before it had happened, as rebellious investors rightly argued. But that commercial success may now finally be appearing (heaven knows what he\u2019ll collect when it does), which is clearly good news for the UK life sciences industry. AstraZeneca still has to convert its new sales momentum into extra profit, and then reward patient shareholders with a better dividend. But rejecting Pfizer was definitely the correct choice. Stick to making bridges and widgets, not bad acronyms Oh dear, the venerable Engineering Employers\u2019 Federation, or EEF, is rebranding. It wishes to be known as Make UK in future. Are the engineers trying to invoke Trump-style visions of making the UK great again, or have they succumbed to the horrible habit of turning verbs into nouns? Whatever the explanation, the new name is ugly. The EEF is clearly not a student of newspaper style either. On second mention, Make UK can become MUK, as in \u201cWhere there\u2019s MUK, there\u2019s brass\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

The European Research Group (ERG) fulminated against the motion that simply noted what parliament voted for last month \u2013 fairytale \u201calternative arrangements\u201d for the Irish border and Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey\u2019s block on no deal. As ever, in this deadlocked, logjammed debate, the government kowtowed to the ERG and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, hardened his stance, vowing no deal was still on the table. Result? The ERG still refused to back her, while Spelman denounced this as \u201ccontemptuous\u201d of parliament. And so it was.</p> \n<p>The ERG is unappeasable. It pretends no deal is a vital \u201cbargaining chip\u201d; the EU sighs at the absurdity. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, made elegant mincemeat of the idea that no deal is a credible negotiating position. Dominic Grieve said it was a like a three-year-old holding its breath to get its way. But this is not about \u201cleverage\u201d: the ERG wants no deal. Working themselves into a froth of wrath, the likes of Mark Francois will never vote for anything less.</p> \n<p>Delay as she might, Tory Armageddon day will come whenever the ERG demands no deal and May finally refuses. Delaying article 50 is now surely inevitable: Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin\u2019s plan will almost certainly win parliament the right to demand a delay on 27 February, preventing no deal. The Brussels eavesdrop on May\u2019s civil servant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/12/theresa-mays-brexit-tactic-my-way-or-a-long-delay?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">Olly Robbins</a>, plus well-informed insight from her old adviser Nick Timothy, reveals she will offer two choices: her deal or a long delay. Surely they who know her are right: she is not the type of thrill-seeker to relish being in charge on no-deal Brexit day.</p> \n<p>The showdown with her party-within-a party will come, so why not face them down now? She could save some credibility, after all her humiliations. Tell them the home truths she sees daily in cabinet documents we shall now read: this is no Project Fear.</p> \n<p>In the real world, the tearing of hair among businesses trying to mitigate unknowable risks grows louder every day. Ian Wright, the head of the food and drinks federation, lets rip on behalf of his members: \u201cDo these politicians think they\u2019ll get away with blaming this on the EU when the day comes? When prices rise, shelves are emptying, the great British public will know who\u2019s to blame.\u201d He talks of companies that long ago ordered shipments of sugar and other faraway goods, with no idea if tariffs will be sky-high or zero when they arrive after 29 March. If zero, much of British food, farming and agriculture will collapse under cheap imports; if on WTO rules, they face hefty tariffs on processed food, cereals and meat.</p> \n<p>Latest on his desk: what to do about packaging printed \u201cMade in the EU\u201d? No one in Whitehall can tell them how packs should be marked. Wright says most of his companies \u201caren\u2019t the sort who think much about politics. But they do now.\u201d He is incandescent. If Brexit fallout propels politicians out of politics, he warns: \u201cIf they think they can sail into jobs in business, they can think again. No company will employ them. In interviews they\u2019ll be asked about Brexit: \u2018What did you do in the great war, Daddy?\u2019\u201d He says one in eight of his members fear they will go to the wall in a no-deal Brexit, so he speaks with their authentic outrage.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfuck business\u201d said it all. Some day, those recording angels will have the names and count the losses. Thanks to Soubry, we shall soon know what the cabinet knows.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

That\u2019s criminally reckless, and her feint comes at gigantic cost. The recording angels will write the billions lost into their account books. Fear of no deal has sent banks and companies fleeing across the Channel or to Dublin \u2013 the Dutch and French are gloating at the cash inflow. Had May honestly ruled out no deal from the start, many would have stayed. The money squandered goes far beyond the Treasury\u2019s \u00a34.2bn already burned for a nonevent. The Bank of England governor points to zero investment growth since the referendum, the UK \u201cdramatically underperforming both history and peers\u201d. Thousands of civil servants are hired, thousands more switched, denuding other departments; fridges, warehouses and staff are rented at market-busting rates. Add in the uncounted loss to business. The UK\u2019s reputational damage is unfathomable: cracks in the union warn of a little England left alone. Even if we leave the EU with some spatchcocked deal, how was it clever to advertise to the world that this country took leave of its senses? But in parliament the charade played on. The European Research Group (ERG) fulminated against the motion that simply noted what parliament voted for last month \u2013 fairytale \u201calternative arrangements\u201d for the Irish border and Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey\u2019s block on no deal. As ever, in this deadlocked, logjammed debate, the government kowtowed to the ERG and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, hardened his stance, vowing no deal was still on the table. Result? The ERG still refused to back her, while Spelman denounced this as \u201ccontemptuous\u201d of parliament. And so it was. The ERG is unappeasable. It pretends no deal is a vital \u201cbargaining chip\u201d; the EU sighs at the absurdity. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, made elegant mincemeat of the idea that no deal is a credible negotiating position. Dominic Grieve said it was a like a three-year-old holding its breath to get its way. But this is not about \u201cleverage\u201d: the ERG wants no deal. Working themselves into a froth of wrath, the likes of Mark Francois will never vote for anything less. Delay as she might, Tory Armageddon day will come whenever the ERG demands no deal and May finally refuses. Delaying article 50 is now surely inevitable: Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin\u2019s plan will almost certainly win parliament the right to demand a delay on 27 February, preventing no deal. The Brussels eavesdrop on May\u2019s civil servant Olly Robbins, plus well-informed insight from her old adviser Nick Timothy, reveals she will offer two choices: her deal or a long delay. Surely they who know her are right: she is not the type of thrill-seeker to relish being in charge on no-deal Brexit day. The showdown with her party-within-a party will come, so why not face them down now? She could save some credibility, after all her humiliations. Tell them the home truths she sees daily in cabinet documents we shall now read: this is no Project Fear. In the real world, the tearing of hair among businesses trying to mitigate unknowable risks grows louder every day. Ian Wright, the head of the food and drinks federation, lets rip on behalf of his members: \u201cDo these politicians think they\u2019ll get away with blaming this on the EU when the day comes? When prices rise, shelves are emptying, the great British public will know who\u2019s to blame.\u201d He talks of companies that long ago ordered shipments of sugar and other faraway goods, with no idea if tariffs will be sky-high or zero when they arrive after 29 March. If zero, much of British food, farming and agriculture will collapse under cheap imports; if on WTO rules, they face hefty tariffs on processed food, cereals and meat. Latest on his desk: what to do about packaging printed \u201cMade in the EU\u201d? No one in Whitehall can tell them how packs should be marked. Wright says most of his companies \u201caren\u2019t the sort who think much about politics. But they do now.\u201d He is incandescent. If Brexit fallout propels politicians out of politics, he warns: \u201cIf they think they can sail into jobs in business, they can think again. No company will employ them. In interviews they\u2019ll be asked about Brexit: \u2018What did you do in the great war, Daddy?\u2019\u201d He says one in eight of his members fear they will go to the wall in a no-deal Brexit, so he speaks with their authentic outrage. Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfuck business\u201d said it all. Some day, those recording angels will have the names and count the losses. Thanks to Soubry, we shall soon know what the cabinet knows. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

The medicine you delivered was a cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d The cousin said it was also disturbing to hear the officers screaming \u201chands up\u201d to a man they had clearly already killed. McCoy died at the scene, according to police officials. \u201cThere was no attempt to try to work out a peaceful solution,\u201d Marc McCoy, Willie\u2019s older brother, told the Guardian earlier this week. The family said it was clear police had racially profiled McCoy, especially considering the long history of police brutality allegations and controversial killings in Vallejo. The video, which lasts 39 seconds, starts with the person filming saying that there are seven officers and it appears a man inside the vehicle doesn\u2019t want to get out. The man who uploaded the video told the San Francisco Chronicle he was \u201ccompletely shocked when this happened\u201d, saying: \u201cIf the guy had a gun on his lap but woke up suddenly of course he would reach for it because he was probably shocked.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s brutality at its finest because even after shooting him so many times, they still gave commands.\u201d He could not immediately be reached for comment. A Vallejo police spokesperson did not respond to request for comment about the video on Thursday. The department has not yet identified McCoy or disclosed the number of bullets that hit him and said an autopsy was pending. Police have not revealed the names of the officers. Harrison said the video didn\u2019t surprise him, because once he arrived on the scene that night, it was clear the officers had executed his cousin for no reason. But he said he hoped the footage would spark others to speak out. \u201cIt\u2019s very tragic and very unnerving and I hope people understand the anger we have now \u2026 People need to demand change.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Police in Canada are investigating a chilling theft in a Newfoundland community after the disappearance of 30,000 litres of valuable iceberg water. Thieves are believed to have covertly pilfered the water from a storage facility in the coastal town of Port Union last week. The water was intended for vodka production, said police. Iceberg water is valued for its purity, and used in premium spirits, cosmetic products \u2013 and even sold as a luxury bottled water, with cases of the bottles often selling for hundreds of dollars. The RCMP, Canada\u2019s federal police force, announced the theft on Wednesday and said the water has a street value of between CAD $9,000 and $12,000 (\u00a35,300 to \u00a37,000). \u201cAs far as we know, so far, we\u2019re looking at either a tanker truck or a tractor trailer,\u201d constable Andy Renwick told CBC News. But an employee at an iceberg water company said the shipment would likely have been contaminated during the transfer, rendering it largely worthless. \u201cJesus, what are they going to do with it?\u201d he said. Icebergs have been harvested for water for centuries. It is a difficult and potentially dangerous process \u2013 the icebergs, calved from Greenland\u2019s ice shelf, can roll over with little warning \u2013 but the water they are formed from is believed by many to be some of the cleanest on the planet. The high labour costs associated with obtaining the ice are part of the reason why the water is so expensive. Icebergs are harvested in late spring, when they pass by Newfoundland and Labrador, and the water, once bottled, is sold all around the world, including in China, Korea and Saudi Arabia. The large chunks of ice are impermeable to the salt water, resulting in clean water when melted. This week\u2019s heist is believed to be the first of its kind in the country, but Canada has previously seen the theft of large quantities of other valuable liquids. In 2012, thieves made off with more than CAD$18m (\u00a310.5m) in maple syrup from a warehouse in Quebec, making it the largest robbery in the country\u2019s history. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 March 2019.

      "bodyText": "Uefa has launched a disciplinary investigation in response to Sergio Ramos\u2019s revelation that he intentionally got himself booked in the Champions League. The Real Madrid captain could now be banned from the first leg of the quarter-final after admitting he wanted to receive a yellow card during Wednesday\u2019s 2-1 win over Ajax in Amsterdam. With Madrid 2-1 up in the last-16 first leg, Ramos was shown a yellow card in the 89th minute, his third booking of the European campaign, which means he will be suspended from the second leg of the tie in the Spanish capital on 5 March. Should the holders progress to the last eight, Ramos would then have a clean slate for the final stretch of Europe\u2019s elite competition. In an extraordinary post-match interview Ramos revealed he broke Uefa\u2019s rules and as a result he is now in line for an extra one-match ban. \u201cLooking at the result I would be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I was thinking about, it\u2019s not to underestimate the opponent nor say the tie is over but in football you have to take difficult decisions so I decided to do it.\u201d The centre-half is no stranger to controversy, having faced fierce criticism in last season\u2019s Champions League final after his rugged challenge on Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah prematurely ended the Egyptian\u2019s participation in the match. On Thursday Uefa confirmed it had launched a disciplinary investigation \u201cin connection with the statements made\u201d by Ramos. The Spain international, who was playing his 600th game for Madrid, later attempted a U-turn with two posts on Twitter. \u201cIn a game there is always a lot of tension and you have to take decisions in seconds. The best thing about tonight was the result, the worst that I will not be in the second leg due to one moment in the game,\u201d Ramos posted. \u201cI want to make it clear that this hurts me more than it would hurt anyone, I did not get the yellow card on purpose, just like the last yellow card I got in the competition, and I will be supporting from the stands like any other fan hoping we get into the quarter-finals.\u201d Ramos\u2019s teammate Dani Carvajal was punished by Uefa last season for intentionally getting booked in a group stage game at Apoel Nicosia. The full-back was charged by Uefa\u2019s disciplinary committee for \u201creceiving a yellow card on purpose\u201d and was suspended for their final group game against Borussia Dortmund and their last-16 first leg against Paris Saint-Germain. Uefa added that Ajax had been charged over the throwing of objects, setting off of fireworks and display of an \u201cillicit banner\u201d by fans. Real were also charged with the setting off of fireworks. Bale could face ban Gareth Bale has been reported by La Liga to the Spanish Football Federation over his provocative celebration in Real\u2019s 3-1 derby win at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Saturday. A statement on La Liga\u2019s official website said: \u201cIn minute 73 of the game, after Gareth Bale, number 11 of Real Madrid, scored his team\u2019s third goal, some jeering is heard from the home crowd by the audio-visual recordings during the celebration. And he moves his right arm up towards his head in a signal of provocation towards the fans, creating a possibly obscene gesture by moving his other arm and striking halfway up his right arm.\u201d The statement included reference to a possible suspension of four to 12 games. Atl\u00e9tico, meanwhile, have announced that Diego Simeone has renewed his contract as manager until 2022.",

The deportation was condemned by Russian officials, who called on the US to intervene. In a blog post announcing the bishop\u2019s deportation, Ukraine\u2019s interior ministry said: \u201cYesterday #borderguards detained him on suspicion of dual citizenship.

He first wrote about his deportation on Facebook earlier this week. Kharon, a bishop of the Russian-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox church of the Moscow patriarchate (UOC-MP), had received a US passport after serving abroad, according to Vakhtang Kipshidze, a church spokesman in Russia. The Russian Orthodox church, which has authority over the UOC-MP, said Kharon had recently traveled to the US to complain about pressure against the Orthodox church in Ukraine. Bartholomew I, the ecumenical patriarch who is the spiritual leader of eastern Orthodox Christians, granted the church in Ukraine a formal separation from the one in Russia. In response, the Russian Orthodox church broke off relations with him in one of the most significant rifts in Christian Orthodoxy in recent memory. Ukraine has since sought to bolster the newly established Orthodox church of Ukraine and attract loyal clergy. The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, signed a law in December that required the UOC-MP to change its name in order to make explicit its links to the Russian church. \u201cIt is easier to make a choice when all things are called by their names,\u201d he said at the time.

Seeing a severed head in a bin \u201cdidn\u2019t faze me at all\u201d, she said, adding that her husband had surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters.</p> \n<p> Begum\u2019s family have appealed for her to be allowed to return. Her brother-in-law Mohammed Rehman told the Mail the family had spoken to her on the phone. He said: \u201cShamima\u2019s mother broke down when she heard her voice ... We want her to come back so that she can be re-educated.\u201d </p> \n<p>The government has taken a hard line in response to the interview, with Ben Wallace, the security minister, saying: \u201cUltimately we have to protect the public. And people who went out there as amateurs are now professionals \u2013 terrorists or professional supporters of terrorism \u2013 and we have to make sure we mitigate that threat should they come back.\u201d</p> \n<p>The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said he would use all available powers to prevent Begum\u2019s return. He told the Times: \u201cMy message is clear \u2013 if you have supported terrorist organisations abroad I will not hesitate to prevent your return. If you do manage to return you should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted.\u201d </p> \n<p>As a British citizen, there is nothing to stop Begum returning to the UK, legal experts said, but Wallace made clear no help would be forthcoming while she was in Syria, where Britain has no consular staff.</p> \n<p>Only those with dual nationality can have their citizenship revoked, as it is an offence in international law to leave someone stateless, said Helen Fenwick, professor of law at Durham university and an expert on counter-terrorism and human rights law.</p> \n<p>But while Begum had the right to come home, \u201cobviously returning in practical terms would be very difficult\u201d.</p> \n<p>In theory, if she were to return Begum could face prosecution on a number of grounds, said Fenwick, including supporting a proscribed group, being a member of Isis or using her social media to encourage others to follow her to Syria. She could also potentially face her child being taken into care if there were fears she wished to radicalise the child.</p> \n<p>However, Fenwick said, securing prosecutions of those returning from Isis war zones was notoriously difficult. \u201cPeople are living in a conflict zone and there are going to be a lot of conflicting stories. Many of these people will try to say they weren\u2019t really involved, and it\u2019s very hard to find reliable testimony to say what they were really doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Counter-terrorism officials say fears of a flood of battle-hardened Britons who travelled to Isis territory returning to the UK have not materialised, but they are finding it more difficult than they hoped to get evidence of wrongdoing.</p> \n<p>The authorities have various powers to manage returnees short of prosecution, including imposing TPIM control orders, which can restrict their movement or rights of association, and compelling them to attend de-radicalisation programmes.</p> \n<p>Asked about the likelihood of Begum\u2019s rehabilitation, David Toube, director of policy at the anti-extremism organisation Quilliam, described Begum\u2019s situation as presenting \u201cthe hardest of hard cases\u201d. \u201cShe appears to have expressed remorse only for the failure of the caliphate and its failure to live up to expectations. So she would be a very difficult person to de-radicalise in her current state of mind.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government says that over 900 people who pose concerns to national security have travelled from the UK to Isis-controlled territory in Syria. They estimate that 20%, some 180 people, were killed, and another 40% have returned. More than 100 women are thought to have travelled to Syria.</p> \n<p>Shiraz Maher, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at Kings College, London, said there were potentially hundreds of Britons who were now in the custody of Kurdish forces and would wish to return to the UK, though their likely fate was unclear. \u201cMost of them do express remorse and regret, but it\u2019s a product of the fact that Isis is being defeated. They were all cheering on its atrocities and barbarism when they felt it was winning.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/shamima-begum-britain-isis-recruit\">In a piece for the Guardian</a>, Barrett, who was formerly head of the United Nations al-Qaeda/Taliban monitoring team and is now director of the Global Strategy Network, said Britain was not alone \u201cin wishing that all its citizens who joined the Islamic State would either die there or disappear ... But governments have a responsibility to address the problems created by their captured nationals and also to look more closely at why they made the choices they did.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer for Begum\u2019s family when she first disappeared, told the Guardian the teenager should be treated as a victim, and rejected claims that it was too dangerous for British officials to travel to the camp to help facilitate her return.</p> \n<p>Akunjee said: \u201cThere were deep failings by the police which led to the children going to a war zone. The police recognised that at the time. The situation has not really changed. She joined a proscribed organisation as a victim of grooming.\u201d</p> \n<p>Begum told the Times that one of the schoolfriends with whom she travelled, Kadiza Sultana, had been killed two years ago, while the other, Amira Abase, and a fourth Bethnal Green schoolgirl who left a year earlier, Sharmeena Begum, had decided to stay in Barghuz.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Telegraph, Hussen Abase, father of Amira Abase, said his daughter made a mistake when she fled to Syria.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a father I would say to the British government please let the girls back into the country and give them some kind of teaching,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were just teenagers when they left. They should be allowed to learn from their mistakes. They are no threat to us.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 February 2019 to clarify a quote from David Toube.</p>",

Interviewed this week in a refugee camp in the north of the country after fleeing Isis\u2019s last stronghold, she told the Times that she was nine months pregnant and had fled the fighting after her two other children had died. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child,\u201d she said. She did not regret going to Syria, she told the newspaper, and expressed support for the murder of journalists, whom she said had been \u201ca security threat for the caliphate\u201d. Seeing a severed head in a bin \u201cdidn\u2019t faze me at all\u201d, she said, adding that her husband had surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters. Begum\u2019s family have appealed for her to be allowed to return. Her brother-in-law Mohammed Rehman told the Mail the family had spoken to her on the phone. He said: \u201cShamima\u2019s mother broke down when she heard her voice ... We want her to come back so that she can be re-educated.\u201d The government has taken a hard line in response to the interview, with Ben Wallace, the security minister, saying: \u201cUltimately we have to protect the public. And people who went out there as amateurs are now professionals \u2013 terrorists or professional supporters of terrorism \u2013 and we have to make sure we mitigate that threat should they come back.\u201d The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said he would use all available powers to prevent Begum\u2019s return. He told the Times: \u201cMy message is clear \u2013 if you have supported terrorist organisations abroad I will not hesitate to prevent your return. If you do manage to return you should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted.\u201d As a British citizen, there is nothing to stop Begum returning to the UK, legal experts said, but Wallace made clear no help would be forthcoming while she was in Syria, where Britain has no consular staff. Only those with dual nationality can have their citizenship revoked, as it is an offence in international law to leave someone stateless, said Helen Fenwick, professor of law at Durham university and an expert on counter-terrorism and human rights law. But while Begum had the right to come home, \u201cobviously returning in practical terms would be very difficult\u201d. In theory, if she were to return Begum could face prosecution on a number of grounds, said Fenwick, including supporting a proscribed group, being a member of Isis or using her social media to encourage others to follow her to Syria. She could also potentially face her child being taken into care if there were fears she wished to radicalise the child. However, Fenwick said, securing prosecutions of those returning from Isis war zones was notoriously difficult. \u201cPeople are living in a conflict zone and there are going to be a lot of conflicting stories. Many of these people will try to say they weren\u2019t really involved, and it\u2019s very hard to find reliable testimony to say what they were really doing.\u201d Counter-terrorism officials say fears of a flood of battle-hardened Britons who travelled to Isis territory returning to the UK have not materialised, but they are finding it more difficult than they hoped to get evidence of wrongdoing. The authorities have various powers to manage returnees short of prosecution, including imposing TPIM control orders, which can restrict their movement or rights of association, and compelling them to attend de-radicalisation programmes. Asked about the likelihood of Begum\u2019s rehabilitation, David Toube, director of policy at the anti-extremism organisation Quilliam, described Begum\u2019s situation as presenting \u201cthe hardest of hard cases\u201d. \u201cShe appears to have expressed remorse only for the failure of the caliphate and its failure to live up to expectations. So she would be a very difficult person to de-radicalise in her current state of mind.\u201d The government says that over 900 people who pose concerns to national security have travelled from the UK to Isis-controlled territory in Syria. They estimate that 20%, some 180 people, were killed, and another 40% have returned. More than 100 women are thought to have travelled to Syria. Shiraz Maher, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at Kings College, London, said there were potentially hundreds of Britons who were now in the custody of Kurdish forces and would wish to return to the UK, though their likely fate was unclear. \u201cMost of them do express remorse and regret, but it\u2019s a product of the fact that Isis is being defeated. They were all cheering on its atrocities and barbarism when they felt it was winning.\u201d In a piece for the Guardian, Barrett, who was formerly head of the United Nations al-Qaeda/Taliban monitoring team and is now director of the Global Strategy Network, said Britain was not alone \u201cin wishing that all its citizens who joined the Islamic State would either die there or disappear ... But governments have a responsibility to address the problems created by their captured nationals and also to look more closely at why they made the choices they did.\u201d Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer for Begum\u2019s family when she first disappeared, told the Guardian the teenager should be treated as a victim, and rejected claims that it was too dangerous for British officials to travel to the camp to help facilitate her return. Akunjee said: \u201cThere were deep failings by the police which led to the children going to a war zone. The police recognised that at the time. The situation has not really changed. She joined a proscribed organisation as a victim of grooming.\u201d Begum told the Times that one of the schoolfriends with whom she travelled, Kadiza Sultana, had been killed two years ago, while the other, Amira Abase, and a fourth Bethnal Green schoolgirl who left a year earlier, Sharmeena Begum, had decided to stay in Barghuz. Speaking to the Telegraph, Hussen Abase, father of Amira Abase, said his daughter made a mistake when she fled to Syria. \u201cAs a father I would say to the British government please let the girls back into the country and give them some kind of teaching,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were just teenagers when they left. They should be allowed to learn from their mistakes. They are no threat to us.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 February 2019 to clarify a quote from David Toube.",

MPs are permitted to amend the motion, which will be voted on on Thursday. This is the second time May has submitted an amendable parliamentary motion after the defeat of her Brexit deal. In January, MPs successfully amended the motion twice. The first amendment, supported by the government, was spearheaded by the Conservative MP Graham Brady and called for the government to seek \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to replace the backstop. The second came from Caroline Spelman and was a defeat for the government backed by rebel Tory MPs. It said the House of Commons rejected the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.

Both Cooper and Boles have said they do not intend to bring their amendment back until 27 February, when May has promised the next update will be tabled. Here is a look at the prime minister\u2019s main motion and the amendments that have been selected by the Speaker. May\u2019s motion \u2013 DEFEATED Theresa May\u2019s motion was defeated after ERG Tories refused to support her approach to leaving the EU. May\u2019s defeat, by 303 votes to 258, showed the prime minister once again losing control of her own party in the crucial final weeks before Brexit. May\u2019s motion had said negotiations to come to a compromise on the backstop are continuing and \u201creiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January 2019\u201d. MPs were voting to accept both the Brady and Spelman amendments \u2013 and members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group did not want to vote to accept the latter. It would effectively have meant they had accepted parliament was against leaving with no deal, when many of their faction believe it is a viable option.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also attended.</p> <p>The Obama administration eased US sanctions on Iran under the terms of the nuclear deal, but Trump reimposed them when he withdrew the US from the agreement last year.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t achieve stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran.

      "bodyText": "The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has sharply rebuked Washington\u2019s European allies over their efforts to shield their businesses from US sanctions on Iran, as transatlantic tensions over US foreign policy were laid bare at a conference in Warsaw. A scheme the European Union has set up to facilitate trade with Iran was \u201can effort to break American sanctions against Iran\u2019s murderous revolutionary regime\u201d, Pence said during a conference on the Middle East organised by the US in the Polish capital. \u201cIt is an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU and create still more distance between Europe and the US,\u201d he said. In an unusually blunt and fiery address, Pence called on what he described as \u201cfreedom-loving nations\u201d to stand against Iranian \u201cevil\u201d, and went so far as to accuse the regional power of plotting a \u201cnew Holocaust\u201d. The Warsaw meeting was attended by more than 60 nations, but major European powers such as Germany and France, parties to the landmark 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, refused to send their top diplomats. The US-led summit focused on Iran but also the Israeli-Palestinian issue, over which European leaders have expressed frustration at Donald Trump\u2019s aid cuts and diplomatic attacks against Palestinians. The US was represented in Warsaw by Pence, Mike Pompeo, Washington\u2019s top diplomat, and Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and special aide on the Middle East. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also attended. The Obama administration eased US sanctions on Iran under the terms of the nuclear deal, but Trump reimposed them when he withdrew the US from the agreement last year. \u201cYou can\u2019t achieve stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran. It\u2019s just not possible,\u201d Pompeo told reporters after his formal opening statement. \u201cThere are malign influences in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq \u2026 The three H\u2019s: the Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah, these are real threats,\u201d he said, referring to groups Iran supports. Netanyahu had earlier withdrawn a claim on his Twitter account, said to be the result of a mistranslation, that he was in Warsaw to discuss war with Iran. Pence praised other nations for complying with US sanctions by reducing Iranian oil imports, but said the Europeans fell short. \u201cSadly, some of our leading European partners have not been nearly as cooperative,\u201d Pence said. \u201cIn fact, they have led the effort to create mechanisms to break up our sanctions.\u201d Pence then called for Europe to abandon the nuclear agreement altogether, making explicit a demand that Trump administration officials had previously only hinted at. European diplomats at the conference rejected Pence\u2019s accusations. \u201cWe strongly disagree,\u201d a diplomat from a major European power told Reuters. Netanyahu described the opening dinner at which he sat alongside senior officials from Arab Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, as a \u201chistorical turning point\u201d. Many Arab states do not recognise Israel but they have been driven together by their common fear of Iran. It remains to be seen how far the new alliance can extend to a combined approach to the Palestinian issue. It is expected Kushner will discuss his peace plan with Arab leaders in private as well as at a public session on the sidelines of the summit. Netanyahu has argued that the Arab world is open to normalised economic ties with Israel that are not dependent on a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Pompeo\u2019s call in his opening speech for a new era of cooperation in the Middle East will be viewed with scepticism by EU leaders, who feel they were not consulted on the US decision to pull out of the Iran deal, or the planned withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria. In a sign of transatlantic division, Niels Annen, a German minister of state for foreign affairs, said he was sceptical that the conference could deliver results on Iran. \u201cI am hoping for constructive signals but nobody here has the expectation that this conference will solve problems,\u201d he told reporters. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described the Warsaw conference as \u201cdead on arrival\u201d and another attempt by the US to pursue an unfounded obsession with Iran. A former US ambassador to Sweden, Azita Raji, also dismissed the event, saying \u201cconducting a lacklustre and rambling conference on the Middle East shows that it is amateur hour at the White House and is ultimately another blow to US prestige and leadership\u201d. The Warsaw conference came as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, increasingly seen as a key player in the Middle East, hosted his Iranian and Turkish counterparts to discuss a final settlement in the Syrian civil war, including the presence of large numbers of Islamist fighters in Idlib province. The three countries, particularly Turkey and Iran, do not agree on the final settlement in Syria, but have been uneasily cooperating to find a solution that does not betray their interests. Iran wants Turkey to agree that Syrian forces should be deployed along the border with Turkey, but there has also been a separate US discussion of an international force to assuage Kurdish fears of Turkish invasion once US forces depart. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that the leaders would also discuss forming a special committee tasked with drawing up a new postwar constitution for Syria. The composition of the committee, including the role of civil society, has been in dispute for more than a year. Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Labour tensions over Brexit threatened to boil over on Thursday as two shadow ministers broke ranks to call for a second referendum, and others hinted they could quit the party unless Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position changed over the next fortnight. Clive Lewis, a shadow Treasury minister, warned Corbyn that Labour might never be forgiven and could disappear from UK politics if MPs voted to facilitate a Conservative Brexit deal. Another shadow minister, Paul Sweeney, also backed a second referendum on the final Brexit deal for the first time on Thursday. The high-profile pro-EU backbencher Chris Leslie said he was \u201cclinging to hope\u201d that the Conservatives would back a fresh poll in the next fortnight, suggesting that he had lost faith in his own party. Leslie accused Corbyn of \u201cregressing\u201d from the party\u2019s conference policy to pursue a public vote when other options had been exhausted. \u201cI certainly feel we are being played for fools by the leadership of the Labour party on this particular issue. By now we should have reached the stage of a public vote. Nobody can explain to me seriously ... why we are not at that particular stage right now.\u201d Leslie is among several backbench MPs rumoured to be considering quitting the party in the coming weeks, as concerns mount not only over the party\u2019s Brexit policy but also how it has dealt with cases of antisemitism. The shadow minister, a prominent supporter of Corbyn, made his comments at a Love Socialism, Hate Brexit rally promoted by the pro-referendum group Another Europe is Possible. Lewis, who resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2017 to vote against triggering article 50 but returned to the frontbench last year, said Labour could face electoral annihilation similar to that of the Liberal Democrats after the party entered a coalition with the Tories. Leslie hinted in the House of Commons chamber on Thursday afternoon that his only reason for holding his fire was the hope more Tory MPs would join the second referendum cause before the next vote on 27 February. \u201cWe have to wait for the payroll government ministers to do the brave thing and resign to counteract for some of those numbers lost on what should be a solid Labour move against this outrageous situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that the Labour party is not together and arguing against this tragedy, this disaster, it is for me entirely heartbreaking.\u201d In a speech loaded with emotion, Leslie said he believed the political system was \u201cshattered \u2026 broken and letting this country down at a crucial time. I believe that it is a moment we needed leadership, but what we are seeing sadly is party political calculations \u2026 tragically putting themselves ahead of the national interest.\u201d More than 10 shadow ministers have suggested privately they could resign if Corbyn did not back a public vote in a fortnight\u2019s time \u2013 though the Labour leader is also facing pressure from the other wing of his party too. Sweeney, the shadow Scotland minister, said he owed it to his pro-remain constituency in Glasgow North East, where people voted 67% in favour of staying in the EU, to support a second referendum. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been explicit on this issue, I never changed my view but I respected the democratic result of the referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we had to try our best as honest brokers to try and come to a compromise parliament could deliver but it is quite clear the Tories are not willing to budge at all on any sort of compromise like a customs union.\u201d Since parliament overwhelmingly rejected Theresa May\u2019s deal last month, Labour has continued to engage with the government after the Labour leader initially declined a meeting with the prime minister. The pair exchanged letters last week setting out their respective Brexit positions, and senior Labour figures met with ministers on Tuesday. Lewis said he feared those moves were \u201cgoing to help to facilitate a Tory Brexit\u201d if discussions continued and that it \u201cwill be the Labour party that will pick up the flak for what happens\u201d. \u201cThe ramifications for our party will be severe,\u201d he said. Tensions in the party have boiled over in recent days, with anger from MPs about the pace of dealing with allegations of antisemitism also coming to the fore, particularly the treatment of Luciana Berger by her local constituency party, according to two sources. Those complaints prompted the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, to release statistics about the complaints on Monday, but MPs have demanded further action. Berger, who is nine months pregnant, is believed to be one of those MPs closest to quitting the party over frustration at the way the party has handled antisemitism allegations and at the party\u2019s Brexit position. It is understood several MPs have worked hard to convince her to stay. \u201cIf Luciana was to quit over antisemitism, that would make our positions untenable for a lot of us,\u201d one MP said. MPs are convinced that if some of their number quit the party, the move would not come as a unified moment but instead in stages, prompted by different flashpoints. \u201cSome were frustrated that May took away their opportunity before December, and they were hoping for an amendment [on Wednesday] that would give them a motive,\u201d one senior Labour source said. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t wait much longer.\u201d One Labour MP who has thought about quitting the party said it would be the wrong time to jump ship: \u201cYou need to wait until the actual moment of betrayal if and when Jeremy votes for Brexit or rules out a second referendum.\u201d He said a small number of colleagues were considering leaving the party imminently, but others were urging them to think again because it would look like an attempt to destabilise Corbyn, rather than a statement that they could not support a party that backed taking the UK out of the EU. \u201cWe have to give him as much time as possible to change his mind and back a people\u2019s vote,\u201d the MP said. \u201cWe need the shadow cabinet to put as much pressure on him as possible.\u201d Ben Bradshaw, a Labour MP who supports the people\u2019s vote campaign, ruled out leaving the party over Brexit.

The movie tells the story of a world that has forgotten the Beatles ever existed but, in a twist of Lars von Trier-level cinematic bleakness, has total recall of James Corden. The film also seems to tell the story of a casting department that has never heard of Game of Thrones, because the film features Ed Sheeran in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/17/ed-sheeran-game-of-thrones-dud-cameo-he-came-he-sang-he-ate-rabbit\" title=\"\">an acting role</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a busy time for bands reviving decades-old hits via the silver screen. So, to avoid confusion, Yesterday must not be mistaken for hit-packed movies such as Bohemian Rhapsody or Mamma Mia!, which, rather than trading on Yesterday\u2019s curiously Farage-friendly notion that society is crying out for a return to the good old days of Britain as pop\u2019s leading exporter, celebrated the free movement of music between European countries and told the story of a small island that actually welcomed immigrants.</p> <p>But there are interesting questions posed by the central conceit of Yesterday, which follows the story of the one man who <em>does</em> remember the work of George, Ringo et al, and who uses this knowledge to pass the Beatles\u2019 Movie Medley hitmakers\u2019 songs off as his own. Not least among these questions are: is Ed Sheeran (who stars in the film as Ed Sheeran) under the misapprehension that he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/ed-sheeran-sued-for-second-time-over-marvin-gaye-lets-get-it-on-claims\" title=\"\">already living in a similar film about Marvin Gaye</a>, and are we all extras in that film, representing one of the most unappealing examples yet of simulation theory?</p> <p>Also, if you had every single Beatles song rattling around in your head, you might consider their dissemination to be broadly in the public interest; after all, it\u2019s fair to say that the Beatles had their moments vis-a-vis the whole toe-tapper thing. But how far would this principle extend into other areas of our cultural lives?</p> <p>If you were the only person who remembered Facebook, would you spread the word, or quite frankly keep your thoughts to yourself? And is it fair to say that life would not be worse \u2013 and might actually be marginally more bearable \u2013 if you switched the Beatles for Muse and decided to join a monastery? When Big Brother first hit our screens, we all thought it might have been quite an interesting social experiment, did we not? But perhaps many of us would now say that was a corner of Elstree that should never have been televised. And putting yourself in the shoes \u2013 then, inevitably, the jeans \u2013 of Simon Cowell, for rather more pressing reasons that have come to light in <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/simon-cowell-plots-dramatic-overhaul-for-x-factor-as-he-remodels-show-with-celebrities-a4066536.html\" title=\"\">this week\u2019s news headlines</a>, how would you behave if you woke up one morning to discover that the UK had suddenly forgotten everything about The X Factor? (As opposed to everyone slowly forgetting, to the tune of 10 million jettisoned viewers since 2010.)</p> <p>For context, current rumblings are trumpeting the partial, or the total, and the imminent, or the not-for-ages disappearance from ITV of The X Factor (Cowell\u2019s current deal with ITV ends this year). Unnamed Chatty Cathys appear in many of the stories with quotes ranging from, \u201cThere will definitely be a show this year\u201d to, \u201cThis year\u2019s auditions are axed for sure\u201d, two apparently contradictory statements that aren\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive. Rumours suggest that the last-minute cancellation of this year\u2019s auditions could pave the way for a champion-of-champions approach that might finally \u2013 finally! \u2013 see stars such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/live/2014/dec/13/the-x-factor-2014-final-as-it-happens\" title=\"\">Ben Haenow</a> back on primetime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/20/how-big-brothers-unvarnished-underdogs-changed-tv\">How Big Brother's unvarnished underdogs changed TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other format shifts have been mooted, including a throwback to 2006\u2019s wisely-never-repeated one-series wonder X Factor: Battle of the Stars, which, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/jun/05/thefinalcelebrityxfactor\" title=\"\">in scenes that scarred a generation</a>, saw Gillian McKeith honking her way through I Just Want to Make Love to You and Chris Moyles romping to third place. At the time even Cowell described the Battle of the Stars as \u201cpointless\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/the-x-factor-axed-and-replaced-by-celebrity-version/\" title=\"\">reports suggest</a> it may be discussed as a possible way forward. Trigger warning: it\u2019s impossible to consider that option without envisaging Keith Lemon coming in at least second place.</p> <p>Why keep it going at all? For elucidation, let\u2019s head over to a quote from last year in which Cowell, with all the enthusiasm of a world-weary sausage salesman, said: \u201cWe could probably do three years or five years. It makes a lot of money.\u201d There\u2019s nothing quite like putting a price on great art. Which is to say, this is nothing like putting a price on great art. But setting to one side the enormous sums of cash that The X Factor has made and continues to generate for Cowell, his record label and ITV, what if The X Factor really had never existed?</p> <p>Well, our collective consciousness would sadly wave goodbye to the triumphant oeuvre of bongo-bothering tunemaul practitioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/nov/28/wagner-leaves-xfactor\" title=\"\">Wagner</a>. We might never have seen <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/x-factor/6582073/Calvin-Harris-defends-X-Factor-stunt.html\" title=\"\">Calvin Harris with a pineapple on his head</a>. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BG3utwIqNU\" title=\"\">Christopher Maloney</a> would have more of a spring in his step and we could do away with the continued insistence \u2013 nearly two decades after his last successful artist launch \u2013 that Louis Walsh knows what he\u2019s talking about. And yet. Nature would, one hopes, still find a way.</p> <p>Leona Lewis, a former stage school and Brit School attendee, would surely still have warbled her way to some sort of success. Harry Styles\u2019s hair would still somehow have achieved global recognition. Jack Quickenden would still have found his way to Portsmouth for last year\u2019s panto season. And had The X Factor \u2013 and Popstars, and Pop Idol \u2013 never existed, the UK music industry would never have come to rely on TV platforms to launch pop artists, meaning that it would never have forgotten how to create and nurture decent pop stars. It\u2019s amazing that the 2016 European referendum ever went ahead considering how clearly X Factor winners such as Leon Jackson highlighted the risks that come with leaving things to a public vote if most of those doing the voting are twice the age of the people who will ultimately have to deal with the outcome.</p> <p>Perhaps this points us, rather circuitously, to the next steps for both The X Factor and Richard Curtis: a jukebox movie that tells the story of Brexit, set to the hits of 15 years\u2019 worth of X Factor winners. Who wouldn\u2019t pay good money to see Steve Brookstein reprising Against All Odds in the role of Jean-Claude Juncker?</p> <h2>Gemma Collins and a missed Opportunity<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"545dcd3ba148179e4f7724a7600e55b29bac07f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/545dcd3ba148179e4f7724a7600e55b29bac07f1/258_50_1346_1346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mars rover Opportunity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mars rover Opportunity might be dead, but Gemma Collins is still going strong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of this week\u2019s most distressing celebrity headlines comes from the Mirror, which, on Wednesday, relayed news regarding the final days of Nasa\u2019s most beloved robotic explorer under the words: <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/breaking-nasas-mars-rover-opportunity-13996380\" title=\"\">\u201cMars rover Opportunity dies, aged 15\u201d</a>. The brave fella\u2019s reported final message echoed the internal monologue many of us endure in these testing times: \u201cMy battery is low, and it\u2019s getting dark.\u201d Nasa had broadcast more than 1,000 wake-up commands to Opportunity, but there was no response. And with that, Opportunity was lost in a cloud of space dust. A dignified end to a brave mission.</p> <p>Back on Earth, Gemma Collins, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qij91D9Di0\" title=\"\">who once fell in a hole</a>, is not in darkness. The sun is shining brightly and she is in hay-making mode following her ejection from Dancing on Ice. Gemma\u2019s time on the show is more robustly summarised by the mask slipping in <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6659347/Dancing-Ices-Gemma-Collins-throws-foul-mouthed-tantrum.html\" title=\"\">leaked backstage audio of a tantrum regarding a visit to Wales</a>, than by any of her perfunctory on-screen endeavours. Regardless, Collins\u2019s profile has benefitted so much from appearing on the show that her fee for nightclub appearances apparently now stands at <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6697209/Gemma-Collins-charges-13-000-hour-club-appearances-stint-Dancing-Ice.html\" title=\"\">\u00a313,000 an hour</a>.</p> <p>Let\u2019s just say it. Opportunity would have been fine with a trip to Wales. Opportunity would probably appear in nightclubs for 10 quid, a finger buffet and a cab fare home. Opportunity \u2013 a bundle of wires, metal and rubber \u2013 showed more humanity in its final eight-word message than Collins has mustered in the past eight years. We don\u2019t always choose the role models who will guide us through life; often, they seem to choose us. But, given a choice between Opportunity and opportunism, it\u2019s not a hard decision.</p>",

So, to avoid confusion, Yesterday must not be mistaken for hit-packed movies such as Bohemian Rhapsody or Mamma Mia!, which, rather than trading on Yesterday\u2019s curiously Farage-friendly notion that society is crying out for a return to the good old days of Britain as pop\u2019s leading exporter, celebrated the free movement of music between European countries and told the story of a small island that actually welcomed immigrants. But there are interesting questions posed by the central conceit of Yesterday, which follows the story of the one man who does remember the work of George, Ringo et al, and who uses this knowledge to pass the Beatles\u2019 Movie Medley hitmakers\u2019 songs off as his own. Not least among these questions are: is Ed Sheeran (who stars in the film as Ed Sheeran) under the misapprehension that he is already living in a similar film about Marvin Gaye, and are we all extras in that film, representing one of the most unappealing examples yet of simulation theory? Also, if you had every single Beatles song rattling around in your head, you might consider their dissemination to be broadly in the public interest; after all, it\u2019s fair to say that the Beatles had their moments vis-a-vis the whole toe-tapper thing. But how far would this principle extend into other areas of our cultural lives? If you were the only person who remembered Facebook, would you spread the word, or quite frankly keep your thoughts to yourself? And is it fair to say that life would not be worse \u2013 and might actually be marginally more bearable \u2013 if you switched the Beatles for Muse and decided to join a monastery? When Big Brother first hit our screens, we all thought it might have been quite an interesting social experiment, did we not? But perhaps many of us would now say that was a corner of Elstree that should never have been televised. And putting yourself in the shoes \u2013 then, inevitably, the jeans \u2013 of Simon Cowell, for rather more pressing reasons that have come to light in this week\u2019s news headlines, how would you behave if you woke up one morning to discover that the UK had suddenly forgotten everything about The X Factor? (As opposed to everyone slowly forgetting, to the tune of 10 million jettisoned viewers since 2010.) For context, current rumblings are trumpeting the partial, or the total, and the imminent, or the not-for-ages disappearance from ITV of The X Factor (Cowell\u2019s current deal with ITV ends this year). Unnamed Chatty Cathys appear in many of the stories with quotes ranging from, \u201cThere will definitely be a show this year\u201d to, \u201cThis year\u2019s auditions are axed for sure\u201d, two apparently contradictory statements that aren\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive. Rumours suggest that the last-minute cancellation of this year\u2019s auditions could pave the way for a champion-of-champions approach that might finally \u2013 finally! \u2013 see stars such as Ben Haenow back on primetime. Other format shifts have been mooted, including a throwback to 2006\u2019s wisely-never-repeated one-series wonder X Factor: Battle of the Stars, which, in scenes that scarred a generation, saw Gillian McKeith honking her way through I Just Want to Make Love to You and Chris Moyles romping to third place. At the time even Cowell described the Battle of the Stars as \u201cpointless\u201d, but reports suggest it may be discussed as a possible way forward. Trigger warning: it\u2019s impossible to consider that option without envisaging Keith Lemon coming in at least second place. Why keep it going at all? For elucidation, let\u2019s head over to a quote from last year in which Cowell, with all the enthusiasm of a world-weary sausage salesman, said: \u201cWe could probably do three years or five years. It makes a lot of money.\u201d There\u2019s nothing quite like putting a price on great art. Which is to say, this is nothing like putting a price on great art. But setting to one side the enormous sums of cash that The X Factor has made and continues to generate for Cowell, his record label and ITV, what if The X Factor really had never existed? Well, our collective consciousness would sadly wave goodbye to the triumphant oeuvre of bongo-bothering tunemaul practitioner Wagner. We might never have seen Calvin Harris with a pineapple on his head. Christopher Maloney would have more of a spring in his step and we could do away with the continued insistence \u2013 nearly two decades after his last successful artist launch \u2013 that Louis Walsh knows what he\u2019s talking about. And yet. Nature would, one hopes, still find a way. Leona Lewis, a former stage school and Brit School attendee, would surely still have warbled her way to some sort of success. Harry Styles\u2019s hair would still somehow have achieved global recognition. Jack Quickenden would still have found his way to Portsmouth for last year\u2019s panto season. And had The X Factor \u2013 and Popstars, and Pop Idol \u2013 never existed, the UK music industry would never have come to rely on TV platforms to launch pop artists, meaning that it would never have forgotten how to create and nurture decent pop stars. It\u2019s amazing that the 2016 European referendum ever went ahead considering how clearly X Factor winners such as Leon Jackson highlighted the risks that come with leaving things to a public vote if most of those doing the voting are twice the age of the people who will ultimately have to deal with the outcome. Perhaps this points us, rather circuitously, to the next steps for both The X Factor and Richard Curtis: a jukebox movie that tells the story of Brexit, set to the hits of 15 years\u2019 worth of X Factor winners. Who wouldn\u2019t pay good money to see Steve Brookstein reprising Against All Odds in the role of Jean-Claude Juncker? Gemma Collins and a missed Opportunity One of this week\u2019s most distressing celebrity headlines comes from the Mirror, which, on Wednesday, relayed news regarding the final days of Nasa\u2019s most beloved robotic explorer under the words: \u201cMars rover Opportunity dies, aged 15\u201d. The brave fella\u2019s reported final message echoed the internal monologue many of us endure in these testing times: \u201cMy battery is low, and it\u2019s getting dark.\u201d Nasa had broadcast more than 1,000 wake-up commands to Opportunity, but there was no response. And with that, Opportunity was lost in a cloud of space dust. A dignified end to a brave mission. Back on Earth, Gemma Collins, who once fell in a hole, is not in darkness. The sun is shining brightly and she is in hay-making mode following her ejection from Dancing on Ice. Gemma\u2019s time on the show is more robustly summarised by the mask slipping in leaked backstage audio of a tantrum regarding a visit to Wales, than by any of her perfunctory on-screen endeavours. Regardless, Collins\u2019s profile has benefitted so much from appearing on the show that her fee for nightclub appearances apparently now stands at \u00a313,000 an hour. Let\u2019s just say it. Opportunity would have been fine with a trip to Wales. Opportunity would probably appear in nightclubs for 10 quid, a finger buffet and a cab fare home. Opportunity \u2013 a bundle of wires, metal and rubber \u2013 showed more humanity in its final eight-word message than Collins has mustered in the past eight years. We don\u2019t always choose the role models who will guide us through life; often, they seem to choose us. But, given a choice between Opportunity and opportunism, it\u2019s not a hard decision.",

I know people see representing one\u2019s country as very different to playing for your club but it\u2019s not as if Rice has chosen to play for Brazil because they are the best team in the world. He is as English as he is Irish and has chosen to play for England. Does it make you more English because you are born in England? Are we going to start tracing bloodlines now to decide whether a player should or should not represent their country? I struggle to understand why many in football get so upset about dual nationality.</p> <p>Rice is being open and essentially saying: \u201cWell, actually I\u2019ve got a bit of a choice to make here,\u201d as he would do if a bigger club came in for him. If he is choosing England for whatever reason, then it\u2019s a valid choice. It\u2019s part of him and would be if he chose Ireland over England. I understand the problem with countries who go looking for players with looser generational ties in an attempt to improve their team, as has happened in other sports. This is slightly bending the rules and cherry-picking talent from around the world. However, when there is a genuine affiliation to a country where you have been raised then it\u2019s a different matter.</p> <p>This a tricky issue because ultimately it\u2019s a question of identity.

On the other hand, my brother, Sone Aluko, played for the Super Eagles even though he was born and raised in Birmingham.</p> <p>It can be difficult for players who are perceived to have turned their backs on England, as Wilfried Zaha has found out after deciding to play for Ivory Coast.

I believe, much like the maturity of Rice\u2019s statement, there needs to be a much more mature attitude in football towards players who have dual nationality and respect their choices as legitimate without the cynical perception that comes with it.

In 1997 he presided as benevolent godfather at the birth of the journal Historical Materialism, encouraging, advising and contributing an essay for the first issue. His final years were dedicated to building the organisation rs21 \u2013 revolutionary socialism in the 21st century: writing for its website, organising and speaking at events. With his keen intellect and evergreen interest in the ideas of fellow activists and scholars, as well as his infectiously funny and warm personality, he inspired many devoted friends and comrades around the world, including myself. He is survived by Ewa, their daughters, Hannah and Nancy, and his siblings, Linda and Martin.",

Since the shock decision nearly a month ago to sack Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, the timbre of conversation surrounding women\u2019s football has degenerated precariously. As divisive former politicians and radio shock jocks weigh in, the outrage of old men once again deprives oxygen to the excellent achievements of talented young female athletes. There is no question that this latest furore is one almost exclusively of Football Federation Australia\u2019s own making, with the governing body providing neither sufficient grounds to justify Stajcic\u2019s removal nor sufficient transparency for the wider public to place trust in the confidential processes that prompted the FFA board to arrive to such an outcome. And while a hugely respected coach with a significant track record of achievement is entitled to demand answers and the opportunity to defend his reputation, an unwanted byproduct of this public slanging match is that the game he and many others worked so hard to build is suffering a major reputational setback. None of which is the fault of the hardworking women of Sydney FC or Perth Glory\u2019s W-League teams (and their staffs, of all genders).

      "body": "<p>I moisturise the way I moisturise because of Zo\u00eb Foster Blake.</p> <p>I chose my pram because of her too.</p> <p>I once paid US$350 (an insane amount of money!) for a massage because she recommended it.</p> <p>I say this not to foreshadow some kind of imagined special bond with Foster Blake, or to confess to being in her thrall, but to demonstrate her clout. I am a pretty average 30-year-old woman with pretty average tastes; only once have I been a devoted fan of someone, and only for a few months when I was 13 (Zac Hanson).</p> <p>But Foster Blake\u2019s influence on a certain type of Australian millennial woman is so vast and far-reaching that, even though I don\u2019t follow her particularly closely, and wouldn\u2019t cough up $45 to head to one of her book events, I will change the way I apply makeup based on her say-so. Because I know it will work.</p> <p>She is obviously zealous in her approach to work \u2013 her output is almost superhuman \u2013 but she claims to have almost no ambition. From a distance I was sceptical of this:<strong> </strong>I assumed she played it down to ramp up the \u201colder sister/best friend\u201d appeal \u2013 someone who\u2019s<em> just like us</em>, but just <em>somehow</em> ended up with nine books, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/28/the-wrong-girl-zoe-foster-blakes-bestseller-brings-australia-into-the-tv-romcom-revolution\">a TV show based on one of them (The Wrong Girl)</a>, and a cult skincare line by the age of 38.<br></p> <p>I figured that, like many women, she was shy of owning how ambitious she was: if you want to gain people\u2019s trust in Australia, you are not allowed to admit you want to be successful. But Foster Blake is sincere, self-conscious even, when she says shedid not actually aspire to much of it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it <em>is </em>ambition,\u201d she tells me when we meet. \u201cI don\u2019t think ambition is a dirty word; ambition to me implies a plan or a goal, and I never had them \u2013&nbsp;I don\u2019t still. I can\u2019t even give you a three-year plan, or a five-year plan.\u201d</p> <p>She has a ferocious work ethic and is attracted to driven men (\u201cI couldn\u2019t be with someone laid back, who just coasts along\u201d) \u2013 but she didn\u2019t actually set out for the magazine covers (<a href=\"https://www.elle.com.au/celebrity/zoe-foster-blake-elle-australia-photo-shoot-9675\">Elle was the biggest</a>), or the 600,000 Instagram followers. This, to her, is the difference between drive and ambition.</p> <p>\u201cI very much believe, \u2018Do what you\u2019re doing now and do that well\u2019 \u2013 so just fucking write a good email now, and do a good column now, and make that bit of work right now good. Be good in that meeting, show up, do the work. And <em>then</em> think about tomorrow.</p> <p>\u201cIf I went into this thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to make a skincare company, and I want it to be in Sephora in America, and I want it to be this, this and this,\u2019 that would cripple me because the weight of expectation is enormous ... [If you] try to get by day by day, try to be a good person on that day, then I think it works out.</p> <p>\u201cSo my main piece of advice to young women is just do good work and do it now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5253e4161e9c19369b279ce1e6a72d531611d3ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5253e4161e9c19369b279ce1e6a72d531611d3ce/0_0_2002_2795/716.jpg\" alt=\"Zo\u00eb Foster Blake\u2019s Love out in February 2019 through Penguin Random House\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Foster Blake\u2019s latest book Love! collectsher relationship advice columns from her days at Cosmopolitan magazine, as well as new essays about self-worth, and what to do for a successful, committed relationship. Foster Blake is married to the comedian Hamish Blake and has two children under four with him (her output really is superhuman).</p> <p>The book <a href=\"https://www.whimn.com.au/talk/think/sorry-but-zoe-foster-blakes-new-book-is-not-the-book-we-need-in-2019/news-story/ae93d8f5a93d7ac9ec38528fe5d0b407\">has been critiqued</a> as being heteronormative and clueless about dating culture in the age of Tinder. Foster Blake admits she hasn\u2019t dated online but says her advice is for when you are actually dating someone, not how to meet them.</p> <p>Some of her musings have echoes of Joan Didion\u2019s essay on self-respect \u2013 one of Foster Blake\u2019s essays is devoted to self-worth and how it differs to self-esteem \u2013 as well as a lot of self-help philosophy, of which Foster Blake is a devotee.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to say I was influenced by very thoughtful, meaningful, clever writers, but not really. Probably the biggest influence is my mum,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my home we have a hallway that\u2019s a library \u2013 and I say library, but really, Dad [the Miles Franklin award-winning David Foster] just knocked in some shelves. Dad\u2019s side is the thinkers, the philosophers \u2026 on the other side it\u2019s Mum\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m OK, you\u2019re OK!\u2019 [books]. Ever since the 80s she was well into it.\u201d</p> <p>Foster Blake\u2019s mother, who works in a maximum-security men\u2019s prison, has a \u201cfascination\u201d with self-improvement, which Foster Blake got into in a big way after a particularly bad break-up when she was 23. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQARb62guqb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

We made a best friend pact to announce the news with high-concept, oversaturated floral imagery and mismatched lingerie on the SECOND of February. But not only did my \u201cbest friend\u201d announce her pregnancy on the FIRST of February, she added an extra baby to make sure HER announcement was more special.

      "bodyText": "I moisturise the way I moisturise because of Zo\u00eb Foster Blake. I chose my pram because of her too. I once paid US$350 (an insane amount of money!) for a massage because she recommended it. I say this not to foreshadow some kind of imagined special bond with Foster Blake, or to confess to being in her thrall, but to demonstrate her clout. I am a pretty average 30-year-old woman with pretty average tastes; only once have I been a devoted fan of someone, and only for a few months when I was 13 (Zac Hanson). But Foster Blake\u2019s influence on a certain type of Australian millennial woman is so vast and far-reaching that, even though I don\u2019t follow her particularly closely, and wouldn\u2019t cough up $45 to head to one of her book events, I will change the way I apply makeup based on her say-so. Because I know it will work. She is obviously zealous in her approach to work \u2013 her output is almost superhuman \u2013 but she claims to have almost no ambition. From a distance I was sceptical of this: I assumed she played it down to ramp up the \u201colder sister/best friend\u201d appeal \u2013 someone who\u2019s just like us, but just somehow ended up with nine books, a TV show based on one of them (The Wrong Girl), and a cult skincare line by the age of 38. I figured that, like many women, she was shy of owning how ambitious she was: if you want to gain people\u2019s trust in Australia, you are not allowed to admit you want to be successful. But Foster Blake is sincere, self-conscious even, when she says shedid not actually aspire to much of it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is ambition,\u201d she tells me when we meet. \u201cI don\u2019t think ambition is a dirty word; ambition to me implies a plan or a goal, and I never had them \u2013 I don\u2019t still. I can\u2019t even give you a three-year plan, or a five-year plan.\u201d She has a ferocious work ethic and is attracted to driven men (\u201cI couldn\u2019t be with someone laid back, who just coasts along\u201d) \u2013 but she didn\u2019t actually set out for the magazine covers (Elle was the biggest), or the 600,000 Instagram followers. This, to her, is the difference between drive and ambition. \u201cI very much believe, \u2018Do what you\u2019re doing now and do that well\u2019 \u2013 so just fucking write a good email now, and do a good column now, and make that bit of work right now good. Be good in that meeting, show up, do the work. And then think about tomorrow. \u201cIf I went into this thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to make a skincare company, and I want it to be in Sephora in America, and I want it to be this, this and this,\u2019 that would cripple me because the weight of expectation is enormous ... [If you] try to get by day by day, try to be a good person on that day, then I think it works out. \u201cSo my main piece of advice to young women is just do good work and do it now.\u201d Foster Blake\u2019s latest book Love! collectsher relationship advice columns from her days at Cosmopolitan magazine, as well as new essays about self-worth, and what to do for a successful, committed relationship. Foster Blake is married to the comedian Hamish Blake and has two children under four with him (her output really is superhuman). The book has been critiqued as being heteronormative and clueless about dating culture in the age of Tinder. Foster Blake admits she hasn\u2019t dated online but says her advice is for when you are actually dating someone, not how to meet them. Some of her musings have echoes of Joan Didion\u2019s essay on self-respect \u2013 one of Foster Blake\u2019s essays is devoted to self-worth and how it differs to self-esteem \u2013 as well as a lot of self-help philosophy, of which Foster Blake is a devotee. \u201cI would like to say I was influenced by very thoughtful, meaningful, clever writers, but not really. Probably the biggest influence is my mum,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my home we have a hallway that\u2019s a library \u2013 and I say library, but really, Dad [the Miles Franklin award-winning David Foster] just knocked in some shelves. Dad\u2019s side is the thinkers, the philosophers \u2026 on the other side it\u2019s Mum\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m OK, you\u2019re OK!\u2019 [books]. Ever since the 80s she was well into it.\u201d Foster Blake\u2019s mother, who works in a maximum-security men\u2019s prison, has a \u201cfascination\u201d with self-improvement, which Foster Blake got into in a big way after a particularly bad break-up when she was 23. At the Sydney cafe where we\u2019re speaking, Foster Blake doesn\u2019t trust the barista to come up with the coffee she wants (a long macchiato), so asks for a double shot espresso with foam on the side. The barista brings it to the table, confessing she wanted to make sure she didn\u2019t mess it up; Foster Blake jokes with her it is the order of a \u201cpest\u201d. It captures another of Foster Blake\u2019s contradictions: she manages to be warm while getting what she wants.

It says the focus will be \u201con providing drought refuges and avoiding irreversible loss of species\u201d. Releasing its environmental watering outlook for 2019-20 the authority warns that there are almost no reserves of environmental water in the northern basin and that, as a result of above-average temperatures and low inflows over successive years, some important wetlands and floodplain forests have not received water for long periods. It says conditions in the Coorong, a Ramsar-listed wetland in South Australia, are deteriorating, as are conditions in the Narran Lakes, despite the federal government paying $80m for water rights aimed at restoring them. The Macquarie Marshes and floodplains along the Murray are also deteriorating. The report says the conditions in the lower Darling are particularly severe and the length and duration of cease-to-flow events in the lower Darling has skyrocketed since 2000.

The vast collection of text weighed in at 40 GB, enough to store about 35,000 copies of Moby Dick.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"039d19b3-e4e0-4adf-9d0e-940dc5909ebf\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>We gave OpenAI\u2019s AI the first two paragraphs of this story to see what it would write about itself. Here\u2019s the story it went with. To be clear: none of what follows is true.</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p>The first thing that strikes you about GPT2 is its simplicity. First, the system is built on unsupervised learning from text, which essentially means the software is trained to spot instances of certain words that, when paired with other words, trigger the system to give it a human review of them. The system also learns through example and repetition, but does not have the capability to recognize itself.</p>\n    <p>This new, artificial intelligence approach could revolutionize machine learning by making it a far more effective tool to teach machines about the workings of the language. Deep-learning systems currently only have the ability to learn something specific; a particular sentence, set of words or even a word or phrase; or what certain types of input (for example, how words are written on a paper) cause certain behaviors on computer screens.</p>\n    <p>GPT2 learns by absorbing words and sentences like food does at a restaurant, said DeepFakes\u2019 lead researcher Chris Nicholson, and then the system has to take the text and analyze it to find more meaning and meaning by the next layer of training. Instead of learning about words by themselves, the system learns by understanding word combinations, a technique researchers can then apply to the system\u2019s work to teach its own language.</p>\n    <p>Once the system is fully ready, DeepFakes plan to make the software openly available for machine learning researchers.</p>\n    <p>DeepFakes\u2019 research was supported by a $400,000 grant from the OpenAI Prize competition, which aims to boost the capabilities and diversity of autonomous systems that are safe to release to the public. OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to building and promoting open source AI systems, or as Nicholson aptly puts it, the \u201clast, best hope for humanity to be safe and secure on Earth.\u201d</p>\n    <p>DeepFakes\u2019 team consists of 15 researchers in 12 departments working together to make GPT2, which was the result of two years of work. However, the team is not releasing the code for the system \u2014 a fact that might be surprising to some if they\u2019re not familiar with how machine learning works \u2014 because GPT2 is so powerful, Nicholson explains.</p>\n    <p>He explained: \u201cAll of our AI systems must work together to make decisions that are more accurate and useful, but one of the problems we\u2019ve encountered lately is not knowing how to trust a system at all, especially when it is working in such a large, complex system. When a system performs its normal function, it tends to make errors because of an unforeseen problem at the deeper level of the system.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The team hopes that the software can create AI systems that are both safe and also highly useful in some way, but ultimately they\u2019re excited about what they\u2019ve built. Because of its ability to understand the human language, GPT2 is able to understand how to make some of the most important changes to the world in the years to come.</p>\n    <p>Nicholson explains: \u201cGPT2 is the kind of system that we really need to build because we\u2019ve built a society based entirely on humans creating information and then humans interpreting that information.\u201d<b><br></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The amount of data GPT2 was trained on directly affected its quality, giving it more knowledge of how to understand written text. It also led to the second breakthrough. GPT2 is far more general purpose than previous text models. By structuring the text that is input, it can perform tasks including translation and summarisation, and pass simple reading comprehension tests, often performing as well or better than other AIs that have been built specifically for those tasks.</p> \n<p>That quality, however, has also led OpenAI to go against its remit of pushing AI forward and keep GPT2 behind closed doors for the immediate future while it assesses what malicious users might be able to do with it. \u201cWe need to perform experimentation to find out what they can and can\u2019t do,\u201d said Jack Clark, the charity\u2019s head of policy. \u201cIf you can\u2019t anticipate all the abilities of a model, you have to prod it to see what it can do.

      "bodyText": "Like a bad Valentine\u2019s Day date, today\u2019s stock market rally has fizzled out after a perky start. The FTSE 100 index has closed just 6 points higher at 7,197, having earlier hit a four-month high around 7,230 points. While Brexit worries are sweeping the City again, the weak US retail sales also knocked confidence. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: US retail sales unexpectedly fell in December -1.2%, the largest decline in 9 years. Analysts had expected retail sales to have increased 0.1%. Retail sales are renowned for their volatility. Under normal circumstances one weak reading by no means constitutes a new trend. However, these dire figures feed directly into the market fear over slowing economic growth. This explains why we havre seem such a dramatic market reaction. The figures showed a broad weakness across most sectors, fuelling concerns that the cooling of the US economy from prior quarters, could be greater than initially projected. Although interestingly this goes against the impressively strong labour market data which we saw in December and January. US futures quickly erased gains resulting in a weaker start for Wall Street. Back in the markets, the pound is under pressure as the UK government faces fresh defeats over Brexit tonight. Sterling has shed more than half a cent against the US dollar to $1.278, a one-month low. Remain-supporting MPs are likely to rebel against Theresa May over a string of amendments, including one insisting that she publishes the government\u2019s no-deal economic impact assessment. Leave supporters are also up in arms, unhappy that the government isn\u2019t giving strong enough assurances that Brexit will definitely happen on 29 March. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Liveblog has all the details: Capital Economics are also concerned by the (apparent) slump in US retail spending; suggesting it will force the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates on hold for longer for some time: The unexpected plunge in control group retail sales in December means that fourth-quarter GDP growth was probably nearer 2.5% annualised than the 3.1% we had pencilled in and, more worryingly, it also suggests the economy entered 2019 with less momentum than anticipated. That doesn\u2019t mean the economy is falling into recession; after all, that decline is hard to square with the recent strength of payroll gains and the boost to households\u2019 purchasing power from lower energy prices. But with the producer price data suggesting inflationary pressures remain contained, it strengthens the case for the Fed to remain \u201cpatient\u201d in the months ahead. The retail sales plunge has prompted Morgan Stanley to slash their forecast for annualised US growth in the last quarter (the official estimate has been delayed until the end of December). They\u2019re also gloomy about the current quarter: The US stock market has opened in the red, as the weak retail sales figures worry traders. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 175 points, or 0.7%, to around 25,368. Consumer goods group Nike is the biggest faller, down 1.4%, reflecting concerns that the US shopper may be cutting back. Construction machinery giant Caterpillar, a good bellwether of the global economy, is down -1.25%. It\u2019s followed by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan (both down 1%), who would suffer if the US economy stumbled. The broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq are also in the red. However, Wall Street is still up 10% so far this year, so some retracement wouldn\u2019t be a shock. The latest US jobs figures aren\u2019t too hot either. The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims jumped last week, to 239,000, a 4,000 increase. This pushed the four-week moving average of initial jobless claims, a less volatile measure, hit a one-year high. Worryingly, the US retail sales report shows that 11 of 13 major retail categories showed a decline in sales last month. That includes non-store retailers (down 3.9%!), clothing stores and gas stations. Bloomberg has more details: Receipts at health and personal care stores fell 2%, the most since October 2016. Sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores tumbled 4.9%, the biggest drop since September 2008. December\u2019s US retail sales figures are so bad that some economists are questioning whether they really show what\u2019s happening in the American economy. Perhaps the shock 1.2% decline is all down to bad weather, or the US shutdown? Maybe it\u2019s a knock-on effect from Black Wednesday in November? Or could the US-China trade wars be to blame - hurting confidence and driving up the cost of Chinese-made imports? The surprise plunge in US retail sales has knocked the dollar down a little: The news has sent traders piling into US government bonds -- suggesting they expect weaker growth in 2019. That\u2019s pushed down the interest rate (or yield) on the debt. Newsflash: US retail sales have fallen at the sharpest rate since the financial crisis. Retail sales fell by 1.2% in December, figures just released show. That\u2019s the biggest drop since September 2009 - the end of the last US recession. Core retail sales (stripping out volatile items like food and gasoline) fell by 1.7% - following a 1% surge in November. Now it might just be a blip, as the US government shutdown may have deterred Americans from spending heavily. But it may also show that the economy is slowing. Here\u2019s our news story on the impact of the Brexit vote on UK growth: Back in the UK, cake chain Patisserie Valerie has been saved from closure. Irish private equity firm Causeway Capital is financing a management buyout for company, which was dragged into administration by a \u00a340m black hole in its accounts. This must be a relief for employees, as my colleague Sarah Butler explains: Almost 100 cafes will be rescued in the Causeway Capital deal, while another 21 sites under the Philpotts brand have been bought by AF Blakemore &amp; Son, the family owned company which is the largest operator of Spar franchise outlets in the UK. The two deals will save about 2,000 jobs. Pablo Shah, senior economist at the CEBR, isn\u2019t impressed by today\u2019s eurozone growth figures - showing the region only expanded by 0.2% last quarter. He sees trouble ahead: \u201cToday\u2019s data confirm that the Eurozone economy is now in the midst of a protracted slowdown, with risks stacked towards the downside going into 2019. Political unrest is simmering across the euro area, while the risks of a disorderly Brexit and an escalation of trade tensions with the US remain live.\u201d Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, says there are bright spots among the gloom: \u201cGermany, the largest economy in the Eurozone, narrowly avoided a recession in the fourth quarter as its output remained at the same levels as the previous quarter. Italy however had no such luck as its output contracted by 0.2% for a second consecutive quarter, entering its fifth recession in the 21st century. This is likely to increase its budget deficit as a proportion of GDP in the future, which could cause friction with European authorities. \u201cHowever, most of the slack from Germany\u2019s and Italy\u2019s poor performance was offset by strong output growth in Spain, the Netherlands and France which grew at a respectable 0.3% quarter-on-quarter despite the gilets jaunes protests. Spain continues to be the poster-child of the peripheral economies, with its economy growing by an average of 0.7% quarter-on-quarter. Stephen Hubble, chief analyst at City firm Centtrip, thinks the European Central Bank may have to step in again: \u201cMeanwhile, Italy has fallen into recession for the third time in a decade, Spain has failed to agree a budget for 2019, the Brexit deadline is looming and uncertainty over global slowdown and trade tensions is rising. The question is how long will the recovery take and what action can the ECB take to try and boost European growth, having stopped its QE programme at the end of December. You can read Jan Vleighe\u2019s speech here: Q: What has the Bank of England learned about the impact of political uncertainty on the economy? Gertjan Vlieghe replies that the Bank has learned that not all political uncertainty is the same. There are some where people scratch their head, and don\u2019t feel happy, but they keeps spending. And others where people do cut back on their spending, hurting the economy. Sometimes increased political uncertainty goes hand in hand with increased financial turmoil - credit spreads widening, risk premia increasing. When the two go together you see an economic effect. However, if the markets don\u2019t respond to political uncertainty, it doesn\u2019t seem to affect the economy, he says. So the Bank has to decide what kind of uncertainty the UK is facing now, Vlieghe concludes. He doesn\u2019t specifically mention Brexit. But in broad terms, this argument explains why some economists (wrongly) predicted a recession if Britain voted to leave the EU - only to find that consumers weren\u2019t panicking (not too surprising, given half of them should have been happy with the referendum result). Gertjan Vlieghe is taking questions, and is asked how soon the Bank of England might raise interest rates. He warns that the UK economic data \u201cis still deteriorating\u201d, so that\u2019s not a good time to raise borrowing costs. The Bank of England would need to see economic data stabilising, and then improving, first. But really, it all depends on Brexit. If a withdrawal agreement is reached, confidence shoots up and business investment rallies, then it might not take long before interest rates move higher, Vlieghe says. But if it takes longer to get clarity on Brexit, and firms take longer to respond, then borrowing costs (currently 0.75%) could stay low for longer. BoE policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has also warned that business confidence has suffered from Brexit uncertainty, while households have barely changed their behaviour: You can see Gertjan Vlieghe\u2019s comments on the economic costs of Brexit here: Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has taken a pop at the Vote Leave bus, in his speech on the impact of Brexit: We now have a decent picture of how Europe\u2019s economy fared in the last three months of 2018, and over the whole year. And it\u2019s not encouraging. Both the European Union and the eurozone only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter, with Germany stagnant, Italy in recession, and France and the UK both posting modest growth. In terms of quarterly growth, the UK was the third-best performer out of the EU\u2019s Big Five. Spain: 0.7% growth in Q4 2018 vs Q3 2018 France: 0.3% growth UK: 0.2% growth (as we learned on Monday) Germany: Zero growth (as we learned this morning) Italy: 0.1% contraction Taking a longer-term view, Eurozone GDP was only 1.2% higher than in Q4 2017, rising to 1.4% in the wider EU. Spain: 2.4% growth in Q4 2018 vs Q4 2017 UK: 1.3% growth in Q4 2018 vs Q4 2017 France: 0.9% growth in Q4 2018 vs Q4 2017 Germany: 0.6% growth in Q4 2018 vs Q4 2017 Italy: 0.1% growth in Q4 2018 vs Q4 2017 Newsflash: Eurostat has confirmed that the eurozone economy grew by 0.2% in the last quarter, in line with its first estimate two weeks ago. More to follow.... NEWSFLASH: Brexit is costing the economy \u00a3800m per week in lost growth, two-and-a-half years after the EU referendum, according to a Bank of England rate-setter. Speaking in London, Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, also predicted that a damaging no-deal scenario could force an emergency cut in interest rates. Vlieghe is explaining that that, since the EU referendum in June 2016, the British economy had lost about 2% of GDP relative to a scenario where that had been no significant domestic economic events. The vote has cost the economy about \u00a340bn per year, or about \u00a3800m per week of lost income, he said. That is more than double the \u00a3350m per week the Leave campaign printed on the side of its battle bus as the amount Britain sent to Brussels to pay for its EU membership. Vlieghe says: \u201cUK growth in the past two years has been weaker than we would have expected based on the performance of the global economy alone. Based on what happened in the rest of the world we would have expected UK growth to accelerate, but actually it slowed. Vlieghe, a former hedge fund manager, added that a no-deal Brexit could warrant an emergency cut in interest rates, should there be a further negative impact for the economy \u201cIn the case of a no-deal scenario I judge that an easing or an extended pause in monetary policy is more likely to be the appropriate policy than a tightening.\u201d Germany\u2019s economy ministry has weighed in, citing Brexit uncertainty and trade wars as key factors behind the country\u2019s slowdown. Reuters has the details: Britain\u2019s forthcoming departure from the European Union and trade disputes are still causing uncertainty for the German economy but the car industry is making progress in adapting to new WLTP pollution standards, the Economy Ministry said. It added that production sites dependent on inland shipping are no longer being hampered by low water levels. While the construction boom is likely to continue in the coming months, given an increase in orders, and private consumption will remain strong, indicators overall suggest that exports from Europe\u2019s largest economy will be subdued in the coming months, the ministry said. Germany\u2019s stock market has risen this morning, amid relief that its economy has avoided falling into recession. The DAX index has gained 0.25%, helping push the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 to its highest level since November. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the German growth report: Germany narrowly avoided a recession in the fourth quarter, reporting only zero growth as foreign trade made little contribution to Europe\u2019s largest economy. The lackluster figure released Thursday by the state statistics agency followed a 0.2% fall in output during the preceding third quarter. Business spending on machinery and equipment as well as construction supported the economy in the fourth quarter and kept Germany from suffering two straight quarters of negative growth, one definition of a recession. Slowing global trade amid U.S.-China trade tensions has been holding back Germany\u2019s export-focused economy. Growth last year was also hit by troubles in the auto industry when automakers had difficulty getting new cars certified under new emissions tests, and by low water on the Rhine River that interrupted commerce. The slowdown led the European Commission last week to cut its growth forecast for Germany for this year to 1.3% from 1.9%. The weak second half followed stronger performance in the first six months, leaving growth for the full year at 1.5%. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said the fourth-quarter weakness \u201cbodes ill for economic growth this year too.\u201d He said the fourth-quarter weakness could no longer be attributed to the auto sector problems since vehicle production edged up in the last three months of the year. He forecast 1.0% growth this year but added \u201cthere are significant downside risks to this forecast.\u201d Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Germany said that \u201cthe German economy escaped a technical recession with the smallest margin possible. The black eye just got blacker.\u201d He said, however, that many economic fundamentals remain strong. A low unemployment rate of 3.3 percent is helping support domestic demand. \u201cThe upside from today\u2019s data is that it can hardly get worse,\u201d Brzeski said. \u201cEconomic fundamentals remain solid and from here on, chances of a gradual rebound are still much higher than chances of yet another disappointment.\u201d Claus Vistesen, economist at Pantheon, says Germany\u2019s economy was held back by weak net trade and sluggish consumers\u2019 spending. He fears that the eurozone growth figures, which will be updated at 10am, will be lowered from 0.2% to just 0.1% for the last quarter. Just as bad as we feared, adding to our conviction that today\u2019s second estimate quarter-on-quarter for the eurozone as a whole will be revised down, by 0.1pp, to 0.1%. We don\u2019t see numerical details in this report, but the statistical office provide hints, indicating that domestic demand, mainly investment in construction and machinery and equipment, and government spending supported the economy. By contrast, growth in consumers\u2019 spending remained subdued, and net exports remained a severe drag on headline GDP growth. We don\u2019t yet have a breakdown of German GDP for the last quarter. But this chart shows how net trade had a negative impact in the third quarter of 2018 (when the economy shrank by 0.2%). It\u2019s from Florien Hense of Berenberg Bank, who says external shocks, political risks and temporary domestic problem all hurt growth. He adds: 2019 looks set to have started as 2018 ended \u2013 not well. While the risks loom large, chances are that a brighter spring could still follow the grey winter if trade tensions do not escalate badly, China escapes a hard landing and the UK avoids a hard Brexit. Ana Andrade, Germany analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that Germany\u2019s government may be forced to stimulate its economy this year (through higher spending): \u201cGerman weakness is attributed in part to the production disruption in the auto sector that resulted from the introduction of the EU\u2019s new emissions standards, to rising geopolitical uncertainty and the softer growth in the Chinese economy. The economy will enter a slowdown in 2109 but this will be manageable. Still, risks to the economy in 2019 are on the downsize and are mainly external and geopolitical. It if turns out to be worst than expected, we believe the government would be willing to provide some fiscal stimulus. It is very well-placed to do so.\u201d Carsten Brzeski of ING says Germany\u2019s economic \u201cblack eye\u201d has taken a blow, after its economy failed to grow in the last quarter. The German economy escaped a technical recession with the smallest margin possible. The black eye just got blacker. Still, the upside from today\u2019s data is that it can hardly get worse. Brzeski also reels off a list of reasons for Germany\u2019s poor performance of late: The weak performance of the German economy in the second half of the year is the result of (too many) one-offs, surfacing structural weaknesses and external uncertainties. Just think of cars, low water levels in main rivers, the trade conflict between the US and China, Brexit or the lack of investment in digital and traditional infrastructure, delays of railways and airlines as well as hardly any significant new structural reforms in the last ten years. What a list! However, it is still not necessarily the end of a long positive cycle. Germany used to be the powerhouse of the eurozone economy, but a cocktail of blows from home and abroad have left it nursing a bad hangover. 1) The global slowdown. The world economy has come off the boil in recent months, partly due to Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. That means less investment, so lower demand for machinery produced by Germany\u2019s industrial heartland. China, in particular, has been cutting back on imports as its economy slows. 2) Brexit. The UK isn\u2019t the only country where Brexit uncertainty is causing anxiety. German bosses also fear a no-deal crisis, and will be making investment decisions accordingly. 3) Car woes. The Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal is still reverberating around Germany\u2019s auto sector. Carmakers now have to meet tougher pollution tests, creating a backlog of models waiting to be tested and approved, and a backlog at the factories. 4) The weather. Germany suffered some pretty devastating flooding in 2018, causing several fatalities and forcing thousands to leave their homes. That disruption hasn\u2019t helped the economy. Some economists are predicting that Germany\u2019s economy will pick up in 2019. Here\u2019s analysts at Danske Bank: And here\u2019s Azad Zangana of Schroders: Destatis says that domestic demand made a positive contribution to German growth in the last quarter -- that\u2019ll be household consumption and government spending. However, trade (so often the backbone of German growth) \u201cdid not make a positive contribution\u201d. That suggests that US-China trade war, and its knock-on effect on the world economy, is hurting Germany. This chart shows how German\u2019s growth rate has slowed: Good morning. Germany is teetering on the brink of recession, after the eurozone\u2019s largest economy failed to grow in the last quarter. New GDP figures just released show that German GDP was flat in the October-December quarter, following a 0.2% contraction in July-September. That means Germany has JUST avoided a technical recession, but has also failed to post any growth since June (when its footballers were crashing out of the World Cup). Destatis, the Germany statistics body says: After a dynamic start into the first half of the year (+0.4% in the first quarter, +0.5% in the second quarter), a small dip (-0.2% in the third quarter, 0.0% in the fourth quarter) was recorded in the second half of the year. For the whole year of 2018, this was an increase of 1.4% (calendar adjusted: 1.5%). Hence growth was slightly smaller than reported in January. Interestingly, that 1.4% matches the UK\u2019s own performance in 2018. Reaction to follow.... Also coming up today It\u2019s a big day in the US-China trade war. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer will hold talks with Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping, later today. If the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate goes well, Donald Trump could extend the deadline for reaching an agreement that addresses US concerns over intellectual property protections. We also get more eurozone GDP figures today, giving a broader picture of Europe\u2019s economy (which is increasingly looking rather weak). The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP (second estimate) for Q4 2018 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment statistics for Q4 2018 1.30pm GMT: US retail sales for January",

      "bodyText": "The first trailer for the much-anticipated second season of Killing Eve has been unveiled and features psychosexual drama, black comedy and at least one ominous shot of a kitchen knife. Developed by Fleabag\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the BBC spy drama, which first aired last year, stars Jodie Comer as the ruthless globe-hopping assassin Villanelle and Sandra Oh as Eve Polastri, the MI5 officer tasked with hunting her down. The series was a hit with viewers, becoming one of the most watched series on the BBC iPlayer. It also received widespread acclaim from critics, and was named the Guardian\u2019s best TV show of 2018. The trailer for the new season addresses the cliffhanger at the end of the first, which saw Villanelle flee her Paris apartment after being stabbed by Eve. A worried Eve admits to her superiors that she \u201cmight have killed her\u201d. Later we see a wounded Villanelle collapsing while attempting to escape from a hospital bed, before returning to her ruthless activities of season one.

      "body": "<p>As more and more Democrats line up for a chance to take on Donald Trump in 2020 the president has predictably responded by doling out insults and nicknames. But while Democrats remain the object of Trump\u2019s ire for now, he may soon have to worry about Republican primary challengers as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/13/trump-campaign-slogan-hillary-clinton-stronger-together\">\u2018Stronger together\u2019: why Trump\u2019s theft of Hillary Clinton\u2019s slogan is tradition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since Trump\u2019s 2016 run, centrist Republicans have watched aghast as the president transformed the party and its supporters to fit his own style and beliefs. Many of his former opponents within the Republican party fell in line, but others have not.</p> <p>As the 2020 election cycle begins, some Republicans may now seek to challenge Trump in the presidential primaries.</p> <p>One potential insurgent Republican candidate is former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who was the vice-presidential nominee on Gary Johnson\u2019s Libertarian party ticket in 2016.</p> <p>Last week, the Associated Press reported that Weld had changed his party registration from Libertarian back to Republican. In late January, he told the New Hampshire television station WMUR that he would not say anything regarding whether he was running or not until he gave a speech in the state \u2013 home to the first primary in the nation \u2013 on 15 February.</p> <p>If he enters the race \u2013 and does so in his old party \u2013 he will be the first rebel Republican to challenge Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt certainly seems that if he runs, it will be as a Republican. And that presents a danger to Trump because incumbent presidents who get primaried usually end up weakened and losing the general election,\u201d said Rob Gray, who was Weld\u2019s press secretary when he was governor of Massachusetts.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe establishment Republican theory is that four years out in the cold with a Democratic president is better for the Republican party long-term than eight years of Trump pushing out and turning off liberal, middle-of-the-road Republicans from the party.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the US morning briefing\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"A different kind of daily email\" data-form-description=\"Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon.\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the US morning briefing</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest speculation over Weld\u2019s candidacy comes as others are also said to be considering taking on Trump. Trump critic and two-time presidential candidate John Kasich, who recently finished his final term as governor of Ohio, has been considering a run. Maryland governor Larry Hogan is also a potential contender. </p> <p>But facing off against Trump is a daunting challenge. He attacks those who criticise him relentlessly \u2013 and for Republicans hoping to advance in the party\u2019s ranks, facing the wrath of the president, his allies and his large base of voters is could be politically dangerous. Even the president\u2019s biggest enemies on the 2016 primary campaign trail, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz (who Trump tauntingly called \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d) were quick to fall in line.</p> <p>With the party firmly under Trump\u2019s control, the GOP is now working to stifle any potential rebellion.</p> <p>Last month, Republican National Committee members unanimously voted to approve a resolution declaring \u201cundivided support\u201d of Trump and his presidency at the body\u2019s annual winter meeting in New Mexico. Meanwhile, in South Carolina, Republicans have voiced support for cancelling the state\u2019s primary to block potential challengers and protect the president.</p> <p>\u201cThe Republican party has really fallen in line behind Donald Trump, in part because they\u2019re afraid of his base and in part because they\u2019re afraid of being targeted by Donald Trump,\u201d said Erin O\u2019Brien, an associate professor of political science at University of Massachusetts Boston.</p> <p>While that could dissuade some Republican candidates, O\u2019Brien said it will not scare off Weld, who operates independent of the party apparatus.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to run and lose. Bill Weld is not afraid to run to make a point,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"740bf15d5cfa962cb9cf75eaa285e25a2afa8f55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/740bf15d5cfa962cb9cf75eaa285e25a2afa8f55/0_16_5086_3052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Weld in Canton, Massachusetts on 8 November 2016. \u2018He\u2019s not afraid to run and lose,\u2019 Erin O\u2019Brien said of Weld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Weld in Canton, Massachusetts on 8 November 2016. \u2018He\u2019s not afraid to run and lose,\u2019 Erin O\u2019Brien said of Weld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dwyer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Weld or any other candidate who runs as a Republican, playing the spoiler might be the best they can do. The president\u2019s approval ratings remain high among Republicans and few observers see him losing the nomination.</p> <p>But historically, wounding is what insurgent candidates have done best. George HW Bush defeated fellow Republican Pat Buchanan\u2019s primary effort in 1992 only to lose to Bill Clinton in the general. In 1980, Jimmy Carter lost 12 primary contests to Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy before losing by a landslide to Ronald Reagan. And in 1976, Reagan challenged Gerald Ford, who lost to Carter.</p> <p>Any attempt to primary the president would be \u201can attempt to wound\u201d, said Steve Duprey, a New Hampshire Republican National Committee member who was a senior adviser to the late John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cNow with the basically co-joining of the Republican National Committee with the Trump campaign so it\u2019s one, I think it makes it a very daunting task to take him on.\u201d</p> <p>Still, some do see some room for potential insurgent candidates to mount more competitive campaigns aimed at denying Trump the nomination.</p> <p>Tom Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney general who served as a senior national advisor to Kasich in the 2016 election, said there is \u201cno appetite\u201d in the Republican party for a challenger. However, if Trump seems unlikely to win re-election in 2020, Republicans afraid of losing the White House after having already lost the House of Representatives could be more open to an insurgent candidate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jan/17/2020-election-candidates-list-democrats-primaries-trump-bernie-sanders-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-kamala-harris-beto-o-rourke-running\">Who's running in 2020?

      "bodyText": "As more and more Democrats line up for a chance to take on Donald Trump in 2020 the president has predictably responded by doling out insults and nicknames. But while Democrats remain the object of Trump\u2019s ire for now, he may soon have to worry about Republican primary challengers as well. Since Trump\u2019s 2016 run, centrist Republicans have watched aghast as the president transformed the party and its supporters to fit his own style and beliefs. Many of his former opponents within the Republican party fell in line, but others have not. As the 2020 election cycle begins, some Republicans may now seek to challenge Trump in the presidential primaries. One potential insurgent Republican candidate is former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who was the vice-presidential nominee on Gary Johnson\u2019s Libertarian party ticket in 2016. Last week, the Associated Press reported that Weld had changed his party registration from Libertarian back to Republican. In late January, he told the New Hampshire television station WMUR that he would not say anything regarding whether he was running or not until he gave a speech in the state \u2013 home to the first primary in the nation \u2013 on 15 February. If he enters the race \u2013 and does so in his old party \u2013 he will be the first rebel Republican to challenge Trump. \u201cIt certainly seems that if he runs, it will be as a Republican. And that presents a danger to Trump because incumbent presidents who get primaried usually end up weakened and losing the general election,\u201d said Rob Gray, who was Weld\u2019s press secretary when he was governor of Massachusetts. He added: \u201cThe establishment Republican theory is that four years out in the cold with a Democratic president is better for the Republican party long-term than eight years of Trump pushing out and turning off liberal, middle-of-the-road Republicans from the party.\u201d The latest speculation over Weld\u2019s candidacy comes as others are also said to be considering taking on Trump. Trump critic and two-time presidential candidate John Kasich, who recently finished his final term as governor of Ohio, has been considering a run. Maryland governor Larry Hogan is also a potential contender. But facing off against Trump is a daunting challenge. He attacks those who criticise him relentlessly \u2013 and for Republicans hoping to advance in the party\u2019s ranks, facing the wrath of the president, his allies and his large base of voters is could be politically dangerous. Even the president\u2019s biggest enemies on the 2016 primary campaign trail, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz (who Trump tauntingly called \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d) were quick to fall in line. With the party firmly under Trump\u2019s control, the GOP is now working to stifle any potential rebellion. Last month, Republican National Committee members unanimously voted to approve a resolution declaring \u201cundivided support\u201d of Trump and his presidency at the body\u2019s annual winter meeting in New Mexico. Meanwhile, in South Carolina, Republicans have voiced support for cancelling the state\u2019s primary to block potential challengers and protect the president. \u201cThe Republican party has really fallen in line behind Donald Trump, in part because they\u2019re afraid of his base and in part because they\u2019re afraid of being targeted by Donald Trump,\u201d said Erin O\u2019Brien, an associate professor of political science at University of Massachusetts Boston. While that could dissuade some Republican candidates, O\u2019Brien said it will not scare off Weld, who operates independent of the party apparatus. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to run and lose. Bill Weld is not afraid to run to make a point,\u201d she said. For Weld or any other candidate who runs as a Republican, playing the spoiler might be the best they can do. The president\u2019s approval ratings remain high among Republicans and few observers see him losing the nomination. But historically, wounding is what insurgent candidates have done best. George HW Bush defeated fellow Republican Pat Buchanan\u2019s primary effort in 1992 only to lose to Bill Clinton in the general. In 1980, Jimmy Carter lost 12 primary contests to Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy before losing by a landslide to Ronald Reagan. And in 1976, Reagan challenged Gerald Ford, who lost to Carter. Any attempt to primary the president would be \u201can attempt to wound\u201d, said Steve Duprey, a New Hampshire Republican National Committee member who was a senior adviser to the late John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cNow with the basically co-joining of the Republican National Committee with the Trump campaign so it\u2019s one, I think it makes it a very daunting task to take him on.\u201d Still, some do see some room for potential insurgent candidates to mount more competitive campaigns aimed at denying Trump the nomination. Tom Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney general who served as a senior national advisor to Kasich in the 2016 election, said there is \u201cno appetite\u201d in the Republican party for a challenger. However, if Trump seems unlikely to win re-election in 2020, Republicans afraid of losing the White House after having already lost the House of Representatives could be more open to an insurgent candidate. \u201cThe only cogent argument that will cut is electability,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if there was a weakening of the president\u2019s numbers, I think that would potentially give more credence to a challenger.\u201d The former chair of the Massachusetts Republican party, Jennifer Nassour, said \u201c2016 shook history up a little bit. I don\u2019t know if I would apply historical norms to any election after 2016. \u201cA lot of centrists are looking for someone to call home \u2013 and that\u2019s people both on the right and the left who feel the parties have left them,\u201d she added. But to University of New Hampshire political science professor Dante Scala, while potential candidates like Weld and Kasich appear attractive to moderate Republicans and independent voters, he believes there is only so far they can go. \u201cUnless the bottom drops out from underneath the president, all they\u2019re going to do is hit that ceiling,\u201d he said.",

Because the US census refuses to recognize me.</p> <p>There is a lot of talk about \u201cblack and brown people\u201d these days, but did you know that \u201cbrown\u201d is not one of the five official races listed on the census? Those five are: white; black or African American; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific islander. These categories are, to be frank, incoherent when considered together, a mishmash of skin color, indigeneity, and geography.</p> <p>America\u2019s racial categories have changed over time, mostly because our notion of what constitutes racial difference changes over time. Back in 1890, the census wanted to know if you were \u201cquadroon\u201d (a quarter black ancestry) or \u201coctoroon\u201d (an eighth black ancestry). For the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses, \u201cHindu\u201d was a racial category. There have also been forward-thinking developments. Starting with the 2000 census, anyone can now check more than one race, which is progress. And yet brown is still absent.</p> <p>As a brown-skinned Arab American, I feel slighted by this omission. But the Latinx community is arguably the biggest loser in this case. By law, the census (and all federal statistical agencies) must follow the standards on race and ethnicity established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and since 1997, the OMB has hewn to this list of five. In 2000, the census began to use a two-question format. The first question asked everyone about possible Hispanic heritage (the wording has slightly changed over the years), and the second asked about race.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It should surprise no one that the administration ruined decades of good work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While it\u2019s certainly true, as the Census Bureau notes, that \u201cpeople of Hispanic origin may be of any race(s),\u201d the question on race still forced Hispanics and Latinos to fit themselves into the five official categories, even though data show that at least two-thirds of Hispanics consider their Hispanic background to be a part of their racial background. On the 2010 census, an astonishing 37% percent of Latinxs (19 million people) elected \u201csome other race,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center. In fact, 97% of those who checked that category and no other were Hispanic.</p> <p>\u201cSome other race\u201d is now the third-largest racial category in the United States.</p> <p>No doubt some people will find this fact comforting, as if it might herald the imminent arrival of an anti-racist America. (Incidentally, the research shows that the more \u201ccolor blind\u201d you believe you are, the more racist you tend to be.) But the census doesn\u2019t make America racist. America\u2019s history and its present do that work \u2013 and until we\u2019ve arrived at a point where racism doesn\u2019t exist, it makes sense to collect the most reliable statistics on race in the country to understand how racism works and what its effects really are. Since \u201csome other race\u201d is not one of the five official categories, its utility is severely limited. Each \u201csome other race\u201d selection is typically converted by the Census Bureau into one or more of the five recognized categories, making the census far less accurate and responsive than it could \u2013 or should \u2013 be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/12/esquire-cover-story-american-boy-black-history-month\">Esquire criticized for white 'American Boy' cover during Black History Month</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And an accurate census matters. A lot. The census is a powerful instrument used to reapportion congressional seats and electoral college votes. Political districts are drawn on the basis of the census. Everything from healthcare to highway construction uses its data. Accuracy in the census is necessary to the partitioning of over $800bn of annual federal funding, including to school lunch programs, section 8 housing, and Medicaid. Census data are key to designing community-level programs and enforcing civil-rights protections.</p> <p>So finding yourself in the census is important. And, although our situations are similar (and both groups are undercounted by the census), my problem is different than the one the Latinx community faces. Many Latinxs don\u2019t see their worlds reflected in the census as it now stands. I, on other hand, am forced to choose a reality that isn\u2019t my own.</p> <p>According to the OMB\u2019s classifications, \u201cwhite\u201d refers to \u201ca person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or north Africa.\u201d My origins are from Egypt. Every day, I live my life in America as a brown person. Defining me as white and likening me to a European, as the census does, is absurd.</p> <p>As with the Latinx community, people from the Middle East and north Africa can often fit within multiple racial categories.

      "bodyText": "I am a brown person. How do I know? Every time I look in a mirror, a brown person stares back at me. If I were to compare the color of my arms to that of a brown paper bag, I wouldn\u2019t find much difference. But also, when it\u2019s dark outside and I\u2019m walking by myself, white people sometimes cross the street to avoid passing me. Then there are the repeated occasions when I\u2019ve been mistaken for a taxi driver or a drugstore clerk, just because I\u2019m standing beside a parked car or buying deodorant. And while it\u2019s true that I\u2019m not so dark that automated soap dispensers can\u2019t see me, I\u2019m also invisible in a more fundamental way in the United States. Why? Because the US census refuses to recognize me. There is a lot of talk about \u201cblack and brown people\u201d these days, but did you know that \u201cbrown\u201d is not one of the five official races listed on the census? Those five are: white; black or African American; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific islander. These categories are, to be frank, incoherent when considered together, a mishmash of skin color, indigeneity, and geography. America\u2019s racial categories have changed over time, mostly because our notion of what constitutes racial difference changes over time. Back in 1890, the census wanted to know if you were \u201cquadroon\u201d (a quarter black ancestry) or \u201coctoroon\u201d (an eighth black ancestry). For the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses, \u201cHindu\u201d was a racial category. There have also been forward-thinking developments. Starting with the 2000 census, anyone can now check more than one race, which is progress. And yet brown is still absent. As a brown-skinned Arab American, I feel slighted by this omission. But the Latinx community is arguably the biggest loser in this case. By law, the census (and all federal statistical agencies) must follow the standards on race and ethnicity established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and since 1997, the OMB has hewn to this list of five. In 2000, the census began to use a two-question format. The first question asked everyone about possible Hispanic heritage (the wording has slightly changed over the years), and the second asked about race. While it\u2019s certainly true, as the Census Bureau notes, that \u201cpeople of Hispanic origin may be of any race(s),\u201d the question on race still forced Hispanics and Latinos to fit themselves into the five official categories, even though data show that at least two-thirds of Hispanics consider their Hispanic background to be a part of their racial background. On the 2010 census, an astonishing 37% percent of Latinxs (19 million people) elected \u201csome other race,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center. In fact, 97% of those who checked that category and no other were Hispanic. \u201cSome other race\u201d is now the third-largest racial category in the United States. No doubt some people will find this fact comforting, as if it might herald the imminent arrival of an anti-racist America. (Incidentally, the research shows that the more \u201ccolor blind\u201d you believe you are, the more racist you tend to be.) But the census doesn\u2019t make America racist. America\u2019s history and its present do that work \u2013 and until we\u2019ve arrived at a point where racism doesn\u2019t exist, it makes sense to collect the most reliable statistics on race in the country to understand how racism works and what its effects really are. Since \u201csome other race\u201d is not one of the five official categories, its utility is severely limited. Each \u201csome other race\u201d selection is typically converted by the Census Bureau into one or more of the five recognized categories, making the census far less accurate and responsive than it could \u2013 or should \u2013 be. And an accurate census matters. A lot. The census is a powerful instrument used to reapportion congressional seats and electoral college votes. Political districts are drawn on the basis of the census. Everything from healthcare to highway construction uses its data. Accuracy in the census is necessary to the partitioning of over $800bn of annual federal funding, including to school lunch programs, section 8 housing, and Medicaid. Census data are key to designing community-level programs and enforcing civil-rights protections. So finding yourself in the census is important. And, although our situations are similar (and both groups are undercounted by the census), my problem is different than the one the Latinx community faces. Many Latinxs don\u2019t see their worlds reflected in the census as it now stands. I, on other hand, am forced to choose a reality that isn\u2019t my own. According to the OMB\u2019s classifications, \u201cwhite\u201d refers to \u201ca person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or north Africa.\u201d My origins are from Egypt. Every day, I live my life in America as a brown person. Defining me as white and likening me to a European, as the census does, is absurd. As with the Latinx community, people from the Middle East and north Africa can often fit within multiple racial categories. But to compel everyone from the Middle East and north Africa to select \u201cwhite\u201d on the census is to force us to participate in our own official erasure. The fact is that, regardless of our color, people from the Middle East and north Africa are subject to multiple forms of discrimination in America, from travel bans to stereotyping by law enforcement. Consider Arab Americans, the largest single group from the Middle East and north Africa. A 2011 study found that resumes for managerial-level jobs that came with \u201cArab-sounding\u201d male names received only half as many replies as identical resumes that came with white male names. In the realm of housing, the results are similar.

      "bodyText": "British TV presenters Graham Norton and Alan Carr have confirmed that they will be sashaying their way on to the judging panel of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK, bringing with them their distinct \u2018charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent\u2019. The pair join RuPaul and Michelle Visage as the judges of the reality show\u2019s UK spinoff, which will search out Britain\u2019s most fabulous drag queens and is set to air on BBC Three later this year. Norton and Carr will rotate each week, being joined by an additional celebrity guest, with both appearing in the finale to crown the UK\u2019s Next Drag Superstar. Norton is a long-time fan of the show, and has previously appeared on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race: All Stars season two in the US in 2016. \u201cBecoming part of the Drag Race family makes me ridiculously happy. I can\u2019t wait to see what the UK drag queens bring to the party, but they better weeeeerk!!!\u201d he said in a statement. Carr added: \u201cWow! To be sat next to Michelle Visage and Mama Ru as a guest judge on possibly one of my all-time favourite shows EVER is a dream come true. I can\u2019t wait to see what the UK Queens have got in store \u2013 it\u2019s going to be sickening! *does death drop*.\u201d Carr has been a fan of RuPaul ever since the 59-year-old drag queen appeared on his chat show Alan Carr\u2019s Chatty Man, where he discussed the show\u2019s popularity: \u201cThe show is a success because you get to see that when you have a dream it really cannot be held down, and it inspires the audience. These kids have been up against everything you can imagine, and doing drag in a male-dominated culture is an act of treason really. So they\u2019re my heroes.\u201d After the BBC announced the news, RuPaul said: \u201cI was both shocked and delighted when Graham and Alan told me they\u2019d be wearing tucking panties when sitting at the judges\u2019 table. I told them it was not necessary, but they insisted. Now that\u2019s what I call dedication!\u201d Drag Race has become a global smash-hit, airing in 193 countries, although every network in the US bar one turned it down initially. The US edition has gained a huge cult following and has been nominated for a record-breaking 23 Emmy awards. However, the show was criticised by drag queen, trans and LGBTQ communities for a lack of trans-inclusivity, after RuPaul told the Guardian he would \u201cprobably not\u201d let a trans woman appear as a competitor.

Like Simon, I thought Fratton Park\u2019s raucous atmosphere would win her over and set her up as a Pompey fan for life. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was having the desired effect until about midway through the second half I look round to see my girlfriend stood on her seat, pointing at Neil Shipperley and shouting abuse at the ex-Saint. That\u2019s when I knew. Seventeen years later we are now married with two children\u201d \u2013 Ben Williams.</p> <p>\u201cI took my godson Elliot to my beloved Villa Park for his first ever Premier League match. We were playing Everton and Elliot spent the scoreless first half asking if we were winning yet. To make up for the disappointment I promised him chips at the end of the game. He spent the second half trying to bid me up to a pair of goalkeeping gloves which he \u2018really needed\u2019.

Buoyed, cheered and generally heartened by the sight of Tottenham Hotspur piling some Big Cup hurt on German league leaders Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night, Arsenal fans can look forward to some fun of their own when their team goes toe to toe with the works team of a tractor factory in Belarus tonight in Euro Vase. Bate Borisov are the opposition in the first knockout round and while most of their players are unknown outside their native country, there will at least be one recognisable face among the ranks. Currently enjoying his fifth separate spell at the club, Alexander Hleb spent three happy years at Arsenal but expects his team to be a little rusty because they haven\u2019t played an actual game since the middle of December and are likely to be about as match fit as your sedentary Fiver nursing a groin injury, a stinking hangover and several kilos of excess winter blubber. \u201cIt will be hard for us, and very much so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will try to squeeze the maximum out of the physical form that we have gained. The usual preparation is under way. We held a training camp in Turkey and got into shape, as far as possible at the current stage. It is clear that we did not achieve ideal conditions in such a short time. But we will try to look decent at home.\u201d Whether or not he\u2019ll be looking decent is anyone\u2019s guess (it is Valentine\u2019s Day after all), but Mesut \u00d6zil will also be absent, the Arsenal playmaker having been left at home because [Fiver consults official Arsenal party line] although he\u2019s recovered from the illness given as the reason for him not travelling to Huddersfield last weekend, he hasn\u2019t trained often enough to be ready for an encounter with a team of vastly inferior players who have hardly run a lap of the training ground between them since long before Christmas. Interestingly, when he did deign to set foot on the training pitch on Tuesday, the German was rocking a double-snood around his neck and head which suggested the chilliness of the Belarusian winter may not be for him. And that he\u2019s never heard of the beanie hat. In other Euro Vase news, the players of Chelsea will be whiling away their Valentine\u2019s evening in the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6, where few vistas are more romantic than the sunset view over Ribersborg beach. A famously discerning bunch renowned for their appreciation of local culture while on their travels, Chelsea fans who take time out to appreciate it are in for a treat.

FIVER LETTER \u201cIn response to Simon Toms, I had a different experience when taking my new girlfriend to Fratton Park in 2002 for a Division One game against Wimbledon. Like Simon, I thought Fratton Park\u2019s raucous atmosphere would win her over and set her up as a Pompey fan for life. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was having the desired effect until about midway through the second half I look round to see my girlfriend stood on her seat, pointing at Neil Shipperley and shouting abuse at the ex-Saint. That\u2019s when I knew. Seventeen years later we are now married with two children\u201d \u2013 Ben Williams. \u201cI took my godson Elliot to my beloved Villa Park for his first ever Premier League match. We were playing Everton and Elliot spent the scoreless first half asking if we were winning yet. To make up for the disappointment I promised him chips at the end of the game. He spent the second half trying to bid me up to a pair of goalkeeping gloves which he \u2018really needed\u2019. Two late goals from Everton (and no goalkeeping gloves) topped the day off beautifully and hockey quickly became his sport of choice\u201d \u2013 Katie Maddock.

      "body": "<p>Before writing The Game, Neil Strauss was a self-described \u201clump of nerd\u201d. But his 2005 bestseller, which has shifted more than 3m copies around the world (270,000 in the UK), revealed the secrets of his midlife transformation into a ladies\u2019 man, through time spent in the company of professional pickup artists. Techniques revealed by Strauss \u2013 practised long before his book, but never before exposed to such a big audience \u2013 included \u201cnegging\u201d (making negative comments to lower a woman\u2019s self-esteem so she\u2019ll stay to earn approval) and \u201ccavemanning\u201d (aggressively escalating physical contact).</p> <p>None of this reads very well in 2019 and this week, the director of women\u2019s charity Zero Tolerance Rachel Adamson <a href=\"https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/edinburgh-based-canongate-publishers-urged-to-drop-the-game-a-notorious-how-to-guide-for-self-styled-pick-up-artists/\">called out UK publisher Canongate</a> for publishing Strauss\u2019s book. \u201cThe Game is marketed on the premise that men are entitled to women\u2019s attention and affection,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says women are something to be attained and then thrown away. These sexist attitudes perpetuate dangerous ideas and opinions that cause violence against women.\u201d Canongate has declined to comment.</p> <p>Before The Game was even a glint in Strauss\u2019s eye, dating books had been steadily reshaping romance into a hardened, cynical transaction, positioning both sexes in a standoff of mutual suspicion. Some books are harmless \u2013 big bestsellers, such as Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus and Why Men Love Bitches are really, at heart, focused on building confidence and communication. Some adopt strangely corporate language \u2013 books such as The Elite Way dictate \u201cdiscipline\u201d and \u201cstrategy\u201d \u2013 and others affect a coolness, such as The Code by Nate Penn and Lawrence LaRose, in which a section titled How to Meet the Relatives reads simply: \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Increasingly, some have a faux-feminist brio: a range of modern guides telling women to push for better sex, to \u201cfuck like a porn star\u201d, act like a Frenchwoman, and very often, approach gender with a retrograde conservatism.</p> <p>Such a simplistic approach, when heterosexuality, binary gender and monogamy are no longer the only norms, works for dating books as they are really selling simplicity: <em>there is nothing intrinsically wrong with you, you just need these six, 12, 15 rules!</em> But the worst of them approach gender with the subtlety of a hammer: all women want to be dominated and are prone to discarding men like litter if they don\u2019t order for them in restaurants or fail to present an engagement ring within two years. Men, meanwhile, are all utter messes and sub-bestial beings who must disguise their worst traits with false charm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Susan Patton\u2019s Marry Smart contains the questionable warning for women who just want to have sex: 'It\u2019s the lonely cow that gives away free milk.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So why single out The Game? What about other bestselling dating guides such as Steve Harvey\u2019s Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, which includes the advice: \u201cMen don\u2019t come up to you to just talk. We come up to you with a plan. We\u2019re looking across the room at you, and we don\u2019t care about your hopes and dreams. We don\u2019t care about what your future holds. We saw something we wanted.\u201d (Some<em>thing</em> is telling.) Or The Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider, the 1995 shocker for single women that included the chapter Most Men Find Chatty Women Annoying and was updated in 2013 to include the new woke chapter about texting, Don\u2019t Talk Too Much in the First Few Weeks? Or Lori Gottlieb\u2019s Marry Him! The Case for Settling for Mr Good Enough, which instructs women not to be picky, because \u201csome guy is going to have to focus on the good things about you, even though he may have wanted someone more easygoing or taller\u201d. Or Susan Patton\u2019s Marry Smart, which includes the questionable warning for women who just want to have sex: \u201cIt\u2019s the lonely cow that gives away free milk.\u201d Patton\u2019s book was published in 2014.</p> <p>Reading The Game in 2019, it is telling that Strauss himself has disowned it, having exchanged the glamour of fishing used condoms out of the jacuzzi at his LA mansion for babies and a wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/10/neil-strauss-the-game-book-truth\">telling the Guardian</a> in 2015 that \u201cit was never meant to be an advocacy of a lifestyle, even though it\u2019s come to symbolise one\u201d. This seems disingenuous, given that Strauss wrote a sequel, The Rules of the Game, in 2007 \u2013 in his own words, a 30-day \u201chow-to\u201d guide that also sold well (85,000 copies in the UK). \u201cSarging\u201d \u2013 approaching a stranger for a rapport \u2013 \u201ccan lower one\u2019s opinion of the opposite sex\u201d, Strauss admits, but he does also tell us how to do it: \u201clower her self-esteem\u201d with negging, sidle your way past her \u201cbitch shield\u201d (natural reaction to rudeness), then \u201cisolate\u201d her \u2013 because all is fair in love and war unless someone has a way to escape you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/24/elliot-rodgers-california-shooting-mental-health-misogyny\">Elliot Rodger's California shooting spree: further proof that misogyny kills | Jessica Valenti</a> </p> </aside>  <p> While the responsibility for violence committed by men against women rests solely with the perpetrator, not a book, Adamson made a link between the behaviours encouraged in The Game and what such entitlement looks like in reality. In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/30/elliot-rodger-puahate-forever-alone-reddit-forums\">Elliot Rodger killed six people</a> and himself because he wanted to \u201cpunish\u201d women for not being attracted to him. In 2015, Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and himself, angry because he did not have a girlfriend. In 2018, Scott Beierle killed two women and injured four women and a man in Florida, having previously posted YouTube videos of his rants about not having a girlfriend. Just last month in Utah, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/christopher-cleary-arrested-virgin-girlfriend-facebook-post-incel-denver-utah-a8742156.html\">Christopher Cleary was arrested</a> after posting his plan for \u201ckilling as many girls as I see\u201d on Facebook. In the post, he complained of being a virgin.</p> <p>After helping one awkward guy to get a girl\u2019s email address in a bar, Strauss claimed in The Game that his work as a pickup artist was \u201cmaking the world a safer place\u201d, because violence was \u201cthe result of the frustrated sexual impulses and desires of males\u201d. But so much of Strauss\u2019s advice would also appeal to these men, whose desire for women borders on disgust. Tellingly, many pickup artists, including Strauss when he was one, reverently read evolutionary biologists \u2013 always hunting for support for their flatulent pseudo-science about polyamory and the inferior state of female brains. If any of Strauss\u2019s acolytes obtained a modicum of self-awareness, they would spot that they got more pleasure from the admiration of men they were spending time with than from the women they were wooing.</p> <p>As Strauss notes in The Game, many pickup artists are depressed: \u201cI\u2019d never heard grown men cry as much as I had in the last two years,\u201d he writes, later describing some of the young men who came to live in his mansion as \u201cvegetables\u201d \u2013 barely speaking and never cleaning, always hoping that a woman with more breasts than opinions would someday whisk them away to mother them. But to this day, Strauss says he is approached by readers of The Game seeking guidance, despite his public disavowal. So, the book is not the problem but a symptom of another \u2013 the insurmountable truth that some men feel they are made inferior by women, because of their desire for them.</p>",

Before The Game was even a glint in Strauss\u2019s eye, dating books had been steadily reshaping romance into a hardened, cynical transaction, positioning both sexes in a standoff of mutual suspicion. Some books are harmless \u2013 big bestsellers, such as Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus and Why Men Love Bitches are really, at heart, focused on building confidence and communication. Some adopt strangely corporate language \u2013 books such as The Elite Way dictate \u201cdiscipline\u201d and \u201cstrategy\u201d \u2013 and others affect a coolness, such as The Code by Nate Penn and Lawrence LaRose, in which a section titled How to Meet the Relatives reads simply: \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Increasingly, some have a faux-feminist brio: a range of modern guides telling women to push for better sex, to \u201cfuck like a porn star\u201d, act like a Frenchwoman, and very often, approach gender with a retrograde conservatism. Such a simplistic approach, when heterosexuality, binary gender and monogamy are no longer the only norms, works for dating books as they are really selling simplicity: there is nothing intrinsically wrong with you, you just need these six, 12, 15 rules! But the worst of them approach gender with the subtlety of a hammer: all women want to be dominated and are prone to discarding men like litter if they don\u2019t order for them in restaurants or fail to present an engagement ring within two years. Men, meanwhile, are all utter messes and sub-bestial beings who must disguise their worst traits with false charm. So why single out The Game? What about other bestselling dating guides such as Steve Harvey\u2019s Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, which includes the advice: \u201cMen don\u2019t come up to you to just talk. We come up to you with a plan. We\u2019re looking across the room at you, and we don\u2019t care about your hopes and dreams. We don\u2019t care about what your future holds. We saw something we wanted.\u201d (Something is telling.) Or The Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider, the 1995 shocker for single women that included the chapter Most Men Find Chatty Women Annoying and was updated in 2013 to include the new woke chapter about texting, Don\u2019t Talk Too Much in the First Few Weeks? Or Lori Gottlieb\u2019s Marry Him! The Case for Settling for Mr Good Enough, which instructs women not to be picky, because \u201csome guy is going to have to focus on the good things about you, even though he may have wanted someone more easygoing or taller\u201d. Or Susan Patton\u2019s Marry Smart, which includes the questionable warning for women who just want to have sex: \u201cIt\u2019s the lonely cow that gives away free milk.\u201d Patton\u2019s book was published in 2014. Reading The Game in 2019, it is telling that Strauss himself has disowned it, having exchanged the glamour of fishing used condoms out of the jacuzzi at his LA mansion for babies and a wife, telling the Guardian in 2015 that \u201cit was never meant to be an advocacy of a lifestyle, even though it\u2019s come to symbolise one\u201d. This seems disingenuous, given that Strauss wrote a sequel, The Rules of the Game, in 2007 \u2013 in his own words, a 30-day \u201chow-to\u201d guide that also sold well (85,000 copies in the UK). \u201cSarging\u201d \u2013 approaching a stranger for a rapport \u2013 \u201ccan lower one\u2019s opinion of the opposite sex\u201d, Strauss admits, but he does also tell us how to do it: \u201clower her self-esteem\u201d with negging, sidle your way past her \u201cbitch shield\u201d (natural reaction to rudeness), then \u201cisolate\u201d her \u2013 because all is fair in love and war unless someone has a way to escape you. While the responsibility for violence committed by men against women rests solely with the perpetrator, not a book, Adamson made a link between the behaviours encouraged in The Game and what such entitlement looks like in reality. In 2014, Elliot Rodger killed six people and himself because he wanted to \u201cpunish\u201d women for not being attracted to him. In 2015, Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and himself, angry because he did not have a girlfriend. In 2018, Scott Beierle killed two women and injured four women and a man in Florida, having previously posted YouTube videos of his rants about not having a girlfriend. Just last month in Utah, Christopher Cleary was arrested after posting his plan for \u201ckilling as many girls as I see\u201d on Facebook. In the post, he complained of being a virgin. After helping one awkward guy to get a girl\u2019s email address in a bar, Strauss claimed in The Game that his work as a pickup artist was \u201cmaking the world a safer place\u201d, because violence was \u201cthe result of the frustrated sexual impulses and desires of males\u201d. But so much of Strauss\u2019s advice would also appeal to these men, whose desire for women borders on disgust. Tellingly, many pickup artists, including Strauss when he was one, reverently read evolutionary biologists \u2013 always hunting for support for their flatulent pseudo-science about polyamory and the inferior state of female brains. If any of Strauss\u2019s acolytes obtained a modicum of self-awareness, they would spot that they got more pleasure from the admiration of men they were spending time with than from the women they were wooing. As Strauss notes in The Game, many pickup artists are depressed: \u201cI\u2019d never heard grown men cry as much as I had in the last two years,\u201d he writes, later describing some of the young men who came to live in his mansion as \u201cvegetables\u201d \u2013 barely speaking and never cleaning, always hoping that a woman with more breasts than opinions would someday whisk them away to mother them. But to this day, Strauss says he is approached by readers of The Game seeking guidance, despite his public disavowal. So, the book is not the problem but a symptom of another \u2013 the insurmountable truth that some men feel they are made inferior by women, because of their desire for them.",

      "body": "<p>Elaine McDonald, who has died aged 75, was one of Britain\u2019s most distinctive ballerinas. Her role as muse to the groundbreaking choreographer Peter Darrell at Scottish Ballet helped build a bridge between classical ballet and the contemporary world of the 1960s and 70s. Although McDonald excelled in his productions of classics, it was her performances in a repertory of narrative ballets on modern themes that made theirs one of the great artistic relationships.</p> <p>It was an equal partnership. Tiny and red-haired, but with a compelling dramatic presence, McDonald put all her filigree artistry and technical mastery at Darrell\u2019s disposal. She was often compared to world-class dancers such as Galina Ulanova, Margot Fonteyn and Lynn Seymour, and her abilities lent lustre to his pioneering ideas.</p> <p>Lyrical and intensely musical, she was also blessed with a strong dramatic presence. The <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-percival-dance-critic-for-the-independent-7904283.html\" title=\"\">critic John Percival </a>pointed out that her characterisation of the betrayed peasant girl in Giselle was \u201ccarried off with such unerringly right detail and danced with such sweet grace, that you can never point to one aspect and say \u2018that\u2019 is how she does it\u201d.</p> <p>She made a similar impact in The Nutcracker, Beauty and the Beast and Swan Lake. So, too, as Lea in Cheri (1980), in which she conveyed the pathos of a woman watching her young lover leave her; Mary Queen of Scots (1976), whom she played as a woman of simplicity and charm; and the courtesan Giulietta in Tales of Hoffman (1977). In Such Sweet Thunder, from 1979, the Telegraph critic described her as managing \u201cto look both funny and sinister as Lady Macbeth interpreted by Rita Hayworth\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ff62f8e8531c25bc26a0392b61f548148bc9d9ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff62f8e8531c25bc26a0392b61f548148bc9d9ec/0_279_2880_3599/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lyrical and intensely musical, Elaine McDonald was also blessed with a strong dramatic presence.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lyrical and intensely musical, Elaine McDonald was also blessed with a strong dramatic presence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TSPL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her sylph in La Sylphide, which used all her lyricism, the lightness of her jump and her flowing line, was reckoned by the critic David Dougill to be one of the finest. He said: \u201cShe brings the character to life: gentle, graceful and radiant.\u201d She performed it not only with Scottish Ballet, but also as a guest artist opposite Rudolf Nureyev in Madrid and at the London Coliseum. In Darrell\u2019s Five R\u00fcckert Songs, which she performed from 1980 (with Janet Baker singing the songs at the premiere), she seemed to embody the emotions of Mahler\u2019s passionate score. \u201cIt is perfect for her weightless, fluent, expressive style,\u201d said the Guardian critic Cordelia Oliver, \u201cher movements merging with the music like wind, and sunlight and shadow on water.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, Elaine was the daughter of Wilfred McDonald, a police officer, and Ellen (nee Hogan), a civil servant. The family moved to Scarborough after the war, where they ran a small hotel. From the age of four, Elaine went to the local dance school, learning tap, modern, Greek and folk dancing as well as ballet.</p> <p>When she was 11, auditioning in a red swimsuit, she won a ballet scholarship run by the Royal Academy of Dancing (now the Royal Academy of Dance) and Girl magazine, which entitled her to two free classes a week at Louise Browne\u2019s dance school in Leeds, then York (it moved in her third year), while simultaneously attending the Convent of the Ladies of Mary grammar school in Scarborough. Four years later she auditioned for the Royal Ballet School and joined the upper school at the age of 16. \u201cIt was like a dream working in the same building as all the famous ballerinas and being taught by the same teachers,\u201d she wrote years later.</p> <p>She made her professional stage debut in a pantomime called The Sleeping Princess, then joined the corps de ballet of Walter Gore\u2019s London Ballet on two British tours. When that company folded, she joined the 14-strong Western Theatre Ballet, based in Bristol and then under Darrell\u2019s directorship. \u201cI did not know much about the company, but I had heard and read that it was young, vital and very forward-looking,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>It was indeed. The company was breaking vital new ground, with a repertory that included Mods and Rockers, danced to the music of the Beatles. \u201cIt was considered one of the most modern companies in Britain,\u201d she said. \u201cNot because the basic steps were different \u2013 we still use the steps I have known since I was a child. But because the stories which some of our ballets tell are stories of everyday life.\u201d</p> <p>She fell in love with Darrell\u2019s work instantly, creating roles in many new productions, including one as a diabolically possessed mother in Sun Into Darkness (1966). \u201cThe most important feature for me is that the company never stands still,\u201d she said. When it moved to Glasgow in 1969, becoming Scottish Ballet five years later, McDonald unhesitatingly went with it. She was only 26 but her loyalty to Darrell\u2019s vision was absolute. \u201cI thought, this is what it\u2019s all about, really; it\u2019s complete. There wasn\u2019t just a worry about straight legs and pointed feet \u2026 the steps and the body and everything were put to use to say what you were feeling.\u201d</p> <p>As well as touring Scottish cities and towns, the company also performed at church halls and community centres on Scottish Arts Council tours to bring ballet to all, and to schools, where she loved talking to the students, dressed in her tutu. </p> <p>Despite her commitment to Scottish Ballet, and working with Darrell for most of her career, McDonald also established an international reputation, touring with a group of dancers assembled by Fonteyn. She was a devout Catholic, and one of the highlights of her life was performing The Dying Swan for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in the mid-80s.</p> <p>When Darrell died suddenly in 1987, at the age of 58, McDonald took on the role of artistic controller of Scottish Ballet. It was not a happy time; she left less than two years later. In succeeding years, she worked as an associate director of Northern Ballet in Leeds and served on the Scottish Arts Council. She built a career staging ballets across Europe and teaching in London, where she remained living in the flat in Earl\u2019s Court that had been her home when she was a student at the Royal Ballet School.</p> <p>A stroke in 1999 left her severely disabled, but her crusading spirit lived on. In 2011, with the backing of Age UK, she took Kensington and Chelsea council to the European court of human rights, claiming their decision to deprive her of night-time assistance breached her right to dignity. She did not win, but the case established a precedent in the role dignity has to play in human rights.</p> <p>In 1983 she was made OBE, and she was made an honorary DLitt by the University of Strathclyde in 1990.</p> <p>She is survived by her husband, the lighting designer Donald McLeish, and her siblings, Margaret and Phillip.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Elaine Maria McDonald, ballerina, born 2 May 1943; died 8 December 2018</p>",

But because the stories which some of our ballets tell are stories of everyday life.\u201d She fell in love with Darrell\u2019s work instantly, creating roles in many new productions, including one as a diabolically possessed mother in Sun Into Darkness (1966). \u201cThe most important feature for me is that the company never stands still,\u201d she said. When it moved to Glasgow in 1969, becoming Scottish Ballet five years later, McDonald unhesitatingly went with it. She was only 26 but her loyalty to Darrell\u2019s vision was absolute. \u201cI thought, this is what it\u2019s all about, really; it\u2019s complete. There wasn\u2019t just a worry about straight legs and pointed feet \u2026 the steps and the body and everything were put to use to say what you were feeling.\u201d As well as touring Scottish cities and towns, the company also performed at church halls and community centres on Scottish Arts Council tours to bring ballet to all, and to schools, where she loved talking to the students, dressed in her tutu. Despite her commitment to Scottish Ballet, and working with Darrell for most of her career, McDonald also established an international reputation, touring with a group of dancers assembled by Fonteyn. She was a devout Catholic, and one of the highlights of her life was performing The Dying Swan for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in the mid-80s. When Darrell died suddenly in 1987, at the age of 58, McDonald took on the role of artistic controller of Scottish Ballet. It was not a happy time; she left less than two years later. In succeeding years, she worked as an associate director of Northern Ballet in Leeds and served on the Scottish Arts Council. She built a career staging ballets across Europe and teaching in London, where she remained living in the flat in Earl\u2019s Court that had been her home when she was a student at the Royal Ballet School. A stroke in 1999 left her severely disabled, but her crusading spirit lived on. In 2011, with the backing of Age UK, she took Kensington and Chelsea council to the European court of human rights, claiming their decision to deprive her of night-time assistance breached her right to dignity. She did not win, but the case established a precedent in the role dignity has to play in human rights. In 1983 she was made OBE, and she was made an honorary DLitt by the University of Strathclyde in 1990. She is survived by her husband, the lighting designer Donald McLeish, and her siblings, Margaret and Phillip. \u2022 Elaine Maria McDonald, ballerina, born 2 May 1943; died 8 December 2018",

      "bodyText": "How badly do you have to mess up, these days, before you\u2019re not allowed in Theresa May\u2019s cabinet? Just how far does tolerance stretch? You might imagine Chris Grayling to be the ultimate prototype in this real-world experiment, with his granting then cancelling of a \u00a313.8m ferry contract to a ferry company with no ferries, but let us also observe the progress of Liam Fox. Fox is one of the most vocal and optimistic Brexiteers in politics. In 2016, he declared that a trade deal with the EU would be \u201cone of the easiest in human history\u201d. In 2017, he promised to \u201creplicate the 40 EU free trade agreements that exist before we leave the European Union so we\u2019ve got no disruption of trade\u201d, and they would be ready \u201cone second after midnight in March 2019\u201d. Yesterday, six short weeks before that midnight, it was revealed that Fox, as secretary of state for international trade, has managed to \u201croll over\u201d just six of the 40 trade deals. This is not surprising. Britain is a considerably smaller trading power than the EU, and is moreover up against a deadline \u2013 most countries are likely to want to adjust trading terms in their favour. What is surprising is that Fox promised he could pull off this feat in the first place, and then, having failed, responded to questioning with further flights of optimism. Having been hauled in to the House of Commons to defend his lack of progress, he responded by insisting it was always going to go \u201cdown to the wire\u201d (23 of the aimed-for deals have now been marked as \u201csignificantly off-track\u201d or \u201cnot possible to be completed by March 2019\u201d), and that it was \u201cnot a numbers game\u201d \u2013 the focus should be on the \u201cproportion of trade we can maintain\u201d (one of the partners with which he has made a deal is the Faroe Islands. Those he has not include Mexico and Japan). Fox, you\u2019ll remember, was in 2011 forced to resign in disgrace from cabinet for allowing his close friend, sans security clearance, to take up an unofficial role at the Ministry of Defence. Adam Werritty was allowed access to Fox\u2019s diary and into private MoD meetings. He also printed business cards describing himself as an adviser to Fox, which the subsequent official report said \u201crisked creating the impression that Mr Werritty spoke on behalf of the UK government\u201d. The report concluded Fox\u2019s actions had put himself and others in the department at risk. Yet how soon he has been rehabilitated \u2013 he was back in the cabinet just five years later. Little wonder if he feels invincible. Fox is not only being allowed multiple chances to fail, but multiple chances to clearly signpost exactly how he will next fail, before being given the powers to go ahead and do it. All he needs is the confidence to brazen it out \u2013 to simply refuse to admit a failure is a failure. This seems to work even as politicians such as Fox and Grayling are criticised at ever greater volume by the media. Bad headlines used to end careers \u2013 now they are something to brush off.

Last weekend Buckingham Palace said he had voluntarily surrendered his driving licence after the incident in which his Land Rover Freelander overturned. His vehicle was involved in a collision with a Kia being driven by Ellie Townsend, 28, as he drove out of a driveway on 17 January. Two women needed hospital treatment after he was apparently dazzled by the low sun as he pulled out of a driveway on the Sandringham estate. A nine-month-old baby boy in the Kia was unhurt.

We have decided that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute. \u201cAll those involved in the collision have been informed and provided with a full explanation in writing.\u201d The CPS said the decision had been made after considering all the evidence submitted by the police and in accordance with the two-stage test in the code for crown prosecutors. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \u201cThe Duke of Edinburgh respects the decision taken by the Crown Prosecution Service.\u201d Asked whether he could drive on private land in future, the spokesperson added: \u201cIf the Duke of Edinburgh did drive on private land that would be in accordance with all relevant regulations.\u201d Among lawyers, majority opinion suggested the CPS decision was consistent with the way elderly motorists who have given up their licences are dealt with normally.

I don\u2019t think his age should have go him off the hook. I think his royal status would have been a factor.\u201d Smith said a previous incident involving a Land Rover allegedly driven by Prince Andrew into the gates of Windsor Great Park had not been investigated by police. \u201cThere seems to be a soft approach to royals when they get into a scrape,\u201d he said. But the royal biographer Hugo Vickers said: \u201cIf the police think he\u2019s a dangerous driver, what is the outcome they want? They want to get him off the road. He\u2019s off the road \u2013 fine, finished. That would happen to anyone \u2026 What else are they going to do? Are you going to fine him? Are you going to put him in prison? It\u2019s ridiculous. The outcome is satisfactory.\u201d",

On Thursday, 485 out of 596 MPs <a href=\"https://www.dostor.org/2517642\">voted to advance</a> the bill, which also contains a package of more palatable changes such as the creation of a vice-presidential post, a quota of 25% female representation, and a new upper house in parliament.</p> <p>It is expected to pass a second committee reading and parliamentary debate by early March, triggering a referendum in which the public will be asked to approve the changes.</p> <p>A coalition of 11 political parties and prominent political figures joined forces to fight the plans, but will struggle to mount a campaign ahead of a referendum in an environment where dissent has been systematically crushed.</p> <p>\u201cWe were expecting that this would happen. The man will never leave power, we all know this,\u201d said Anwar Sadat, the nephew of Egypt\u2019s former president and member of the new coalition, in reference to Sisi.</p> <p>A growing chorus of pro-state voices has emerged claiming that the president requires more time to enact his flagship economic reforms.</p> <p>Last year, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/01/petition-signals-egyptian-presidents-abdel-fatah-al-sisi-intention-to-seek-third-term\">reported</a> the existence of a petition calling for Sisi to remain in office beyond his second term, which circulated within institutions and among pro-state figures. Pro-government lawyers also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-presidency/egyptian-court-to-hear-petition-to-cancel-presidential-term-limits-idUSKBN1O61EN\">mounted a legal challenge</a> demanding that parliament \u2013 often seen as little more than a vehicle for rubber stamping Sisi\u2019s demands \u2013 remove the article in the constitution that sets term limits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9df3ee66de61cf48648dd722b2f60dd8fdcf2e85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9df3ee66de61cf48648dd722b2f60dd8fdcf2e85/0_99_3906_2344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abdel Fatah al-Sisi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has been in power since a military coup in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Timothy Kaldas, from the Washington-based thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said the opposition\u2019s hands were tied. \u201cThe reality is it is quite limited what the opposition can do, given the level of repression that this government is capable of,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is a fairly weak opposition that has been battered by large-scale imprisonment, people forced into exile, and organisations being shuttered.\u201d </p> <p>One option for Sisi\u2019s opponents is the country\u2019s supreme constitutional court. \u201cSome of the constitutional lawyers we have within the union will explore the possibility that what they [the government] are doing violates the constitution, so we will attempt to bring a court case,\u201d said Sadat.</p> <p>Khaled Dawoud, a longtime opposition figure, said of a possible pre-referendum campaign against the constitutional changes: \u201cConsidering we are deprived of access to local media, we are going to try our best to use social media to increase the awareness among Egyptians of the dangerous consequences of the single man rule we\u2019ve suffered for the past 60 years. We will [also] identify and contact the few honest MPs, the ones with integrity.\u201d</p> <p>The risks of speaking out against the proposed changes are high in a country where even seemingly <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/d7ca821cf3a54c6fb065b356739c56c0\">benign protests</a> can result in arrest. Despite this, some Egyptians have begun posting <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/almawkef.almasry/videos/vb.743199805779919/1060941414116811/?type=2&amp;theater\">videos</a> to social media under the hashtag \u201cno change to the constitution\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if he [Sisi] decides to round up all of us,\u201d said Dawoud. \u201cThat\u2019s a price we\u2019re ready to pay. But I will not accept, under any condition, this disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Sisi swept to power after a military coup in 2013, and won re-election for his second term last April with 97.8% of the vote, after <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2018/mar/20/egypts-ghad-party-leader-makes-discreet-bid-for-presidency\">five candidates</a> looking to oppose his rule were prevented from running. Despite the president\u2019s routine denials, the country currently holds an <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/01/07/egypt-little-truth-al-sisis-60-minutes-responses\">estimated</a> 60,000 political prisoners and the already staunchly pro-government media is <a href=\"https://afteegypt.org/en/media_freedom-2/2018/03/21/14887-afteegypt.html\">increasingly owned</a> by the country\u2019s security services.</p>",

The bill also grants new political powers to the military and extra presidential control over the judiciary, dealing another blow to opponents of Sisi\u2019s increasingly autocratic regime. In a rare criticism during a debate over the bill, one MP branded the reforms \u201cmedieval\u201d and said they were tailored to facilitate absolute rule by Sisi, the former head of Egypt\u2019s armed forces who took power in a coup in 2013. The bill has moved swiftly through the Egyptian legislature since it was tabled on 3 February, aided by a decision to move the debate forward by several days. On Thursday, 485 out of 596 MPs voted to advance the bill, which also contains a package of more palatable changes such as the creation of a vice-presidential post, a quota of 25% female representation, and a new upper house in parliament. It is expected to pass a second committee reading and parliamentary debate by early March, triggering a referendum in which the public will be asked to approve the changes. A coalition of 11 political parties and prominent political figures joined forces to fight the plans, but will struggle to mount a campaign ahead of a referendum in an environment where dissent has been systematically crushed. \u201cWe were expecting that this would happen. The man will never leave power, we all know this,\u201d said Anwar Sadat, the nephew of Egypt\u2019s former president and member of the new coalition, in reference to Sisi. A growing chorus of pro-state voices has emerged claiming that the president requires more time to enact his flagship economic reforms. Last year, the Guardian reported the existence of a petition calling for Sisi to remain in office beyond his second term, which circulated within institutions and among pro-state figures. Pro-government lawyers also mounted a legal challenge demanding that parliament \u2013 often seen as little more than a vehicle for rubber stamping Sisi\u2019s demands \u2013 remove the article in the constitution that sets term limits. Timothy Kaldas, from the Washington-based thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said the opposition\u2019s hands were tied. \u201cThe reality is it is quite limited what the opposition can do, given the level of repression that this government is capable of,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is a fairly weak opposition that has been battered by large-scale imprisonment, people forced into exile, and organisations being shuttered.\u201d One option for Sisi\u2019s opponents is the country\u2019s supreme constitutional court. \u201cSome of the constitutional lawyers we have within the union will explore the possibility that what they [the government] are doing violates the constitution, so we will attempt to bring a court case,\u201d said Sadat. Khaled Dawoud, a longtime opposition figure, said of a possible pre-referendum campaign against the constitutional changes: \u201cConsidering we are deprived of access to local media, we are going to try our best to use social media to increase the awareness among Egyptians of the dangerous consequences of the single man rule we\u2019ve suffered for the past 60 years. We will [also] identify and contact the few honest MPs, the ones with integrity.\u201d The risks of speaking out against the proposed changes are high in a country where even seemingly benign protests can result in arrest. Despite this, some Egyptians have begun posting videos to social media under the hashtag \u201cno change to the constitution\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if he [Sisi] decides to round up all of us,\u201d said Dawoud. \u201cThat\u2019s a price we\u2019re ready to pay. But I will not accept, under any condition, this disaster.\u201d Sisi swept to power after a military coup in 2013, and won re-election for his second term last April with 97.8% of the vote, after five candidates looking to oppose his rule were prevented from running. Despite the president\u2019s routine denials, the country currently holds an estimated 60,000 political prisoners and the already staunchly pro-government media is increasingly owned by the country\u2019s security services.",

After an episode of Call the Midwife, in which a character died as a result of complications from an illegal abortion, women who visited the BBC Action Line website complained there was no advice relating to abortion. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) raised concerns about the omission, and the BBC said it had chosen not to include abortion because it was \u201ccontentious\u201d and it did not want to be seen as \u201csupporting one side\u201d. \u201cIt isn\u2019t possible for the BBC Action Line to offer support for abortion and similarly contentious issues without referring people either to campaigning organisations which take a particular stance on an issue or to organisations which provide it,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cDoing so could imply the BBC supported one side or another in any contentious issue which it does not do in its coverage.\u201d Bpas, which provides reproductive healthcare to women and advocates reproductive choice, has now signed a letter to the BBC which was published on Thursday, expressing \u201cdisappointment\u201d. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, Family Planning Association (FPA), Marie Stopes UK, the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are among the co-signatories.

Abortion, under certain circumstances, has been legal in England, Wales and Scotland since 1967, and, according to government figures, 98% of terminations are funded by the NHS.

The evidence \u201csupports a compelling link\u201d between exposures to glyphosate-based herbicides and increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the authors concluded, though they said the specific numerical risk estimates should be interpreted with caution. The findings by five US scientists contradict the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) assurances of safety over the weed killer and come as regulators in several countries consider limiting the use of glyphosate-based products in farming. Monsanto and its German owner Bayer AG face more than 9,000 lawsuits in the US brought by people suffering from NHL who blame Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate-based herbicides for their diseases. The first plaintiff to go to trial won a unanimous jury verdict against Monsanto in August, a verdict the company is appealing.

His First Violin Concerto regularly ranks high on lists of the most performed classical pieces, while little else from his 60-year career has achieved anything like the same popularity. Born in 1838, Bruch lived through some of the greatest stylistic upheavals in the history of European music, but remained impervious to all of them; right up to his death in 1920, he remained faithful to the Romanticism he\u2019d inherited from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/05/felix-mendelssohn-richard-wagner-classical-music\">Mendelssohn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/robert-schumann\">Schumann</a>.</p> <p>Among the raft of his forgotten works are three operas, of which Die Loreley was the second. Premiered in Mannheim in 1863, it had a few years of success before lapsing into obscurity, and though Bruch revised the score in 1887 for performances conducted by the young Gustav Mahler, it\u2019s hardly been heard since. This Bavarian Radio recording, taken from a performance in Munich in 2014, is the first to make it complete on to disc.</p> <p>Loosely based upon Clemens Brentano\u2019s version of the <a href=\"https://www.deutschland.de/en/the-siren-song-of-the-lorelei\">Loreley legend</a>, Emanuel Geibel\u2019s libretto was originally written for Mendelssohn. It\u2019s the story of Lenore, the daughter of a Rhine ferryman, who sells her soul to the spirits that inhabit the river and its famous rock, so that she can take revenge on the aristocratic lover who has spurned her by enchanting him with her singing. Mendelssohn dropped the idea of the opera after writing only a few fragments, and Bruch took over the text. His Loreley is a number opera of set-piece arias and ensembles, with a prominent role for the chorus. The orchestral writing shows an admiration for Schumann especially, and while Weber\u2019s Der Freisch\u00fctz seems to have been Bruch\u2019s most significant operatic model, particularly in the ambitious set piece of the second act, the Grand Scene of the Rhine Spirits, there are also several passages suggesting he wasn\u2019t totally impervious to the attractions of early Wagner \u2013 Tannh\u00e4user and Lohengrin \u2013 either.</p> <p>Certainly, Die Loreley has the heft of mid-century German opera, with occasional hints of the memorable melodic invention that a few years later would characterise Bruch\u2019s most enduring work, even if there are passages when that invention flags, too. The conducting of <a href=\"https://www.sulivansweetland.co.uk/stefan-blunier-1/\">Stefan Blunier</a> certainly emphasises the strengths, and both soprano <a href=\"https://www.opera-online.com/en/items/performers/michaela-kaune\">Michaela Kaune</a> as Lenore and tenor <a href=\"https://www.thomasmohr.eu/\">Thomas Mohr</a> as her lover Otto (quaintly described in the English version of the synopsis as her \u201csecret playmate\u201d) seem well up to the considerable vocal demands of their roles, even though she sounds a little frail in the opening scene. While this may not be a major act of rehabilitation for a lost masterpiece, then, it does throw light on a forgotten byway in 19th-century German opera.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2veDmpCytJAWH4ZfcbTbbv\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2veDmpCytJAWH4ZfcbTbbv\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Max Bruch\u2019s place in the musical pantheon is guaranteed by a single work. His First Violin Concerto regularly ranks high on lists of the most performed classical pieces, while little else from his 60-year career has achieved anything like the same popularity. Born in 1838, Bruch lived through some of the greatest stylistic upheavals in the history of European music, but remained impervious to all of them; right up to his death in 1920, he remained faithful to the Romanticism he\u2019d inherited from Mendelssohn and Schumann. Among the raft of his forgotten works are three operas, of which Die Loreley was the second. Premiered in Mannheim in 1863, it had a few years of success before lapsing into obscurity, and though Bruch revised the score in 1887 for performances conducted by the young Gustav Mahler, it\u2019s hardly been heard since. This Bavarian Radio recording, taken from a performance in Munich in 2014, is the first to make it complete on to disc. Loosely based upon Clemens Brentano\u2019s version of the Loreley legend, Emanuel Geibel\u2019s libretto was originally written for Mendelssohn. It\u2019s the story of Lenore, the daughter of a Rhine ferryman, who sells her soul to the spirits that inhabit the river and its famous rock, so that she can take revenge on the aristocratic lover who has spurned her by enchanting him with her singing. Mendelssohn dropped the idea of the opera after writing only a few fragments, and Bruch took over the text. His Loreley is a number opera of set-piece arias and ensembles, with a prominent role for the chorus. The orchestral writing shows an admiration for Schumann especially, and while Weber\u2019s Der Freisch\u00fctz seems to have been Bruch\u2019s most significant operatic model, particularly in the ambitious set piece of the second act, the Grand Scene of the Rhine Spirits, there are also several passages suggesting he wasn\u2019t totally impervious to the attractions of early Wagner \u2013 Tannh\u00e4user and Lohengrin \u2013 either. Certainly, Die Loreley has the heft of mid-century German opera, with occasional hints of the memorable melodic invention that a few years later would characterise Bruch\u2019s most enduring work, even if there are passages when that invention flags, too. The conducting of Stefan Blunier certainly emphasises the strengths, and both soprano Michaela Kaune as Lenore and tenor Thomas Mohr as her lover Otto (quaintly described in the English version of the synopsis as her \u201csecret playmate\u201d) seem well up to the considerable vocal demands of their roles, even though she sounds a little frail in the opening scene. While this may not be a major act of rehabilitation for a lost masterpiece, then, it does throw light on a forgotten byway in 19th-century German opera.",

Details are scant, and it\u2019s still unclear whether the president will sign the deal, but the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/12/politics/border-security-deal-details/index.html\">rough outline</a> is there: more detention beds, more fencing, and more funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p> <p>The Democrats, in other words, are conceding to Trump\u2019s calls for increased border security. Importantly, their increased funding for DHS includes miscellaneous \u201ctechnology\u201d spending, which, given past statements, is likely to include drones, artificial intelligence, and unspecified \u201ccutting-edge technology\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/feb/14/trump-news-live-government-shutdown-deal-latest-updates-democrats-republicans-us-politics-today\">Congress poised to strike bipartisan deal to avoid another shutdown \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Late last month, Democratic party leadership released a <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-democratic-conferees-unveil-proposal-for-smart-effective-border-security\">proposal</a> for \u201csmart, efficient border security\u201d. It\u2019s all but certain that the compromise deal will include elements from this proposal, given the buy-in from almost all Democrats, wary of another government shutdown but untroubled by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/05/advocacy-groups-urge-democrats-oppose-invasive-surveillance-tech-border-security-negotiations/\">demands from groups like ours</a> to back down from the creation of a \u201csmart wall\u201d using untested, biased technology.</p> <p>Our calls have been ignored. The Democrats are prepared, as the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown/democrats-push-technology-as-alternative-to-trump-wall-in-shutdown-impasse-idUSKCN1PH14I\">has made clear</a>, to give Trump billions \u2013 so long as it is spent on a tech wall, not a physical one.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve said that we ought to have a smart wall. I defined that as a wall using drones to make it too high to get over, using x-ray equipment to make it too wide to get around, and using scanners to go deep enough not to be able to tunnel under it,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/jim-clyburn-border-wall-house-democrats/2019/02/06/id/901537/\">said</a> Clyburn. \u201cTo me, that would be a smart thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>We should be extremely cautious about increasing funding for a \u201csmart wall\u201d. Such a wall will amass profits for military companies like Raytheon, tech firms like Amazon, and private prison makers like Geo Group, but do nothing to solve the humanitarian crisis at our southern border.</p> <p>It will also likely lead to civil rights violations writ large \u2013 not just for migrants, but for the two-thirds of the American population who live within 100 miles of the border around the US as a whole. Eventually, surveillance technology perfected at the border could be repurposed against us all, as is often the case when new tech is rolled out first against the most vulnerable populations.</p> <p>Noteworthy among the proposed investments are more funding for \u201cair and marine operations\u201d along the border, the \u201cexpansion of risk-based targeting of passengers\u201d, and unspecified \u201ccutting-edge technology\u201d that would \u201cimprove situational awareness\u201d. In other words: drones, artificial intelligence, and untested surveillance technology.</p> <p>Customs and Border Protection would probably use all within the zone 100 miles of a land or coastal border that is already<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone\"> subject to fewer constitutional rights</a> than the rest of the country, despite a full two-thirds of the American people living in it. What happens when border drones begin operating in this zone, taking photos of 200 million people in the name of national security and storing their faces in large, privatized databases?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This does nothing to address the root causes of migration. It punishes the most vulnerable among us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The privacy implications are vast: the mass collection of person data \u2013 of both citizens and non-citizens alike \u2013 and the widespread use of artificial intelligence technologies like facial recognition to analyze them for border agents.

      "bodyText": "A government shutdown deal seems to have been reached. Details are scant, and it\u2019s still unclear whether the president will sign the deal, but the rough outline is there: more detention beds, more fencing, and more funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Democrats, in other words, are conceding to Trump\u2019s calls for increased border security. Importantly, their increased funding for DHS includes miscellaneous \u201ctechnology\u201d spending, which, given past statements, is likely to include drones, artificial intelligence, and unspecified \u201ccutting-edge technology\u201d. Late last month, Democratic party leadership released a proposal for \u201csmart, efficient border security\u201d. It\u2019s all but certain that the compromise deal will include elements from this proposal, given the buy-in from almost all Democrats, wary of another government shutdown but untroubled by demands from groups like ours to back down from the creation of a \u201csmart wall\u201d using untested, biased technology. Our calls have been ignored. The Democrats are prepared, as the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, has made clear, to give Trump billions \u2013 so long as it is spent on a tech wall, not a physical one. \u201cI\u2019ve said that we ought to have a smart wall. I defined that as a wall using drones to make it too high to get over, using x-ray equipment to make it too wide to get around, and using scanners to go deep enough not to be able to tunnel under it,\u201d said Clyburn. \u201cTo me, that would be a smart thing to do.\u201d We should be extremely cautious about increasing funding for a \u201csmart wall\u201d. Such a wall will amass profits for military companies like Raytheon, tech firms like Amazon, and private prison makers like Geo Group, but do nothing to solve the humanitarian crisis at our southern border. It will also likely lead to civil rights violations writ large \u2013 not just for migrants, but for the two-thirds of the American population who live within 100 miles of the border around the US as a whole. Eventually, surveillance technology perfected at the border could be repurposed against us all, as is often the case when new tech is rolled out first against the most vulnerable populations. Noteworthy among the proposed investments are more funding for \u201cair and marine operations\u201d along the border, the \u201cexpansion of risk-based targeting of passengers\u201d, and unspecified \u201ccutting-edge technology\u201d that would \u201cimprove situational awareness\u201d. In other words: drones, artificial intelligence, and untested surveillance technology. Customs and Border Protection would probably use all within the zone 100 miles of a land or coastal border that is already subject to fewer constitutional rights than the rest of the country, despite a full two-thirds of the American people living in it. What happens when border drones begin operating in this zone, taking photos of 200 million people in the name of national security and storing their faces in large, privatized databases? The privacy implications are vast: the mass collection of person data \u2013 of both citizens and non-citizens alike \u2013 and the widespread use of artificial intelligence technologies like facial recognition to analyze them for border agents. Such technologies have known issues with bias, particularly against people of color, and these issues will be amplified as information gleaned from border patrol is shared with law enforcement agencies across the country, as is already current practice. Taken in tandem with the administration\u2019s antagonism to asylum, such policies serve only to disincentivize immigration and asylum-seeking generally, by increasing the dangers of border crossings. Let\u2019s be clear: tightening the noose around the border means more migrants will die as they seek out crossings that are more dangerous but out of sight of border patrol. This does nothing to address the root causes of migration. It punishes the most vulnerable among us \u2013 migrants who have taken the drastic step of leaving their home for a better shot elsewhere \u2013 by enmeshing them in an efficient government surveillance net that could follow them in law enforcement agencies across the country and around the world. The beneficiaries of this proposal, however, are very clear: companies like Raytheon, which builds drones for the military; Amazon, which is currently shopping facial recognition technology to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and which also provides cloud storage to dozens of government agencies; and Palantir, the provider of software to Ice that allows its agents to track and build profiles of undocumented migrants throughout the country.

      "bodyText": "Renewable energy sources will be the world\u2019s main source of power within two decades and are establishing a foothold in the global energy system faster than any fuel in history, according to BP. The UK-based oil company said wind, solar and other renewables will account for about 30% of the world\u2019s electricity supplies by 2040, up from 25% in BP\u2019s 2040 estimates last year, and about 10% today. In regions such as Europe, the figure will be as high as 50% by 2040. The speed of growth was without parallel, the company said in its annual energy outlook. While oil took almost 45 years to go from 1% of global energy to 10%, and gas took more than 50 years, renewables are expected to do so within 25 years in the report\u2019s central scenario. In the event of a faster switch to a low carbon economy, that period comes down to just 15 years, which BP said would be \u201cliterally off the charts\u201d relative to historical shifts. But the company, as in previous editions of its report, does not see oil going away any time soon. The outlook\u2019s core scenario envisages that oil demand does not peak until the 2030s, though under its greener scenario that milestone could be reached between now and the early 2020s. Regardless, BP sees a \u201cmajor role\u201d for hydrocarbons until 2040, which it says will require substantial investment. It expects global demand for oil and gas to be 80-130 million barrels per day by then, up from around 100mb/d today. The company has ambitious plans to grow its oil and gas production 16% by 2025, according to figures compiled by the Norway-based consultants Rystad Energy. The report is gloomy on prospects for avoiding dangerous levels of global warming. The central scenario expects carbon emissions to grow 10% by 2040, as world energy demand grows by a third and fossil fuels continue to play a key role. Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, said meeting the challenge of providing more energy while cutting emissions would \u201cundoubtedly require many forms of energy to play a role\u201d. The company said it expected growth in renewables to be driven by government policies, technological change and the falling costs of wind and solar power. Renewables are expected to grow by 7.1% each year over the next two decades, eventually displacing coal as the world\u2019s top source of power by 2040. Spencer Dale, chief economist at BP, said in terms of cutting carbon emissions, most of the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d was outside the transport sector, which makes up around a fifth of energy demand. The company expects more efficient vehicles to have more of an impact on emissions than electric cars. The group sees energy demand growth in China slowing as the country\u2019s economy moves away from polluting industries to a more services-based one.

Begum has said all she wants to do is come home to the UK so her child can receive proper medical care.</p> \n<p>Sultana reportedly married an American Isis fighter with Somali heritage, who was killed a short time later in a Russian airstrike. She told her family she was growing disillusioned with life in Raqqa, but was scared to try to leave.</p> \n<p>In August 2016, ITV reported that Sultana\u2019s family believed she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/london-schoolgirl-kadiza-sultana-who-joined-isis-believed-killed-in-syria-airstrike\">had been killed</a>, aged 17, in an airstrike on Raqqa that May.

She is nine months pregnant and desperate to come home to Britain. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child,\u201d she said. The details of what happened to the schoolgirls \u2013 who were described as gifted students \u2013 are patchy. All four ended up in Raqqa, where they were married off to jihadists who had come to Syria from around the world. Begum married Yago Riedijk, 27, a Dutch convert to Islam, 10 days after arriving in the city in 2015. She said he had later been accused of spying and was tortured in prison before being released. She then had her first child, a daughter called Sarayah. In January 2017, the family left Raqqa to live on the outskirts of the town of Mayadin. She had a son called Jerah before they moved again as Isis was pushed back by the Syrian Democratic Forces. She told the Times her son died three months ago, aged eight months, of an unknown illness and malnutrition. She tried to take him to an Isis hospital but there were no drugs available and not enough medical staff. Her daughter then grew sick and died aged one year and nine months. Heavily pregnant, she decided to flee to a refugee camp and her husband surrendered to Syrian forces. Begum has said all she wants to do is come home to the UK so her child can receive proper medical care. Sultana reportedly married an American Isis fighter with Somali heritage, who was killed a short time later in a Russian airstrike. She told her family she was growing disillusioned with life in Raqqa, but was scared to try to leave. In August 2016, ITV reported that Sultana\u2019s family believed she had been killed, aged 17, in an airstrike on Raqqa that May. Her family\u2019s lawyer said: \u201cThe family are devastated. A number of sources have said that she has been killed and she has not been in contact with the family for several weeks. Over a year ago, she had been talking about leaving. There was a plan to get her out.\u201d Speaking to the Times about her friend\u2019s death, Shamima Begum said: \u201cAt first I was in denial. I thought if ever we did get killed, we\u2019d get killed together.\u201d Amira Abase married an 18-year-old Australian jihadist, Abdullah Elmir, in July 2016. Elmir, who was described in Australian media as the \u201cGinger Jihadi\u201d, was later reported by intelligence agencies to have been killed in coalition airstrikes. Despite reports last year that Abase had been killed, Shamina Begum said she heard two weeks ago that she and Sharmeena Begum were still alive. They had decided to stay on in Baghuz, Isis\u2019s last stronghold, where she last saw them in June. Sharmeena Begum, the first of the girls to join Isis, travelled to Syria in December 2014 after 18 months of tumult in her private life. Her 33-year-old mother had died of lung cancer and her father, Mohammad Uddin, had remarried. She reportedly married a Bosnian, who was also killed. \u201cThey were strong,\u201d Shamina Begum said of her friends\u2019 decision to stay. \u201cI respect their decision. They urged patience and endurance in the caliphate and chose to stay behind in Baghuz. They would be ashamed of me if they survived the bombing and battle to learn that I had left. \u201cThey made their choice as single women. For their husbands were already dead. It was their own choice as women to stay.\u201d",

Strikes have already forced the airline to cancel several hundred flights this year in its quieter winter schedules. According to A4E (Airline For Europe), which represents the 15 biggest European airlines, there was a 53% rise in delays due to air traffic control staffing issues in 2018, forcing its members to cancel more than 5,000 flights last summer. Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said that represented record disruption, but predicted even worse for 2019. He said air traffic control staff shortages were now the primary reason for flight delays and would aggravate the effect of strikes: \u201cYou don\u2019t feel it so much now, but once you get into the summer I promise you the French air traffic controllers will go on strike in May \u2026 that will then be followed by the Italians. \u201cYou could have the Belgians taking industrial action more, and you also have the backdrop that they don\u2019t have enough trained staff.\u201d Jacobs said passengers would \u201cbe feeling that at weekends in the summer\u201d and there was \u201ca cost for customers not getting away for their holidays on time, but also for us in EU261s\u201d. EU261 is the EU directive that obliges airlines to pay compensation for flight delays of more than three hours. Ryanair and other low-cost carriers have often disputed the levels of compensation, which can far exceed the fares paid, but Jacobs said it now pledged to meet claims within 10 days. Ryanair cancelled almost 100 flights to and from Italy last month and 128 flights to Belgium on Wednesday because of air traffic control strikes. He said Violeta Bulc, the EU commissioner for transport, was working with countries whose operators were \u201cthe worst offenders\u201d.

Does it matter that Cameron is stepping into the background, taking a \u201chands-on\u201d producer\u2019s role, rather than stepping behind the cameras himself? To answer that question you only have to imagine the level of perfectionism required for a film-maker of Cameron\u2019s clout and industry standing to take 10 years to follow up the highest-grossing film ever.

It\u2019s a very female-centric film, [and] I\u2019m glad Tim embraced those themes.\u201d</p> <p>Such talk of baton-passing inevitably recalls the approach taken by the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars\">Star Wars</a> trilogy, which has seen Mark Hamill and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harrisonford\">Harrison Ford</a> stepping aside for a new generation.

Likewise, no right-minded sci-fi fan would ever complain that the excellent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/denis-villeneuve\">Denis Villeneuve</a> took on Blade Runner 2049, rather than saga originator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott\">Ridley Scott</a>.

There is no time machine to jump into for those who consider Terminator the superior venture, no way of creating an alternative timeline in which Cameron really did take charge of the cameras on Dark Fate and left the Pandorans to their USB tail-assisted frolickings \u2013 only the sneaking suspicion that the movie might have turned out rather better if he had.</p>",

It\u2019s a very female-centric film, [and] I\u2019m glad Tim embraced those themes.\u201d Such talk of baton-passing inevitably recalls the approach taken by the latest Star Wars trilogy, which has seen Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford stepping aside for a new generation. While a little obvious, this may be preferable to yet another timeline reboot in which John Connor has joined the robots and Arnie is back as 19 versions of himself, all equally tedious. And Davis certainly has the spiky verve and statuesque cool required to become the new queen of sci-fi, as demonstrated by her small role in Blade Runner 2049 and by a rather larger one in the searing San Junipero episode of Black Mirror. The history of famed directors palming off pet projects on to lesser-known names offers hope here. George Lucas did such an excellent job of hiring Star Wars directors the first time round \u2013 Irvin Kershner on The Empire Strikes Back, Richard Marquand on Return of the Jedi \u2013 that a lot of fans wondered why he insisted on directing all of the dreaded prequel trilogy. Likewise, no right-minded sci-fi fan would ever complain that the excellent Denis Villeneuve took on Blade Runner 2049, rather than saga originator Ridley Scott. And it is not as if Miller is a total noob \u2013 this is, after, the guy who directed the then highest grossing R-rated movie of all time. Still, Avatar 2 (and 3 and 4 and 5) had better be worth it. There is no time machine to jump into for those who consider Terminator the superior venture, no way of creating an alternative timeline in which Cameron really did take charge of the cameras on Dark Fate and left the Pandorans to their USB tail-assisted frolickings \u2013 only the sneaking suspicion that the movie might have turned out rather better if he had.",

      "body": "<p>An oil company drilling off the Dorset coastline is attempting to extend its licence into the spring, challenging the conditions imposed to protect the sea\u2019s many sensitive wildlife species.</p> <p>Corallian Energy has set up a rig visible from the protected coastline and in close proximity to 58 marine and coastal protected areas. Sensitive and protected species offshore include bottlenose dolphins, seahorses, rays and breeding populations of seabirds including sandwich terns and little terns.</p> <p>Despite opposition from environmentalists and local people, the government offshore petroleum regulator (Opred), part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, gave permission for Corallian to carry out exploratory drilling last year. </p> <p>But after representations from the Environment Agency and Natural England, among others, the company was restricted to drilling in the winter and not in the spring to mitigate \u201csignificant concerns in relation to both landscape and seascape impacts and potential effects on migratory fish\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the conditions Corallian has gone back to Opred seeking permission to extend the drilling into March.</p> <p>The rig was approved after an application for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/11/tories-reject-navitus-bay-offshore-windfarm\">windfarm off the coast </a> was turned down on grounds it would harm the views from designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and England\u2019s only natural Unesco World Heritage Site, the Jurassic Coast.</p> <p>If significant oil is confirmed it will be extracted via horizontal long-reach drilling via Wytch farm, at Poole harbour, Europe\u2019s biggest onshore oil facility.</p> <p>Neil Garrick-Maidment, of the Seahorse Trust, said the waters were home to the UK\u2019s two seahorses, the short-snouted and the spiny, and permission should never have been given for the drilling. The seahorses are protected under schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, one of the strongest wildlife protections under law.</p> <p>He said protected species had been totally ignored in the evaluation for the well. \u201cThe rig should never have been put there in the first place and to now go into the spring is absolutely appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe potential risk of disaster for these species is huge. Seahorses are migratory, they shelter in winter in the seas exactly where the rig is, and in the summer they move inland. The noise from the rig causes them stress and activates diseases. The sediment from the drilling makes it difficult for them to feed.\u201d</p> <p>On 20 February campaigners from Save our Shores are holding a public meeting to fight new fossil fuel extraction in the sea.</p> <p>Sara Pascoe, of Save our Shores Bournemouth, said the rig was the most recent fight against continued extraction from Dorset on and offshore. \u201cWe are fighting this rig individually and also we are saying all extraction should be stopped,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Angela Pooley, of East Dorset Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWe should not be investing in fossil fuel extraction, we should be investing in renewables. Yet the government has given permission for this oil rig when it turned down attempts to build a windfarm on the grounds of the impact on the Jurassic Coast. We are strongly opposed to this drilling. There a risk of spillage and the risk to species, and now they are trying to continue into the spring against the conditions of the original permission.\u201d</p> <p>The proposed well, four miles north-east of Studland Bay, was first drilled by BP and British Gas in 1986. Further geological explorations in 2017 confirmed the potential for commercial volumes of oil.</p> <p>Corallian, a private oil and gas exploration company, confirmed it had applied to extend its licence to drill. A spokeswoman said: \u201cA formal request has gone to Opred to extend the permission for drilling to continue beyond the end of February should that be required.\u201d</p> <p>In granting its original permission to drill there, Opred said: \u201cMany of the environmental concerns relating to the proposals would be best addressed if the operations were undertaken during the winter months. Corallian accepted this advice and scheduled the drilling operations to be undertaken during the period November 2018 to February 2019. This was therefore incorporated into the proposals as a mitigation factor.\u201d</p> <p>The Corallian spokesperson said an environmental assessment had been submitted for licence approval. The government said the company had submitted an amended environmental assessment to extend the licence.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cApplications to extend drilling operations into March are currently being reviewed and approval will only be given if there is no significant adverse effect on the environment.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An oil company drilling off the Dorset coastline is attempting to extend its licence into the spring, challenging the conditions imposed to protect the sea\u2019s many sensitive wildlife species. Corallian Energy has set up a rig visible from the protected coastline and in close proximity to 58 marine and coastal protected areas. Sensitive and protected species offshore include bottlenose dolphins, seahorses, rays and breeding populations of seabirds including sandwich terns and little terns. Despite opposition from environmentalists and local people, the government offshore petroleum regulator (Opred), part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, gave permission for Corallian to carry out exploratory drilling last year. But after representations from the Environment Agency and Natural England, among others, the company was restricted to drilling in the winter and not in the spring to mitigate \u201csignificant concerns in relation to both landscape and seascape impacts and potential effects on migratory fish\u201d. Despite the conditions Corallian has gone back to Opred seeking permission to extend the drilling into March. The rig was approved after an application for a windfarm off the coast was turned down on grounds it would harm the views from designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and England\u2019s only natural Unesco World Heritage Site, the Jurassic Coast. If significant oil is confirmed it will be extracted via horizontal long-reach drilling via Wytch farm, at Poole harbour, Europe\u2019s biggest onshore oil facility. Neil Garrick-Maidment, of the Seahorse Trust, said the waters were home to the UK\u2019s two seahorses, the short-snouted and the spiny, and permission should never have been given for the drilling. The seahorses are protected under schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, one of the strongest wildlife protections under law. He said protected species had been totally ignored in the evaluation for the well. \u201cThe rig should never have been put there in the first place and to now go into the spring is absolutely appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe potential risk of disaster for these species is huge. Seahorses are migratory, they shelter in winter in the seas exactly where the rig is, and in the summer they move inland. The noise from the rig causes them stress and activates diseases. The sediment from the drilling makes it difficult for them to feed.\u201d On 20 February campaigners from Save our Shores are holding a public meeting to fight new fossil fuel extraction in the sea. Sara Pascoe, of Save our Shores Bournemouth, said the rig was the most recent fight against continued extraction from Dorset on and offshore. \u201cWe are fighting this rig individually and also we are saying all extraction should be stopped,\u201d she said. Angela Pooley, of East Dorset Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWe should not be investing in fossil fuel extraction, we should be investing in renewables. Yet the government has given permission for this oil rig when it turned down attempts to build a windfarm on the grounds of the impact on the Jurassic Coast. We are strongly opposed to this drilling. There a risk of spillage and the risk to species, and now they are trying to continue into the spring against the conditions of the original permission.\u201d The proposed well, four miles north-east of Studland Bay, was first drilled by BP and British Gas in 1986. Further geological explorations in 2017 confirmed the potential for commercial volumes of oil. Corallian, a private oil and gas exploration company, confirmed it had applied to extend its licence to drill. A spokeswoman said: \u201cA formal request has gone to Opred to extend the permission for drilling to continue beyond the end of February should that be required.\u201d In granting its original permission to drill there, Opred said: \u201cMany of the environmental concerns relating to the proposals would be best addressed if the operations were undertaken during the winter months. Corallian accepted this advice and scheduled the drilling operations to be undertaken during the period November 2018 to February 2019. This was therefore incorporated into the proposals as a mitigation factor.\u201d The Corallian spokesperson said an environmental assessment had been submitted for licence approval. The government said the company had submitted an amended environmental assessment to extend the licence. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cApplications to extend drilling operations into March are currently being reviewed and approval will only be given if there is no significant adverse effect on the environment.\u201d",

People who worked with us later on saw that as marketable, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Slash\u2019s first choice of his favourite tracks across his back catalogue, Rocket Queen, predated Guns: it came from a track that he had worked on with Steven Adler and Duff McKagan in their band Road Crew, before they joined up with Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin. That final quintet, though, was something greater than the sum of its parts. \u201cIt needed all of them to really connect,\u201d Slash says. \u201cWe had exhausted a lot of other lineups and it just clicked.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb67a25357ef12cf9210890b7162318dbcb1b778\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb67a25357ef12cf9210890b7162318dbcb1b778/0_0_5821_3742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Axl Rose and Slash onstage in LA in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Axl Rose and Slash onstage in LA in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc S Canter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biNGPkOVaBE\" title=\"\">Guns N\u2019 Roses, Coma</a></h2> <p>Guns appeared to go straight from starving on the streets to bloated superstardom. Slash hadn\u2019t much enjoyed the transition to stardom \u2013 \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just hang out in the pub. That was a little bit of a shock for me and I just did drugs and drank and hid away at my house. That part of it took a long time to try and sort out.\u201d After touring Appetite to death, or at least the brink of it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/oct/15/guns-n-roses-use-your-illusion\" title=\"\">they returned in 1991</a> with not one but two albums. And both of them were doubles: Use Your Illusion I and II.</p> <p>\u201cThere was some really really cool shit on those records,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was not the the lean or trim eight-to-10-song record that would have probably been the ideal thing.\u201d And the band was in such turmoil that good decision-making was rather beyond them, hence the 28-month tour to promote the two albums. \u201cAs streetwise as I\u2019d like to think the guys were, no one was really prepared for the big-money music business,\u201d admits Slash.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGdcOb9Yq2Q\" title=\"\">Lenny Kravitz, Always on the Run</a></h2> <p>The story goes that Slash took the riff of Always on the Run to Lenny Kravitz because Adler wasn\u2019t a funky enough drummer to play along with it. \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever saying that,\u201d Slash says with a raised eyebrow. \u201cIt was a riff that I came up with that I didn\u2019t present it Guns N\u2019 Roses because it didn\u2019t seem appropriate.\u201d The truth is that Kravitz heard Slash playing the riff while working on his second album, Mama Said, and asked if he could have it. \u201cIt was a free piece of property, so \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The list of artists who have asked Slash to play on their records reads like an awards ceremony lineup: Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, Iggy Pop, Mot\u00f6rhead, Carole King, Rihanna.

Instead, he quietly assembled a collection of tracks, then set about finding singers to front them. This became his first solo album, 2010\u2019s Slash. He had first met Lemmy in June 1987, when Guns N\u2019 Roses came to play at the Marquee in London. \u201cLemmy and I just hit it off and we started hanging out and we\u2019ve been friends ever since.

      "bodyText": "Guns N\u2019 Roses, Rocket Queen No band has been quite so terrifying to the guardians of morality since Guns N\u2019 Roses ascended to worldwide notoriety in the year following the release of their 1987 debut album, Appetite for Destruction. \u201cI know how in the 80s especially, a lot of bands were infamous for creating infamy,\u201d says Slash \u2013 shades on, nicotine gum on the table in front of him, nine years after packing in the fags \u2013 with a little laugh of disdain. \u201cWe were feral. People who worked with us later on saw that as marketable, I guess.\u201d Slash\u2019s first choice of his favourite tracks across his back catalogue, Rocket Queen, predated Guns: it came from a track that he had worked on with Steven Adler and Duff McKagan in their band Road Crew, before they joined up with Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin. That final quintet, though, was something greater than the sum of its parts. \u201cIt needed all of them to really connect,\u201d Slash says. \u201cWe had exhausted a lot of other lineups and it just clicked.\u201d Guns N\u2019 Roses, Coma Guns appeared to go straight from starving on the streets to bloated superstardom. Slash hadn\u2019t much enjoyed the transition to stardom \u2013 \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just hang out in the pub. That was a little bit of a shock for me and I just did drugs and drank and hid away at my house. That part of it took a long time to try and sort out.\u201d After touring Appetite to death, or at least the brink of it, they returned in 1991 with not one but two albums. And both of them were doubles: Use Your Illusion I and II. \u201cThere was some really really cool shit on those records,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was not the the lean or trim eight-to-10-song record that would have probably been the ideal thing.\u201d And the band was in such turmoil that good decision-making was rather beyond them, hence the 28-month tour to promote the two albums. \u201cAs streetwise as I\u2019d like to think the guys were, no one was really prepared for the big-money music business,\u201d admits Slash. Lenny Kravitz, Always on the Run The story goes that Slash took the riff of Always on the Run to Lenny Kravitz because Adler wasn\u2019t a funky enough drummer to play along with it. \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever saying that,\u201d Slash says with a raised eyebrow. \u201cIt was a riff that I came up with that I didn\u2019t present it Guns N\u2019 Roses because it didn\u2019t seem appropriate.\u201d The truth is that Kravitz heard Slash playing the riff while working on his second album, Mama Said, and asked if he could have it. \u201cIt was a free piece of property, so \u2026\u201d The list of artists who have asked Slash to play on their records reads like an awards ceremony lineup: Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, Iggy Pop, Mot\u00f6rhead, Carole King, Rihanna. Sometimes, though, it didn\u2019t work out as expected. Such as when he went to record Wiggle Wiggle with Bob Dylan in 1990. \u201cI go in and I did what I consider to be a really good one-off in my own style,\u201d he says. \u201cA couple days later I asked Don [Was, the producer], \u2018Can you send me a rough of what it what it sounds like?\u2019 I\u2019d done an acoustic rhythm track through the whole song. I\u2019m listening \u2013 it\u2019s Bob Dylan, cool!\u201d But Slash\u2019s solo hadn\u2019t made the cut. \u201cBob said it sounded a little bit too much like Guns N\u2019 Roses. So he just took it off.\u201d Velvet Revolver, Slither When Slash left Guns N\u2019 Roses in 1996, he had his own project, Slash\u2019s Snakepit, up and running, but was adrift in many other ways. \u201cJohn Lennon had his lost weekend; I had a lost decade in the 90s. But the one thing I was doing with Snakepit was to try and do something that had something solid underneath.\u201d Velvet Revolver \u2013 the group he formed with his old Guns colleagues McKagan and Matt Sorum, plus guitarist Dave Kushner and \u2013 especially \u2013 singer Scott Weiland was not an easy ride, though. \u201cVelvet Revolver was a really difficult time. It never felt as good as it looked from the outside. It was a cool combination \u2013 but I didn\u2019t help, and we all fell off the wagon after a while.\u201d Did the news of Weiland\u2019s death in December 2015, of an accidental overdose, come as any surprise? \u201cWhen you get that phone call \u2026 it was a shock and at the same time it was, \u2018Why should it be a shock?\u2019\u201d Slash, Dr Alibi (feat Lemmy) After Velvet Revolver came to an end, Slash had no desire to form another band. Instead, he quietly assembled a collection of tracks, then set about finding singers to front them. This became his first solo album, 2010\u2019s Slash.

      "bodyText": "Jussie Smollett, the gay and black star of TV show Empire, has said that he believes he was assaulted in Chicago two weeks ago because he is an outspoken critic of Donald Trump. In his first detailed interview since the alleged 29 January assault, Smollett was asked by Good Morning America on ABC News why he thinks he was targeted. In his reply, he referred to Trump by his moniker as the 45th president of the United States. \u201cI come really, really hard against 45,\u201d he said. \u201cI come really, really hard against his administration and I don\u2019t hold my tongue.\u201d During the interview, Smollett was played a clip of Trump responding to news of the alleged attack on the actor and R&amp;B singer. The president said: \u201cI think that\u2019s horrible. It doesn\u2019t get worse as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d The actor said he appreciated that Trump had not brushed over the event, but added that he had no doubt that his assailants were motivated by his criticism of the president. With ABC News censoring the comment on taste grounds, Smollett said: \u201cI can only go off of their words. Who says, \u2018[bleep] Empire, this Maga country,\u2019 [bleep] ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on to you? And this is just a friendly fight?\u201d Shortly after ABC News aired, Chicago police announced a potentially important development in their investigation. They said that two men had been detected in surveillance film in the area of the alleged attack and were now being questioned, though they were not being treated as suspects. Smollett grew emotional in the TV interview and became teary. He said: \u201cI will never be the man that this did not happen to. I am forever changed.\u201d His family has said he suffered a hate attack, and the actor has been supported by a surge of sympathy on social media. But doubters have also questioned his account. He addressed some of those doubts in the interview. Asked why he had taken so long to contact police after the incident he said: \u201cThere\u2019s a level of pride there. We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak, and we as a people are not weak.\u201d At first he refused to hand over his cellphone to police for forensic investigation. He said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not going to do that. I have private pictures and videos and numbers. My partner\u2019s number, my family\u2019s number, my cast mates\u2019 numbers, my friends\u2019 numbers, my private emails, songs, voicemails.\u201d Police have said that he has now handed over records of his phone activity at the time of the alleged attack, but that it was so heavily redacted that they needed further information. Smollett said that on the night he had walked detectives down to the site of the alleged attack and had seen a surveillance camera right above the spot. But the camera was found to be pointing in the wrong direction to capture anything. Smollett said he was \u201cpissed off\u201d not only by his attackers but also by those who had questioned the veracity of his account. \u201cHow can you doubt that, how can you not believe that, it\u2019s the truth? And then it became, oh, it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to believe that this is the truth, you don\u2019t even want to see the truth.\u201d He added: \u201cIt feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.

He said that his assailant had used the phrase coined by Donald Trump, Make America Great Again, Maga, as he laid into the actor. \u201cI turned around and I see the attacker masked and he said: \u2018This Maga country [bleep]\u2019 and punched me right in the face so I punched his ass right back.

Bragg argues, said publisher Faber &amp; Faber, \u201cthat to protect ourselves from encroaching tyranny, we must look beyond this one-dimensional notion of what it means to be free and, by reconnecting liberty to equality and accountability, restore the individual agency engendered by the three dimensions of freedom\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think the interest in in-depth writing is returning,\u201d said Bragg, who previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/nov/05/lords.uk\">published a pamphlet in 2001</a> about reform of the House of Lords. Back then, he said, \u201cI was trying to stimulate a debate about that, to start a fire. I think that\u2019s what pamphlets are good at. If you think about Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, it was starting a debate, and I\u2019ve really been thinking and writing about accountability since then.\u201d</p> <p>Bragg said that he had \u201cwritten a few songs on the subject, but it\u2019s hard to get a rhyme for accountability\u201d.

Where\u2019s the accountability in that? \u2026 That\u2019s where I come up with the idea that free speech alone is not the definition of freedom. It\u2019s liberty, fine, but freedom has to be more than just saying whatever you want to whoever you want whenever you want and having no comeback. That\u2019s not freedom.\u201d</p> <p>Bragg said he wasn\u2019t \u201cwriting about a principle, like John Stuart Mill\u201d. Instead he was \u201ctrying to get to grips with the situation we find ourselves in at the moment \u2026 If your free speech is to be more than a privilege, it\u2019s something that has to be reciprocated for others, and that\u2019s being lost as well .... One of the things about being a singer-songwriter is that you\u2019re trying to talk about something that everyone\u2019s experienced, love, and you\u2019re trying to join the dots in a way that helps people see from another perspective.

It feels like they are people who are connected but who don\u2019t have a vested interest in what they\u2019re saying, unlike politicians, where of course what we\u2019re seeing is rampant hypocrisy. Billy\u2019s always had this tradition and was the natural person to go to first to galvanise the whole series.\u201d</p> <p>Brackstone said that the authors would be free to choose what they wanted to write about: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can prescribe an issue to address, it\u2019s got to come from the heart and you\u2019ve got to be prepared to break a few eggs.\u201d</p> <p>The series marks a high-profile revival of pamphlet publishing in the UK, riffing on the 18th and 19th-century idea of chapbooks.

He said: \u201cI find that HMRC\u2019s decision that Mr Pokorowski\u2019s circumstances were not \u2018special\u2019 to be flawed. \u201cBeing homeless and having to sleep on the street has to be \u2018something out of the ordinary run of events\u2019 \u2026 No reasonable HMRC officer acting reasonably could have reached a decision that Mr Pokorowski\u2019s circumstances were not \u2018special\u2019.\u201d HMRC said it was writing to Pokorowski and looking into redress. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry that this case came to court and we apologise to Mr Pokorowski. \u201cWe know that people often need additional help and support from us and we are committed to delivering that while being considerate and sensitive to individuals\u2019 circumstances.\u201d",

Reagan probably had bigger problems, given that he survived an assassination attempt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/john-hinckley-jr-release-ronald-reagan-assassination-attempt\" title=\"\">later that </a>March. Political references aside, Fascist Groove Thang remains depressingly relevant.</p> \n<h2>19. The Who</h2> \n<p><strong>My Generation </strong>(1965)</p> \n<p>The Who\u2019s single didn\u2019t fall foul of the prudish BBC for flipping off their wartime elders or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/17/the-who-uk-singles-ranked\" title=\"\">espousing nihilism</a>, but because the corporation worried that Roger Daltrey\u2019s stutter \u2013 \u201cWhy don\u2019t you all f-fade away\u201d \u2013 might offend people afflicted with the condition. (It eventually backed down.)</p> \n<h2>18. Neil Young</h2> \n<p><strong>This Note\u2019s for You </strong>(1988)</p> \n<p>By declaring that he \u201cain\u2019t singing\u201d for Pepsi, Young is effectively doing its bidding for free. Still, the video is a great satire of 80s corporate rock: a dog in sunglasses licks his chops at a bikini-clad girl, and a Michael Jackson lookalike catches fire, leading MTV to ban the clip after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/27/michael-jackson-hair-diamonds\" title=\"\">threats from MJ\u2019s lawyers</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wagn8Wrmzuc\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wagn8Wrmzuc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>17. Lady Gaga</h2> \n<p><strong>Judas</strong> (2011)</p> \n<p>Lebanese officials unfortunately agreed with Gaga\u2019s claim, in her single Judas \u2013 released at Easter, no less \u2013 that \u201cin the most Biblical sense / I am beyond repentance\u201d. It was banned from radio and police impounded boxes of its parent album, Born This Way, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/07/lady-gaga-born-this-way-banned-lebanon\" title=\"\">when they arrived at Beirut international airport</a>. (They also eventually gave in.)</p> \n<h2>16. Olivia Newton-John</h2> \n<p><strong>Physical </strong>(1981)</p> \n<p>ONJ\u2019s single was banned from several radio stations in Utah for being \u201cmore suggestive than most songs\u201d. But perhaps this just reveals KFMY and KSL-FM\u2019s dirty minds. There are plenty of things that ONJ could have be talking about doing \u201chorizontally\u201d with her beau. Spirit levels. Barre classes. Sanding. Breaststroke.</p> \n<h2>15. The Beatles</h2> \n<p><strong>Happiness Is a Warm Gun </strong>(1968)</p> \n<p>Another instance of the BBC\u2019s gift for misinterpretation. The Beatles\u2019 track was not censored for referencing firearms, or for its phallic implications, but, John Lennon claimed, for being \u201cabout shooting up drugs\u201d. Given that the phrase came from Charlie Brown, it would have been an endearingly innocent heroin reference.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/18/from-blurred-lines-to-new-rules-how-sex-in-pop-has-changed-for-ever\">From Blurred Lines to New Rules: how sex in pop has changed for ever</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>14. Robin Thicke feat TI and Pharrell</h2> \n<p><strong>Blurred Lines </strong>(2013)</p> \n<p>Banned by dozens of student unions for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/13/blurred-lines-most-controversial-song-decade\" title=\"\">its coercive lyrics</a>, Blurred Lines started an important conversation about pop\u2019s sexual politics. The video is as objectionable as the lyrics, but the song remains sort of irresistible. That must be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/13/robin-thicke-and-pharrell-williams-to-pay-5m-in-final-blurred-lines-verdict\" title=\"\">the Marvin Gaye part</a>.</p> \n<h2>13. Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads</h2> \n<p><strong>Spasticus Autisticus</strong> (1981)</p> \n<p>Dury wrote Spasticus Autisticus to protest against what he saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/27/guardianobituaries.robindenselow\" title=\"\">as the patronising International Year of Disabled Persons</a>, and then it was blocked by the BBC, which deemed Dury\u2019s descriptions of physical disability offensive. Redemption finally came at the 2012 Paralympic opening ceremony, where it was sung by a group of performers with disabilities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f4ae184782a3b75b0c487170da45a65d0550c47\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f4ae184782a3b75b0c487170da45a65d0550c47/0_0_6101_4243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wreckers of civilisation! ...

Abba</h2> \n<p><strong>Waterloo </strong>(1974)</p> \n<p>During the Gulf war, the reliably literal BBC wasn\u2019t taking any chances, and expunged 67 songs \u2013 featuring even the vaguest and most metaphorical references to armies, fighting, boats, killing, cavalry or the Middle East \u2013 from its playlists. Among them, Abba\u2019s notoriously hawkish hit, Waterloo. Don\u2019t mention the ... <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/all-abbas-uk-singles-ranked\" title=\"\">1974 Eurovision Song Contest</a>?</p> \n<h2>11. NWA</h2> \n<p><strong>Fuck Tha Police </strong>(1988)</p> \n<p>Fuck Tha Police didn\u2019t need banning: it was too profane for radio broadcast anyway. But that didn\u2019t deter Australia\u2019s Triple J, which happily played it for six months. Then the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (under pressure from a rightwing senator) banned it. Triple J protested by putting NWA\u2019s Express Yourself on loop for 24 hours.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/02/straight-outta-compton-reel-history-nwa-eazy-e-ice-cube-dr-dre\">Straight Outta Compton: hit biopic raps up NWA story cleanly</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>10. 2 Live Crew</h2> \n<p><strong>Me So Horny </strong>(1989)</p> \n<p>The standout from the Florida group\u2019s album As Nasty As They Wanna Be, which was ruled obscene and produced a cracking defence from Christopher Hitchens, who called the judge and sheriff a \u201c<a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2011/12/heilemann-remembering-hitchens.html\" title=\"\">pair of racist shitheads who should be told to fuck right off</a>\u201d. Despite being cartoonishly puerile, it seems weirdly innocent now.</p> \n<h2>9. Lil Louis</h2> \n<p><strong>French Kiss </strong>(1989)</p> \n<p>French Kiss features a woman having a lovely time and was initially banned by the BBC for the charmingly coy crime of \u201cheavy breathing\u201d. Lest you thought society was finally OK with female pleasure, Ofcom found the east London digital station 883 Centreforce in breach of its broadcast standards for playing it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/dec/04/why-french-kiss-got-the-kiss-off\" title=\"\">one lunchtime last August</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f4Mc-NYPHaQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>8. Queen</h2> \n<p><strong>I Want to Break Free </strong>(1984)</p> \n<p>Many claim that MTV banned this Corrie-spoofing video, although accounts conflict as to whether that really happened. Regardless, the US didn\u2019t take to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/24/real-freddie-mercury-bohemian-rhapsody\" title=\"\">Freddie Mercury in drag</a>: Brian May recalled midwestern radio programmers saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t possibly play this. You know, it looks homosexual.\u201d (MTV did ban the raunchier video for 1982\u2019s less good Body Language.)</p> \n<h2>7. Madonna</h2> \n<p><strong>Justify My Love</strong> (1990)</p> \n<p>Justify My Love was accused of being so outrageous that Madonna had to invent a new format to contain her smuttiness: when MTV pulled the video for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/16/every-one-of-madonnas-78-singles-ranked\" title=\"\">being too sexually explicit</a>, she released the first ever VHS single (certified 18). It was a global hit, the clunky format a testament to the tenacity of perverts everywhere.</p> \n<h2>6. Billie Holiday</h2> \n<p><strong>Strange Fruit </strong>(1939)</p> \n<p>Columbia refused to let Holiday record it; when Commodore Records did, Atlantic co-founder Ahmet Ertegun called it \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/16/protest-songs-billie-holiday-strange-fruit\" title=\"\">the beginning of the civil rights movement</a>\u201d.

George Michael</h2> \n<p><strong>I Want Your Sex </strong>(1987)</p> \n<p>Once again, in an attempt to protect the nation \u2013 this time from the promotion of casual sex \u2013 the BBC missed the mark and ended perpetuating dodgy stereotypes: Michael reprimanded them for \u201c[dividing] sex and love incredibly\u201d, and asserted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/26/george-michael-songs-more-than-lust-and-longing\" title=\"\">I Want Your Sex</a> \u201cis about attaching lust to love, not just to strangers\u201d.</p> \n<h2>4. Loretta Lynn</h2> \n<p><strong>The Pill </strong>(1975)</p> \n<p>Lynn\u2019s iconic hit details more than just the liberation from pregnancy offered by the contraceptive pill, including the fun she will have, the clothes she will wear, how \u201cthe feelin\u2019 good comes easy now / Since I got the pill\u201d. Naturally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/drugs-casual-sex-comedy-country-music-revolution\" title=\"\">country radio</a> flipped its wig at the scandalous notion of a woman enjoying sex and banned it widely.</p> \n<h2>3. Donna Summer</h2> \n<p><strong>Love to Love You Baby </strong>(1975)</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/17/donna-summer-classic-interview\" title=\"\">orgasmic obstacle</a> strikes again as Donna Summer unleashes her majestic carnal rhapsodies amid Giorgio Moroder\u2019s arpeggiations. What radio stations banned, discos lapped up. Why is it that the sound of female climax is prohibited in pop, yet male guitarists get to play great wanking guitar solos until kingdom, well, come?</p> \n<h2>2. Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin</h2> \n<p><strong>Je T\u2019aime ... Moi Non Plus </strong>(1969)</p> \n<p>The ne plus ultra of coming on strong, this breathy 1969 (nice) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/feb/28/serge-gainsbourg-20-scandalous-moments\" title=\"\">single upset everyone</a> from Portugal to the pope (whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/apr/14/7\" title=\"\">Gainsbourg</a> called, per Birkin, \u201cour greatest PR man\u201d).

Frankie Goes to Hollywood</h2> \n<p><strong>Relax </strong>(1984)</p> \n<p>In January 1984, Mike Read yanked Relax off Radio 1 before the song had finished playing, appalled after having realised that they weren\u2019t singing about, you know, calisthenics. Despite his rashness, Read was pretty slow off the mark: Frankie\u2019s label ZTT had already taken out ads that included such phrases as \u201call the nice boys love sea men\u201d and \u201cnineteen inches that must be taken always\u201d. Of course, it went on to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/28/frankie-goes-to-hollywood-30-years-welcome-to-the-pleasuredome\" title=\"\">a giant hit</a>, spending 52 weeks in the Top 75.

      "bodyText": "20. Heaven 17 (We Don\u2019t Need This) Fascist Groove Thang (1981) A nervy BBC banned the Human League splinter group\u2019s funky debut single for potentially libelling the US\u2019s new president Ronald Reagan as a \u201cfascist god in motion\u201d. Reagan probably had bigger problems, given that he survived an assassination attempt later that March. Political references aside, Fascist Groove Thang remains depressingly relevant. 19. The Who My Generation (1965) The Who\u2019s single didn\u2019t fall foul of the prudish BBC for flipping off their wartime elders or espousing nihilism, but because the corporation worried that Roger Daltrey\u2019s stutter \u2013 \u201cWhy don\u2019t you all f-fade away\u201d \u2013 might offend people afflicted with the condition. (It eventually backed down.) 18. Neil Young This Note\u2019s for You (1988) By declaring that he \u201cain\u2019t singing\u201d for Pepsi, Young is effectively doing its bidding for free. Still, the video is a great satire of 80s corporate rock: a dog in sunglasses licks his chops at a bikini-clad girl, and a Michael Jackson lookalike catches fire, leading MTV to ban the clip after threats from MJ\u2019s lawyers. 17. Lady Gaga Judas (2011) Lebanese officials unfortunately agreed with Gaga\u2019s claim, in her single Judas \u2013 released at Easter, no less \u2013 that \u201cin the most Biblical sense / I am beyond repentance\u201d. It was banned from radio and police impounded boxes of its parent album, Born This Way, when they arrived at Beirut international airport. (They also eventually gave in.) 16. Olivia Newton-John Physical (1981) ONJ\u2019s single was banned from several radio stations in Utah for being \u201cmore suggestive than most songs\u201d. But perhaps this just reveals KFMY and KSL-FM\u2019s dirty minds. There are plenty of things that ONJ could have be talking about doing \u201chorizontally\u201d with her beau. Spirit levels. Barre classes. Sanding. Breaststroke. 15. The Beatles Happiness Is a Warm Gun (1968) Another instance of the BBC\u2019s gift for misinterpretation. The Beatles\u2019 track was not censored for referencing firearms, or for its phallic implications, but, John Lennon claimed, for being \u201cabout shooting up drugs\u201d. Given that the phrase came from Charlie Brown, it would have been an endearingly innocent heroin reference. 14. Robin Thicke feat TI and Pharrell Blurred Lines (2013) Banned by dozens of student unions for its coercive lyrics, Blurred Lines started an important conversation about pop\u2019s sexual politics. The video is as objectionable as the lyrics, but the song remains sort of irresistible. That must be the Marvin Gaye part. 13. Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads Spasticus Autisticus (1981) Dury wrote Spasticus Autisticus to protest against what he saw as the patronising International Year of Disabled Persons, and then it was blocked by the BBC, which deemed Dury\u2019s descriptions of physical disability offensive. Redemption finally came at the 2012 Paralympic opening ceremony, where it was sung by a group of performers with disabilities. 12. Abba Waterloo (1974) During the Gulf war, the reliably literal BBC wasn\u2019t taking any chances, and expunged 67 songs \u2013 featuring even the vaguest and most metaphorical references to armies, fighting, boats, killing, cavalry or the Middle East \u2013 from its playlists. Among them, Abba\u2019s notoriously hawkish hit, Waterloo. Don\u2019t mention the ... 1974 Eurovision Song Contest? 11. NWA Fuck Tha Police (1988) Fuck Tha Police didn\u2019t need banning: it was too profane for radio broadcast anyway. But that didn\u2019t deter Australia\u2019s Triple J, which happily played it for six months. Then the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (under pressure from a rightwing senator) banned it. Triple J protested by putting NWA\u2019s Express Yourself on loop for 24 hours. 10. 2 Live Crew Me So Horny (1989) The standout from the Florida group\u2019s album As Nasty As They Wanna Be, which was ruled obscene and produced a cracking defence from Christopher Hitchens, who called the judge and sheriff a \u201cpair of racist shitheads who should be told to fuck right off\u201d. Despite being cartoonishly puerile, it seems weirdly innocent now. 9. Lil Louis French Kiss (1989) French Kiss features a woman having a lovely time and was initially banned by the BBC for the charmingly coy crime of \u201cheavy breathing\u201d. Lest you thought society was finally OK with female pleasure, Ofcom found the east London digital station 883 Centreforce in breach of its broadcast standards for playing it one lunchtime last August. 8. Queen I Want to Break Free (1984) Many claim that MTV banned this Corrie-spoofing video, although accounts conflict as to whether that really happened. Regardless, the US didn\u2019t take to Freddie Mercury in drag: Brian May recalled midwestern radio programmers saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t possibly play this. You know, it looks homosexual.\u201d (MTV did ban the raunchier video for 1982\u2019s less good Body Language.) 7. Madonna Justify My Love (1990) Justify My Love was accused of being so outrageous that Madonna had to invent a new format to contain her smuttiness: when MTV pulled the video for being too sexually explicit, she released the first ever VHS single (certified 18). It was a global hit, the clunky format a testament to the tenacity of perverts everywhere. 6. Billie Holiday Strange Fruit (1939) Columbia refused to let Holiday record it; when Commodore Records did, Atlantic co-founder Ahmet Ertegun called it \u201cthe beginning of the civil rights movement\u201d. Strange Fruit \u2013 a song about lynchings \u2013 was considered so powerful that some US cities banned it, worried it would provoke civil disharmony. 5. George Michael I Want Your Sex (1987) Once again, in an attempt to protect the nation \u2013 this time from the promotion of casual sex \u2013 the BBC missed the mark and ended perpetuating dodgy stereotypes: Michael reprimanded them for \u201c[dividing] sex and love incredibly\u201d, and asserted that I Want Your Sex \u201cis about attaching lust to love, not just to strangers\u201d. 4. Loretta Lynn The Pill (1975) Lynn\u2019s iconic hit details more than just the liberation from pregnancy offered by the contraceptive pill, including the fun she will have, the clothes she will wear, how \u201cthe feelin\u2019 good comes easy now / Since I got the pill\u201d. Naturally, country radio flipped its wig at the scandalous notion of a woman enjoying sex and banned it widely. 3. Donna Summer Love to Love You Baby (1975) The orgasmic obstacle strikes again as Donna Summer unleashes her majestic carnal rhapsodies amid Giorgio Moroder\u2019s arpeggiations. What radio stations banned, discos lapped up. Why is it that the sound of female climax is prohibited in pop, yet male guitarists get to play great wanking guitar solos until kingdom, well, come? 2. Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin Je T\u2019aime ... Moi Non Plus (1969) The ne plus ultra of coming on strong, this breathy 1969 (nice) single upset everyone from Portugal to the pope (whom Gainsbourg called, per Birkin, \u201cour greatest PR man\u201d). Little did they know that, three decades later, Birkin\u2019s rhapsodic delivery would be appropriated by M&amp;S ads hawking posh salmon. 1. Frankie Goes to Hollywood Relax (1984) In January 1984, Mike Read yanked Relax off Radio 1 before the song had finished playing, appalled after having realised that they weren\u2019t singing about, you know, calisthenics. Despite his rashness, Read was pretty slow off the mark: Frankie\u2019s label ZTT had already taken out ads that included such phrases as \u201call the nice boys love sea men\u201d and \u201cnineteen inches that must be taken always\u201d. Of course, it went on to be a giant hit, spending 52 weeks in the Top 75. It just goes to show, the best way to suppress smut is \u2013 like a pervert on public transport \u2013 just to ignore it.",

It\u2019s as moreish as popcorn, and exactly as substantial. Crackdown 3 is out 15 February, \u00a349.99, or included with Xbox Game Pass subscription (\u00a37.99 per month).",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn will hold talks in Brussels next week with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, as he seeks to break the Brexit impasse and persuade Theresa May to sign up to a customs union. The visit is likely to be highly unwelcome in Downing Street, and risks accusations that Labour is pursuing its own shadow negotiations, undermining the prime minister\u2019s hopes of fresh EU concessions. May will be in Brussels in the same week to meet the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The UK attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, is expected to travel with her. During a whistle-stop tour of the central figures in the Brexit talks on Thursday, Corbyn is also due to meet the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt. He will also hold talks with senior figures in the socialist group in the European parliament, including Labour MEPs. EU sources said Corbyn was expected to provide further details on his recent conditional offer of support for the prime minister\u2019s deal along with an update on the cross-party talks. Earlier this month, the Labour leader said his party would back the withdrawal agreement, containing the Irish backstop, if May renegotiated the accompanying political declaration on the future relationship. Labour is seeking a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union, a close alignment with the single market and protection for standards and workers\u2019 rights. Corbyn also wants commitments on participation in EU agencies, funding programmes and security arrangements, such as the European arrest warrant, written into the deal. The Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: \u201cThere are enough people in Brussels already dedicatedly working against British national interests without Corbyn and his circus joining them.\u201d Barnier raised the Labour party\u2019s ideas as a way to secure parliament\u2019s support when he dined with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, on Monday in Brussels, EU sources said. Barclay is understood to have pointed to the UK\u2019s determination to have an independent trade policy. The government is still pursuing legally binding changes to the Irish backstop, in order to persuade the Democratic Unionist party and Brexiter MPs to back the prime minister\u2019s deal, despite the EU\u2019s refusal to reopen the deal. May has insisted to the EU that a time limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d would convince Brexiter MPs that the UK would not be trapped in the customs union envisaged as a way to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. But the EU\u2019s most senior officials have said in turn that the bloc will not reopen the withdrawal agreement. When the European council president, Donald Tusk, directly suggested to May last week that Corbyn\u2019s Brexit plan might be a way out of the deadlock, sources said May did not respond. Spokesmen for Corbyn, the European commission and Verhofstadt declined to comment on the scheduled visit. The EU\u2019s belief that there is little hope of the government winning over the most hardline Brexiters and the DUPwas strengthened on Thursday evening during a debate and vote on the next steps in the Brexit talks. May had asked the Commons to approve a motion that \u201creiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January\u201d. But Tory MPs criticised the motion on the basis that the Commons had also voted to avoid a no-deal Brexit that day, leaving a host of those backbenchers that May would need to back her deal vowing to rebel again. Meanwhile, the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, announced \u201cemergency\u201d legislation as Ireland \u201cramped up\u201d its preparations for no deal. Earlier, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, also expressed the growing dismay in EU capitals over the Brexit talks, and claimed that the UK was a \u201cwaning country\u201d and too small to stand alone on the global stage. A Downing Street spokesman hit back, claiming that employment was \u201cat a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK.

The court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/02/dutch-court-allows-posthumous-dna-tests-on-doctor-in-ivf-scandal\">only gave permission</a> for Karbaat\u2019s DNA, collected from 27 personal objects, including a toothbrush, to be secured in a safe.</p> <p>Since the 2017 hearing, significant DNA links between a legal child of Karbaat and those conceived with his clinic\u2019s help have emerged.</p> <p>The court on Wednesday ruled that the interests of those who want to know if they are descended from the doctor outweighed the interests of Karbaat\u2019s widow and heirs.</p> <p>\u201cIf he did [use his own sperm], without announcing it at the time, his widow and other heirs cannot claim that the doctor\u2019s anonymity should be respected,\u201d the judge said.</p> <p>It is feared that as many as 200 children may have been fathered by Karbaat. Clinical tests in 2017 suggested a high level of certainty about the paternity of 47 children.</p> <p>Dutch children born to donors before 2004, when the law was changed, have no legal right to know the identity of their biological parent.</p> <p>But the judge said the Karbaat case had special merit given the alleged illegality of the doctor\u2019s actions. Dutch law limits the number of people who can be conceived from one sperm donor to 25.</p> <p>The 2017 hearing had heard that Karbaat once reportedly boasted of fathering 60 children through IVF treatment.</p> <p>When his clinic was shut down in 2009, major administrative irregularities were found.

      "bodyText": "A group of 22 people have won the right to have their DNA checked against that of a Dutch fertility clinic doctor who is feared to have fathered 200 children by using his own sperm rather than that of donors. Jan Karbaat, who died in April 2017 aged 89, always denied the accusations and refused to cooperate with those potentially affected. But a court has ruled that DNA tests can be undertaken as there is sufficient evidence to suggest Karbaat used his sperm without declaring it. One of the children, Merel-Lotte Heij, said in response to the judgment that \u201cevery child has the right to know where he comes from\u201d. In 2017, 22 children who had been conceived with the help of Karbaat\u2019s Blijdorp medical centre in Barendrecht, south of Rotterdam, and 11 of their parents, went to court to demand a DNA test. The doctor died a month before the lawsuit and Karbaat\u2019s family lawyer fiercely fought against any DNA checks, saying the privacy of the deceased and his relatives should be respected. The judge felt at that stage there was insufficient evidence to allow the tests. The court only gave permission for Karbaat\u2019s DNA, collected from 27 personal objects, including a toothbrush, to be secured in a safe. Since the 2017 hearing, significant DNA links between a legal child of Karbaat and those conceived with his clinic\u2019s help have emerged. The court on Wednesday ruled that the interests of those who want to know if they are descended from the doctor outweighed the interests of Karbaat\u2019s widow and heirs. \u201cIf he did [use his own sperm], without announcing it at the time, his widow and other heirs cannot claim that the doctor\u2019s anonymity should be respected,\u201d the judge said. It is feared that as many as 200 children may have been fathered by Karbaat. Clinical tests in 2017 suggested a high level of certainty about the paternity of 47 children. Dutch children born to donors before 2004, when the law was changed, have no legal right to know the identity of their biological parent. But the judge said the Karbaat case had special merit given the alleged illegality of the doctor\u2019s actions. Dutch law limits the number of people who can be conceived from one sperm donor to 25. The 2017 hearing had heard that Karbaat once reportedly boasted of fathering 60 children through IVF treatment. When his clinic was shut down in 2009, major administrative irregularities were found. He is thought to have falsified data and the descriptions of donors.",

Mourinho was sacked in December after 17 league games in his third season, with a contract due to expire at the end of the 2019-20 campaign. Figures released on Thursday list a sum of \u00a319.6m as \u201can exceptional item relating to compensation to the former manager and certain members of the coaching staff for loss of office\u201d. The goalkeeping coach Silvino Louro, the scout Ricardo Formosinho, the analyst Giovanni Cerra and the fitness coaches Stefano Rapetti and Carlos Lal\u00edn are expected to have received payments, though it is likely most of the money went to Mourinho, who was earning \u00a315m a year at Old Trafford. Mourinho has said he is not finished with club management though, having agreed to host a fortnightly Champions League show on the Russian RT television channel, he may be content to spend the rest of this season as a broadcaster. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s success in reviving the club\u2019s fortunes, in the Premier League at least, casts an unflattering light on Mourinho\u2019s time at United and the size of his payoff, though the United board was fully aware that, having granted the manager a one-year contract extension in January 2018, it would not be able to remove him cheaply. Very little at United has come cheaply in recent seasons, with the club\u2019s spending on players in the two and a half seasons since Louis van Gaal departed standing at an enormous \u00a3364m.

Based on what was seen in the first leg at Old Trafford, the caretaker manager and his players do not appear capable of overturning that deficit in the second, making it all the more important that United remain in their present top-four spot until the end of the season. The clamour for Solskj\u00e6r to be given the job full time has died down a little after his first defeat, with a gulf evident between United\u2019s standards and those of a leading European side equally used to throwing money around, though a top-four finish would still represent a significant achievement for a club that was losing its way under Mourinho. While Solskj\u00e6r may still be overlooked for the permanent job even if he manages to secure Champions League football for next season, at the moment he is doing his old club a favour and his managerial CV no harm.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Gun control advocates take stock of victories and setbacks It is a year to the day since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, which revitalised the national movement to prevent gun violence. And while the prospect of new federal gun control laws were negligible under Donald Trump and a Republican-led Congress, campaigners can point to signs of progress, including the Democrats\u2019 recent introduction of House bill HR 8, which would expand federal background check requirements on gun transfers and sales. Students remember. As they prepare to mark Thursday\u2019s anniversary, Parkland students have written about the shooting and its aftermath in these personal reflections first published by the Eagle Eye, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school newspaper. Judge rules that Manafort lied to Mueller A federal judge in Washington DC has found that Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, lied to Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia inquiry about several issues, including his interactions with a former Russian intelligence agent, even after agreeing to cooperate with the special prosecutor. The Wednesday ruling by Judge Amy Berman Jackson means Mueller\u2019s team is no longer obliged to honour its plea deal with Manafort, who could therefore spend many more years behind bars than he previously expected. Mystery Russian. Manafort was accused of lying to Mueller about having shared polling data on the 2016 election with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political operative with ties to Moscow\u2019s intelligence services. Democrats attempt to throw light on \u2018dark money\u2019 Democrats hope to shed new light on the influence of \u201cdark money\u201d in US politics on Thursday, at the first congressional hearing on their sweeping new anti-corruption measure, HR1. The House Administration committee will examine the bill, which aims to combat the corrosive power of undisclosed political donations from big corporations and wealthy individuals. John Doe files. In 2016 the Guardian published the John Doe files, documents revealing previously undisclosed political donations, intended to support candidates including then-Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. AOC video. A clip of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez playing a \u201ccorruption game\u201d to explain the lack of current campaign finance controls this week became the most-watched video of any politician on Twitter, ever. Rio police kill 13 in gang raid, raising \u2018shoot-to-kill\u2019 concerns Brazilian police killed 13 people during a deadly operation against a drug gang in Rio\u2019s Fallet/Fogueteiro favela last Friday, raising fears that the \u201cshoot-to-kill\u201d policy promised by the new governor of Rio de Janeiro state has already come into effect. Fallet/Fogueteiro residents and relatives of the dead said two of those killed had been tortured, including a teenager with no gang links, while even those who were drug gang members had surrendered their weapons to police before being summarily executed. Rio governor. Wilson Witzel, an ally of Brazil\u2019s new far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, became governor of Rio state in January after campaigning on an anti-corruption platform, which included the promise of shoot-to-kill tactics to combat drug gangs. Crib sheet The House of Representatives has approved a resolution that would force an end to US involvement in Yemen, an implicit rebuke to the Trump administration for its continuing close alliance with Saudi Arabia. Nasa has confirmed its Mars rover Opportunity is finally dead after 15 years, the longest ever mission to the planet\u2019s surface. When it landed in January 2004, the robot was expected to survive for only around 90 Martian days. The FBI has released sketches by the serial killer Samuel Little of his alleged victims, along with other information that the agency hopes could help solve dozens of unsolved homicides. Multiple women have accused the musician Ryan Adams of \u201c[dangling] career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex,\u201d according to a report by the New York Times. Adams tweeted that the article was \u201cupsettingly inaccurate\u201d and contained details that were \u201coutright false\u201d. Must-reads How fashion has redefined sex appeal in the #MeToo era It\u2019s 18 months since the start of the MeToo movement. That\u2019s three seasons in which fashion\u2019s centre of gravity has shifted steadily away from sex, says Jess Cartner-Morley \u2013 long enough for the trend to trickle down to date night outfits this Valentine\u2019s weekend. Could a neo-Nazi be Slovakia\u2019s next president? Marian Kotleba, the leader of the far-right Our Slovakia party, is widely regarded as a neo-Fascist. In 2013, he won a shock victory in regional elections. Voted out four years later, his party turned its focus to the Slovak national legislature, taking 14 of its 150 seats. Next month, Kotleba will run for president. Shaun Walker reports. From US intelligence officer to alleged Iranian spy Monica Witt, a former intelligence officer with the US airforce, who converted to Islam and defected to Iran in 2013, has been charged with espionage. Julian Borger asks how the 39-year-old became so enthusiastic about turning her back on her homeland. Life in the shadow of al-Shabaab Given the enduring influence of the extremist group al-Shabaab, Mogadishu remains a dangerous place to live and work, especially for journalists, aid workers, government employees or youth leaders. Moulid Hujale reports from the Somali capital. Opinion The 2011 protests in Tahrir Square represented a radical democratic movement that wanted to restore people\u2019s dignity. But now, rightwing populists around the world have reduced that need for dignity to a vindictive clamour for pride, writes Ece Temelkaran. It is dangerous and unfortunate that so much public anger is being organised and mobilised by rightwing populists and ruthless autocrats such as Donald Trump, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Turkey and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Sport The Ricketts family helped to turn the Chicago Cubs from \u201clovable losers\u201d into World Series champions, ending the team\u2019s 108-year drought.

      "bodyText": "The Patisserie Valerie cafe chain has been saved from closure by a management buyout backed by an Irish private equity firm. Almost 100 cafes will be rescued in the deal, funded by Causeway Capital Partners. Another 21 Philpotts sandwich shops that were part of the Patisserie Valerie group have been bought by AF Blakemore &amp; Son, the family-owned company which is the largest operator of Spar convenience stores in the UK. The two deals will save about 2,000 jobs. Patisserie Holdings \u2013 the listed parent company of the two chains \u2013 said they had been sold for \u00a313m in total, a fraction of the \u00a3450m the group was once worth. The company fell into administration in January, three months after a black hole emerged in its accounts which it blamed on \u201cpotentially fraudulent\u201d accounting irregularities. A buyer for the group\u2019s five Baker &amp; Spice cafes is still being sought but Patisserie Holdings said there had been strong interest. Dublin-based Causeway specialises in investing in small and medium-sized companies and already owns BB Bakers + Baristas, which has just over 60 sites in the UK and Ireland. Causeway Capital\u2019s Matt Scaife said on Thursday: \u201cPatisserie Valerie is a heritage brand, much loved by its loyal customers. This investment should mark the end of a turbulent period for customers and suppliers alike. We are delighted to partner with the team and look forward to helping the business return to growth.\u201d The private equity firm said it wanted to \u201crefresh and renew\u201d the Patisserie Valerie brand and has taken on the group\u2019s head office and bakery in Birmingham as well as 96 cafes. It is keeping on the chief executive, Steve Francis, a turnaround specialist who joined the business in November after a \u00a340m black hole was uncovered in its finances. Peter Blakemore, chairman of AF Blakemore, which already owns the Eat17 hipster cafe and convenience store chain, said the acquisition of Philpotts brought \u201csignificant opportunities to develop the brand, whilst taking elements of the Philpotts offer into our wider business\u201d. The rescue deals come only days after Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct walked away from talks to buy the stricken cake chain. Patisserie Valerie went into administration last month, blaming its financial difficulties on \u201cvery significant manipulation\u201d of its balance sheet and \u201cextensive\u201d misstatement of its accounts. It suspended its finance chief Chris Marsh in October, and he subsequently resigned after being arrested and bailed by police. The Serious Fraud Office has said it is investigating an unnamed individual in relation to Patisserie Holdings,, but has not commented further. It is understood that any liabilities relating to the fraud investigation remain in the hands of administrators at KPMG and have not been passed on to the new owners. The company \u2013 which was founded in 1926 by a Belgian, Esther van Gyseghem, who became known as Madame Valerie \u2013 expanded rapidly after being bought by the Pizza Express entrepreneur Luke Johnson\u2019s Risk Capital in 2006. Patisserie Holdings was valued at \u00a3450m before shares were suspended when the black hole was discovered. Its later collapse into administration wiped out shareholders, including Johnson, who was executive chairman with a 37% stake. Johnson, who will no longer be involved with the business, said on Thursday that he was pleased that the \u201ccloud of uncertainty\u201d had been lifted for employees. \u201cWhile I\u2019m naturally deeply disappointed at the events that led us to this point, I wish the company well,\u201d he said. Administrators at KPMG last month closed 71 of of the group\u2019s near 200 stores and concessions, including the entire Druckers cafe chain, while they sought a buyer for the company. About 900 jobs were lost. David Costley-Wood, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said it was \u201creally pleasing\u201d to have saved a significant number of jobs through the deals with Causeway and Blakemore. He said: \u201cIt was clear from the outset of our appointment that the loyalty shown in the brands from their very many customers was a significant factor in ensuring that these businesses would remain part and parcel of our high streets.\u201d",

When the panel agrees that she could, she asks whether she could use the money from those Pacs to make hush payments to get elected and whether, once elected, she could write laws that help her donors, and even buy stock in them to benefit from her own legislation. She would not be breaking the law in doing so, each expert confirms, making a compelling case for campaign finance reform.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1032017750829531142\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u2018I can think of nothing more American.\u2019 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke \u2014 the man taking on Ted Cruz \u2014 brilliantly explains why NFL players kneeling during the anthem is not disrespectful <a href=\"https://t.co/bEqOAYpxEL\">pic.twitter.com/bEqOAYpxEL</a></p>\u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1032017750829531142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 21, 2018</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is currently mulling a run for president, has the second most viewed political Twitter video.

Some had assumed that while Ocasio-Cortez drove likes and favourites online, as a first-term congresswoman she would be relatively inconspicuous. Instead, she has done the improbable, translating the topic of campaign finance into a viral video. Recently, she played a \u201clightning round game\u201d with a panel of ethics experts, in which she asked a series of quick-fire lawyerly questions in order to demonstrate the ease with which officials in Congress and the White House can be corrupted by donations from special interest groups. An edited video of the hearing, which was uploaded by the leftwing online channel NowThis news, has been viewed 37.5m times, making it the most watched political video ever posted on Twitter, according to the subscription-based web analytics company Tubular (although that claim depends on what you count as \u201cpolitical\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s doctored video of him bodyslamming and punching a person with the CNN logo for a head has slightly more views at 39.1m). The video is the 38th most viewed overall, as of Wednesday morning. Many other versions of the video, including those uploaded CNN and C-Span, also have millions of views. \u201cThe video has been uniquely successful but we are seeing more and more clips from congressional hearings and floor speeches getting tens of millions of views,\u201d said Nico Pitney, NowThis political director.\u201cOur audience is very hungry right now for issue-based political videos. They want to hear from people who are authentic, and who present smart factual information in a creative way.\u201d In the video, Ocasio-Cortez asks whether, as a member of Congress, she would be able to run a campaign entirely funded by corporate political action committees (Pacs). When the panel agrees that she could, she asks whether she could use the money from those Pacs to make hush payments to get elected and whether, once elected, she could write laws that help her donors, and even buy stock in them to benefit from her own legislation. She would not be breaking the law in doing so, each expert confirms, making a compelling case for campaign finance reform. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is currently mulling a run for president, has the second most viewed political Twitter video. His explanation of why he supports NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, also edited and uploaded by NowThis, garnered 19.9m views.",

You would have been a fool to bet against her original shtick being huge in 2002. An era in which Busted bestrode teenage affections like a tri-headed, invariably gurning colossus was clearly ripe for a Canadian teen dressed as a schoolgirl, sticking her tongue out, doing devil-horn fingers and peddling battery-farmed pop-punk aimed squarely at teens. And it was huge: her debut album Let Go sold 16m copies. Equally, however, you would have been brave to bet on Avril Lavigne hanging around. You could marvel at the precision-tooling that went into Sk8er Boi without thinking it was necessarily the stuff on which protracted careers were founded.

Seventeen years on from Let Go and here we are, staring down the barrel of Lavigne\u2019s sixth album. How has she survived, even flourished, when the careers of most 2002 teen sensations \u2013 and indeed the pop-punk bands that provided her initial inspiration \u2013 have withered? In the interim, certain adjustments have been made. Her albums now sell only in vast quantities, rather than figures that make you think there\u2019s been a misprint. Her image has shifted. You can\u2019t go on dressing like a schoolgirl and sticking your tongue out indefinitely, although Lavigne kept at it longer than you might imagine, bolstered by her 2007 single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg59q4puhmg\">Girlfriend</a>, a Chinn and Chapman-esque burst of bubblegum so brilliant it would have been a huge hit at any point in the last 50 years. By contrast, Head Above Water arrives with a cover that offers us Avril Lavigne, serious singer-songwriter, naked but for an acoustic guitar, a stock signifier of unvarnished honesty that, for some inexplicable reason, male singer-songwriters are never impelled to use to prove their sincerity.</p> <p>In a sense, this approach returns Lavigne to her roots. Like a millennial equivalent of Gryphon, the medievally inclined prog band whose members ditched their crumhorns and regrouped as the Banned when punk hit, she was originally signed as a country-ish singer-songwriter, before someone noticed that Blink-182 were selling millions. Head Above Water\u2019s title track, meanwhile, has been a big hit on US Christian radio, hailed as a powerful worship ballad: Lavigne\u2019s career began with her performing alongside a Christian singer called Stephen Medd.</p> <p>The reviewers at Faithwire and Christian Headlines have a point. Head Above Water <em>is</em> powerful, in a big old MOR power-ballad way. In fact, what the yanks call adult contemporary is very much the album\u2019s most successful mode: it\u2019s at its best when Lavigne and her co-writers forget about trends and roll out the booming drums and the kind of air-punching choruses you could imagine Heart singing in their garagantuan-haired 80s heyday. No one is ever going to describe the results as hip, but It Was in Me and Warrior are ruthlessly well-written, they fit Lavigne\u2019s voice and the soldier-on lyrical sentiment is given a little edge by the album\u2019s backstory. Head Above Water was inspired by Lavigne\u2019s battle with Lyme disease, the tick-bourne infection to which she succumbed shortly after her 30th birthday and, she has said, nearly killed her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKF6ghfcQic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EKF6ghfcQic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Avril Lavigne: Head Above Water \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s on substantially shakier ground when it tries to apply the pragmatic thinking that led Lavigne to co-opt pop-punk to what\u2019s in vogue today.

There was consensus that she was an innocent child who\u2019d been groomed online. Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation\u2019s narrative \u2013 one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming \u2013 because that demanded nothing from us. She was the little girl who\u2019d been caught up in a dangerous death cult; the pixelated image of a kid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/09/london-schoolgirls-syria-journey-checklist-found-in-bedroom\" title=\"\">caught on CCTV</a> about to fly, and that was sad.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/14/uk-isis-britons-officials-risk-syria-schoolgirl-shamima-begum\">UK will not put officials at risk to rescue Isis Britons, says minister</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was also made easier by her absence. We only needed to empathise with Begum\u2019s situation in the abstract. Of course, we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately. But that was just a fantasy. I can\u2019t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad. Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp, Begum is no longer an abstract concept. Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom \u2013 especially given her apparent lack of remorse. And yet is she not still a victim of grooming? Still a British citizen we should be looking to help? </p> \n<p>There are already those arguing that since Begum left the UK to join Islamic State four years ago her situation has changed entirely. Ex counter-terrorism chief Mark Rowley told the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0002hl5\" title=\"\">Today programme</a> on Radio 4 this morning that when Begum was 15 he considered her a victim. Now she is an adult what happens next, he argued, should be determined by clinical risk assessment and the consideration of cold, hard facts. He wants us to separate those grainy images of a young girl from the crisp picture of the woman she is today.</p> \n<p>But to see Begum in isolation to past events serves no purpose. The brainwashed child she was has everything to do with the brainwashed young woman she has become. That\u2019s not to justify what she has done, but to see the series of events that have unfolded in her life as being traceable directly back to her grooming and subsequent radicalisation. Children are influenced by those around them, a product of their environment. We only develop and learn to be better when another influence takes a bad one\u2019s place. Since the age of 15 Begum has not been afforded that opportunity in the caliphate; it is unsurprising her views continue to be as dangerous as when she left \u2013 they\u2019ve become her norm.</p> \n<p>If she seems untroubled by the violence she has witnessed, that\u2019s no more a sign of a callous and wicked villain than a vulnerable young woman who is profoundly scarred. We know that trauma in childhood impacts your experiences as you grow older. I can\u2019t begin to imagine what she has seen in her life, what it\u2019s like to have had two children die. What we told ourselves about that 15-year-old girl remains true to this day, except now helping this young woman requires more than just easy words.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/london-schoolgirl-who-fled-to-join-isis-wants-to-return-to-uk\">London schoolgirl who fled to join Isis wants to return to UK</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That\u2019s not to say Begum is to receive a hero\u2019s welcome back at Gatwick airport. To rehabilitate and reintegrate her back into society will take much work by dedicated professionals, be in no doubt. But to try to help her must be better than leaving this teenager to languish in a camp, to quite possibly witness her third child die. If rehabilitation proves impossible, at least back in Britain she can live under supervision and be kept from doing further harm \u2013 to herself or to others. And should, one day soon, Begum be in a position to rejoin British society proper, who could be better placed to warn other vulnerable children of the dangerous reality of online grooming, of radicalisation by extremists and the acts that led her to commit? Our justice system is based on the possibility of rehabilitation. It would be wrong to write off the prospect of anyone changing, let alone a vulnerable 19-year-old girl and her unborn child.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s impossible not to feel a jolt of shock when confronted with the photo of Shamima Begum on the front page of this morning\u2019s Times. Four years ago \u2013 when we last saw her \u2013 it was accepted that Begum had been brainwashed. There was consensus that she was an innocent child who\u2019d been groomed online. Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation\u2019s narrative \u2013 one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming \u2013 because that demanded nothing from us. She was the little girl who\u2019d been caught up in a dangerous death cult; the pixelated image of a kid caught on CCTV about to fly, and that was sad. It was also made easier by her absence. We only needed to empathise with Begum\u2019s situation in the abstract. Of course, we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately. But that was just a fantasy. I can\u2019t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad. Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp, Begum is no longer an abstract concept. Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom \u2013 especially given her apparent lack of remorse. And yet is she not still a victim of grooming? Still a British citizen we should be looking to help? There are already those arguing that since Begum left the UK to join Islamic State four years ago her situation has changed entirely. Ex counter-terrorism chief Mark Rowley told the Today programme on Radio 4 this morning that when Begum was 15 he considered her a victim. Now she is an adult what happens next, he argued, should be determined by clinical risk assessment and the consideration of cold, hard facts. He wants us to separate those grainy images of a young girl from the crisp picture of the woman she is today. But to see Begum in isolation to past events serves no purpose. The brainwashed child she was has everything to do with the brainwashed young woman she has become. That\u2019s not to justify what she has done, but to see the series of events that have unfolded in her life as being traceable directly back to her grooming and subsequent radicalisation. Children are influenced by those around them, a product of their environment. We only develop and learn to be better when another influence takes a bad one\u2019s place. Since the age of 15 Begum has not been afforded that opportunity in the caliphate; it is unsurprising her views continue to be as dangerous as when she left \u2013 they\u2019ve become her norm. If she seems untroubled by the violence she has witnessed, that\u2019s no more a sign of a callous and wicked villain than a vulnerable young woman who is profoundly scarred. We know that trauma in childhood impacts your experiences as you grow older. I can\u2019t begin to imagine what she has seen in her life, what it\u2019s like to have had two children die. What we told ourselves about that 15-year-old girl remains true to this day, except now helping this young woman requires more than just easy words. That\u2019s not to say Begum is to receive a hero\u2019s welcome back at Gatwick airport. To rehabilitate and reintegrate her back into society will take much work by dedicated professionals, be in no doubt. But to try to help her must be better than leaving this teenager to languish in a camp, to quite possibly witness her third child die. If rehabilitation proves impossible, at least back in Britain she can live under supervision and be kept from doing further harm \u2013 to herself or to others. And should, one day soon, Begum be in a position to rejoin British society proper, who could be better placed to warn other vulnerable children of the dangerous reality of online grooming, of radicalisation by extremists and the acts that led her to commit? Our justice system is based on the possibility of rehabilitation. It would be wrong to write off the prospect of anyone changing, let alone a vulnerable 19-year-old girl and her unborn child. \u2022 Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine",

      "bodyText": "Nairobi\u2019s traffic congestion is notorious. Minibuses known as matatus battle for space with cars, motorbikes and hand-drawn carts, causing excruciating gridlock. Through this automotive battleground dart the daring members of the Kenyan city\u2019s inline skating community, deftly weaving between moving vehicles, holding on to buses for speed and jumping over potholes. Usually dressed in stylish apparel and rarely wearing safety gear, these street skaters relish the risks of their sport and the accompanying swagger it gives them. Lenny Alvin and Allan Ayigah gain speed before turning on to the highway. Inline skating, better known as rollerblading after the Rollerblade brand of skates, peaked in popularity in most western countries over 20 years ago. When the fad faded, most skates were either hidden in cupboards or donated to charity. In recent years, along with bundles of used clothes and shoes, some of them have been steadily making their way to east Africa \u2013 fuelling a skating craze. Racing around a turn and on to Nairobi\u2019s Thika superhighway, Allan Ayigah and his friends seem calm and determined. As they draft behind each other for speed, it is apparent the three skaters are accustomed to this, holding their own while vehicles zoom by at speeds over 70mph (110km an hour). Left: Nairobi\u2019s central business district during afternoon rush hour. Right: a lone skater makes the most of some relatively light afternoon traffic. Skating on major roadways may be risky, but lack of facilities and poorly maintained streets mean Kenyan skaters have to make do, and the best places to skate are almost always the busiest. \u201cIt\u2019s perceived as a young person\u2019s sport \u2013 older guys tend to see it as risky,\u201d says Ayigah, a skater since 2007. Like most of his peers he\u2019s self-taught, having learned via Google and YouTube videos. Along the way he has had to deal with injuries and arrests for breaking unspecified traffic laws \u2013 but shows no sign of stopping. He and his friends give many reasons for why they continue skating despite the perils: the adrenaline rush, income from skate lessons and the chance to meet girls. But one thing everyone agrees on is the sense of community the sport provides. Nelson Mbusyei and Angela Martha practise the move known as the footgun. \u201cYou can meet up to 20 guys in a day,\u201d says Ayigah. \u201cYou exchange contacts and it grows into something else. It\u2019s a uniting sport.\u201d He adds: \u201cIn skating we don\u2019t have the ethnic groups. In almost every clique you find guys from different tribes.\u201d In a country where tribal ties affect all facets of life, from business to politics, and can even lead to violence, the pluralism of inline skating is unique. It is still a male-dominated pursuit, however. Among a group of four freestyle skaters out on a Sunday afternoon in the central business district, 20-year-old Angela Martha is the only female. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s mainly guys out there,\u201d says Martha. \u201cBut in this generation girls are growing as skaters. It\u2019s more about how you skate than who you are.\u201d Left: kids take part in a Sunday afternoon skating lesson. Right: Lenny Alvin drafts behind Allan Ayigah on Nairobi\u2019s Thika superhighway. The inclusive culture of skating in Kenya has helped it increase in popularity. An increasing number of clubs travel around the country to compete with each other. And with a strong performance by team Kenya in the 2018 African speed skating championship, many hope the government will finally take the sport seriously. A beneficiary of this rapid growth is Kenneth Wanjohi, who runs Skate Station Nairobi in the city\u2019s CBD. Squeezed in a stall between a hair salon and a used shoe vendor, Wanjohi\u2019s store is overflowing with skates. Kenneth Wanjohi inside Skate Station Nairobi. By his own reckoning 90% of the products he sells are secondhand, imported from Australia or the UK in large bundles. This is all part of the burgeoning secondhand clothing business, known as \u201cmitumba\u201d or literally \u201cbundles\u201d in Swahili, that brings used products from wealthier countries to Africa. Wanjohi makes a serious return on these imports, usually collecting double what he paid for the wholesale bundle of skates. For now, this growth shows no sign of stopping. \u201cFour years I\u2019ve been in the business,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery year it gets better and better.\u201d Every Sunday afternoon, in an empty lot in the CBD known as the Sunken Park, the expanding popularity of skating in Kenya is on display.

      "bodyText": "Sweden is investigating its ambassador to China after she was accused of orchestrating a bizarre series of meetings between the daughter of a Swedish bookseller jailed in China and businessmen who said they could help secure his release. The story is detailed in a blogpost by Angela Gui, the daughter of Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish bookseller who has disappeared twice and is currently held in Chinese custody. Gui Minhai was one of five Hong Kong-based booksellers \u2013 known for publishing sensational tomes on the private lives of China\u2019s elite \u2013 who disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced in mainland China two years later. He was released in October 2017, but was arrested on a train to Beijing in January 2018 while travelling with two Swedish diplomats. He was reportedly en route to see a Swedish specialist over fears he had the neurological disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Angela Gui, who is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, has been vocal about calling for her father\u2019s release. In the Medium post, Gui details the \u201cvery strange experience\u201d, alleging that she was contacted by Anna Lindstedt, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to China, in mid-January and invited to Stockholm to hear about a \u201cnew approach\u201d to her father\u2019s case. Lindstedt returned to Stockholm on Wednesday to meet officials from the foreign affairs ministry, the Swedish embassy in Beijing told Associated Press by phone. Lindstedt is not under criminal investigation. The embassy declined to give further details, but a foreign ministry spokesman in Sweden confirmed that Lindstedt\u2019s departure was related to meetings she arranged between Gui and the Chinese businessmen. \u201cShe didn\u2019t explain very much, but said that there were some businessmen she thought could help, and that they wanted to meet me in Stockholm. She\u2019d join too, and these were people she trusted, she reassured me,\u201d wrote Gui. Gui said the meetings were held at a hotel lounge, which required keycard access. She was encouraged not to leave the suite, with the businessmen saying they needed her to \u201cbe around as much as possible\u201d. She said she was even escorted to and from the bathroom. After several days, during which time Gui says she was offered a job at the Chinese embassy, Gui said she felt a growing sense of unease. \u201cThere was a lot of wine, a lot of people, and a lot of increasingly strange questions. But because Ambassador Lindstedt was present and seemingly supportive of whatever it was that was going on, I kept assuming that this had been initiated by the Swedish foreign ministry,\u201d wrote Gui. She alleges the men told her that talks were underway with Beijing to secure her father\u2019s release but that in order for them to succeed Gui must stop talking about the case and avoid media engagement because \u201c\u2018the Chinese\u2019 were very angry with me\u201d. Gui says Lindstedt agreed to the plan and promised that if Gui\u2019s father was released she would \u201cgo on Swedish television and speak of the bright future of Sweden-China relations\u201d. Gui claims that the conversations took a nasty turn, with one man saying she had to trust him or she would never see her father again and that her refusal to cooperate could harm the ambassador\u2019s career. \u201cAmbassador Lindstedt added that China were adopting a new diplomatic line which meant that if activism and media coverage was to continue, China might \u2018punish Sweden\u2019,\u201d wrote Gui. Gui said she rang the ministry of foreign affairs the following week and they told her they were unaware that these meetings had taken place and were not even aware Lindstedt was in the country. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Stockholm denied any involvement in the incident. \u201cThe embassy of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Sweden would like to solemnly state that the Chinese side has never authorised and will not authorise anyone to engage with Gui Minhai\u2019s daughter,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cChina is a country of rule of law, and the result of the Gui Minhai case is to be decided by China\u2019s law, instead of the so-called China\u2019s representative claimed by Gui Minhai\u2019s daughter or the press. We hope that some people will not try to gain publicity for themselves by making up a so-called China\u2019s representative.\u201d Gui concluded her post by saying she would continue to campaign for her father\u2019s release: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be quiet in exchange for a visa and an arbitrary promise that my father \u2018might\u2019 be released.

      "body": "<p>Strange things happen in Yukiko Motoya\u2019s short stories: salarymen get swept skywards, Mary Poppins-like, by their umbrellas; sales assistants help aliens choose the perfect outfit; and women challenge their boyfriends to duels. Like soap bubbles, several of these stories catch your eye, but the instant they are gone you forget about them. It\u2019s when Motoya is on the rocky terrain of collapsing relationships that her strangeness finds the friction it needs to stick.</p> <p>In 2016 Motoya won Japan\u2019s most prestigious literary award, the Akutagawa prize, for the novella that appears here as \u201cAn Exotic Marriage\u201d. It is an ingenious, funny and frightening story in which San and her husband appear to be transforming into one another. \u201cWhenever I\u2019d gotten close to someone in the past,\u201d San thinks, \u201cI\u2019d had the feeling that little by little I was being replaced.\u201d She asks her brother\u2019s girlfriend, Hakone, when she is going to marry. \u201cGetting married,\u201d Hakone replies uncertainly, \u201cthat means swallowing everything about the other person.\u201d</p> <p>In his introduction to a recent anthology of Japanese short stories, Haruki Murakami wondered whether \u201cthe long history of male-centred society in Japan has produced female writers whose gaze possesses a sharper critical spirit\u201d. It\u2019s certainly true that Motoya\u2019s men are nearly all useless: distant and self-absorbed, hunched over iPads or in front of the TV. When San\u2019s husband gets into an argument in the street he makes her deal with it. In the surreal \u201cThe Straw Husband\u201d, Tomoko\u2019s partner (a scarecrow who sheds tiny orchestral instruments when he gets upset, but there isn\u2019t time to get into that here) sulks when she puts a tiny scratch on his new car. \u201cYou let me down,\u201d he mournfully repeats, slumped on the couch.</p> <p>The other standout story is \u201cThe Dogs\u201d, in which a shy, possibly misanthropic artist retreats to a cabin in the woods. She is kept company by a pack of white dogs who surround her at night \u201clike an overcoat, leaving only my mouth and eyes exposed\u201d. The story builds, one eerie detail at a time, towards an apocalyptic conclusion. Here Motoya rides a perfect line between the surface-level weirdness of the story, and its potential latent meaning as an expression of her main character\u2019s desire to live in a world emptied of people. Like the best fables it steps outside reality not to escape it, but to see it better.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Picnic in the Storm is translated by Asa Yoneda and published by Corsair (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "Strange things happen in Yukiko Motoya\u2019s short stories: salarymen get swept skywards, Mary Poppins-like, by their umbrellas; sales assistants help aliens choose the perfect outfit; and women challenge their boyfriends to duels. Like soap bubbles, several of these stories catch your eye, but the instant they are gone you forget about them. It\u2019s when Motoya is on the rocky terrain of collapsing relationships that her strangeness finds the friction it needs to stick. In 2016 Motoya won Japan\u2019s most prestigious literary award, the Akutagawa prize, for the novella that appears here as \u201cAn Exotic Marriage\u201d. It is an ingenious, funny and frightening story in which San and her husband appear to be transforming into one another. \u201cWhenever I\u2019d gotten close to someone in the past,\u201d San thinks, \u201cI\u2019d had the feeling that little by little I was being replaced.\u201d She asks her brother\u2019s girlfriend, Hakone, when she is going to marry. \u201cGetting married,\u201d Hakone replies uncertainly, \u201cthat means swallowing everything about the other person.\u201d In his introduction to a recent anthology of Japanese short stories, Haruki Murakami wondered whether \u201cthe long history of male-centred society in Japan has produced female writers whose gaze possesses a sharper critical spirit\u201d. It\u2019s certainly true that Motoya\u2019s men are nearly all useless: distant and self-absorbed, hunched over iPads or in front of the TV. When San\u2019s husband gets into an argument in the street he makes her deal with it. In the surreal \u201cThe Straw Husband\u201d, Tomoko\u2019s partner (a scarecrow who sheds tiny orchestral instruments when he gets upset, but there isn\u2019t time to get into that here) sulks when she puts a tiny scratch on his new car. \u201cYou let me down,\u201d he mournfully repeats, slumped on the couch. The other standout story is \u201cThe Dogs\u201d, in which a shy, possibly misanthropic artist retreats to a cabin in the woods. She is kept company by a pack of white dogs who surround her at night \u201clike an overcoat, leaving only my mouth and eyes exposed\u201d. The story builds, one eerie detail at a time, towards an apocalyptic conclusion. Here Motoya rides a perfect line between the surface-level weirdness of the story, and its potential latent meaning as an expression of her main character\u2019s desire to live in a world emptied of people. Like the best fables it steps outside reality not to escape it, but to see it better. \u2022 Picnic in the Storm is translated by Asa Yoneda and published by Corsair (\u00a312.99).

Despite the business\u2019s cyclical nature, Alta Gracia workers are employed throughout the year, unlike many garment factories that dispense with their temporary workers for weeks or months at a time. This is far from the grueling conditions many of the 117 workers at Alta Gracia faced when working at BJ&amp;B, the Korean-owned company which produced baseball caps for Nike and Reebok on the same site before closing down in 2007. When Nova helped launch the Alta Gracia factory the idea was to \u201ctest and demonstrate the proposition that you can have a garment factory that treats workers decently and pays a living wage\u201d while also keeping prices \u201creasonable\u201d. Nestled among tropical vegetation in a valley one hour from the bustling port of Santo Domingo, the factory is located in one of the country\u2019s 60 or so free-trade zones, in the town of Villa Altagracia, better known in the 50s and 60s as the hub of the country\u2019s sugar and paper industries.

He assures the Guardian that the company\u2019s growth is now guaranteed for at least \u201cthe next five years\u201d. \u201cI finally feel we have the financial resources to build this brand,\u201d he says. Since the takeover in 2018 by AG Triada and TripleStone Partners, Alta Gracia has signed a distribution agreement with Fanatics, a major online sportswear retailer.

As Alta Gracia\u2019s parent company, Knights Apparel had already laid the foundation for this expansion into the sports world beyond college-logo clothing by teaming up with the Dallas Cowboys, the US\u2019s most valuable sports franchise. Morocco plans to build on Alta Gracia\u2019s solid relationship with more than 400 Barnes &amp; Noble College bookstores, their main distribution platform, and to take things to the next level through online distribution.

The opening two rounds have been relatively open, assisted by a sharp drop in the penalty count as referees look for fewer excuses to blow the whistle.

The six matches have produced 33 tries and 19 penalties and, if that is similar to last year, 32-22, when Italy\u2019s matches are excluded 26-14 plays 16-20. Penalties outnumbered tries every year from 2012 with the exception of 2017 when it was 28-28, but again when the Azzurri were factored out, penalties triumphed \u2013 by 29-9 in 2015, the year the Six Nations was unrepresented in the last four of the World Cup.</p> \n<p>The five matches involving France last year produced 14 tries, two of them penalty tries. Their two this month have yielded 12, including a penalty try. If <em>Les Bleus </em>were all too easily outwitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/feb/10/england-owen-farrell-enforcers-steamroller-france-six-nations-rugby-union\" title=\"\">by England at Twickenham last Sunday</a>, geared up for a long-distance race only to find themselves in a sprint, they had a go against Wales before becoming overcome by the moment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/archive-zip/giv-3902t3FwdqcGfLm7/\" data-alt=\"Penalties\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/archive-zip/giv-3902t3FwdqcGfLm7/\">Penalties</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Sides in possession have a greater licence this year.

A team that was hard to work out last year because it seemed to lack definition, in part because of an injury list that appeared to get longer, is suddenly in sharp focus. Eddie Jones had always maintained the importance of an English approach, based on the set-pieces, mauling and kicking, but he has spiked it with pace. They are playing as they train.</p> \n<p>When England last year ended a run of five successive defeats by winning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/23/south-africa-england-match-report\" title=\"\">final Test against South Africa</a>, George Ford had been replaced by Danny Cipriani at outside-half. When Cipriani\u2019s chip for Jonny May clinched the match, it looked as if he would remain in the squad. Instead, despite Ford starting only the match against Japan since, Cipriani has returned to the wilderness.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Eddie Jones had always maintained the importance of an English approach ... but he has spiked it with pace</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Owen Farrell has taken over at 10 and been given the captaincy. He was one of three survivors last Sunday from Jones\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/06/scotland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">first starting line-up against Scotland</a> in 2016 \u2013 George Kruis and Billy Vunipola were the others. Jones has gradually decommissioned his old guard but Farrell\u2019s influence has been heightened by his moving from centre. If he has been blessed with more ball-carriers than England had a year ago when the likes of Manu Tuilagi and Billy Vunipola were absent, he has a decisiveness England were lacking.</p> \n<p>Jones said the two victories were down to the players rather than the coaches but that was only in the way plays were executed. They were both coaching triumphs and in hindsight the clue to the approach against France could be seen on the bench which for the last three years has contained finishers rather than replacements.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By bringing in the props Ben Moon and Dan Cole and swapping Jack Nowell and Chris Ashton so that the latter was in the starting line-up, Jones was placing emphasis on the start rather than the finish, expecting to be protecting a lead rather than looking to break clear. The assumption was that England would indulge France in an arm-wrestle for an hour before exploiting their perceived relative lack of fitness but they suckered them into guarding the gainline, committing players to rucks and defending high and narrow.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/14/ben-foden-rugby-united-new-york-interview\">Ben Foden: \u2018Anything that\u2019s published about me is never very good\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>They were left kicking themselves as England sought space rather than contact. As in Dublin, it was a masterly execution of the gameplan that put England on the front foot from the off and delivered a bonus point as well as victory. It means their next match, against Wales in Cardiff, is a title decider, but only for Jones\u2019s team. If England win, five points from their next match at home to Italy may land their third championship in four years with a round to spare.</p> \n<p>Wales will come up with a tactic to stop England but they will need more than that if they are to end a run of five successive defeats in the Six Nations to their rivals. So far England have had it pretty much their own way, apart from 10 minutes in Dublin when they were down to 14 men. Wales, who are looking to set a record of 12 consecutive victories, will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/10/warren-gatland-pressure-wales-england-six-nations\" title=\"\">need to make them think rather than feel</a>. Their head coach, Warren Gatland, will have to come up with something. Home advantage and a few defensive ploys will not be enough.</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\" title=\"\">To subscribe just visit this page and follow the instructions</a></strong>.</p>",

With the emphasis this year on continuity rather than a contest for possession teams, led by England, are becoming less reliant on set-pieces and turnovers as vehicles for tries. From 2006 until last year the average number of penalties in a Six Nations match was 21.4, ranging from 18 in 2008 to 24 in 2013 when reset scrums were a bane and some teams used the set-piece to try and wangle a penalty to kick the ball downfield and enjoy an attacking lineout, not least Wales when they secured the title against England on the final day. The average this year is 13.8, a 35% drop. The six matches have produced 33 tries and 19 penalties and, if that is similar to last year, 32-22, when Italy\u2019s matches are excluded 26-14 plays 16-20. Penalties outnumbered tries every year from 2012 with the exception of 2017 when it was 28-28, but again when the Azzurri were factored out, penalties triumphed \u2013 by 29-9 in 2015, the year the Six Nations was unrepresented in the last four of the World Cup. The five matches involving France last year produced 14 tries, two of them penalty tries. Their two this month have yielded 12, including a penalty try. If Les Bleus were all too easily outwitted by England at Twickenham last Sunday, geared up for a long-distance race only to find themselves in a sprint, they had a go against Wales before becoming overcome by the moment. Sides in possession have a greater licence this year. The percentage retention rates are well into the 90s for scrums, lineouts and breakdowns and there is a clear emphasis on speeding up the game. Crooked feeds and throws are connived out and all manner of clear-outs are tolerated. When the Japan coaches spent a week this month watching England train, they said their aim was to achieve a ball-in-play time of 50 minutes in the World Cup. It looks attainable and it is hard to dodge the suspicion that part of the drive to increase the flow of matches has the hosts in mind, given their historic weakness in set-pieces. England have embraced the shift in emphasis. A team that was hard to work out last year because it seemed to lack definition, in part because of an injury list that appeared to get longer, is suddenly in sharp focus. Eddie Jones had always maintained the importance of an English approach, based on the set-pieces, mauling and kicking, but he has spiked it with pace. They are playing as they train. When England last year ended a run of five successive defeats by winning the final Test against South Africa, George Ford had been replaced by Danny Cipriani at outside-half. When Cipriani\u2019s chip for Jonny May clinched the match, it looked as if he would remain in the squad. Instead, despite Ford starting only the match against Japan since, Cipriani has returned to the wilderness. Owen Farrell has taken over at 10 and been given the captaincy. He was one of three survivors last Sunday from Jones\u2019s first starting line-up against Scotland in 2016 \u2013 George Kruis and Billy Vunipola were the others. Jones has gradually decommissioned his old guard but Farrell\u2019s influence has been heightened by his moving from centre. If he has been blessed with more ball-carriers than England had a year ago when the likes of Manu Tuilagi and Billy Vunipola were absent, he has a decisiveness England were lacking. Jones said the two victories were down to the players rather than the coaches but that was only in the way plays were executed. They were both coaching triumphs and in hindsight the clue to the approach against France could be seen on the bench which for the last three years has contained finishers rather than replacements. By bringing in the props Ben Moon and Dan Cole and swapping Jack Nowell and Chris Ashton so that the latter was in the starting line-up, Jones was placing emphasis on the start rather than the finish, expecting to be protecting a lead rather than looking to break clear. The assumption was that England would indulge France in an arm-wrestle for an hour before exploiting their perceived relative lack of fitness but they suckered them into guarding the gainline, committing players to rucks and defending high and narrow. They were left kicking themselves as England sought space rather than contact. As in Dublin, it was a masterly execution of the gameplan that put England on the front foot from the off and delivered a bonus point as well as victory. It means their next match, against Wales in Cardiff, is a title decider, but only for Jones\u2019s team. If England win, five points from their next match at home to Italy may land their third championship in four years with a round to spare. Wales will come up with a tactic to stop England but they will need more than that if they are to end a run of five successive defeats in the Six Nations to their rivals. So far England have had it pretty much their own way, apart from 10 minutes in Dublin when they were down to 14 men. Wales, who are looking to set a record of 12 consecutive victories, will need to make them think rather than feel. Their head coach, Warren Gatland, will have to come up with something. Home advantage and a few defensive ploys will not be enough. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

      "bodyText": "A Briton was among four people stabbed in football-related clashes in central Rome, according to Italian media reports. Fighting broke out shortly after 9pm on Wednesday at a bar in the Monti area before continuing outside. About 40 people were involved in the clashes, which took place before a Europa League match between Lazio and Sevilla at the Olympic Stadium on Thursday night. Two Spanish people and an American were also stabbed, with the Briton and one of the Spaniards in a serious condition at Santo Spirito hospital, Gazzetto dello Sport reported. It is unclear whether the Briton was among the football fans or a tourist who was caught up in the brawl. Police are trying to establish whether Italian football fans known as \u201cultras\u201d had infiltrated the group. Witnesses told the newspaper La Repubblica they saw \u201cdozens of people running around, dressed in black\u201d. \u201cOthers wore helmets and had sticks and belts in their hands. It was as if they were chasing someone,\u201d one said. The fighting began on Via Leonina, which is frequented by tourists and shows live football matches. Some of the fans sought refuge in nearby bars and restaurants. A bar owner told La Repubblica: \u201cIt was quiet and then shortly after 9pm we suddenly heard shouting and the sound of broken glass. \u201cOne of the Spaniards, who had a leg injury, came into our bar. He asked for help, he was scared and upset.\u201d Italy\u2019s ultras tend to be well organised and can be extremely violent. Last year, Daniele De Santis was jailed for 16 years for the murder of a Napoli fan, Ciro Esposito, before the 2014 Italian Cup final against Fiorentina. In November 2012, two Tottenham Hotspur fans were attacked by football hooligans while having a drink at a bar in Rome before a Europa League match against Lazio. Two men were jailed for the attack in 2013.",

The good news is that, though I am more than capable of such a callous feat, I don\u2019t intend to write about this child\u2019s naive zoological error. In fact, this piece isn\u2019t really about the (gorgeous, I\u2019m sure) child. It\u2019s about us. You and me, and the words we use.</p> <p>So let\u2019s repeat it. That sentence, I mean. \u201cDon\u2019t escape, you bad little gorilla!\u201d the child shouted. The words I\u2019d like to focus on in this sentence are the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d. The words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d are nice examples of a simple law of nearly all human languages. They are examples of <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/laws-that-unite-all-human-languages-have-been-seen-in-chimp-communication\" title=\"\">Zipf\u2019s law of abbreviation</a>, where more commonly used words in a language tend to be shorter. It\u2019s thought that this form of information-shortening allows the transmission of more complex information in a shorter amount of time, and it\u2019s why one in four words you and I write or say is likely to be something of the \u201cyou, me, us, the, to\u201d variety.</p> <p>Language. Information. Communications efficiency. So far, so very human, you might argue. But wait. Because you\u2019d be wrong. Because, of course, we humans aren\u2019t the only ones to communicate using such laws of communication. </p> <p>This week, scientists at the University of Roehampton <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2193730-chimp-sign-language-and-human-communication-follow-the-same-rules/\" title=\"\">described their analyses of 58 different types</a> of \u201clet\u2019s play\u201d gestures that chimpanzees give to one another in the wild \u2013 and these gestures also displayed Zipf\u2019s law of abbreviation. The frequently used play gestures were shorter in length than less frequently used gestures. In other words, it turns out that our language law is also their law, to a degree. It\u2019s a shared communications law. Even more wonderful than this, however, is that their play gestures also tick off another human communications law, <a href=\"https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-chinese-language-and-linguistics/menzeraths-law-COM_000161\" title=\"\">Menzerath\u2019s law</a>, which predicts that larger linguistic structures are made up of shorter parts. Chimpanzees manage this, too.</p> <p>For a topical example of a human word that obeys Menzerath\u2019s law, take \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2013 a shortening that has freed up time to get our leave-the-EU negotiations done at top speed. In summary, this week\u2019s scientific discovery means that if chimpanzees had a play-gesture for \u201cBritish exit from the EU\u201d, they would probably stumble across the same time-saving shortening as us. (Whether they would be able to do a better job of negotiating Brexit is, as yet, unknowable, but far from unimaginable.)</p> <p>And so, back to our escaping chimp and the words of that excited toddler watching from the sidelines. As far as one-liners go, I\u2019m happy to admit to you that \u201cyou bad little gorilla!\u201d isn\u2019t quite up there with Charlton Heston screaming, \u201c<em>Y</em><em>ou damn dirty apes!</em>\u201d at a crowd of latex-laden Hollywood extras, but I find that there is a certain delicious irony in its being blurted out by a child, itself learning unconsciously the rules of grammar and word-use that apply to all humans.</p> <p>Deep down, we\u2019re all toddlers, mastering the language bestowed on us by our ancestors. Deep down, we\u2019re all using grammatical rules and communication laws without a moment\u2019s consideration. And, spectacular as it seems, it turns out we\u2019re not the only ones because the chimps are at it, too.</p> <p>And so it seems opportune to finish with four of our simplest human words. They are little words and so, according to Zipf\u2019s law, they are words that really matter. And they now apply to other species as much as to ours: me, you, them, us.</p> <p>\u2022 Jules Howard is a zoologist and the author of Sex on Earth and Death on Earth</p>",

This week, scientists at the University of Roehampton described their analyses of 58 different types of \u201clet\u2019s play\u201d gestures that chimpanzees give to one another in the wild \u2013 and these gestures also displayed Zipf\u2019s law of abbreviation. The frequently used play gestures were shorter in length than less frequently used gestures. In other words, it turns out that our language law is also their law, to a degree. It\u2019s a shared communications law. Even more wonderful than this, however, is that their play gestures also tick off another human communications law, Menzerath\u2019s law, which predicts that larger linguistic structures are made up of shorter parts. Chimpanzees manage this, too. For a topical example of a human word that obeys Menzerath\u2019s law, take \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2013 a shortening that has freed up time to get our leave-the-EU negotiations done at top speed. In summary, this week\u2019s scientific discovery means that if chimpanzees had a play-gesture for \u201cBritish exit from the EU\u201d, they would probably stumble across the same time-saving shortening as us. (Whether they would be able to do a better job of negotiating Brexit is, as yet, unknowable, but far from unimaginable.) And so, back to our escaping chimp and the words of that excited toddler watching from the sidelines. As far as one-liners go, I\u2019m happy to admit to you that \u201cyou bad little gorilla!\u201d isn\u2019t quite up there with Charlton Heston screaming, \u201cYou damn dirty apes!\u201d at a crowd of latex-laden Hollywood extras, but I find that there is a certain delicious irony in its being blurted out by a child, itself learning unconsciously the rules of grammar and word-use that apply to all humans. Deep down, we\u2019re all toddlers, mastering the language bestowed on us by our ancestors. Deep down, we\u2019re all using grammatical rules and communication laws without a moment\u2019s consideration. And, spectacular as it seems, it turns out we\u2019re not the only ones because the chimps are at it, too. And so it seems opportune to finish with four of our simplest human words. They are little words and so, according to Zipf\u2019s law, they are words that really matter. And they now apply to other species as much as to ours: me, you, them, us. \u2022 Jules Howard is a zoologist and the author of Sex on Earth and Death on Earth",

They\u2019ll be looking to see whether parliament is showing consistency. \u201cParliament said we don\u2019t want there to be no deal and that we will sign up to the prime minister\u2019s deal if we are able to get changes to the Irish backstop. \u201cOur European partners will be watching our debate and listening today to see if they get the impression that if they were to make those concessions, parliament would definitely deliver on that agreement.\u201d Fox said MPs had a \u201cduty\u201d to back the prime minister because her withdrawal deal represented the will of the public. \u201cWe need to understand that the public wants us to leave the European Union, but they would prefer us to leave the European Union with a deal. And therefore parliament has got a duty to ensure that we send the correct signals that represent those views of the British people and represent them to those we are negotiating with,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is happening today is about whether we can display to our European partners that the prime minister has the support of the house in continuing to negotiate changes to the Irish backstop. \u201cAnd I think there is a willingness on the part of our European partners to accommodate us, but they will be wanting to see that Britain will be able to deliver if they were willing to compromise on that.\u201d Fox downplayed his department\u2019s failure to roll over EU trade deals with other countries in time for the 29 March Brexit deadline. \u201cOf the 11% of our trade that is covered by the EU free-trade agreements, 20 of those 40 [countries] make up less than point eight of 1% of all our trade.\u201d And he pointed out the best way to ensure trade continued was to back the withdrawal agreement. \u201cWe will get continuity of all of them if we get a deal and a withdrawal agreement agreed with the European Union. There is always a chance that we don\u2019t get them, we are in fact well in advance with some of those biggest ones,\u201d he said.",

He bowled fast in St Lucia and it was a captivating sight for punters and coaches alike.</p> \n<p>Bayliss recalled telling him he was out of the one-day team last year. \u201cHe was a little angry and went into the nets and tried to knock the batter\u2019s head off. And I said to him afterwards: \u2018Mate, that\u2019s it. That is what we want to see from you every single time you bowl.\u2019\u201d Wood delivered in St Lucia and Bayliss was excited but it is by no means certain whether he can do it again and again.</p>",

He is a leader within the team whether he has vice-captain next to his name or not, and they follow him.\u201d We can take it as a known known that Bayliss is desperate to have him on board in this summer\u2019s Ashes campaign. Now for the known unknowns. Bayliss acknowledges that finding a functioning top three remains a problem and it is still no clearer who they should be. So it is possible to plonk Rory Burns and Joe Denly in the category of known unknowns. Glimpse them for half an hour in a Test they do not look out of place \u2013 and they are lumbered with batting when life is most difficult \u2013 but Burns in particular has an all too familiar return after six Tests (he averages 25). Some familiar alternatives were mentioned by Bayliss: Jason Roy and James Vince. \u201cIf those two guys come out and score runs, they\u2019ll be in the mix,\u201d he said. Then someone mentioned Ian Bell \u2013 apparently Michael Vaughan has yo-yoed him back into contention \u2013 and a slightly surprised Bayliss eventually responded, \u201cYou never say never at all.\u201d More positively Mark Wood has graduated into a known unknown. He bowled fast in St Lucia and it was a captivating sight for punters and coaches alike. Bayliss recalled telling him he was out of the one-day team last year. \u201cHe was a little angry and went into the nets and tried to knock the batter\u2019s head off. And I said to him afterwards: \u2018Mate, that\u2019s it. That is what we want to see from you every single time you bowl.\u2019\u201d Wood delivered in St Lucia and Bayliss was excited but it is by no means certain whether he can do it again and again.",

No patriotic conviviality a few years later when he saved a penalty from Geoff Hurst in a broiling League Cup semi-final between Stoke and West Ham. Enjoy a compilation of his top stops, soundtracked by some delicious 1960s lounge jazz. Certainly more appropriate than Sabrina Vaz (us neither) to go with this clip of the last game Banks played before the car crash that effectively ended his career as a top-class goalkeeper, although as you can see in this Channel 4 interview, he declared the loss of his right eye \u201cnot too bad.\u201d Finally \u2026 go on then, here it is. 2) It\u2019s the rugby league World Club Challenge this weekend, as Wigan take on the Sydney Roosters. Here\u2019s the first official edition of the game, when Widnes turned over Canberra in 1989. And regard the time Wigan won it for the third time, a belter against Brisbane in 1994, featuring the British national anthem as played on a toy Stratocaster. The 2010 edition was a bit weird: Melbourne Storm won the game, beating Leeds Rhinos 18-10 (first half, and second here), only for them to be stripped of the title due to financial irregularities, but rather than give the crown to Leeds it was just\u2026left in the ether. 3) Aaron Ramsey is off to Juventus, continuing a brief but proud tradition of Welshman to have donned the Bianconeri jersey. Of course, there was the very good of John Charles, a thoroughbred of a footballer if there ever was one, and the not-so good of Ian \u201cit was like living in a foreign country\u201d Rush. The Liverpool legend certainly looked a little unnerved when he first pitched up at the Stadio Comunale and highlights of his time in Turin were few and far between. Let\u2019s also not forget honorary Welshman Giorgio Chinaglia, who after serving his football apprenticeship at Swansea City returned to his homeland in 1966 where he\u2019s most fondly remembered for a seven-year spell with Lazio. 4) To Serie B, where Salernitana goalkeeper Alessandro Micai elbows Jordan Pickford out of the way and installs himself as the red-hot favourite for the Best Helping Hand of the Season award with this calamity in the 1-0 defeat by Benevento. 5) Tony Romo takes a detour to the hospitality stand on the 15th in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. A bogey at least, right? Nope. A delicate chip to within a couple of feet sets up a birdie. Not bad for a quarterback. 6) Nascar now, and the rather spicy overtaking move from Jimmie Johnson that took out the entire field and allowed Johnson to win the race. \u201cI\u2019m very remorseful,\u201d said Johnson afterwards, protesting a teensy bit too much. \u201cI\u2019m probably more remorseful than any driver in the field when stuff like this happens. I don\u2019t crash people to win races\u2026absolutely I\u2019m remorseful.\u201d Our favourites from below the line last week 1) Parkour madness, right here. 2) Aussie rules, but not as you know it. 3) With them in the FA Cup fifth round, revel in Doncaster\u2019s calamitous 1997-98 season.

      "bodyText": "Germany narrowly avoided falling into recession in the second half of last year as weaker exports dragged Europe\u2019s largest economy to stalling point during the final three months of 2018. The German economy recorded zero growth in the fourth quarter, managing to just avoid a technical recession after reporting a contraction of 0.2% in the third quarter amid a slump in industrial output. Several economists had previously warned that Germany was on the brink of recession because of consecutive monthly declines in factory output, with the country suffering from weaker levels of global demand and disruption at factories. Tensions between the US and China have acted as a handbrake on global goods trade, while growth is slowing in the Chinese economy after years of rapid expansion. Sales of cars in China dropped last year for the first time in almost 30 years, affecting manufacturers across Europe. New vehicle emissions tests introduced after the VW emissions scandal have also caused disruption to factories across Europe, including in Britain. Manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of the Germany economy, about double the size of Britain\u2019s industrial base. Overall growth for 2018 in Germany was 1.5%, marginally above the 1.4% expansion recorded in Britain. Analysts said that domestic demand in the German economy \u2013 predominantly from investment in construction and machinery as well as government spending \u2013 helped it to avoid recession. Growth in consumer spending was, however, subdued, while net exports were a severe drag on headline GDP growth. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said there were some reasons to hope German GDP growth would recover at the start of 2019. \u201cThere may be a further pick-up in auto production as the emissions testing backlog is cleared; and household real incomes should rise due to falling headline inflation,\u201d he said.",

It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own.\u201d Rutte, who also claimed the Dutch would replace the UK in the bloc as the pre-eminent voice for free trade, has been regularly consulted by Theresa May on progress in the Brexit negotiations. The Netherlands is one of the EU member states that will be most affected by the barriers to trade that will emerge after the UK leaves the bloc, although it has been the beneficiary of some relocations by big businesses. Figures released last week by the Dutch investment agency revealed 42 companies had relocated to the Netherlands in 2018, citing Brexit as a reason, resulting in the movement of 1,923 jobs. Asked whether a Brexit deal was likely, Rutte said in an interview with European media outlets, including the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds: \u201cMy impression is that the ball is heading towards the precipice and everyone screams to stop, but nobody does anything to stop it, at least, from the British side.\u201d He said of the Irish backstop, which has proven to be the most contentious of issues, that Brussels had no intention of trying to use it to trap Britain in a customs union with the EU. The backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the whole of the UK would share a customs territory, is to come into force should a future trade deal or alternative arrangement be unable to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Rutte said: \u201cSome British parliamentarians say that we want to trap them in a permanent limbo. But it is not true. The EU is interested in moving to the next phase as soon as possible and starting a new relationship with the United Kingdom. \u201cBut given May\u2019s efforts to renegotiate the Irish safeguard, I do not know how this will end and if we can avoid a hard Brexit. It would be devastating for the UK.\u201d Rutte was speaking after a speech in Zurich on Wednesday, in which he highlighted that the \u201cchaos\u201d of Brexit showed \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as splendid isolation\u201d. UK MPs will debate the next steps in the Brexit talks later on Thursday. Theresa May has asked the Commons to approve a motion that \u201creiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January\u201d. Tory MPs in the Eurosceptic European Research Group, chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg, are threatening to rebel as the Commons had expressed both its support for \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop and for no deal to be avoided. It has been reported that up to 50 Tory MPs could abstain or vote against the motion, delivering another defeat for the prime minister. A Labour amendment is also seeking to force the government to return to parliament by the end of the month to hold a vote on its Brexit plan.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has rebuked the government for abandoning a central plank of its superannuation reforms, as the Coalition confirmed it will pass Greens amendments that continue automatic life insurance cover for young workers. The Coalition\u2019s Protecting Your Super package aims to save workers up to $2.6bn in fees by ending automatic life insurance premiums for workers under 25 and savers with balances under $6,000, while consolidating unwanted duplicate superannuation accounts through the Australian Taxation Office. After the Australian first reported that the government was preparing to do a deal with the Greens, Senator Peter Whish-Wilson confirmed to Guardian Australia the Coalition had approached the party and he is now \u201cconfident\u201d it will support all the Greens\u2019 amendments. The Greens amendments would continue opt-out life insurance cover for young workers and those with low balances, neutering one of the central planks of the original bill but retaining other provisions which consolidate lost savings. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told the Senate on Thursday the Coalition would agree to the Greens\u2019 amendments \u201cto facilitate passage of this bill and allow key measures to come in by 1 July\u201d. Those include capping fees at 3% a year for accounts with balances of less than $6,000 and abolishing exit fees on all super accounts, which Cormann said would be \u201cto the great benefit of all Australians\u201d. \u201cEven if we can\u2019t get 100% of what we want legislated \u2013 we secure the passage of what we can.\u201d Cormann said the Coalition would \u201cseparately seek to pursue\u201d its plan to make life insurance cover opt-in for young workers, a sign it would reintroduce the measure if it gets enough crossbench votes or attempt the measure again after the election. Earlier the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said that \u201cafter months of bluster the Liberals are about to announce a deal with the Greens to gut the centrepiece\u201d of their legislation. \u201cThey said it was vital to protecting young members\u2019 super and now they are junking their own bill!\u201d Labor offered to support the bill subject to amendments to continue opt-out life insurance cover for workers from high-risk industries and provided lost savings were reunited with their member within a month. Whish-Wilson told the Senate that stakeholders who favoured ending automatic life insurance \u2013 such as the Grattan Institute and Productivity Commission \u2013 were well-intentioned but dealt with the average impact of fees on workers. He said the Greens had insisted on opt-out cover to protect vulnerable workers such as young blue-collar workers up ladders on construction sites because \u201cnobody needs insurance until they need it\u201d. Whish-Wilson told Guardian Australia the government had supported the Greens\u2019 amendments on their merits because they were \u201cquite surgical and very precise\u201d and denied horse-trading or making other concessions. Centre Alliance\u2019s Stirling Griff told the Senate the minor party would support the bill but was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the government had taken so long to introduce legislation. The reform was first announced by the former financial services minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer in the 2018 federal budget.",

You might assume therefore that Nick is straight and Jezz is gay; or, if not, that both must be bisexual. But you would be wrong.</p> <p>\u201cI always describe my sexuality as: \u2018If you\u2019ve got nice hair and pretty eyes, I\u2019m down for it,\u2019\u201d explains Jezz, a 26-year-old editor working in historical publishing. \u201cIt\u2019s not that gender doesn\u2019t matter, because it can be important, but it\u2019s a bit of an afterthought. It\u2019s just like: \u2018Oh, hello.\u2019\u201d For a while, she wasn\u2019t sure what to call this, but eight years ago she settled on \u201cpansexual\u201d as the closest word. \u201cIt took me a while to figure it out. [The TV series] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/john-barrowman-torchwood-comic-series-doctor-who-captain-jack-harkness-carole-e\" title=\"\">Torchwood</a> was about the only thing I\u2019d heard of. I was talking about maybe being pansexual and someone said: \u2018Oh, like Captain Jack in Torchwood.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Nick, a 22-year-old physics and philosophy masters student at the University of York, initially thought he was bisexual as a teenager, but also now feels \u201cpansexual\u201d better fits his view that attraction isn\u2019t really about gender. \u201cI just find characteristics generally about people attractive. Pan is simply easier to understand, and much closer to the truth for me. It\u2019s not specific to any gender.\u201d He often explains it, he says, by talking about height: a bi person might find tall guys attractive, and short girls. But he tends to fancy tall people, regardless of whether they are male or female.</p> <p>Last year, \u201cpansexual\u201d briefly became the online dictionary Merriam-Webster\u2019s most searched word of the day after the singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae\" title=\"\">Janelle Mon\u00e1e</a> defined herself as a pansexual and \u201cqueer-ass motherfucker\u201d. The Panic at the Disco frontman Brendan Urie and the singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">Miley Cyrus</a> both also identify as pan, with Urie explaining that, to him, it means: \u201cI really don\u2019t care \u2026 If a person is great, then a person is great. I just like good people, if your heart\u2019s in the right place.\u201d The singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/demi-lovato\" title=\"\">Demi Lovato</a>, meanwhile, identifies as \u201csexually fluid\u201d, or \u201chaving a shifting gender preference\u201d, while other labels for being neither exclusively straight nor gay include \u201cheteroflexible\u201d and \u201cquestioning\u201d.</p> <p>For bisexual activists who have long felt erased from the picture, many of these new identities can sound suspiciously like elaborate ways to avoid the word \u201cbisexual\u201d. But <a href=\"https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com\" title=\"\">Meg-John Barker</a>, psychology lecturer and author of The Psychology of Sex, argues that, while \u201cbisexual\u201d is a useful and widely understood umbrella term for being attracted to more than either gender, labels such as \u201cpansexual\u201d do capture a specific sense that fancying someone isn\u2019t just about gender.

(Evidence is divided on whether women are more sexually fluid than men or just more willing to admit it.) More than a quarter of British 25- to 39-year-olds told YouGov they had had some kind of same-sex experience. But Generation Z are not necessarily having more adventurous sex than anyone else; they are more inclined to what might be called a \u201cnever say never\u201d approach, with a quarter of those identifying as straight saying they couldn\u2019t rule out a gay relationship if the right person came along.</p> <p>\u201cThis suggests that being attracted to more than one gender is becoming a majority, not a minority, position,\u201d says Barker. \u201cBut wider culture is taking a long time to catch up to that fact, still tending to assume that people are either straight or gay, and presenting non-binary attraction as confused, a phase, or somehow suspicious.\u201d The gradual easing of those assumptions, however, has implications for more than one generation.</p> <p>Andrea Hewitt has known since her schooldays that she was attracted to girls. But growing up in the US south in the 1970s, she didn\u2019t dare think too hard about what that meant. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know any gay people until I was an adult. I didn\u2019t understand a lot of the feelings I was having, so I put them on a shelf,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t an option. Nobody spoke of it.\u201d</p> <p>So, she duly got married and had two children; when that marriage broke down, she married again. It was only after her older daughter left for college that she finally plucked up courage to come out as lesbian and ask for a divorce.</p> <p>Hewitt\u2019s children and her wider family were supportive, but it was, she says, an isolating time. \u201cI Googled \u2018coming out\u2019, but it was all geared towards teenagers coming out to their parents, and here I was a 40-year-old woman with two kids. I truly thought I was the only person who had ever done this.\u201d It was only when she started her blog, <a href=\"https://alatelifelesbianstory.com\" title=\"\">A Late Life Lesbian Story</a>, that she realised she was very far from alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e93b5a08a8d502828498f3a6350e41f309268d84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e93b5a08a8d502828498f3a6350e41f309268d84/0_0_500_300/500.png\" alt=\"Elizabeth Gilbert\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bestselling US author Elizabeth Gilbert and her late partner Rayya Elias.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/Elizabeth Gilbert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years ago, the author Elizabeth Gilbert revealed she had left her husband Jose Nunes \u2013 the man she described travelling halfway round the world to meet in her bestseller Eat Pray Love \u2013 for a female friend, Rayya Elias. The British retail expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/mary-portas\" title=\"\">Mary Portas</a> famously fell in love with the fashion writer Melanie Rickey after an amicable divorce from the father of her two children. Hewitt now runs a Facebook group for women coming out in later life with more than 1,100 members worldwide; while some identify as lesbians, others prefer not to define their sexuality or swear they were straight until the moment they fell for a woman. But one common thread, says Hewitt, is having parked their own lives on a back burner while they were raising children. \u201cI\u2019d say a lot of the people in my group have a very similar personality type. We\u2019re mothers, we\u2019re fixers, we\u2019re problem-solvers; we want to focus on everything but ourselves. It isn\u2019t until you have time to do some self-reflection that you go: \u2018Wait a minute, what about me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hewitt, who now lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her partner Rachel, says she cannot be sure that if she had been born two decades later she would have identified as lesbian from the start. But while some of her Facebook group wish they had had the courage to do so years earlier, she cautions against assuming that the marriages of women who come out later must have been a sham all along. \u201cYou can only know what you know when you know it. You can\u2019t go back and judge your past self on thoughts you didn\u2019t have.\u201d</p> <p>Changing social attitudes are clearly enabling some older people to explore feelings repressed for decades. But coming out in middle age does not necessarily imply a life spent in the closet, according to Barker, who points to the US psychologist <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-19851-002\" title=\"\">Lisa Diamond\u2019s landmark study</a> following 79 non-heterosexual women for 10 years. The women originally identified as either lesbian, bisexual or preferring not to put a label on their sexuality. Over time, two-thirds of their sexual identities shifted, and a third changed more than once; overall the most common identity adopted was \u201cunlabelled\u201d, and more women moved towards identifying as bi or unlabelled than away from it.</p> <p>Yet, as Hewitt points out, the idea that sexuality can change across the course of a life is threatening for some. \u201cIf you allow for the possibility that people can change their sexuality, what\u2019s to say your wife couldn\u2019t do that, or you couldn\u2019t?\u201d Some of the later-life lesbians she knows were asked when they were going to \u201cchange back\u201d to being straight, while one of her own friends suggested that perhaps she hadn\u2019t just met the right man yet.</p> <p>And if it is difficult for seemingly straight people to come out as bi, then it is perhaps even more controversial for gay people to do so. If sexuality really is fluid, then it might logically be expected to flow both ways; yet in practice it is not always easy for members of a historically oppressed group to admit to sleeping with the perceived enemy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Part of the reason bisexuality and sexual fluidity are so erased is because they\u2019re seen as muddying the water</p> <footer> <cite>Meg-John Barker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The idea that sexual identity is set in stone has been useful in some ways to the gay community, especially in tackling the offensive idea that homosexuality might somehow be \u201ccured\u201d.

So, what if it isn\u2019t as fixed as we thought?</p> <p>In the US, Diamond\u2019s work has been used by campaigners against same-sex marriage, who argue that it shows some gay people can change their minds \u2013 even though Diamond has stressed the changes she saw were involuntary and sometimes against the women\u2019s wishes.

One of the recurring themes in the book is, she says, people describing going to an LGB group or bar for the first time \u201cand being rejected by the gay and lesbian people they met because they \u2018weren\u2019t really queer\u2019 or \u2018hadn\u2019t made a choice yet\u2019 or because they were seen as innately faithful and untrustworthy. Imagine finally getting up the courage to go to a place you think will accept you and instead experiencing hostility or scorn, or disbelief that your sexuality even exists. It\u2019s no wonder bi people have worse mental health than any other orientation.\u201d</p> <p>Bisexual people are also less likely than gay ones to be out at work, which Harrad argues is not surprising: \u201cBisexuality is heavily associated with explicit sexuality, for a lot of people even more than gayness is. So people feel entitled to ask weirdly intrusive questions, like how many people you\u2019re sleeping with, or to assume that you\u2019re interested in them sexually.\u201d</p> <p>That may go double for pansexuals. As Palmer puts it, there is often a knee-jerk assumption that they are all out swinging from chandeliers when \u201chalf the time you\u2019re spending Saturday nights watching documentaries in your pyjamas\u201d. When bi or pan people settle into long-term relationships, that can prompt hurtful assumptions that they have either finally \u201cpicked a side\u201d or else may secretly hanker after whichever gender they are not currently with. \u201cThere\u2019s this whole thing coming from the LGBT community: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re dating a girl, you must be gay,\u2019\u201d says Palmer. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also had a partner\u2019s parents saying: \u2018Aren\u2019t you scared Jezz is going to run off with a man?\u2019 as if you\u2019re always wanting what you can\u2019t have, when it doesn\u2019t really feel that way.\u201d</p> <p>Yet as Generation Z grow older, and become the dominant cultural influence, their belief that, as Meadowcroft-Lunn puts it, \u201cpeople have the right to identify however they choose\u201d is only likely to become more mainstream. Could we eventually reach a point where heterosexuality, or at least the uncompromising version at one end of the Kinsey scale, is no longer considered the norm and \u201ccoming out\u201d as anything else is practically superfluous? \u201cIt\u2019s still true that over 90% of the country identifies as straight, so I don\u2019t want to overstate this,\u201d says Harrad. \u201cIt\u2019s more that awareness-raising is a virtuous circle - the more you know about minority sexualities and the more people you meet who identify as one of them, the less it feels like a big deal. And in an ideal world, why wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nick Meadowcroft-Lunn has a girlfriend, whom he has been seeing for three years. Jezz Palmer has a girlfriend, too, and they have been together for five. You might assume therefore that Nick is straight and Jezz is gay; or, if not, that both must be bisexual. But you would be wrong. \u201cI always describe my sexuality as: \u2018If you\u2019ve got nice hair and pretty eyes, I\u2019m down for it,\u2019\u201d explains Jezz, a 26-year-old editor working in historical publishing. \u201cIt\u2019s not that gender doesn\u2019t matter, because it can be important, but it\u2019s a bit of an afterthought. It\u2019s just like: \u2018Oh, hello.\u2019\u201d For a while, she wasn\u2019t sure what to call this, but eight years ago she settled on \u201cpansexual\u201d as the closest word. \u201cIt took me a while to figure it out. [The TV series] Torchwood was about the only thing I\u2019d heard of. I was talking about maybe being pansexual and someone said: \u2018Oh, like Captain Jack in Torchwood.\u2019\u201d Nick, a 22-year-old physics and philosophy masters student at the University of York, initially thought he was bisexual as a teenager, but also now feels \u201cpansexual\u201d better fits his view that attraction isn\u2019t really about gender. \u201cI just find characteristics generally about people attractive. Pan is simply easier to understand, and much closer to the truth for me. It\u2019s not specific to any gender.\u201d He often explains it, he says, by talking about height: a bi person might find tall guys attractive, and short girls. But he tends to fancy tall people, regardless of whether they are male or female. Last year, \u201cpansexual\u201d briefly became the online dictionary Merriam-Webster\u2019s most searched word of the day after the singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e defined herself as a pansexual and \u201cqueer-ass motherfucker\u201d. The Panic at the Disco frontman Brendan Urie and the singer Miley Cyrus both also identify as pan, with Urie explaining that, to him, it means: \u201cI really don\u2019t care \u2026 If a person is great, then a person is great. I just like good people, if your heart\u2019s in the right place.\u201d The singer Demi Lovato, meanwhile, identifies as \u201csexually fluid\u201d, or \u201chaving a shifting gender preference\u201d, while other labels for being neither exclusively straight nor gay include \u201cheteroflexible\u201d and \u201cquestioning\u201d. For bisexual activists who have long felt erased from the picture, many of these new identities can sound suspiciously like elaborate ways to avoid the word \u201cbisexual\u201d. But Meg-John Barker, psychology lecturer and author of The Psychology of Sex, argues that, while \u201cbisexual\u201d is a useful and widely understood umbrella term for being attracted to more than either gender, labels such as \u201cpansexual\u201d do capture a specific sense that fancying someone isn\u2019t just about gender. And if all this seems confusing, the all-purpose \u201cqueer\u201d is increasingly used to mean anything other than plain-vanilla 100% straight, a visibly expanding category. When YouGov asked people to place themselves on a sliding scale where zero equals exclusively straight and six equals exclusively gay, more than a quarter of Britons polled identified as something other than 100% heterosexual. But strikingly, 54% of people aged 18 to 24 did. That arguably makes them the most sexually liberated, least socially repressed group of adults in British history. Baby boomers saw homosexuality decriminalised, if not destigmatised. Their children grew up with Brookside\u2019s celebrated lesbian kiss and the scrapping of Section 28. But it is their grandchildren who have grown up taking the idea of gay rights almost for granted. \u201cThe working assumption is that\u2019s because we have progressed as a society in the last 30 years. We\u2019ve become much more accepting and that\u2019s allowed people to explore their sexuality,\u201d says Paul Twycock of the LGBT rights group Stonewall. And yet, for all that, heterosexuality is hardly dead yet. According to the Office for National Statistics, 93.2% of Britons still call themselves heterosexual, although that figure is down slightly from 94.4% in 2012. So how did YouGov get its headline-grabbing figures? It changed the question, which turns out to change the answer significantly. It is well over half a century since Alfred Kinsey, who was himself bisexual, published his conclusion: \u201cMales do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual \u2026 The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats.\u201d His successors are still arguing over whether the godfather of research into human sexuality was broadly right to describe it as a sliding scale with numerous stopping points along the way, or whether that is overly simplistic. But in popularising the idea that same-sex attraction was far more common than acknowledged, Kinsey\u2019s work was a landmark moment for gay rights nonetheless. When YouGov asked its respondents whether they were straight, gay, bisexual or something else, 89% identified as heterosexual and 6% as gay. But when asked to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, that fell to 72% straight and 4% gay. The more choices people are given, the more shades of grey they acknowledge. But does that mean heterosexuality is genuinely rarer than we think, or is sexuality more multifaceted than was previously accepted? According to one US study, half of male college students and eight out of 10 female ones have fantasised about someone of the same sex. (Evidence is divided on whether women are more sexually fluid than men or just more willing to admit it.) More than a quarter of British 25- to 39-year-olds told YouGov they had had some kind of same-sex experience. But Generation Z are not necessarily having more adventurous sex than anyone else; they are more inclined to what might be called a \u201cnever say never\u201d approach, with a quarter of those identifying as straight saying they couldn\u2019t rule out a gay relationship if the right person came along. \u201cThis suggests that being attracted to more than one gender is becoming a majority, not a minority, position,\u201d says Barker. \u201cBut wider culture is taking a long time to catch up to that fact, still tending to assume that people are either straight or gay, and presenting non-binary attraction as confused, a phase, or somehow suspicious.\u201d The gradual easing of those assumptions, however, has implications for more than one generation. Andrea Hewitt has known since her schooldays that she was attracted to girls. But growing up in the US south in the 1970s, she didn\u2019t dare think too hard about what that meant. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know any gay people until I was an adult.

Nobody spoke of it.\u201d So, she duly got married and had two children; when that marriage broke down, she married again. It was only after her older daughter left for college that she finally plucked up courage to come out as lesbian and ask for a divorce. Hewitt\u2019s children and her wider family were supportive, but it was, she says, an isolating time. \u201cI Googled \u2018coming out\u2019, but it was all geared towards teenagers coming out to their parents, and here I was a 40-year-old woman with two kids. I truly thought I was the only person who had ever done this.\u201d It was only when she started her blog, A Late Life Lesbian Story, that she realised she was very far from alone. Two years ago, the author Elizabeth Gilbert revealed she had left her husband Jose Nunes \u2013 the man she described travelling halfway round the world to meet in her bestseller Eat Pray Love \u2013 for a female friend, Rayya Elias. The British retail expert Mary Portas famously fell in love with the fashion writer Melanie Rickey after an amicable divorce from the father of her two children. Hewitt now runs a Facebook group for women coming out in later life with more than 1,100 members worldwide; while some identify as lesbians, others prefer not to define their sexuality or swear they were straight until the moment they fell for a woman. But one common thread, says Hewitt, is having parked their own lives on a back burner while they were raising children. \u201cI\u2019d say a lot of the people in my group have a very similar personality type.

Over time, two-thirds of their sexual identities shifted, and a third changed more than once; overall the most common identity adopted was \u201cunlabelled\u201d, and more women moved towards identifying as bi or unlabelled than away from it. Yet, as Hewitt points out, the idea that sexuality can change across the course of a life is threatening for some. \u201cIf you allow for the possibility that people can change their sexuality, what\u2019s to say your wife couldn\u2019t do that, or you couldn\u2019t?\u201d Some of the later-life lesbians she knows were asked when they were going to \u201cchange back\u201d to being straight, while one of her own friends suggested that perhaps she hadn\u2019t just met the right man yet. And if it is difficult for seemingly straight people to come out as bi, then it is perhaps even more controversial for gay people to do so. If sexuality really is fluid, then it might logically be expected to flow both ways; yet in practice it is not always easy for members of a historically oppressed group to admit to sleeping with the perceived enemy.

But the pressure to argue for gay rights on the grounds of fixed identities has, Barker argues, led to some inconvenient truths being swept under the carpet. \u201cPart of the reason bisexuality and sexual fluidity are so erased and rejected is because they\u2019re seen as muddying the water.\u201d When Antoni Porowski of the TV show Queer Eye, which involves a panel of gay men making over a generally hapless straight one, came out as sexually fluid, he was accused on social media of being a traitor and a fake, despite having been with his boyfriend for seven years. Kate Harrad is a bi activist and editor of Purple Prose: Bisexuality in Britain, a collection of essays exploring all forms of bisexuality. One of the recurring themes in the book is, she says, people describing going to an LGB group or bar for the first time \u201cand being rejected by the gay and lesbian people they met because they \u2018weren\u2019t really queer\u2019 or \u2018hadn\u2019t made a choice yet\u2019 or because they were seen as innately faithful and untrustworthy.

As Palmer puts it, there is often a knee-jerk assumption that they are all out swinging from chandeliers when \u201chalf the time you\u2019re spending Saturday nights watching documentaries in your pyjamas\u201d. When bi or pan people settle into long-term relationships, that can prompt hurtful assumptions that they have either finally \u201cpicked a side\u201d or else may secretly hanker after whichever gender they are not currently with. \u201cThere\u2019s this whole thing coming from the LGBT community: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re dating a girl, you must be gay,\u2019\u201d says Palmer. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also had a partner\u2019s parents saying: \u2018Aren\u2019t you scared Jezz is going to run off with a man?\u2019 as if you\u2019re always wanting what you can\u2019t have, when it doesn\u2019t really feel that way.\u201d Yet as Generation Z grow older, and become the dominant cultural influence, their belief that, as Meadowcroft-Lunn puts it, \u201cpeople have the right to identify however they choose\u201d is only likely to become more mainstream. Could we eventually reach a point where heterosexuality, or at least the uncompromising version at one end of the Kinsey scale, is no longer considered the norm and \u201ccoming out\u201d as anything else is practically superfluous? \u201cIt\u2019s still true that over 90% of the country identifies as straight, so I don\u2019t want to overstate this,\u201d says Harrad. \u201cIt\u2019s more that awareness-raising is a virtuous circle - the more you know about minority sexualities and the more people you meet who identify as one of them, the less it feels like a big deal. And in an ideal world, why wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Are there secret desires that both endanger family life and make it survivable? Do we long to escape our children? To have sex with strangers at will? The Franco-Moroccan novelist Le\u00efla Slimani\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/10/lullaby-leila-slimani-review\" title=\"\"><em>Lullaby</em></a> won the Prix Goncourt in 2016 and swiftly became a bestseller here last year. That tale of a murderous nanny, exposing the fetid emotional growths fouling the bourgeois home, was Slimani\u2019s second novelistic investigation of forbidden desires. Now <em>Ad\u00e8le</em>, the novel she wrote before that breakthrough success, has been translated into English by Sam Taylor.</p> <p>When we first meet Ad\u00e8le, she\u2019s leaving the house before her husband and son wake up, looking for sex on the way to work. \u201cAd\u00e8le has been good,\u201d the opening proclaims, but now \u201cshe wants to be devoured, sucked, swallowed whole.\u201d For several years, she\u2019s combined a sexless marriage to Richard with a closet life as a sex addict, seducing almost all the men she meets. The situation becomes unsustainable when her husband is injured in a road accident, depriving Ad\u00e8le of freedom because she has to look after him.</p> <p>Slimani\u2019s novels are hard to categorise. They combine the pace of the thriller with the flatness of tone that we might associate with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/04/vanquished-white-male-houellebecqs-new-novel-eerily-predicts-french-discontent\" title=\"\">Michel Houellebecq</a>, or indeed with Camus and Robbe-Grillet. Like those writers, Slimani is drawn to revealing the hellishness of the ordinary and the ordinariness of hell. But this isn\u2019t social satire or commentary. Class and race matter \u2013 in <em>Lullaby</em> the employer was of north African descent and the nanny white; here Richard is upper class, Ad\u00e8le working class \u2013 but these aren\u2019t novels hustling for social change or even pushing us to be more honest about the falsity of bourgeois life. They are too story-driven for that. Ad\u00e8le is rarely likable, but the narrative is on her side, breathless in its fears that sex won\u2019t be available (\u201cShe hates the idea that her beauty will be wasted, that her good mood will be for nothing\u201d) or that exposure will follow.</p> <p>In many ways, Ad\u00e8le is a modern-day Madame Bovary, but the book itself has less in common with Flaubert than with the sensation novels that Emma Bovary reads addictively. Slimani is trying to shock, arouse and titillate us with extreme mental states. Addiction makes a good subject for her because Ad\u00e8le\u2019s desire to live a fantasised version of her own life seems to mirror Slimani\u2019s desire to write sleek, fantastical prose, not quite committing to building a three-dimensional world. Like Flaubert, though, she empathises with her character, even at her silliest (Ad\u00e8le falls asleep with her face in an ashtray), and occasionally we feel something like Flaubert\u2019s interest in the nuances of Ad\u00e8le\u2019s mind. She likes to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/22/milan-kundera-immortality-jonathan-coe-novels-women\" title=\"\">Kundera</a>, and there\u2019s a quote from him in the epigraph: his definition of vertigo not as the fear of falling but as \u201cthe desire to fall \u2026 the intoxication of the weak\u201d. Slimani seems interested in delineating this intoxication.</p> <p>In <em>Lullaby</em>, the question driving the book is not only whether the mother Myriam will find a way to survive bourgeois life without feeding off the weakness of another woman, but whether the nanny will give in to her own weakness, abdicating responsibility for keeping her charges alive. Here there\u2019s the question of whether Ad\u00e8le will allow her addiction to take over her life, destroying her love for her son. Both books are very good at showing that there can be a kind of gleeful pleasure in overcoming your fears by living them out, losing the things you are most desperate to hold on to. \u201cWanting to is the same as giving in,\u201d Ad\u00e8le thinks, \u201cthe dam has been breached.

The demonstrations, the culmination of months of anti-corruption protests over the fate of almost $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) in missing funds earmarked for social development \u2013 delivered via a controversial deal for Venezuelan petrol \u2013 have swelled in recent days under the slogan: \u201cKot k\u00f2b Petrocaribe a?\u201d (\u201cWhere\u2019s the Petrocaribe money?\u201d). The protests have all but emptied streets normally clogged with traffic and pollution as schools, shops and municipal offices closed for fear of more violence. With at least four people dead, an air of uncertainty is hanging over the government of Jovenel Moise, with demonstrators demanding the president stand down. Describing the escape from the prison in Aquin, a police official said the prisoners had initially left their cells for a scheduled shower but refused to return before fleeing when police were distracted by a nearby demonstration. The discontent has been driven by a long-running scandal over the fate of money from a deal that first emerged in a government report in 2017, in which it was suggested large sums had been embezzled by officials during the course of the Petrocaribe deal. Amid major protests in the centre of Port-au-Prince, a city that was devastated by the 2010 earthquake, protesters in the wealthy P\u00e9tion-Ville neighbourhood have blocked the road to Moise\u2019s house and stoned his property. The Petrocaribe deal has become a lightning rod for wider discontents that have bubbled under the surface since the January 2010 earthquake that killed more than 100,000 people. Despite a large international aid effort, Haiti remains the Americas most impoverished country and was again hit by disaster in 2016, when Hurricane Matthew struck. According to the World Bank, about 59% of Haiti\u2019s population live below the national poverty line of $2.41 a day, while the estimated 24% living in extreme poverty on less than $1.23 a day now face rocketing inflation. In this context, the Petrocaribe deal, signed before the earthquake, was sold as a possible solution to Haiti\u2019s desperate finances. Under the terms of the deal, signed in the middle of the last decade despite US efforts to prevent it, the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez government in Caracas sold Haiti heavily discounted oil as part of Venezuela\u2019s efforts to win allies in the region, supposedly freeing up funds for much needed social development. The arrangement offered Haiti fuel at a downpayment of just 60% of the purchase price, with the rest of the cost spread at very low terms of interest over 25 years. The deal led to Haiti building up billions in debt to Venezuela. Because of Venezuela\u2019s own political and economic crisis, which escalated under Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor Nicolas Maduro, the deal began winding down last year even as it emerged that billions were unaccounted for, pushing Moise\u2019s government to attempt to end fuel subsidies \u2013 a move reversed amid widespread discontent. \u201cWhat we are enduring today is because of Jovenel [Moise] \u2026 they are hungry,\u201d said Joseph, whose stock of fish was totally depleted by looters during a recent demonstration. \u201cWe don\u2019t have good leaders: if there was work in the country, this would never have happened.\u201d For his part, Moise has insisted on his commitment to rooting out corruption.

      "body": "<p>In August 2009, after two-and-a-half years of trying, the Tribune Company <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tribune-sell-cubs-wrigley-field-ricketts-family/story?id=8387004\">finally sold the Chicago Cubs to the Ricketts family.</a> The Ricketts made their money in the investment world, with patriarch Joe founding Omaha-based broker TD Ameritrade in 1971. Joe\u2019s son, Tom, would become the public face of the Cubs, the most famous losers in US sports.</p> <p>The fact that the Cubs even <em>had</em> a public face was a bizarre feeling for fans like me, but there was plenty of reason for optimism. Tom Ricketts wasn\u2019t just going to be another billionaire corporate owner. He was more than that: he was a fan. He and his brother Pete lived in an apartment across the street from Wrigley during the 1984 season, when the team reached the playoffs for the first time in four decades, and he even met his wife in the bleachers at a game. He understood the team\u2019s history, he respected the traditions, and he believed that under his family\u2019s leadership, the team could shed its reputation as \u201clovable losers\u201d.</p> <p>He was right, though it would take some time. The team took fifth place in the NL Central five seasons in a row to start the family\u2019s tenure, but they were putting the pieces in place for future success. Prior to the 2012 season, the team brought on former Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein to serve as president and Jed Hoyer of the San Diego Padres as the team\u2019s new GM. The pair made several canny trades and, in just the seventh season under the new ownership, the Cubs broke their 108-year World Series drought, beating the Cleveland Indians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/03/world-series-game-7-chicago-cubs-cleveland-indians-mlb\">in a thrilling seven-game set</a>.</p> <p>But as the glow of a World Series win faded over the past two seasons, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that not all change has been for the better. The no-frills experience of a day at Wrigley, free from loud walk-up music and LED scoreboards, is mostly a thing of the past. Now, star first baseman Anthony Rizzo regularly takes the plate to the tune of Taylor Swift\u2019s Bad Blood while ads scroll on recently-installed screens in both left and right field. Rooftops across the street from the stadium were once seen as a cheeky way for fans to catch an unauthorized glimpse of the action, eventually evolving into businesses of their own, <a href=\"https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2016/1/14/10767310/ricketts-family-wrigley-rooftops\">but are now mostly under the control of the Ricketts family itself</a>. The bullpens were moved off the field and out of sight, and much of the obscure mish-mash of businesses that made up surrounding Wrigleyville were shuttered and replaced with hotels and office buildings, rising like some sort of suburban phoenix from the dingy ashes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2147223c8403660346b7b3e04f2310be791f70a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2147223c8403660346b7b3e04f2310be791f70a5/0_8_5142_3085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wrigley Rooftops \u2013 that let fans watch Cubs games from nearby houses \u2013 have lent gameday a unique atmosphere\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wrigley Rooftops \u2013 that let fans watch Cubs games from nearby houses \u2013 have lent gameday a unique atmosphere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Chicago Tribune, Blair Kamin <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kamin/ct-met-flyover-urban-design-kamin-0405-story.html\">explained the trouble with these new structures</a>, writing, \u201cWrigley once rose majestically, like a medieval cathedral, above the humble jumble of three-flats and stores that rimmed it. This contrast, an essential part of the ballpark\u2019s beauty, is now compromised by the cumulative impact of the new buildings around it.\u201d \u201cRIP Wrigleyville,\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/ricketts-cubs-wrigley-field-world-series-trump/Content?oid=26115753\">wrote Ryan Smith of the Chicago Reader</a>. \u201cWelcome to Rickettsville.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s something a bit disconcerting about what\u2019s happened with the players, as well. Prior to the 2012 season, shortstop Starlin Castro <a href=\"https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/01/06/sources-cubs-starlin-castro-accused-of-sexual-assault/\">was accused of sexual assault</a>. Two years later, he was <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/12083909/starlin-castro-chicago-cubs-questioned-shooting\">questioned by police</a> in the Dominican Republic about two separate shootings. During the 2016 World Series run, the Cubs traded for flame-throwing closer Aroldis Chapman to shore up the team\u2019s bullpen. <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-aroldis-chapman-suspended-30-games/c-165860226\">Chapman began the 2016 season suspended</a> after allegedly choking his girlfriend and firing several shots in the garage of his Florida home (Chapman and Castro were not charged over any of the incidents). During the 2018 season, the team acquired second baseman Daniel Murphy, a man who once said, \u201cI do disagree with the fact that [MLB Ambassador for Inclusion Billy Bean] is a homosexual.\u201d Given Wrigley\u2019s proximity to Boystown, <a href=\"https://www.choosechicago.com/neighborhoods/north/boystown/\">one of the largest LGBTQ communities in the country</a>, Murphy\u2019s acquisition just days before the Cubs\u2019 annual \u201c<a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2018/08/22/cubs-debut-daniel-murphy-who-disagrees-with-gay-lifestyle-days-before-lgbtq-out-at-wrigley-event/\">Out at Wrigley</a>\u201d LGBTQ Pride event left some fans with a bad taste in their mouths. Shortstop Addison Russell will begin the 2019 season finishing up the final 28 games of a 40 game suspension <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/chicago-cubs-addison-russell-spring-training-distraction-2019/\">after allegedly physically and mentally abusing</a> his ex-wife.</p> <p>At a certain point, it\u2019s worth Cubs fans asking ourselves whether the Ricketts purchase was a deal with the devil. Yes, they turned the team into perennial contenders \u2014 but in doing so, haven\u2019t shied away from players with murky histories. Yes, they made much needed renovations to the stadium, which as recently as 2004 <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/g00/news/ct-xpm-2004-07-18-0407180256-story.html?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&amp;i10c.dv=2\">was literally falling apart</a> \u2013 but in doing so, wiped away so much of its low-tech charm. Yes, they gave fans names and faces to put to the team\u2019s ownership \u2013 but in doing so, made it that much harder for fans to compartmentalize the business and the baseball, especially given the Ricketts family\u2019s massive presence in the world of politics (Joe Ricketts has donated <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cmte=C00574533&amp;cycle=2016\">millions of dollars to conservative political action committees</a>, Pete Ricketts is the Republican governor of Nebraska, and Todd Ricketts is the current finance chairman of the Republican National Committee), making it extremely fitting that it was just days after the team\u2019s World Series win that Donald Trump was elected president.</p> <p>Recently, a trove of racist emails sent by Joe Ricketts \u2013 who is not involved in the day to day running of the club \u2013<a href=\"https://splinternews.com/here-are-the-racist-conspiracy-emails-rotting-right-win-1831199766?utm_medium=sharefromsite&amp;utm_source=splinter_twitter&amp;utm_campaign=sharebar\"> were published by Splinter</a>, putting ownership into damage control mode. To top it off, the team\u2019s proposed TV network, set to debut in 2020, <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/unavoidable-organization-with-amoral-right-wing-ownersh-1832601199\">will pair them</a> with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo\">controversial conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting</a>, meaning that Cubs fans will no longer be able to \u201ccatch it all on <a href=\"https://cubbiescrib.com/2018/08/30/chicago-cubs-cubs-paving-own-way-television-2020-season/\">WGN</a>,\u201d as the line in Steve Goodman\u2019s 1984 team victory anthem \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko58baUVstE\">Go Cubs Go</a>\u201d says. The Ricketts-ification of the Cubs will soon be complete, for better or for worse.</p> <p>Like a lot of change in life, it\u2019s hard to definitively say whether everything that\u2019s happened to the Cubs over the past decade or so is good or bad. Whether it\u2019s a new morning routine or a new job, change is rarely simple, but the truth is that nothing ever stays exactly the same. My own conflicted thoughts about the Cubs under Ricketts\u2019 ownership probably have less to do with a love of baseline bullpens or some sort of attachment to the McDonald\u2019s that\u2019s been replaced by a hotel. In reflection, I think that a large part of my discomfort comes from a sense that baseball, this great game that\u2019s retained so many of its traditions over the many decades, is not some exception to the rule of change. At its core, the pain a sports fan feel when his team is knocked out of the playoffs, the sadness someone feels as her favorite player hangs up the spikes for the final time \u2014 I believe those emotions are about change more than anything else. As a person, as a Cubs fan, I\u2019m doing my best to embrace those feelings of conflict.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In August 2009, after two-and-a-half years of trying, the Tribune Company finally sold the Chicago Cubs to the Ricketts family. The Ricketts made their money in the investment world, with patriarch Joe founding Omaha-based broker TD Ameritrade in 1971. Joe\u2019s son, Tom, would become the public face of the Cubs, the most famous losers in US sports. The fact that the Cubs even had a public face was a bizarre feeling for fans like me, but there was plenty of reason for optimism. Tom Ricketts wasn\u2019t just going to be another billionaire corporate owner. He was more than that: he was a fan. He and his brother Pete lived in an apartment across the street from Wrigley during the 1984 season, when the team reached the playoffs for the first time in four decades, and he even met his wife in the bleachers at a game. He understood the team\u2019s history, he respected the traditions, and he believed that under his family\u2019s leadership, the team could shed its reputation as \u201clovable losers\u201d. He was right, though it would take some time. The team took fifth place in the NL Central five seasons in a row to start the family\u2019s tenure, but they were putting the pieces in place for future success. Prior to the 2012 season, the team brought on former Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein to serve as president and Jed Hoyer of the San Diego Padres as the team\u2019s new GM. The pair made several canny trades and, in just the seventh season under the new ownership, the Cubs broke their 108-year World Series drought, beating the Cleveland Indians in a thrilling seven-game set. But as the glow of a World Series win faded over the past two seasons, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that not all change has been for the better. The no-frills experience of a day at Wrigley, free from loud walk-up music and LED scoreboards, is mostly a thing of the past. Now, star first baseman Anthony Rizzo regularly takes the plate to the tune of Taylor Swift\u2019s Bad Blood while ads scroll on recently-installed screens in both left and right field. Rooftops across the street from the stadium were once seen as a cheeky way for fans to catch an unauthorized glimpse of the action, eventually evolving into businesses of their own, but are now mostly under the control of the Ricketts family itself. The bullpens were moved off the field and out of sight, and much of the obscure mish-mash of businesses that made up surrounding Wrigleyville were shuttered and replaced with hotels and office buildings, rising like some sort of suburban phoenix from the dingy ashes. At the Chicago Tribune, Blair Kamin explained the trouble with these new structures, writing, \u201cWrigley once rose majestically, like a medieval cathedral, above the humble jumble of three-flats and stores that rimmed it. This contrast, an essential part of the ballpark\u2019s beauty, is now compromised by the cumulative impact of the new buildings around it.\u201d \u201cRIP Wrigleyville,\u2019 wrote Ryan Smith of the Chicago Reader. \u201cWelcome to Rickettsville.\u201d There\u2019s something a bit disconcerting about what\u2019s happened with the players, as well. Prior to the 2012 season, shortstop Starlin Castro was accused of sexual assault. Two years later, he was questioned by police in the Dominican Republic about two separate shootings. During the 2016 World Series run, the Cubs traded for flame-throwing closer Aroldis Chapman to shore up the team\u2019s bullpen. Chapman began the 2016 season suspended after allegedly choking his girlfriend and firing several shots in the garage of his Florida home (Chapman and Castro were not charged over any of the incidents). During the 2018 season, the team acquired second baseman Daniel Murphy, a man who once said, \u201cI do disagree with the fact that [MLB Ambassador for Inclusion Billy Bean] is a homosexual.\u201d Given Wrigley\u2019s proximity to Boystown, one of the largest LGBTQ communities in the country, Murphy\u2019s acquisition just days before the Cubs\u2019 annual \u201cOut at Wrigley\u201d LGBTQ Pride event left some fans with a bad taste in their mouths. Shortstop Addison Russell will begin the 2019 season finishing up the final 28 games of a 40 game suspension after allegedly physically and mentally abusing his ex-wife. At a certain point, it\u2019s worth Cubs fans asking ourselves whether the Ricketts purchase was a deal with the devil. Yes, they turned the team into perennial contenders \u2014 but in doing so, haven\u2019t shied away from players with murky histories. Yes, they made much needed renovations to the stadium, which as recently as 2004 was literally falling apart \u2013 but in doing so, wiped away so much of its low-tech charm. Yes, they gave fans names and faces to put to the team\u2019s ownership \u2013 but in doing so, made it that much harder for fans to compartmentalize the business and the baseball, especially given the Ricketts family\u2019s massive presence in the world of politics (Joe Ricketts has donated millions of dollars to conservative political action committees, Pete Ricketts is the Republican governor of Nebraska, and Todd Ricketts is the current finance chairman of the Republican National Committee), making it extremely fitting that it was just days after the team\u2019s World Series win that Donald Trump was elected president. Recently, a trove of racist emails sent by Joe Ricketts \u2013 who is not involved in the day to day running of the club \u2013 were published by Splinter, putting ownership into damage control mode. To top it off, the team\u2019s proposed TV network, set to debut in 2020, will pair them with controversial conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting, meaning that Cubs fans will no longer be able to \u201ccatch it all on WGN,\u201d as the line in Steve Goodman\u2019s 1984 team victory anthem \u201cGo Cubs Go\u201d says. The Ricketts-ification of the Cubs will soon be complete, for better or for worse. Like a lot of change in life, it\u2019s hard to definitively say whether everything that\u2019s happened to the Cubs over the past decade or so is good or bad. Whether it\u2019s a new morning routine or a new job, change is rarely simple, but the truth is that nothing ever stays exactly the same. My own conflicted thoughts about the Cubs under Ricketts\u2019 ownership probably have less to do with a love of baseline bullpens or some sort of attachment to the McDonald\u2019s that\u2019s been replaced by a hotel. In reflection, I think that a large part of my discomfort comes from a sense that baseball, this great game that\u2019s retained so many of its traditions over the many decades, is not some exception to the rule of change. At its core, the pain a sports fan feel when his team is knocked out of the playoffs, the sadness someone feels as her favorite player hangs up the spikes for the final time \u2014 I believe those emotions are about change more than anything else. As a person, as a Cubs fan, I\u2019m doing my best to embrace those feelings of conflict.",

How on earth can the prime minister say she has confidence in the transport secretary?\u201d </p> <p>May defended Grayling by saying he is delivering the \u201cbiggest rail investment programme since the Victorian era\u201d before noting there were Brexit questions that Corbyn had avoided asking. </p> <p>She said MPs did not know if Corbyn backs a second referendum, backs a deal or backs Brexit. </p> <p>The PM went on: \u201cHe prefers ambiguity and playing politics to acting in the national interest.

Having posed a tough question on a topic, and received a brush off, more often than not he tends to move on to something else rather than persist. But today he went micro, rather than wide-lens, and it was a success. When the topic of the Seaborne Freight contract came up in the first question, Theresa May seemed so keen to avoid addressing it that she started reminiscing about the 1966 World Cup (the first times she has ever expressed an interest in football at the dispatch box?) before responding with the most cursory response imaginable. Corbyn kept banging away at this for the next five questions, and May\u2019s answers throughout the whole exchange were little more than evasive or unsatisfactory. Her best answer came at the end, when she segued into a general attack on Corbyn\u2019s Brexit inconsistencies, but it sounded irrelevant to what had gone before and failed to dispel that impression that Corbyn had stitched her up good and proper. His final broadside against Chris Grayling was effective, but his best line was probably the one questioning how May could claim that \u201cdue diligence\u201d was performed on the Seaborne Freight contract with a straight face. Admittedly, if Labour could not win at PMQs on the battleground of Grayling\u2019s competence, it would be in real trouble. But Corbyn rose to the occasion, and he managed reasonably persuasively to turn Grayling into an emblem of the government\u2019s Brexit record more generally.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c640a20e4b04a6f567de9e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T12:19:09.454Z\">12.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says Eurotunnel called this contract a secretive and flawed exercise. Taxpayers face a bill of almost \u00a31m contesting their legal claim. He asks May if she can assure the people of Thanet will not have to pay the price for the failure of this contract.</p> <p>May says the government is discussing this with Thanet council. She says the DoT took this action to ensure, in the event of a no-deal situation, medicines will be able to come into this country. Corbyn does not seem to be interested in ensuring that the government can ensure medical supplies in the event of no deal.</p> <p>Corbyn says the government should take no deal off the table, as the House said in its recent vote. He says this illustrates the spectacular failure of government planning. Attacking Grayling\u2019s record, she asks how on earth May can have confidence in him.</p> <p>May says Grayling is delivering the biggest investment in rail since the Victorian era. Corbyn wanted to focus his questions on this, rather than ask about Brexit generally, because there are a number of issues on which Labour can\u2019t give answers. We don\u2019t know if Corbyn backs a second referendum, or even if he backs Brexit.

It is on <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190213.pdf\">the order paper (pdf),</a> starting on page 22, along with five amendments already tabled: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/12/brexit-latest-news-developmens-mays-statment-mps-need-to-hold-our-nerve-may-to-tell-mps-as-leadsom-hints-uk-softening-call-for-deal-to-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c630ffde4b00ef6acc6cb23#block-5c630ffde4b00ef6acc6cb23\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s</a>, a Ken Clarke one proposing an indicative ballot, allowing MPs to rank their Brexit preferences in order; one from the SNP\u2019s Angus Brendan MacNeill saying article 50 should be revoked, one from Anna Soubry saying the government should publish its advice about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on business; and one from the Labour Brexiter Roger Godsiff calling for a second referendum. </p> <p>Here is the text of the government motion.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That this House welcomes the prime minister\u2019s statement of 12 February 2019; reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on 29 January 2019 and notes that discussions between the UK and the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop are ongoing.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to a story by<strong> Jonathan Isaby</strong> for the pro-Brexit website BrexitCentral, <a href=\"https://brexitcentral.com/row-brewing-thursdays-government-motion-opposing-no-deal-brexit/\">the wording of the amendment has angered MPs from the European Research Group</a>, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit. Isaby says the ERG, which has the backing of around 50 MPs, may tell its supporters not to vote for the government motion because it implicitly rules out a no-deal Brexit. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Far from being neutral, [the wording] means that MPs are being called upon to back a motion that would not only be endorsing the demand of Sir Graham Brady\u2019s amendment for the backstop to be replaced, but also the other successful amendment of two weeks ago \u2013 from Dame Caroline Spelman \u2013 that states opposition to leaving the EU without a deal.</p> <p>I gather that there was a fiery meeting in the government whips\u2019 office yesterday involving leading lights of the ERG during which the Tory eurosceptics indicated that they could not support a motion that ruled out the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. The ERG suggested that it be pulled and a new version tabled today. But the government whips did not acquiesce to their entreaties and ministers therefore face the prospect of potentially losing the vote tomorrow if they refuse to table an alternative motion and Labour and other opposition parties then whip their MPs to oppose the motion as currently tabled.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> Earlier I said that Roger Godsiff, who voted leave, has tabled an amendment calling for a second referendum because he hopes it will show little support for the idea in the Commons. That is certainly what some pro-referendum campaigners think. But Godsiff himself says that <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birmingham-mp-roger-godsiff-table-15794926\">he is backing a second referendum partly because a majority in his constituency voted to remain in the EU,</a> and so I have taken out that line from the paragraph above.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The BDI] keep to a hard line, they don\u2019t want to weaken the commission\u2019s negotiation position. </p> <p>I think that makes sense, but at the same time if you watch talk shows on TV in Germany, you see members of big businesses and business federations who do urge the Commission to make concessions and find a solution. </p> <p>Everyone knows that both sides would be hit quite severely by a hard Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Prof Felbermayr said German companies were already \u201csuffering\u201d because of uncertainty ahead of Brexit. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the EU should, as a quick-fix at least, offer to remove both the backstop and the withdrawal agreement\u2019s current time-limit on the mobility of goods and capital, so that the provisional agreement would keep the EU and the UK in a joint customs territory association even after 2020, without making a difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c63eb5ae4b00ef6acc6d0f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T10:08:39.106Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Conservative/Labour Brexit talks will resume this afternoon, the BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kunessberg </strong>reports.

He happened to find himself in a hotel bar in Brussels where he heard <strong>Olly Robbins,</strong> the government\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, chatting in a voice loud enough to be heard about what will happen next in the Brexit process.</p> <p>Assuming that Robbins was not engaged in an elaborate act of subterfuge (which seems very unlikely), there were two important revelations in what Robbins said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Robbins said that he expected the final vote on Brexit to take place at the very last minute. </strong>He talked about a decision point in \u201cthe week beginning end of March\u201d. Presumably that would be the week beginning Monday 25 March, after the EU summit (starting on Thursday 21 March), and only four days before Brexit (Friday 29 March). This confirms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/12/brexit-latest-news-developmens-mays-statment-mps-need-to-hold-our-nerve-may-to-tell-mps-as-leadsom-hints-uk-softening-call-for-deal-to-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c62d8a6e4b00ef6acc6c81e#block-5c62d8a6e4b00ef6acc6c81e\">what Jeremy Corbyn and many other MPs were saying in the Commons yesterday;</a> that Theresa May is running down the clock.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Robbins said that he expected MPs to be presented with a final choice between backing May\u2019s deal and a long extension of article 50</strong>. This is also very interesting, because most of those accusing May of running down the clock were doing so on the assumption that she would end up offering MPs a choice between her deal and no deal. If Robbins is right, then May has or will conclude that a no-deal Brexit would be unacceptable.</li> </ul> <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-02-12/exclusive-uk-chief-brexit-negotiator-olly-robbins-warns-mps-the-choice-is-mays-deal-or-extension/\">Walker\u2019s story.</a> And here is an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Olly Robbins said that, in his view, he expects the choice for MPs to be either backing May\u2019s deal or extending talks with the EU.</p> <p>He expects MPs in March to be presented with backing a reworked Brexit deal or a potentially significant delay to Brexit, he told colleagues last night.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension,\u201d he was overheard saying. \u201cIn the end they will probably just give us an extension\u201d ...</p> <p>Robbins added that he thought the fear of a long extension to article 50 might focus MPs\u2019 minds.</p> <p>He suggested: \u201c... Got to make them believe that the week beginning end of March... Extension is possible but if they don\u2019t vote for the deal then the extension is a long one...\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Stephen Barclay</strong>, the Brexit secretary, was asked if what Robbins reportedly said reflected government policy. \u201cNo,\u201d said Barclay. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/brexit-minister-downplays-article-50-extension\">He stressed that extending article 50 was not the government\u2019s plan, </a>and that it was not something the UK could do unilaterally anyway. But he did not sound particularly angered by the Robbins story, and he did not absolutely rule out article 50 being extended.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>10am:</em> Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, gives evidence to the parliamentary committee on restoration of the Palace of Westminster.</p> <p><em>10.45am:</em> Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives a speech at an NHS conference.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Bernadette Kelly, permanent secretary at the Department for Transport, and Clare Moriarty, permanent secretary at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about Brexit planning.</p> <p>As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> and PMQs.

      "bodyText": "Julian Smith, the government chief whip, is meeting Tory Brexiters from the European Research Group in the hope of finding a way of getting them to vote for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit motion tomorrow. They have been threatening not to back it, creating the risk that May could suffer a defeat that would have no direct, practical impact but that would nevertheless undermine May\u2019s already-much-weakened credibility with the EU. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said that Labour\u2019s priority in the vote tomorrow is to introduce a \u201chard stop\u201d into the Brexit process. He was referring to the Labour amendment, which says by 27 February there should either be a vote on a revised deal, or else a minister should \u201cmake a written statement declaring that there is no longer an agreement in principle in the negotiations with the European Union\u201d and table an amendable motion on \u201chow the government proposes to proceed.\u201d Commenting on this, Starmer said: At the moment, the battle this week is to stop the prime minister running down the clock and put a hard stop into the process. Our amendment says there should be a hard stop on February 26. The prime minister must either put up her deal or allow parliament to take control. Speaking after talks with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, Starmer also said that it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to make progress in the cross-party talks unless May abandoned her red lines, but that further talks were planned. He said: We had frank and serious discussions. We set out the Labour party position, which is the two options of on the one hand a close economic relationship, on the other a public vote. Obviously, the question of the red lines came up, because unless the red lines change it\u2019s very difficult to make progress. It was against the backdrop of the prime minister running down the clock. We\u2019ve agreed to meet again to continue the discussions, so that\u2019ll happen in the coming days or weeks. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has said it is not backing a move by the Labour MP Geraint Davies to amend the Brexit motion tomorrow to say that May\u2019s plan should be passed subject to it being put to the public in a referendum. (See 4.31pm and 4.35pm.) Ford has warned that leaving the EU without a deal next month would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the UK\u2019s auto industry. As the Press Association reports, the company did not confirm a newspaper report that it was stepping up preparations to move production out of the UK. But a Ford spokesman said: We have long urged the UK government and parliament to work together to avoid the country leaving the EU on a no-deal, hard Brexit basis on March 29. Such a situation would be catastrophic for the UK auto industry and Ford\u2019s manufacturing operations in the country. We will take whatever action is necessary to preserve the competitiveness of our European business. The former Labour MP and justice campaigner Chris Mullin has named two of the four men he believes were responsible for the 1974 IRA Birmingham pub bombings. That\u2019s all from me for today. We hope to keep comments open until about 6pm. Thanks for all those submitted so far. Julian Smith, the chief whip, is meeting members of the European Research Group to discuss what might be done to get ERG members to lift their objections to voting for the government\u2019s Brexit motion tomorrow. (See 11.36am.) This is from HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh. A secret nuclear bunker under Whitehall could delay a restoration project on the parliamentary estate, MPs have warned. As the Press Association reports, the crisis command centre under the Ministry of Defence is at the centre of concerns over the planned use of the department\u2019s car park for work on Richmond House. MPs plan to use 79 Whitehall as a temporary debating chamber when they decant from the Palace of Westminster as part of a 5 billion restoration project. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom, appearing before the joint committee on the draft parliamentary buildings bill, said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets costs are already being incurred redrawing plans to exclude the MoD car park and she has tried \u201cextremely hard\u201d to resolve the issue. Lord Blunkett, the former Labour cabinet minister and a member of the committee, said: Let\u2019s be clear so that we don\u2019t mislead anybody: we all know that there\u2019s been a bunker under there, we\u2019ve known that there\u2019s one in Gloucestershire as well. I used to say when I was home secretary, the last place on God\u2019s Earth I\u2019d want to be, let alone take my family, would be the bunker under the MoD. I mean it is insane. People have just got to get real on this and come into the real world. A further \u00a35.5m of public money will be spent on the failed Garden Bridge project, it has been revealed. As the Press Association reports, Transport for London (TfL) said the money is needed to meet the cost of winding up the charity set up to build and run the crossing in the centre of the English capital. This will bring the amount spent by the public sector to around \u00a343m, consisting of \u00a324m from TfL and \u00a319m from the Department for Transport. The Sinn Fein leader, Mary Lou McDonald, met Jeremy Corbyn at Westminster today to discuss Brexit. Afterwards she said: We are of one mind in terms of protecting the Good Friday agreement. In terms of the need for a backstop, we have said to him that there is a backstop, it is the backstop, it is the only backstop that there is. And that it represents the bottom line for us. He has heard that message very, very clearly. The People\u2019s Vote campaign is not backing the Geraint Davies amendment (see 4.31pm), according to Business Insider\u2019s Adam Payne. The Labour MP Geraint Davies has tabled an amendment to the Brexit motion for tomorrow urging the government to make concessions that would enable Labour MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. The main one would be to make the deal subject to a referendum (with the options being the deal, or remain), but it also says that article 50 should be extended, that the government should commit to matching any EU plan to enhance workers\u2019 rights after Brexit (\u201cdynamic alignment\u201d, in the jargon), and permanent customs union membership being an option. This is in effect the same plan as the one proposed by the Labour MPs Phi Wilson and Peter Kyle. Kyle asked Theresa May about this at PMQs. (See 12.42pm.) If it gets put to a vote, the government will reject this plan firmly. But it would pose more of a challenge for Labour. Much of what it proposes is a Labour Brexit. But Jeremy Corbyn has also made it clear that his preference is for a Brexit on Labour terms that does not have to be endorsed by a second referendum. Whether John Bercow, the speaker, decides to call the amendment or not tomorrow will depend in part on how much support it gets (ie, how many MPs sign it). At this point, that is not at all clear. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. One of the amendments to the government\u2019s Brexit motion tomorrow has been tabled by the Conservative pro-European, Anna Soubry. (See 10.54am.) It instructs the government to publish its most recent assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit on business. A few minutes ago Soubry told BBC News why she tabled it. She said: I\u2019m told that the civil service, at the behest of the cabinet, has looked at the implications on trade and business if we were to leave the European Union, crashing out without a deal. And I am told that it does not mince its words, and it makes it very plain that that outcome would be disastrous, in the words of the business secretary, Greg Clark, \u201cruinous\u201d for British business, if we leave without a deal. And I want the government to publish that paper. It\u2019s been to cabinet. I\u2019m told that some members of the cabinet argued that it should be published. They were overruled. In all the circumstances, I think it is absolutely critical. My constituents, not just business but everybody in my constituency, and of course across the country, has a right to know and understand the consequences of Mrs May\u2019s decision not to take that calamitous outcome off the table. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart on the Conservative/Labour Brexit talks. Here are two assessments of thinking in Brussels on Brexit that are worth reading. Mujtaba Rahman, the former European commission official who is now a managing director at the Eurasia Group consultancy, says the EU now does not think this will be resolved until the March summit. Here are the conclusions from his latest assessment. And here is an extract from his assessment. May\u2019s overtures to Jeremy Corbyn did not come as a surprise in Brussels\u2014many see Labour\u2019s support as inevitable if May is to muster a Commons majority\u2014but May\u2019s outreach is now seen as more of a tactical than genuine move. Says one seasoned EU negotiator in Brussels, \u201cIn the EU\u2019s eyes, these types of problems always require a national consensus and cross-party majority, but we now realise this is not in the genes or culture of UK politics.\u201d Yet rather than concluding that May is preparing to drive the UK off a cliff, the assessment being reached in Brussels and many of the EU\u2019s 27 capitals is different\u2014namely, that if May is to compromise with Labour and threaten splitting her own party, she is only likely to do so at the very last minute. The stage is therefore being set for a high-stakes European council on 21-22 March. Another senior EU negotiator remarks, \u201cIf anything happens on substance and timing, it has to happen at the European council.\u201d This is because any move on substance \u2014within or outside the withdrawal agreement\u2014will now be politically painful and will \u201chave to be taken by EU leaders\u201d, as will signing off an extension of article 50. Moreover, many officials in Brussels don\u2019t think enough progress will be made between now and the scheduled March summit to justify an ad-hoc council. Says another official, \u201cWe can only mobilise leaders if we know we\u2019re going to make a deal. Right now, the elements are not in place for a summit.\u201d And here is a Twitter thread from the Sun\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Nick Gutteridge. At the post-PMQs briefing, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman insisted that Labour\u2019s preferred solution to the Brexit crisis remains a general election. As PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield reports, this has been seen as a rebuke to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who said this morning that \u201cthe only credible options now left are a close economic relationship - that\u2019s the sort of relationship we spelt out in the letter to the prime minister last week - or a public vote.\u201d (See 10.01am.) Downing Street is currently ruling out redrafting the Brexit motion for tomorrow\u2019s debate, despite the Tory European Research Group saying its current wording is unacceptable. (See 11.36am and 1.41pm.) This means that there is a real risk of Theresa May being defeated, in a vote that would have no practical impact but that would nevertheless undermine her credibility with fellow EU leaders. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, has said the UK\u2019s backstop demands would \u201cweaken the economic development of Europe\u201d. (See 1.14pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has said that Chris Grayling\u2019s handling of the Seaborne Freight contract sums up the \u201cutter shambles\u201d of the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit planning. (See 12.56pm.) Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, has said there is \u201cno possibility\u201d of the Irish government accepting a time limit on the backstop. Giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, he said: There is no possibility of the Irish government or the Irish people saying the backstop could be time-limited. There is no hope of that, I\u2019m afraid. I don\u2019t see the EU changing on the withdrawal agreement, I don\u2019t see them changing on the backstop, I don\u2019t think the Irish government are going to change on that. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has played down the possibility of an extension to article 50. And May herself, at PMQs, urged MPs not to believe what her Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, reportedly said about the government wanting to leave the Commons with a choice at the end of March between backing her deal and accepting a long extension to article 50. The government\u2019s push to roll over EU trade deals from which the UK currently benefits has yielded agreements covering only \u00a316bn of the near-\u00a3117bn of British trade with the countries involved. The freight industry has warned of the potential for a fresh Brexit ferry fiasco after it emerged all British truckers will be required to have counter-terrorism safety security certificates to enter the European Union in the event of no deal. The biggest monthly fall for gas prices since the 1980s helped drag down UK inflation to the lowest level in two years in January as the government\u2019s energy price cap came into effect. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has called for tough rules to swiftly kick out antisemitic Labour members, following rows at a shadow cabinet meeting over the party\u2019s backlog of complaints. Speaking in Liverpool on the final day of his visit to England, the Irish president, Michael D Higgins, called for Britain and Ireland to build on their links \u201cirrespective of whatever happens in proximate political events\u201d. Downing Street is not proposing to redraft the Brexit motion being debated tomorrow, despite the objections from the European Research Group. (See 11.36am.) As the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment reports, it is arguing that the Commons amendment passed two weeks ago rejecting a no-deal Brexit does not really count. One of the most surprising stories around this morning was the revelation that Theresa May told cabinet yesterday that, if you scrap the mould from the top of a jam jar, the rest will be fine to eat. She delivered the tip during a discussion on food waste, according to the Mail. According to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman, the Labour leader does not need to do this himself - because he never lets the jam get mouldy. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. Labour MPs will leave the party unless Jeremy Corbyn changes his stance on issues like Brexit and antisemitism, one of his backbenchers, Neil Coyle, is saying on Twitter. The prime minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, has backed a \u2018no deal\u2019 over a \u2018bad deal\u2019, despite his country\u2019s vulnerability to a cliff-edge Brexit. \u201cClarity requires me to say that between a \u2018no deal\u2019 and a \u2018bad deal\u2019, I prefer a \u2018no deal\u2019, which will have the merit of clarity and responsibility\u201d, said Michel, in comments reported today in the Belgian media. Speaking in Bruges, the Belgian PM added: The backstop is not a detail, both for guaranteeing peace in Ireland and for the integrity of the domestic market, its capacity for economic development, employment and investment. A good deal is on the table, but the British parliament is trying to take us toward a bad deal. The British parliament\u2019s demands on the backstop would weaken the economic development of Europe, a risk for our businesses and our jobs. The comments made on Tuesday echo those of the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grtbauskait\u0117, who claimed last month that a no deal Brexit would be better than continued uncertainty. Fox is responding to Gardiner. He says, if Labour wants continuity, they should vote for the government\u2019s Brexit deal. He says some countries wanted the UK to drop human rights clauses that had been in EU free trade deals. He says he has refused to do this. And he says Gardiner was wrong to claim that Fox advocated the unilateral removal of tariffs. That was a newspaper claim, Fox says. He says the government has yet to decide its policy on this. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, says the leaked information (see 11.45am) shows that Fox has only signed four of the many trade deals that he said would be ready one second after Brexit day. He suggests Fox has spent too much time looking for new trade deals, and too little time trying to secure the ones the UK has. He challenges Fox to rule out reducing all tariffs on imports to zero in the event of a no-deal Brexit. How can exporters send goods abroad when they do not know what tariffs will be? Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is now responding to the UQ on trade deals. (See 11.45am.) He says the best way to provide continuity would be for MPs to vote for a Brexit deal. He says some agreements have been signed. And some mutual recognition agreements have been signed. He says other agreements are at an advanced stage. He says, for those countries where they cannot get an agreement by exit day, there will be contingency plans in case there is no deal. His department will update the House, he says. Here is the Press Association story about the May/Corbyn exchanges. Jeremy Corbyn described Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy as \u201ccostly, shambolic and deliberately evasive\u201d, saying it was summed up by the fiasco around Seaborne Freight. The Labour leader said in the Commons during PMQs that the company, which won a contract to provide extra ferry services in case of a no deal, had \u201cno ships and no trading history\u201d. He said the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had told MPs last month he was \u201cconfident the firm would deliver the service\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d In response May said the contract went to three companies in total, with the other two making up 90% of the capacity, with both still in place. She said: \u201cDue diligence was carried out on all of these contracts and as [Grayling] made clear earlier this week, we will continue to ensure we provide that capacity, which is important in a no deal situation.\u201d Corbyn continued, saying that Grayling had said the Seaborne Freight contract had \u201cno cost to the taxpayer\u201d, but a report by the National Audit Office found that 800,000 had been spent on external consultants. He asked the PM if she wanted to: \u201cUse this opportunity to correct the record?\u201d May accused the Labour leader of being \u201clate to the party\u201d, after the issue was raised in the chamber yesterday by the SNP. She added: \u201cWhen these contracts were all let, proper due diligence was carried out - that included third-party assessment of the companies that were bidding for the contracts. \u201cThere would have been a cost attached to this process, regardless of who the contracts were entered into with.\u201d Corbyn, concluding his remarks, said: \u201cThe spectacular failure of this contract is a symptom of the utter shambles of this government and its no-deal preparations. The transport secretary ignored warnings about drones and airport security, gave a \u00a31.4bn contract to Carillion despite warnings over their finances, he oversaw the disastrous new rail timetables last year, rail punctuality at a 13-year low and fares at a record high - that is some achievement. \u201cNow the transport secretary is in charge of a major and vital aspect of Brexit planning. How on earth can the prime minister say she has confidence in the transport secretary?\u201d May defended Grayling by saying he is delivering the \u201cbiggest rail investment programme since the Victorian era\u201d before noting there were Brexit questions that Corbyn had avoided asking. She said MPs did not know if Corbyn backs a second referendum, backs a deal or backs Brexit. The PM went on: \u201cHe prefers ambiguity and playing politics to acting in the national interest. People used to say he was a conviction politician - not any more.\u201d Ian Blackford makes a point of order at the end of PMQs. John Bercow, the speaker, allows it, but he says he hope that this won\u2019t become a habit, by which Blackford tries to get a third question. Blackford says May inadvertently misled the House. She says the SNP had no plan for independence. But it published a white paper, he says. Bercow says Blackford has made his point. Here is a clip of Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, at PMQs earlier. (I did not cover the questions because I was posting the snap verdict.) Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves asks the government to extend parental leave to the parents of children who end up in neo-natal wards. May says the government is looking at this, as well as if parental leave can be extended to women who have miscarriages. Giles Watling, a Conservative, asks May to get the government to ban the consumption of dog and cat meat. May says it is illegal to sell dog and cat meat in the UK. And there is no evidence that dog and cat meat are being consumed in this country either. Labour\u2019s Lyn Brown asks about a drug used to treat muscular dystrophy. She asks May to intervene to ensure it is made available. May says she will get a health minister to respond. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts asks May to ensure that her polices work for all three countries in the UK. May reprimands her for ignoring Northern Ireland in her question. She claims she is concerned about all parts of the country. UPDATE: In the comments romeoromeotango points out that Saville Roberts did not talk about the three countries in the UK. She actually said: \u201cWhen will she work with others to remake this island as three self-sufficient, thriving nations, rather than perpetuating the assumption of privilege for one?\u201d I\u2019m sorry I missed that distinction. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle says May cannot get her deal through the Commons. But she could if she promised a referendum on the deal, she says. That is what happened with the Good Friday agreement. Kyle asks May to meet him and Labour\u2019s Phil Wilson, who are pushing an amendment proposing this. May says Kyle knows that she thinks about a second referendum. She says she will ensure they get a meeting with a minister to discuss this. Labour\u2019s Rosie Cooper asks if the government will take back responsibility for free TV licences for the over-75s from the BBC. May says the government expects the BBC to carry on giving over-75s free TV licences. May says BBC should continue to fund free TV licences for the over-75s. UPDATE: This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Heidi Allen, a Conservative, says she welcomes what Amber Rudd said about the link between universal credit and increasing food bank use. It is not that there has been a link, she says; there is a link. She urges May to reform the way UC operates. May says there have been a number of changes to who UC operates already. The government will continue to review it. But UC is a system that encourages people into work. The legacy system left people trapped on benefits. In response to a question about Sir Philip Green, May says there is a Whitehall committee that has the power to recommend that honours can be removed from people. Like Stephen Barclay on the Today programme, May has used PMQs to dismiss what Olly Robbins reportedly said about her Brexit strategy. PMQs - Snap verdict: One of the standard criticisms of Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs is that he avoids forensic questioning. Having posed a tough question on a topic, and received a brush off, more often than not he tends to move on to something else rather than persist. But today he went micro, rather than wide-lens, and it was a success. When the topic of the Seaborne Freight contract came up in the first question, Theresa May seemed so keen to avoid addressing it that she started reminiscing about the 1966 World Cup (the first times she has ever expressed an interest in football at the dispatch box?) before responding with the most cursory response imaginable. Corbyn kept banging away at this for the next five questions, and May\u2019s answers throughout the whole exchange were little more than evasive or unsatisfactory. Her best answer came at the end, when she segued into a general attack on Corbyn\u2019s Brexit inconsistencies, but it sounded irrelevant to what had gone before and failed to dispel that impression that Corbyn had stitched her up good and proper. His final broadside against Chris Grayling was effective, but his best line was probably the one questioning how May could claim that \u201cdue diligence\u201d was performed on the Seaborne Freight contract with a straight face. Admittedly, if Labour could not win at PMQs on the battleground of Grayling\u2019s competence, it would be in real trouble. But Corbyn rose to the occasion, and he managed reasonably persuasively to turn Grayling into an emblem of the government\u2019s Brexit record more generally. Corbyn says Eurotunnel called this contract a secretive and flawed exercise. Taxpayers face a bill of almost \u00a31m contesting their legal claim. He asks May if she can assure the people of Thanet will not have to pay the price for the failure of this contract. May says the government is discussing this with Thanet council. She says the DoT took this action to ensure, in the event of a no-deal situation, medicines will be able to come into this country. Corbyn does not seem to be interested in ensuring that the government can ensure medical supplies in the event of no deal. Corbyn says the government should take no deal off the table, as the House said in its recent vote. He says this illustrates the spectacular failure of government planning. Attacking Grayling\u2019s record, she asks how on earth May can have confidence in him. May says Grayling is delivering the biggest investment in rail since the Victorian era. Corbyn wanted to focus his questions on this, rather than ask about Brexit generally, because there are a number of issues on which Labour can\u2019t give answers. We don\u2019t know if Corbyn backs a second referendum, or even if he backs Brexit. People used to say he was a conviction politician; not any more. Corbyn says he is surprised that May can say \u201cdue diligence\u201d was carried out with a straight face. May says, on the basis of what Corbyn is saying, contracts should never be offered to start-up companies. She says in the past Corbyn attacked spending on no-deal planning. Corbyn says govenrment advisers were instructed to restrict their due diligence checks to what Seaborne Freight told them. Some of those directors would not pass a due diligence test, he says. He says an FoI request shows Grayling breached standard rules for these contracts. What will May do about this? May defends the way the contract was awarded. She says no money has been paid to that contractor. Corbyn has stood here time and time again and said the government should not be spending money on a no-deal Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn starts by expressing condolences to the family of the army cadet who died at Sandhurst. He says he hopes cadets are offered better support in future. He also pays tribute to Gordon Banks. He says he remembers England\u2019s World Cup victory with joy. He says nothing illustrates the flaws in the government\u2019s handling of Brexit more than the Seaborne Freight fiasco. Chris Grayling defended this contract, before it was abandoned. What went wrong? May also accepts the need for better mental health support at Sandhurst, and she says she too remembers the 1966 World Cup victory. She says other firms will provide ferry capacity. Corbyn says Grayling said that the taxpayer would not lose out from the Seaborne Freight contract. But \u00a3800,000 was spent on consultants. May says the SNP asked about this yesterday. The money would have been spent by consultants whoever got the contract. Helen Whately, a Conservative, asks about the first conviction for female genital mutilation last month. She asks May to make government time for the bill that was blocked by the Tory Sir Christopher Chope intended to crack down on this. May says the government will make time for this bill. Theresa May starts by saying MPs will pay tribute to Sir David Natzler, who is retiring as clerk of the Commons, later today. She gives her own tribute, thanks him for his work, and wishes him the best for the future. From my colleague Heather Stewart PMQs is starting in a moment. Here is the order paper. A no-deal Brexit would lead to a \u201cmajor dislocation\u201d to the Scottish economy, according to the country\u2019s chief economist. As the Press Association reports, In a State of the Economy report published today Scotland\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary Gillespie, indicated that disruptions to logistics, supply, trade, investment, migration and market confidence could cause a \u201csignificant structural change in the economy\u201d. The analysis suggested that although the country had experienced a \u201cpositive year\u201d economically, with growth in areas such as exports and high labour market performance, uncertainty around the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU remained a \u201clive risk\u201d. There is an urgent question after PMQs about the government\u2019s failure to carry over most of the existing EU trade deals that benefit the UK in time for Brexit. The UQ was prompted by this story in today\u2019s Sun. Here is an extract. The government has promised to rollover 40 current EU free trade deals with 70 different countries, so they will still apply to the UK under a no deal Brexit. But a secret tally leaked to The Sun has revealed that just a handful will be ready in time when the UK leaves on March 29 ... A minister told The Sun: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get many of the deals over the line in time now. \u201cWhat we hope to have instead is letters of understanding with all the remaining countries, which will go some way to reassuring business.\u201d The current tally drawn up by the Department for International Trade lists progress of the 40 deal rollovers in four colour-coded tables. Only six are in green table, signifying they will be done by March 29. They are the four already agreed, with Switzerland \u2013 signed on Monday - Chile, an Eastern and Southern African block, and the Faroe Islands. In addition, deals with Israel and the Palestinian Authority are \u201con track\u201d. And here is a fuller version of the story by my colleague Richard Partington. Mark Francois, vice chair of the European Research Group, which represents around 50 Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, has just told BBC News that the ERG will not vote for the government motion on Brexit tomorrow night because it implicitly rules out a no-deal Brexit. He is confirming the story reported by BrexitCentral overnight. (See 10.54am.) Francois said: We cannot vote for this as it\u2019s current configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels. The prime minister, if she went through the lobbies for this tomorrow night, would be voting against the guarantees she has given in the Commons for months [that no-deal remains an option]. It is madness. ERG supporters do not always vote as a bloc, but May has such a small majority that, even if some of them were to vote against or abstain, she would be in real danger of losing. If the government were to lose the vote on the main motion, there would be no immediate consequence because the wording is relatively anodyne. But a defeat would badly damage May\u2019s standing in Brussels, where EU leaders would conclude that there is even less support for her negotiating stance in the Commons than they previously assumed. At least after the votes on 29 January May was able to argue that she had secured a Commons majority for something. A defeat tomorrow would leave even that very modest achievement undone. Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, has been giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee this morning. Here are some highlights from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll. Last night the government tabled the Brexit motion for debate tomorrow. It is on the order paper (pdf), starting on page 22, along with five amendments already tabled: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, a Ken Clarke one proposing an indicative ballot, allowing MPs to rank their Brexit preferences in order; one from the SNP\u2019s Angus Brendan MacNeill saying article 50 should be revoked, one from Anna Soubry saying the government should publish its advice about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on business; and one from the Labour Brexiter Roger Godsiff calling for a second referendum. Here is the text of the government motion. That this House welcomes the prime minister\u2019s statement of 12 February 2019; reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on 29 January 2019 and notes that discussions between the UK and the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop are ongoing. According to a story by Jonathan Isaby for the pro-Brexit website BrexitCentral, the wording of the amendment has angered MPs from the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit. Isaby says the ERG, which has the backing of around 50 MPs, may tell its supporters not to vote for the government motion because it implicitly rules out a no-deal Brexit. He says: Far from being neutral, [the wording] means that MPs are being called upon to back a motion that would not only be endorsing the demand of Sir Graham Brady\u2019s amendment for the backstop to be replaced, but also the other successful amendment of two weeks ago \u2013 from Dame Caroline Spelman \u2013 that states opposition to leaving the EU without a deal. I gather that there was a fiery meeting in the government whips\u2019 office yesterday involving leading lights of the ERG during which the Tory eurosceptics indicated that they could not support a motion that ruled out the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. The ERG suggested that it be pulled and a new version tabled today. But the government whips did not acquiesce to their entreaties and ministers therefore face the prospect of potentially losing the vote tomorrow if they refuse to table an alternative motion and Labour and other opposition parties then whip their MPs to oppose the motion as currently tabled. UPDATE: Earlier I said that Roger Godsiff, who voted leave, has tabled an amendment calling for a second referendum because he hopes it will show little support for the idea in the Commons. That is certainly what some pro-referendum campaigners think. But Godsiff himself says that he is backing a second referendum partly because a majority in his constituency voted to remain in the EU, and so I have taken out that line from the paragraph above. I\u2019m happy to make that clear. On the Today programme this morning the director of the German economic think tank IFO, Prof Gabriel Felbermayr, said that some German businesses wanted the EU offer concessions to the UK over Brexit and that the BDI, the German equivalent of the CBI, was out of step with many of its members in opposing a renegotiation. He said: [The BDI] keep to a hard line, they don\u2019t want to weaken the commission\u2019s negotiation position. I think that makes sense, but at the same time if you watch talk shows on TV in Germany, you see members of big businesses and business federations who do urge the Commission to make concessions and find a solution. Everyone knows that both sides would be hit quite severely by a hard Brexit. Prof Felbermayr said German companies were already \u201csuffering\u201d because of uncertainty ahead of Brexit. I think the EU should, as a quick-fix at least, offer to remove both the backstop and the withdrawal agreement\u2019s current time-limit on the mobility of goods and capital, so that the provisional agreement would keep the EU and the UK in a joint customs territory association even after 2020, without making a difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Conservative/Labour Brexit talks will resume this afternoon, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kunessberg reports. But, on the basis of what Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn were saying in the Commons yesterday about their respective positions, goodwill is limited and the gap between the two sides remains quite wide. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was also on the Today programme this morning. Here are the key points from his interview. Starmer refused to deny reports that he wanted Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to Theresa May last week, setting out Labour\u2019s five demands for Brexit, to include a commitment to backing a second referendum if May rejected them. Starmer said he would not comment on exactly what happened in the drafting process. But there have been multiple reports saying Starmer thought a second referendum reference was going to be included, but that it was taken out by someone in Corbyn\u2019s office, leading to a backlash from Labour pro-Europeans. For example, this is what ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reported in a Facebook post. I am told Starmer is not the happiest member of the frontbench, to put it mildly - according to multiple sources. He had agreed that the final part of Corbyn\u2019s letter to May would say \u201cif you do not accept this [Brexit offer] there will be a People\u2019s Vote\u201d. A source tells me \u201cLOTO [the leader of the opposition] agreed to this. But then Keir discovered after the letter had been sent and published that the People\u2019s Vote para had gone\u201d. Starmer \u201ccalled LOTO and was told \u2018oh we must have forgotten that paragraph\u2019\u201d. Apparently Starmer\u2019s reaction has not been one of unbridled joy. Starmer insisted that backing a second referendum was still an option for Labour. He said: In reality, for the Labour party, the only credible options now left are a close economic relationship - that\u2019s the sort of relationship we spelt out in the letter to the prime minister last week - or a public vote. He said Labour would back the new Yvette Cooper amendment intended to ensure that MPs get the chance to vote to block a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe will support that,\u201d he told Today. \u201cThe sense that this can\u2019t be allowed to go on is growing.\u201d Starmer\u2019s comment triggered this response from the Labour MP Caroline Flint. Flint was one of the 14 Labour MPs who defied the whip and voted against the Cooper amendment two weeks ago also designed to give MPs the chance to vote to block a no-deal Brexit. He confirmed that the eight Labour frontbenchers who defied the whip in the vote on the previous Cooper amendment by abstaining had not been disciplined. But he rejected claims that this meant, in practice, MPs would do what they liked, regardless of what the whip said. Asked if frontbenchers who failed to vote for the new Cooper amendment would be sacked, he said: The job of deciding what people do on the whip is the chief whip\u2019s job, along with Jeremy Corbyn. UK inflation has hit a two-year low of 1.8% in January, bringing some relief to households, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports on his business live blog. ITV\u2019s Angus Walker released a wonderful scoop last night. He happened to find himself in a hotel bar in Brussels where he heard Olly Robbins, the government\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, chatting in a voice loud enough to be heard about what will happen next in the Brexit process. Assuming that Robbins was not engaged in an elaborate act of subterfuge (which seems very unlikely), there were two important revelations in what Robbins said. Robbins said that he expected the final vote on Brexit to take place at the very last minute. He talked about a decision point in \u201cthe week beginning end of March\u201d. Presumably that would be the week beginning Monday 25 March, after the EU summit (starting on Thursday 21 March), and only four days before Brexit (Friday 29 March). This confirms what Jeremy Corbyn and many other MPs were saying in the Commons yesterday; that Theresa May is running down the clock. Robbins said that he expected MPs to be presented with a final choice between backing May\u2019s deal and a long extension of article 50. This is also very interesting, because most of those accusing May of running down the clock were doing so on the assumption that she would end up offering MPs a choice between her deal and no deal. If Robbins is right, then May has or will conclude that a no-deal Brexit would be unacceptable. Here is Walker\u2019s story. And here is an excerpt. Olly Robbins said that, in his view, he expects the choice for MPs to be either backing May\u2019s deal or extending talks with the EU. He expects MPs in March to be presented with backing a reworked Brexit deal or a potentially significant delay to Brexit, he told colleagues last night. \u201cThe issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension,\u201d he was overheard saying. \u201cIn the end they will probably just give us an extension\u201d ... Robbins added that he thought the fear of a long extension to article 50 might focus MPs\u2019 minds. He suggested: \u201c... Got to make them believe that the week beginning end of March... Extension is possible but if they don\u2019t vote for the deal then the extension is a long one...\u201d On the Today programme this morning Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, was asked if what Robbins reportedly said reflected government policy. \u201cNo,\u201d said Barclay. He stressed that extending article 50 was not the government\u2019s plan, and that it was not something the UK could do unilaterally anyway. But he did not sound particularly angered by the Robbins story, and he did not absolutely rule out article 50 being extended. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. 10am: Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, gives evidence to the parliamentary committee on restoration of the Palace of Westminster. 10.45am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives a speech at an NHS conference. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2.30pm: Bernadette Kelly, permanent secretary at the Department for Transport, and Clare Moriarty, permanent secretary at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about Brexit planning. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit and PMQs. I plan to post at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Eric Harrison, the coach credited with producing Manchester United\u2019s famous Class of 92 youth side, has died at the age of 81. News of his death was confirmed on Thursday by United, where Harrison spent 17 years as a youth team coach after moving from Everton in 1981. \u201cManchester United is extremely saddened to report that our former youth coach Eric Harrison passed away on Wednesday,\u201d the club said. \u201cEric served United with distinction as a mentor of young players, including a number of prodigies who achieved great success with club and country after graduating to the first team at Old Trafford.\u201d Harrison, who played as a wing-half for Halifax and Hartlepool before turning to coaching on his retirement in 1972, was responsible for producing the group of players who were originally known as \u201cFergie\u2019s Fledglings\u201d, including David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes, who went on to play for the first team under Sir Alex Ferguson. Neville wrote on Twitter: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our mentor, our coach and the man who made us. He taught us how to play, how to never give up, how important it was to win your individual battles and what we needed to do to play for Manchester United Football Club. Eric we owe you everything.\u201d In 2017, when Harrison was awarded an MBE for his services to football, Ferguson said: \u201cIf you wanted a teacher who would give you the right way forward, the right path, Eric was that man. He was fantastic in his time at United. When I came in as manager, I decided to keep him on the coaching staff. As I got to know him and the work he was doing, I realised it was a great decision.\u201d In a statement released on Thursday, Ferguson paid tribute to his long-serving member of staff. \u201cEric\u2019s contribution to football and not just at Manchester United was incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I came as manager I was lucky enough to have Eric on the staff as head of youth development, so I got to see the work he did and not just with the Class of 92 but with all the young players. \u201cHe built character and determination in those young players and prepared them for the future. He was a teacher, he gave these players a path, a choice and he only did that through his own hard work and sacrifice. \u201cHe was able to impart that education to the young which made him one of the greatest coaches of our time. On a personal level Eric had a wicked, dry sense of humour and was straight-talking and I admired that in him.\u201d Beckham paid tribute to Harrison. \u201cHe was always watching and always with us every time we played, I can still hear him telling me NO MORE HOLLYWOOD PASSES,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cI can still see him as we played on The Cliff training ground looking down on us either with a proud smile or a loud bang of his fist on the window knowing any minute he would be on his way down to probably advise me in the most polite way to stop playing those passes. \u201cMore importantly he made us understand how to work hard and respect each other and not just on the pitch.

      "body": "<p>What do ambient composer Brian Eno, jazz guitarist Stanley Jordan and the Korg Wavestation EX synthesizer have in common? Beyond a myriad of potentially witty and certainly nerdy ripostes, I\u2019ll highlight one commonality: all three have played pivotal roles in the creation of memorable earcons. From Windows to Mac, Netflix right through to the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/conversation/conversational-components/earcons.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1550082353383000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8NMW60SnhuP7XFIJpYBHrW0ZJQQ\">earcons</a> are the sounds we hear as devices load, programs launch and shows begin, and they play a pivotal role in establishing tone and asserting a brand identity.</p> <p>If you\u2019re coming from the radio or podcast world, you\u2019ll be familiar with how to approach designing such an asset, but for those of you coming to voice from the world of app development, it might appear a more daunting task.</p> <p>Regardless of your background, this post looks to provide pointers on how you might create an earcon of your own, exploring what you want to communicate with it, and outlining how we at the Voice Lab approached the process ourselves. And should you be questioning whether there\u2019s really a need for earcons in voice apps, I\u2019ll explain why we think they\u2019re worth the time and effort.</p> <p><strong>Sonic identity in under five seconds</strong></p> <p>When we decided to produce a sonic identity for the Voice Lab, we wanted to create an earcon that\u2019s interesting, and augments the experience, but doesn\u2019t become annoying on repeat listens. Based on what we know, earcons should best be kept short, so we gave ourselves five seconds.</p> <p>We wanted the Voice Lab\u2019s sonic brand identity to indicate experimentation and a forward-thinking approach to technology, while remaining consistent with the shared values of the Guardian. This led us to settling on synthesised electronic sounds as our initial sound palette, which, in doing so, conveniently kept costs to a minimum.</p> <p><strong>Initial sketches</strong></p> <p>If you\u2019re creating an earcon, you\u2019ll need an audio sequencer. Anything from <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/mac/garageband/\">GarageBand</a> (free on Mac) through to the more professional <a href=\"https://www.ableton.com/en/\">Ableton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/\">Logic</a>, <a href=\"https://new.steinberg.net/cubase/\">Cubase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avid.com/pro-tools\">Pro Tools</a> options will suffice. From a sound design perspective, it can be quite freeing when you have five seconds. You don\u2019t have much time, so you can keep things simple.</p> <p>Loading up a synth, we began by recording two or three notes in a loop, leaving enough time at the end for the sounds to naturally disappear. Playing that loop over and over, we flicked through various synth presets to find a sound that felt a good starting point, continually moving the notes around before settling on a melody that felt right, tweaking the preset to modify the sound as we saw fit.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t want our earcon to sound rudimentary or flimsy, so the next step was to add some complexity to the initial layer of sound. A couple of questions you can ask yourself at this stage include: \u201cShould my earcon have rich low end?\u201d \u201cDo I want the high end to sound crisp and sparkle?\u201d \u201cShould there be textures in the mid tones?\u201d The answer in most cases will be yes to all three questions, as, when combined, these characteristics produce sounds that are perceived as full-bodied and rich, and that reflect well on your app.</p> <p>So, to supplement your initial soundscape, you can add new layers of sounds, asking yourself: \u201cWhat is currently missing?\u201d Having a specific intention behind the addition of new sounds can help you avoid the trap of creating a muddy composition, caused by similar sounds competing with and drowning each other out.</p> <p>Here was our first completed take, with a placeholder vocal added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/cushtilla/guardian-voice-lab-earcon-v1\">  <iframe height=\"460\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F574270341&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p><strong>Refinement within a news context</strong></p> <p>After discussions within the team, the feedback on version one suggested that although the sonic palette was about right, there was something slightly unsettling about the melody. It communicated an unresolved feeling, which didn\u2019t match our original intentions for the earcon. Being a news-focused organisation, it\u2019s particularly important to get this tone right. By re-focusing on what the earcon should communicate, as well as the context in which it will be heard, we looked to build on our first version by developing the melody in a more straightforward, positive direction.</p> <p><strong>Mono versus stereo composition</strong></p> <p>Much of the early compositional work on the earcon was done in stereo, with some sounds giving a fantastic feeling of space because of their complex stereo imaging. This isn\u2019t ideal when working for voice platforms, as many listeners will only hear your earcon in mono, dependent on the device they use.

      "bodyText": "What do ambient composer Brian Eno, jazz guitarist Stanley Jordan and the Korg Wavestation EX synthesizer have in common? Beyond a myriad of potentially witty and certainly nerdy ripostes, I\u2019ll highlight one commonality: all three have played pivotal roles in the creation of memorable earcons. From Windows to Mac, Netflix right through to the Guardian, earcons are the sounds we hear as devices load, programs launch and shows begin, and they play a pivotal role in establishing tone and asserting a brand identity. If you\u2019re coming from the radio or podcast world, you\u2019ll be familiar with how to approach designing such an asset, but for those of you coming to voice from the world of app development, it might appear a more daunting task. Regardless of your background, this post looks to provide pointers on how you might create an earcon of your own, exploring what you want to communicate with it, and outlining how we at the Voice Lab approached the process ourselves. And should you be questioning whether there\u2019s really a need for earcons in voice apps, I\u2019ll explain why we think they\u2019re worth the time and effort. Sonic identity in under five seconds When we decided to produce a sonic identity for the Voice Lab, we wanted to create an earcon that\u2019s interesting, and augments the experience, but doesn\u2019t become annoying on repeat listens. Based on what we know, earcons should best be kept short, so we gave ourselves five seconds. We wanted the Voice Lab\u2019s sonic brand identity to indicate experimentation and a forward-thinking approach to technology, while remaining consistent with the shared values of the Guardian. This led us to settling on synthesised electronic sounds as our initial sound palette, which, in doing so, conveniently kept costs to a minimum. Initial sketches If you\u2019re creating an earcon, you\u2019ll need an audio sequencer. Anything from GarageBand (free on Mac) through to the more professional Ableton, Logic, Cubase and Pro Tools options will suffice. From a sound design perspective, it can be quite freeing when you have five seconds. You don\u2019t have much time, so you can keep things simple. Loading up a synth, we began by recording two or three notes in a loop, leaving enough time at the end for the sounds to naturally disappear. Playing that loop over and over, we flicked through various synth presets to find a sound that felt a good starting point, continually moving the notes around before settling on a melody that felt right, tweaking the preset to modify the sound as we saw fit. We didn\u2019t want our earcon to sound rudimentary or flimsy, so the next step was to add some complexity to the initial layer of sound. A couple of questions you can ask yourself at this stage include: \u201cShould my earcon have rich low end?\u201d \u201cDo I want the high end to sound crisp and sparkle?\u201d \u201cShould there be textures in the mid tones?\u201d The answer in most cases will be yes to all three questions, as, when combined, these characteristics produce sounds that are perceived as full-bodied and rich, and that reflect well on your app. So, to supplement your initial soundscape, you can add new layers of sounds, asking yourself: \u201cWhat is currently missing?\u201d Having a specific intention behind the addition of new sounds can help you avoid the trap of creating a muddy composition, caused by similar sounds competing with and drowning each other out. Here was our first completed take, with a placeholder vocal added. Refinement within a news context After discussions within the team, the feedback on version one suggested that although the sonic palette was about right, there was something slightly unsettling about the melody. It communicated an unresolved feeling, which didn\u2019t match our original intentions for the earcon. Being a news-focused organisation, it\u2019s particularly important to get this tone right. By re-focusing on what the earcon should communicate, as well as the context in which it will be heard, we looked to build on our first version by developing the melody in a more straightforward, positive direction. Mono versus stereo composition Much of the early compositional work on the earcon was done in stereo, with some sounds giving a fantastic feeling of space because of their complex stereo imaging. This isn\u2019t ideal when working for voice platforms, as many listeners will only hear your earcon in mono, dependent on the device they use. By switching to mono in your sequencer, you can accurately work on your earcon, knowing how most of the audience will ultimately hear it. After another couple of versions created in mono, we settled on a new iteration, replacing a couple of sounds with more mono-friendly synths, while introducing new, more cheerful melodies. Plus we added additional details, piano rolls to provide a musical flourish and resolution at the end, and white noise sweeps to excite the high-end frequencies. This is what the earcon currently sounds like, and at this point we feel it\u2019s pretty close to achieving what we want to communicate. But has the time invested been worth it? Not sounding like everyone else When working in voice apps, many use the text-to-speech robot voice, with little consideration for further sound design. As a result, many actions or skills sound much the same, making it difficult for users to immediately differentiate one voice app from another, or indeed from the platform itself, as we have found in user testing. We can\u2019t be certain what type of speaker or device our earcon will ultimately be played on, from the Google Assistant on a phone speaker right through to high-end headphones and luxury car stereos. However, in creating a sonically rich earcon that reaches from low-end bass right through to the highest frequencies, which works well in mono, we\u2019re giving ourselves a fighting chance of effectively conveying our brand identity and uniqueness to users, regardless of the device.

I was wondering if you had a better solution. <strong>TA</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Last September, Bernadette, a writer and photographer, asked for a cheaper Windows alternative to her MacBook, and I was criticised for recommending that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/sep/13/is-there-a-cheap-windows-alternative-macbook-user-apple\">stuck with what she knew</a>. Guess what: I\u2019m going to do it again. Anyone who switches <em>either way</em> will lose some of the benefits of years of experience, and will spend time relearning. Lost productivity is a cost.</p> <p>I do understand that Apple\u2019s prices have become a strain on creative freelances\u2019 finances. And, obviously, there are lots of cheap Windows all-in-ones that would do a decent job for most home users. But if your career depends on something, it\u2019s not a step to take lightly.</p> <h2><strong>Lenovo vs iMac</strong></h2> <p>The Lenovo is good value and stands up pretty well against the entry-level Apple iMac. Both have Intel Core i5 processors, 8GB of memory, slow 1TB hard drives and 1920 x 1080-pixel screens. The ThinkCentre has the edge thanks to its 2.8GHz six-core i5-8400 (the iMac has an older 2.3GHz dual-core i5-7360U) and slightly larger screen (23.8in vs 21.5in). At \u00a3839.99, it\u2019s also \u00a3209 cheaper.</p> <p>In addition, Lenovo will sell you four years of on-site service for an extra \u00a351.60, where AppleCare adds \u00a3189 for three years, not on-site.</p> <p>The problem is that neither machine is really what you want. I think your best choice is the 21.5in iMac with 16GB of memory and 4K Retina display for \u00a31,429. Upgrading the slow 1TB hard drive to a 1TB Fusion drive would add \u00a390, busting your maximum budget at \u00a31,519. Sorry.</p> <p>To be fair, these low-end iMacs are \u201cpixel doubled\u201d so they work like 2048 x 1152-pixel screens, but as an illustrator, you would benefit from the superior colour accuracy and extra pixel density.</p> <p>The other problem with the Lenovo ThinkCentre M920Z is that while it can support a very high specification, Lenovo is only offering two pre-built systems, not ones that you can configure. However, the M920Z has two memory slots, so you could add another 8GB of RAM \u2013 or get someone to do it for you. In fact, you could upgrade it to 32GB, though that would be expensive.</p> <p>The alternative is to shop around for an M920Z with a better spec. For example, you could get one with slightly faster Core i5-8500, 16GB of memory and a 256GB SSD for <a href=\"https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/lenovo-10s60020uk-core-i5-16gb-256gb-ssd-desktop-all-in-one-10s60020uk/version.asp#/\">\u00a31,105 from Laptops Direct</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/855737-lenovo-thinkcentre-m910z-aio-desktop-10s60020uk\">\u00a31,201 from ebuyer.com</a>. Unfortunately, you\u2019d lose the Lenovo support option.</p> <p>Otherwise, my pick would be the 24in touch-screen Dell Inspiron 24 5000, which you could look at in <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/desktop-pcs/desktop-pcs/dell-inspiron-24-5000-23-8-intel-core-i7-all-in-one-pc-1-tb-hdd-128-gb-ssd-silver-10181393-pdt.html\">PC World</a>. This has a Core i7-8700T, 16GB of memory, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card with 4GB of memory, a 128GB SSD and a 1TB hard drive for<a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/desktops-and-all-in-ones/inspiron-24-5000-all-in-one/spd/inspiron-24-5477-aio/cd547706\"> \u00a31,379</a> (or possibly less if you find a Dell deal or a discount code). The closest iMac equivalent would cost \u00a31,789.</p> <p>However, if a fairy godmother waves a magic wand, ask for a <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-uk/work/shop/workstations/precision-5720-all-in-one/spd/precision-5720-aio/xctop5720emea\">Dell Precision Workstation AIO 5720</a> and a 27in <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-uk/work/shop/workstations/dell-canvas-27/spd/dell-canvas-kv2718d/s001p2718emea\">Dell Canvas</a> touch-screen with pen support. I had a play with one last month. (Yes, putting 10 loudspeakers in the built-in soundbar was a little extravagant.)</p> <h2><strong>All-in-one vs small form-factor</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f3c0bd3c1221f8b1f457e5dcddcdd600c93bcfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f3c0bd3c1221f8b1f457e5dcddcdd600c93bcfa/0_0_1435_861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple\u2019s iMac comes in various sizes and performance levels, all the way up to the latest iMac Pro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple\u2019s iMac comes in various sizes and performance levels, all the way up to the latest iMac Pro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t like all-in-ones (AIOs) very much because you lose the benefits of having a desktop tower, where you can upgrade or repair the PC separately from upgrading the monitor. Also, as with laptops, an AIO\u2019s performance may be constrained by heat generation problems. You get more bangs for fewer bucks if you put a hot fast chip in a big mains-powered case.</p> <p>Separately, you said you wanted a bigger screen than your laptop, but you didn\u2019t have a lot of space. An all-in-one does solve both problems admirably.</p> <p>But there is an alternative. You can attach a small form-factor (SFF) or micro form-factor (MFF) PC to the back of a monitor, as long as both support the industry standard VESA mount. This gives you much more flexibility in your hardware spec, and a wide choice of good screens.</p> <p>Dell\u2019s Optiplex 7060 MFF would do the job for <a href=\"https://www.ebuyer.com/841950-dell-optiplex-7060-mff-usff-desktop-cv3wx\">\u00a3754 at ebuyer</a>, though again, you\u2019d have to add an extra 8GB of memory separately. (<a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-uk/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7060-micro/n007o7060mffunitehttps://www.dell.com/en-uk/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7060-micro/n007o7060mffunite\">Dell\u2019s price \u2013 \u00a3728.99 \u2013 isn\u2019t cheaper</a> because it doesn\u2019t include VAT and delivery.)</p> <p>Alternatively, talk to PC Specialist. They offer <a href=\"https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/small-form-factor-pcs/\">four ranges of mini-PCs</a> built to order, and if you take one of the gaming options, you get a choice of nine different cases. They can probably find one that supports VESA, and you\u2019ll get the best spec you can afford. The catch is fitting a good graphics card into a very small case.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s SFF solution is the Mac Mini. This started out as an affordable machine but the latest versions are anything but. A <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/3.0ghz-6-core-processor-with-turbo-boost-up-to-4.1ghz-256gb#\">Mac Mini</a> with a fast six-core i5-8500B, 16GB of not-really-expandable memory and 256GB of not-really-expandable SSD storage costs \u00a31,279, which wouldn\u2019t leave much for the screen.</p> <h2><strong>Another laptop, perhaps?</strong></h2> <p>A third alternative is to use the laptop as an SFF PC, and connect it to an external monitor and keyboard. You wouldn\u2019t get the performance of a desktop tower, but you could still use a big high-resolution monitor.</p> <p>For more on choosing a monitor, see my recent answer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/jan/24/can-i-buy-a-monitor-for-photo-editing-that-shows-colour-like-print\">Can I buy a monitor for photo editing that shows colour like print?</a> (For the record, I just bought an LG 27UK650-W for \u00a3434.27.)</p> <p>What you save on the laptop you can spend on the screen, or vice versa.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the world is not awash with laptops that have 16GB of memory, except for games machines that are mostly beyond your budget. The cheapest option I can find at the moment is a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/hp-pavilion-15-cs0511sa-15-6-intel-core-i7-geforce-mx150-laptop-256-gb-ssd-silver-10180936-pdt.html\">silver HP Pavilion 15-cs0511sa at PC World</a>. This has a Core i7-8550U with 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card with 4GB of video memory for \u00a3849.</p> <p>An alternative would be a 14in Lenovo <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/edge-series/E490/p/20N8CTO1WWENGB1/customize?\">ThinkPad E490</a> configured with a quad-core i5-8265U, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for \u00a3841.78. Upgrading to a Core i7-8565U would add \u00a398.65 to the price, while an AMD Radeon RX 550X graphics card with 2GB of video RAM would add \u00a391.13. The E machines are entry level and not built or tested to the same level as the ThinkPad T and X ranges, but I assume you don\u2019t work in a hazardous environment.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, the best value MacBook is the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch-space-grey-2.3ghz-dual-core-128gb#\">13in MacBook Pro</a> with a 2.3GHz dual-core i5-7360U, 8GB of memory and either 128GB (\u00a31,249) or 256GB (\u00a31,449) of SSD storage. A system with 16GB of memory and a 256GB SSD would therefore cost \u00a31,629, which is almost twice the price of the ThinkPad E490. Three years of AppleCare at \u00a3249 would bump it up to \u00a31,878.</p> <p>It\u2019s not worth dropping down to a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/space-grey-1.6ghz-dual-core-processor-with-turbo-boost-up-to-3.6ghz-128gb#\">MacBook Air</a>. The new 2018 Air has a 1.6GHz dual-core m5 processor and a less bright screen with lower colour accuracy for \u00a31,579 (16GB RAM/256GB SSD) \u2013 a saving of \u00a350.</p> <p>The 21.5in Retina iMac is a bargain compared with that, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

To be fair, these low-end iMacs are \u201cpixel doubled\u201d so they work like 2048 x 1152-pixel screens, but as an illustrator, you would benefit from the superior colour accuracy and extra pixel density. The other problem with the Lenovo ThinkCentre M920Z is that while it can support a very high specification, Lenovo is only offering two pre-built systems, not ones that you can configure. However, the M920Z has two memory slots, so you could add another 8GB of RAM \u2013 or get someone to do it for you. In fact, you could upgrade it to 32GB, though that would be expensive. The alternative is to shop around for an M920Z with a better spec. For example, you could get one with slightly faster Core i5-8500, 16GB of memory and a 256GB SSD for \u00a31,105 from Laptops Direct or \u00a31,201 from ebuyer.com. Unfortunately, you\u2019d lose the Lenovo support option. Otherwise, my pick would be the 24in touch-screen Dell Inspiron 24 5000, which you could look at in PC World. This has a Core i7-8700T, 16GB of memory, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card with 4GB of memory, a 128GB SSD and a 1TB hard drive for \u00a31,379 (or possibly less if you find a Dell deal or a discount code). The closest iMac equivalent would cost \u00a31,789. However, if a fairy godmother waves a magic wand, ask for a Dell Precision Workstation AIO 5720 and a 27in Dell Canvas touch-screen with pen support. I had a play with one last month. (Yes, putting 10 loudspeakers in the built-in soundbar was a little extravagant.) All-in-one vs small form-factor I don\u2019t like all-in-ones (AIOs) very much because you lose the benefits of having a desktop tower, where you can upgrade or repair the PC separately from upgrading the monitor. Also, as with laptops, an AIO\u2019s performance may be constrained by heat generation problems. You get more bangs for fewer bucks if you put a hot fast chip in a big mains-powered case. Separately, you said you wanted a bigger screen than your laptop, but you didn\u2019t have a lot of space. An all-in-one does solve both problems admirably. But there is an alternative. You can attach a small form-factor (SFF) or micro form-factor (MFF) PC to the back of a monitor, as long as both support the industry standard VESA mount. This gives you much more flexibility in your hardware spec, and a wide choice of good screens. Dell\u2019s Optiplex 7060 MFF would do the job for \u00a3754 at ebuyer, though again, you\u2019d have to add an extra 8GB of memory separately. (Dell\u2019s price \u2013 \u00a3728.99 \u2013 isn\u2019t cheaper because it doesn\u2019t include VAT and delivery.) Alternatively, talk to PC Specialist. They offer four ranges of mini-PCs built to order, and if you take one of the gaming options, you get a choice of nine different cases. They can probably find one that supports VESA, and you\u2019ll get the best spec you can afford. The catch is fitting a good graphics card into a very small case. Apple\u2019s SFF solution is the Mac Mini. This started out as an affordable machine but the latest versions are anything but. A Mac Mini with a fast six-core i5-8500B, 16GB of not-really-expandable memory and 256GB of not-really-expandable SSD storage costs \u00a31,279, which wouldn\u2019t leave much for the screen. Another laptop, perhaps? A third alternative is to use the laptop as an SFF PC, and connect it to an external monitor and keyboard. You wouldn\u2019t get the performance of a desktop tower, but you could still use a big high-resolution monitor. For more on choosing a monitor, see my recent answer, Can I buy a monitor for photo editing that shows colour like print? (For the record, I just bought an LG 27UK650-W for \u00a3434.27.) What you save on the laptop you can spend on the screen, or vice versa. Unfortunately, the world is not awash with laptops that have 16GB of memory, except for games machines that are mostly beyond your budget. The cheapest option I can find at the moment is a silver HP Pavilion 15-cs0511sa at PC World. This has a Core i7-8550U with 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card with 4GB of video memory for \u00a3849. An alternative would be a 14in Lenovo ThinkPad E490 configured with a quad-core i5-8265U, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for \u00a3841.78. Upgrading to a Core i7-8565U would add \u00a398.65 to the price, while an AMD Radeon RX 550X graphics card with 2GB of video RAM would add \u00a391.13. The E machines are entry level and not built or tested to the same level as the ThinkPad T and X ranges, but I assume you don\u2019t work in a hazardous environment. As previously mentioned, the best value MacBook is the 13in MacBook Pro with a 2.3GHz dual-core i5-7360U, 8GB of memory and either 128GB (\u00a31,249) or 256GB (\u00a31,449) of SSD storage. A system with 16GB of memory and a 256GB SSD would therefore cost \u00a31,629, which is almost twice the price of the ThinkPad E490. Three years of AppleCare at \u00a3249 would bump it up to \u00a31,878. It\u2019s not worth dropping down to a MacBook Air. The new 2018 Air has a 1.6GHz dual-core m5 processor and a less bright screen with lower colour accuracy for \u00a31,579 (16GB RAM/256GB SSD) \u2013 a saving of \u00a350. The 21.5in Retina iMac is a bargain compared with that, isn\u2019t it? Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

OK, it was his mum\u2019s Nissan Micra, but it was a car!) I was so excited \u2013 a date <em>and</em> a house party. We made awkward small talk as he drove me to his parents\u2019 house in the country. I thought: how cool must your parents be to just let you have a party in their massive house? We arrived, and I was greeted at the front door by said parents. Both of them. It was their 25th-anniversary party, where I was to be paraded and introduced to his entire family.

The tube staff were really kind and sympathetic considering he was a felon, and called an ambulance. They assumed we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I felt obliged to go with him. I stayed with him for five hours in A&amp;E until he was discharged.

I had to be up for the school run. After a few minutes she said: \u201cYou snogged my cousin at the Edinburgh festival\u2019 ARGH! Obviously, her cousin did not respect the law of \u201cwhat happens at the fringe, stays at the fringe\u201d. At Edinburgh, I\u2019m 90s-me again. All other times, I\u2019m a tired fortysomething.

We elected, foolishly, to watch the film Buried, about an American truck-driver (Ryan Reynolds) in Iraq who spends the film imprisoned in a coffin. The only sliver of hope for this claustrophobic nightmare of a cinema experience would have been a mutual clasp of terror during one of the white-knuckle moments (the snake? the sand? Ryan\u2019s phone running out of battery?). Alas, due to our late arrival at the Gaumont Parnasse, my companion sat not next to me but one row in front. And someone kicked over my popcorn. A dismal failure on every front. Ivo Graham: Motion Sickness is on a UK tour. Ken Cheng: \u2018She reheated some pasta and started kissing me\u2019 During the last Edinburgh fringe, I met a flyerer and we had a fun initial chat. We both had an hour to kill and she asked if I wanted to get a bite to eat. I went \u201cSure\u201d and she said \u201cOK, do you want to come back to my place?\u201d I was a bit taken aback but it seemed innocent enough so I went along with it. When I got there, she reheated some pasta, we ate and then she started kissing me. She quickly stopped and said: \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not into this.\u201d So I left and we never spoke again. This all took place within an hour of meeting. Ken Cheng: Best Dad Ever is on a UK tour. Sofie Hagen: \u2018He said his powers came from his mother\u2019s cat\u2019 We had worked together one summer, and ran into each other one Friday night. We went for drinks and everything was fine, until he shushed me and started listening intensely to the music. It was Madonna or something. Then he smiled and said: \u201cSorry, it\u2019s just that I communicate with God through music. Carry on.\u201d He told me his powers came from his mother\u2019s cats and that he believed all people were cats or dogs. \u201cYou\u2019re obviously a dog,\u201d he said with a big, caring smile. He wanted to win The X Factor. \u201cDo you sing?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never cried before and I can only cry if I win The X Factor. I\u2019d love to try crying.\u201d I still don\u2019t know if he was trying to be funny or not. Either way, he never texted me back. Sofie Hagen: Bubblewrap/Happy Fat is on a UK tour. Suzi Ruffell: \u2018I was smashing this date until\u2026\u2019 Edinburgh festival, 2012. She was flirty and pretty in a girl-next-door way (if the girl next door was really fit). She came to my show, said she loved it and suggested a drink the next night. We had several \u2013 laughing, chatting, sharing a fag. The bar was closing but she knew somewhere else. Brilliant! A jazz club. I\u2019ve never been into jazz but I could be tonight. I\u2019ve always been awkward on dates but I was smashing this one. As I walked her home, we shared an umbrella. (Since I was a teenager I\u2019ve thought rain is romantic because of a kissing scene in Ally McBeal; I remember thinking: \u201cImagine wanting to kiss someone so much you didn\u2019t mind your hair getting wet.\u201d) At her house, we gazed into each other\u2019s eyes. Then she broke the silence. \u201cThis was amazing. You\u2019re the perfect date. If I was gay, you\u2019d be the one.\u201d Ah \u2026 not a date after all. Suzi Ruffell: Nocturnal is on a UK tour. Emma Sidi: \u2018Ask to see ID first\u2019 I was 13 and Nick from my drama group invited me to see Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Remember it? It\u2019s the one that was extra shit and in which Anakin refers to child jedis as \u201cyounglings\u201d. I brought my best friend Libby with me, as was the Year 9 way, and we just took the piss out of the film, not saying a word to poor Nick. Afterwards a friend texted me on my Nokia brick to inform me something I needed to know about Nick. It turns out he wasn\u2019t 13 at all \u2013 he was 12. Twelve! I felt lost, betrayed and humiliated. This Year 8 kid had lied to me and it was over. The experience taught me everything I now know about love: ask to see ID before going to the latest Star Wars instalment, or girl you gonna get burned. Emma Sidi: Faces of Grace is at Soho theatre, London, 14-16 February. Olga Koch: \u2018I injected as much whimsy as possible\u2019 This date was disastrous thanks to me and only me. While at university, I fancied myself a real manic pixie dream girl \u2013 so when a lovely young man asked me out, I decided to inject it with as much whimsy as humanly possible. First, I demanded he drive us to a cemetery, because I wanted to be quirky but in a goth way. It turned out to be much sadder than the Smiths made it seem, so we got back into his car. After that, I asked him to drive us to a strip club. There, he tried his best to maintain eye contact with me as a beautiful woman approached us offering a lap dance. He politely said \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d, to which the beautiful woman responded with a shrug: \u201cI\u2019m better.\u201d Later we made out in his car. Olga Koch: Fight is on a UK tour. Stephen Bailey: \u2018There was a bed of nails\u2019 Once upon a time, there was a little, ginger, camp comedian who had just finished a Soho theatre run and was ready to find The One. He searched far and wide (OK, I went into Soho after my gig) and met a boy. He looked like Aladdin, we exchanged numbers. Days later, I was invited to his house (a warehouse in east London, and he was vegan \u2013 I should have known). The conversation was great, he was a little eccentric and wore a kimono but I just thought: \u201cTake what you can get.\u201d He took me into his \u201cspecial room\u201d and there was a bed of nails. He said they were for chiropractic \u2013 a likely story! I was dying to leave but the Uber surge charge was on. So I hopped on and I\u2019ve not quite been the same since. Stephen Bailey: Our Kid is on a UK tour. Angela Barnes: \u2018I couldn\u2019t escape\u2019 When I was an awkward 18-year-old, all low self-esteem and Nirvana T-shirts, I met a friend of a friend in the pub. He had dark curly hair and lovely eyes, so when he asked me to go out with him, I was over the moon. I gave him my number (by which I mean the landline at my mum\u2019s house) and steeled myself for a week of sitting by a phone that never rang. But it did. The next day. He was having a party at his house on Saturday night. Would I like to go along as his date? He lived in a village out of town so would come and pick me up. (He had a car! OK, it was his mum\u2019s Nissan Micra, but it was a car!) I was so excited \u2013 a date and a house party. We made awkward small talk as he drove me to his parents\u2019 house in the country. I thought: how cool must your parents be to just let you have a party in their massive house? We arrived, and I was greeted at the front door by said parents. Both of them. It was their 25th-anniversary party, where I was to be paraded and introduced to his entire family. I couldn\u2019t escape \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know where I was \u2013 so I had to smile sweetly and wait for him to drive me home. Angela Barnes: Rose-Tinted is on a UK tour. Elf Lyons: \u2018He resembled a serial killer from Luther\u2019 Never date someone older than your dad. Never date a drug addict. Never date someone you meet in a lift. These were the golden rules my mum told me. I broke all of them two years ago. He told me \u201cYou make me feel impossible\u201d and quoted a Stephen King book at me. I assumed it was true love. We arranged to meet at 7pm. He was 45 minutes late. He told me he had been stopping a fight. This turned out to be a lie. He had gone to the cinema on his own to see Paddington and got the timings wrong. He wore Crocs, army shorts and a Robbie Williams Let Me Entertain You tour T-shirt. It was a Friday in December. He resembled a serial killer from Luther. We went to a hipster restaurant where he talked about his brother\u2019s divorce, his dead relatives and his acute IBS \u2013 all while taking out a lot of aggression on the bread sticks. After he asked if I had \u201cever considered getting checked for Marfan syndrome\u201d, I stood to make a dignified exit. Instead, I banged my head on a decorative shelf and started bleeding from my head. As I bled all over my dress, the table, the food and my dignity, much like Sissy Spacek in Carrie, I also managed to bleed on his clothes. I apologised. He said there was nothing to apologise for. A week later he sent me a receipt for the dry cleaning. Elf Lyons: Love Songs to Guinea Pigs is at the Vault festival, London, 14-15 February. Lou Sanders: \u2018I did the walk of shame\u2019 I was 15 and my boyfriend and I were in a posh spa for Valentine\u2019s day. After some heavy petting in the deep end, I needed a widdle and because it was a nice place, I thought I would use the toilet. I sauntered off as sassily as I could in my mum\u2019s ill-fitting Aztec-print bikini, through a door up some stairs. I was following my nose to the toilet because, like a fox (or rat), I work on instinct. I opened a fire door, which locked closed behind me and I took in my surroundings. I was in a five-star restaurant where people were busy eating Sunday lunch. There I was stuck like a fox (or rat) in the headlights: a dripping-wet, apologetic, bikini-clad rat. I did the walk of shame through to the other end of the restaurant, out the front door and back into reception. Hiya! Lou Sanders: Shame Pig is on a UK tour. Ahir Shah: \u2018I was beginning to inflate\u2019 When we first met, my girlfriend was living in Bristol. Early in our relationship, we walked to the beautiful suburb of Clifton for lunch; it was all dappled sunlight and gentle breeze. Things were going tremendously well until the end of the meal, when my face and hands began dramatically swelling. My breathing was normal, I was merely beginning to inflate like Violet Beauregarde (but still brown). Once we had acquired deflationary drugs, detective work was in order. It turned out that the multivitamins I had started taking contained small amounts of krill oil. It also turns out that I am allergic to krill. Like a shit whale. If you want a date to go perfectly, avoid spending the preceding week microdosing yourself with poison while telling anyone who\u2019ll listen that you\u2019re \u201con a health kick\u201d. Ahir Shah: Duffer is on a UK tour. Lucy Porter: \u2018He broke his arm\u2019 We were just winding up the date when he broke his arm. My friend had arranged a blind date for me with her work colleague. There had been no spark of romance, I had to foot the whole bill and he told me I looked fatter in real life than on TV. We were just about to part ways (reasonably) amicably at the tube when he decided to vault over the barrier. The tube staff were really kind and sympathetic considering he was a felon, and called an ambulance. They assumed we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I felt obliged to go with him. I stayed with him for five hours in A&amp;E until he was discharged. I would love to be a time traveller so I could go back to 2002 and tell my younger self to leave before coffee. Lucy Porter: Pass It On is on a UK tour. Sindhu Vee: \u2018He turned on his heel and walked out\u2019 When I was 18 I had an all-consuming crush on a boy who was also a very close pal. We were already very comfortable talking about romantic relationships, just never the one we were clearly meant to have. I decided I had to tell him and invited him over to my place. I went to make us some tea and returned with two mugs on a tray. As he took a mug, I said: \u201cI really, really like you.\u201d The mug stopped in mid-air.

There was no second date. Shappi Khorsandi: Skittish Warrior is on a UK tour.

I\u2019d never considered that it might be unpleasant to receive my unwanted attention.</p> <p>I take responsibility for my mistakes but I also wonder, in retrospect, if there was something in the cultural water of the 90s which encouraged boys such as me to think girls should like us.

My teacher made us cut scraps of shiny red paper into heart shapes, glue them to flimsy cards, and write messages inside to our mums \u2013 although I remember wanting to give my card to a girl named Demelza. Ernest Hemingway said he had to be in love to be able to write. When I was a teenager in the 1990s, I had to be in love to go to school. My love was usually unrequited, so Valentine\u2019s Day offered an annual shot at redemption. In year 9, I loved Tammy, so I wrote a haiku inside a Valentine\u2019s card and placed it on her desk, along with a Terry\u2019s Chocolate Orange. \u201cThanks,\u201d said Tammy. I said I loved her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what love is,\u201d she said, and went to maths. I sent more Valentine\u2019s over the years and felt sorry for myself when they got me nowhere. \u201cWhy won\u2019t she like me?\u201d I wailed, alone in my room, Radiohead\u2019s Pablo Honey playing on repeat. At university, after reading Chaucer\u2019s The Knight\u2019s Tale, in which two men compete to decide who will marry a princess without ever really consulting her, I posted a Valentine\u2019s card to Becky, with whom I\u2019d been besotted in sixth form.

      "bodyText": "A cotton farmer who has pleaded guilty to pumping over 153-Olympic-swimming-pools-worth of water from the Barwon River in western New South Wales during a dry spell in 2015 says he did so because he was assured by the then NSW minister for water, Kevin Humphries, there was no embargo. The revelations are contained in Anthony Barlow\u2019s sentencing submission to the NSW Land and Environment Court. The sentencing hearing was held last week and he is now waiting to learn his fate. Barlow could face nearly $750,000 in fines but he argues that the court should show leniency because he relied on the advice of Humphries who attended a meeting of the Barwon-Darling Water Users group in March 2015. His recollection of the conversation, which is detailed in the submission, is backed up by notes taken by departmental officials and the minutes of the water users group, also referenced in the submission. Questions about Burren Downs, owned by the Barlow family, were first publicly raised by the Four Corners program, Pumped, in 2017, which focused on water compliance in the Murray-Darling Basin. They were then raised in the NSW parliament. \u201cWhat steps has the government taken to investigate allegations that when the member for Barwon was minister for water he gave a room full of irrigators permission to pump water despite a ban being in place?\u201d, the former Labor leader Luke Foley asked. The Nationals leader, John Barilaro, said \u201creferrals have been made to the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u201d. At the time Humphries denied he made the remarks and said Foley was wrong but the submission will again raise the question about his role as NSW\u2019s water minister from 2011 to 2015. He is not recontesting the seat of Barwon at this March\u2019s election. The South Australian Royal Commission into the Murray-Darling Basin raised serious concerns about NSW\u2019s administration of the basin plan, and in particular the development and enforcement of the water-sharing plan in the Barwon-Darling. At the time Humphries said: \u201cThe opposition leader made an inaccurate claim that I informed a group of Barwon-Darling irrigators that they could access water during a water embargo. \u201cThe meeting that actually took place was in Bourke early 2015 and at no stage did I articulate such a claim, as anyone who attended will confirm.\u201d But Barlow has produced a detailed recollection in his affidavit. He says he attended the meeting of cotton growers in Bourke on 25 March 2015. One water user advised the group he had been told by Humphries there was \u201cno embargo on pumping on the Barwon-Darling\u201d, even though the embargo had been declared in February and advertised in the Government Gazette. The minister then attended and spoke at the meeting, Barlow said. According to Barlow \u201che [Humphries] made repeated statements to the effect that \u2018there is currently no embargo on the Barwon-Darling\u2019.\u201d Barlow also recalled Humphries saying: \u201cIt is on a flow-by-flow basis and if there is a requirement downstream for water, if a flow is deemed to be beneficial, it will be embargoed but if it is isn\u2019t it won\u2019t be embargoed.\u201d At the time Broken Hill, which draws its water supply downstream from the Menindee lakes, was in danger of running out of water. Barlow said his account was corroborated by minutes taken by the water users group and by handwritten notes taken by Andrew Scott, a bureaucrat from the NSW Office of Water. A second case against Bourke cotton farmers Jane and Peter Harris is being heard this week. The defendants have pleaded not guilty.",

Communications References Committee inquiry report into the Great Barrier Reef 2050 Partnership Program was tabled today by the Chair of the inquiry, Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson. </p> \n   <p> Senator Whish-Wilson said, \u201cThis was the Senate at its best, acting swiftly and working cooperatively to scrutinise, in full, government policy of significant public importance.</p> \n   <p> \u201cThis grant was a desperate attempt to cover up this government\u2019s legacy of reef mismanagement, years of chronic underfunding and disregard for climate change, in the context of an imminent world heritage \u2018in danger\u2019 listing.</p> \n   <p> \u201cIt was clearly a political decision made with no consultation, due diligence or regard for proper process.</p> \n   <p> \u201cIt\u2019s a textbook case of how not to implement public policy, and a perfect example of why we shouldn\u2019t trust the future of a dying reef to a government intent on outsourcing public policy.</p> \n   <p> \u201cThis report and its recommendations are a good opportunity to press reset and build the best blueprint for future reef management, in full consultation with all stakeholders.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> Some of the conclusions from the committee were:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li> \u201cThe granting of $444m to the Reef Foundation was a highly irresponsible decision, hastily concocted by relevant ministers, without proper consideration of risks and potential effectiveness, no consultation with key stakeholders, and without having undertaken due diligence.</li> \n   <li> \u201cThis \u2018off-the-cuff\u2019 decision has caused massive disruption to existing policy and program delivery, including by existing government agencies. It has all the hallmarks of a government that is not properly managing its responsibility as the guardian of the world heritage listed Great Barrier Reef.</li> \n   <li> \u201cThere were widespread concerns about \u2018whether the foundation was the right organisation to manage such a significant investment\u2019, including \u2018the foundation\u2019s ability to handle such a rapid increase in size and responsibilities, the high cost of administration, and the duplication and governance complexities the Partnership introduces\u2019.</li> \n   <li> \u201cThe most appropriate action for the commonwealth to take is to terminate the foundation partnership. The committee believes this is necessary to help restore trust in the process of commonwealth funding for the reef, if not the entire commonwealth grants process. The committee also considers that this is necessary to ensure that commonwealth funding is spent in the best possible way to help protect and preserve the world\u2019s largest coral reef system.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T05:35:34.631Z\">at 5.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c64fb64e4b00ef6acc6db66\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T05:28:11.624Z\">5.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>So far, today has included some sort of altercation between a senator and a staffer in the marble hall, disputes over who historically sexually harassed who at Rooty Hill RSL club, blood on a senator\u2019s door that the bleeder doesn\u2019t recall leaving there but admits to, a senior staffer being banned from the parliament, the deputy prime minister [falsely] declaring rapists and murderers will be coming into the country because of the medevac bill and being called out for the false claims on Sky News and the longest ever question time so the government avoids losing a vote that wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p> \n  <p>Just a totally normal day in the 45th parliament.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T05:30:17.836Z\">at 5.30am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c64fa7be4b00ef6acc6db5d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T05:20:27.744Z\">5.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">One Nation staffer James Ashby banned from parliament</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The president of the Senate, <strong>Scott Ryan</strong>, on why he revoked <strong>James Ashby\u2019s</strong> pass:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Senators must be free to go about their work in this building.

Now we are in a race against time to try and go through each of those 300 to determine whether or not there are charges pending; whether or not they\u2019re awaiting trial; whether or not they\u2019re awaiting sentence; whether or not there are credible allegations; whether or not there\u2019s credible intelligence that an offence may have been committed\u2026\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cSurely you have some understanding on these islands already?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cAs I said in parliament yesterday, there\u2019s been reporting and we are working through all of the cases that we think may be the subject of a medical transfer.

Normally you do say alleged.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, I would say charged with a serious offence.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cOkay, well, say charged but you can\u2019t say rapist or criminal until they\u2019re convicted. That\u2019s the way the law works.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re \u2013 again, the point is this \u2013 that a person could be convicted of rape or murder but not yet sentenced and the minister\u2026\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cBut have you got any evidence of that happening?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, we are going through all of the people and we are in a race against time to do that. But the reality is that people who may have or have been charged or who are awaiting sentence or who are awaiting trial for serious criminal offences can now be brought to Australia and we have no ability to stop \u2026.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cSo 800 people are in limbo, in continuing limbo, on the basis of this esoteric argument that you have got no \u2013 you\u2019ve given me no evidence this morning that there are any individuals in this circumstance.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, there is\u2026\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201c\u2026convicted and awaiting sentence.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, there are many people there who have been charged. There are people who are awaiting trial under sovereign criminal processes of PNG\u2026\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter: <br></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201c\u2026and Nauru. Well, we are trying to ascertain that at the moment, Kieran. But the reality is this legislation was rammed through under a gag motion \u2013 we\u2019re now becoming aware that there are 300 people who have already taken the preliminary steps to effect their transfer, and resources and the effort that it takes to have security checks on a person\u2019s background to try and work out whether or not they\u2019re subject to charge \u2026.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cOK, well, on the basis of what we\u2019ve worked out so far, you\u2019ve got no evidence to suggest any of them have been convicted and awaiting sentence. So on that basis, shouldn\u2019t the government, from here on in, say alleged or charged with as opposed to rapists, paedophiles, criminals?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, we have used language, I think, in appropriate ways. I\u2019ve very clearly set out in parliament, in question time, how the law works. Very clearly set it out. Now, if someone wants to argue.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cBut it\u2019d be nice if the government used the appropriate language \u2013 in the sense of alleged or charged with \u2013 as opposed to convicting the individuals before they have the right in court.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, again, I can put to you quite clearly that someone can be convicted of a serious criminal offence and we have no discretion \u2026\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Gilbert:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t have any evidence of that. None.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, we are trying to gather that evidence at the moment but we \u2026\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong> Gilbert:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWell, at that point, why did you make the argument?\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Porter:</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cBut Kieran, we did not bring this legislation into parliament. We did not effect this change. And the reality is that it puts us, our government, our border protection, our security intelligence agencies, under enormous time pressure to try and work out who in that list of 300 people \u2013 and it will be a larger list than that \u2013 may have these issues attached to them.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T03:14:15.380Z\">at 3.14am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c64c911e4b00ef6acc6da71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katharine-murphy\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T01:49:41.577Z\">1.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Chris Bowen</strong> and <strong>Mark Butler </strong>have held a press conference to blast the government for dumping the big stick. </p> \n  <p>Labor doesn\u2019t support this policy but the Bowen/Butler argument is the government did, and this is yet another energy policy that has now bitten the dust.

committee</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security has issued its report on the Coalition\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/22/morrison-government-to-make-it-easier-to-strip-citizenship-from-people-convicted-of-terrorism\">bill to lower the bar for stripping terrorists of Australian citizenship</a>.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s an odd document \u2013 because Labor has backed down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/12/labor-warns-coalition-bill-to-strip-terrorist-of-citizenship-is-unconstitutional\">its threat to issue a dissenting report</a> (a hard no) opting instead for a minority report (best characterised as a \u201cyes, but\u201d) but then made recommendations at odds with the Coalition members.<br></p> \n  <p>The committee recommended:<br></p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>That it review the operation of the current citizenship stripping powers by 1 December 2020<br></li> \n   <li>Subject to that review, the new bill giving the home affairs minister more powers should then be passed.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>That in itself is significant \u2013 that a committee chaired by Liberal MP <strong>Andrew Hastie </strong>would call for a further review and put the bill on the backburner when <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> and <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>have talked up its urgency.</p> \n  <p>In its minority report Labor warned the bill is likely unconstitutional, referring to its advice from <strong>Peter Hanks </strong>and evidence from academics including <strong>Kim Rubenstein</strong> and <strong>George Williams</strong>.<br></p> \n  <p>Labor recommended:<br></p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>The bill in its current form not be passed </li> \n   <li>The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor review the current citizenship stripping powers<br></li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Twice in its minority report Labor members referred to \u201cthis dissenting report\u201d, which does tend to put up in lights that it intended to dissent and then softened its stance.</p> \n  <p>Shadow attorney general <strong>Mark Dreyfus </strong>has issued a statement explaining the stance:</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeter Dutton and Scott Morrison are trying to rush legislation through the parliament that could result in terrorists taking the Australian government to the high court \u2013 and winning.</p> \n  <p>The committee heard expert evidence that the proposed legislation was likely unconstitutional, would not survive a high court challenge, and risked completely destroying the government\u2019s ability to revoke the citizenship of any terrorist.<br> Labor always puts the safety of Australians first and approaches national security in a bipartisan manner. There is nothing more important than keeping Australians safe.<br>Labor will issue a minority report on this bill on the basis that the government has made no efforts to show it is constitutional. Labor stands ready to negotiate on other parts of the bill which do not risk a high court challenge.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T01:18:50.039Z\">at 1.18am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c64bf6ce4b04a6f567df1e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T01:10:34.178Z\">1.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mike Bowers</strong> has a \u201cwork experience kid\u201d today \u2013 gallery stalwart <strong>Lyndal Curtis</strong> has turned her very fine mind to photography.

This is a spectacular increase from the 30 Indigenous businesses winning just $6.2 million in contracts in 2012-13,\u201d Minister Scullion said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo from 1 July 2019, the <em>Indigenous Procurement Policy 2.0 </em>will introduce a target of 3 per cent of the value of commonwealth contracts are to be awarded to Indigenous businesses within a decade, adding to the existing IPP target that 3 per cent of the number of commonwealth contracts are to go to Indigenous businesses.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are investing further in what we know, what the data shows and what Indigenous communities tell us, works.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T00:13:34.677Z\">at 12.13am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c64a91fe4b042feedcbd724\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T23:33:41.662Z\">11.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>After months of yelling about the big stick, which then became a somewhat smaller stick, the government has pulled its legislation from the notice paper, after facing the risk of having the bill amended to prohibit funding for coal-fired power generation projects.</p> \n  <p>So what is left of the big stick will now go to the election, as a Coalition policy. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c64a842e4b04a6f567df142\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T23:31:36.510Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is all very fine and normal.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9346fced3c05bf4ddd998e5ec57c75bb86eaf20\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9346fced3c05bf4ddd998e5ec57c75bb86eaf20/0_0_1891_1261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UAP senator Brian Burston as the senate resumes sitting in Parliament House Canberra this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UAP senator Brian Burston as the Senate resumes sitting in Parliament House Canberra this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b750809c7de265a48caec0026f4693f3925b07ff\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b750809c7de265a48caec0026f4693f3925b07ff/0_0_2554_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cory Bernardi has some questions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cory Bernardi has some questions.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4335416d284cc9624c2f226f98f7015011baa22b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4335416d284cc9624c2f226f98f7015011baa22b/0_0_3599_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oh the lolsOne Nation leader Pauline Hanson as the senate resumes sitting in Parliament House Canberra this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oh the lols.<br>One Nation leader Pauline Hanson as the Senate resumes sitting in Parliament House Canberra this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T23:33:53.832Z\">at 11.33pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c64a576e4b04a6f567df133\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T23:22:33.543Z\">11.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bill Shorten </strong>was asked about the One Nation ... saga?

The footage which I\u2019ve seen is really \u2013 it has no place in parliament. What we\u2019re seeing is that some of these small parties are just consumed by themselves. It would be comic except it\u2019s not, it\u2019s violence and unparliamentary conduct. Clearly the One Nation party has descended back into chaos, which it tends to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And on the medical evacuation bill reaction from the government:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think this country in 2019 is not the same nation as 2001. I do not believe that Australians want a government which governs by slogans and fear. We can have strong borders in this country \u2013 and I\u2019m grateful for the work of Australian Border Force, the ADF and our public service \u2013 but strong borders does not need to come at the price of humane treatment of people who\u2019ve been in our care for half a decade or more. </p> \n   <p>I totally repudiate the attacks of the government, seeking to whip up fear and hysteria, seeking to lure people smugglers to entice people onto boats to come to Australia. </p> \n   <p>Under a government I lead, we will turn back boats where it is safe to do so. People who seek to come to Australia by boat will go to Nauru and will be regionally processed to third-party nations. </p> \n   <p>But this nation has voted yesterday to say that for people who\u2019ve been in our care for literally thousands of days, where their treating doctors say there is an issue or an illness requiring medical evacuation, we\u2019ve been prepared to codify what the government is already doing. </p> \n   <p>Never forget this government has bought 900 people from Manus and Nauru to Australia. Hundreds of sick people and members of their family. None of them have gone back. So I actually think that what we\u2019re fighting about or disagreeing about, the substance isn\u2019t as great as the government says.</p> \n   <p>But in 2019, this is a government who\u2019s run out of offering Australians hope.

And yes, there is an International Men\u2019s Day and it is in November).<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Last year Kelly [O\u2019Dwyer] addressed the National Press Club and she had something to say that I think is timeless. She said, \u201cGender equality isn\u2019t about pitting girls against boys. Or women against men. It\u2019s about recognising that girls and women deserve an equal stake in our economy and our society. It\u2019s not about conflict.\u201d It\u2019s about what the message of the day is about. Which is about doing this together. She said, \u201cLife is not a zero sum game, we\u2019re on a life journey together.\u201d And she\u2019s right about that. Kelly said she was speaking as the mother of a son and a daughter. I suspect, on occasion, those boys and girls are against each other, but I\u2019m sure Mum and Dad sort it out.</p> \n   <p> I\u2019m the blessed father of two beautiful young girls and they are of course the joy of my and Jenny\u2019s life. And my girls, like all of our children, allow us as parents to see the world through new eyes, through young eyes, through fresh eyes. And when I see the girls I want them to be able to pursue their passions. I want them to be absolutely confident that they can chase their dreams, whatever they are. And receive the same rewards for their hard work and their beliefs and their passions as their male counterparts, as indeed I\u2019ve had the blessing to do over my life. I want them as adults to have real choices so they can decide what works best for them and their families and not be judged for it. I want them to be free from harassment and violence. I want them to be able to walk the streets of Australia. And I want them to be safe in their home, both today and always in the future.</p> \n   <p> Now our priorities. As the prime minister I\u2019ve laid out three priorities from the very first day. Keeping our economy strong, keeping Australians safe and keeping Australians together. It is very much the theme of today. Economic opportunities, the choices and security that can come with it, [are] at the heart of what my government is seeking to do for a more prosperous, safe and cohesive Australia.</p> \n   <p> Last year\u2019s landmark release of the Women\u2019s Economic Security Statement by Kelly delivered for women by helping boost their skills and employability, backing them to start their own businesses, importantly, and giving women more options to secure their financial independence when they need it most, particularly in their retirement. And that is the agenda we\u2019re working to with increased flexibility for paid parental leave and supporting entrepreneurship opportunities for women and the Stem programs for girls, which I know<strong> Karen Andrews</strong> is a keen and passionate advocate for as science minister.</p> \n   <p> And we\u2019ve asked the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to inquire into sexual harassment in the workplace. We\u2019re fully engaged in keeping women safe by working together to combat violence against women and this is a shared and equal objective of all members of our parliament. Too many women dying. Horrifically, on average one woman every week. And far too many others suffering in silence. We\u2019ve all reflected on the horrific death of <strong>Aiia Maasarwe</strong> which rocked the country and she was a guest to our country, she was a visitor to our country. But it really did shake us. It wasn\u2019t the first time this had happened, obviously. But it was an event I think that cried out to the country that this must stop, and stop it must.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-14T00:15:05.167Z\">at 12.15am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c649e90e4b04a6f567df105\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-13T22:48:37.219Z\">10.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Linda Burney</strong> spoke ahead of the latest Closing the Gap report release:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The 2014 budget brought down by this government was horrendous for Aboriginal affairs. $500 million was ripped out of the Aboriginal affairs budget. You do not fix the issues in Aboriginal communities by taking away half a billion dollars out of the budget. There needs to be a recommitment to partnership with Aboriginal people and organisations. We are calling on that partnership. We are saying very clearly that peak Aboriginal organisations and Aboriginal communities have the answers to the social issues that dog those communities.</p> \n   <p><strong>Scott Morrison </strong>today says he\u2019s going to make an announcement about removing HECS fees for teachers to go and work in remote communities. Well that just ignores the fact that 79% of Aboriginal people live in urban environments. In fact, that number is very real. 79% of Aboriginal people living in urban environments. Yes, the issues in remote communities are shocking. They need to be addressed, but the Prime Minister and this government ignores that two thirds of Aboriginal people actually live in urban environments.</p> \n   <p>When you look at the record of the Morrison Government in Aboriginal affairs, it is shocking. CDP for example is languishing out there in the bush. Labor will reform CDP program. The changes to the Indigenous Advancement Strategy have been an absolute disaster for Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal organisations. We will reform that.</p> \n   <p>...Can I just finish off by saying this, Aboriginal people and peak organisations have formed a coalition and they are working towards partnership. Labor agrees with that partnership. And we are calling the Morrison Government to truly make a commitment and make that partnership a reality. The issues in Aboriginal affairs will not be fixed by bureaucrats or politicians in Canberra. The issues in Aboriginal affairs will be fixed by those bureaucrats and us politicians listening to peak organisations and listening to what\u2019s happening in those Aboriginal communities.

Just the literal words. And we have all of next week to go as well! So get some rest because, the way things have been going, you are going to need all the wheaties to keep up. All of them. Thank you, thank you, thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp and everyone else in the Guardian brains trust for dragging me bodily across the line. I am the typing monkey to their Caesar. And, forever and always, the biggest thank you to you, for reading, commenting and following along with us as we try to make sense of this building and all who dwell within her. This week has moved faster than most, and that is saying something. So please enjoy your coming weekend, check back in for the latest updates on all the stories from this week, and we\u2019ll see you back here, hopefully, early next week. Take care of you. Bill Shorten also came in to listen. Given today is Jacinta Collins\u2019s final day, her Senate position is now a casual vacancy and will need to be filled by the Victorian parliament. But there aren\u2019t that many sitting days scheduled until the election. Penny Wong paid tribute to the Victorian senator when she announced her resignation last month: Senator Collins has been a determined and principled representative of Victoria in the Senate across two decades. She is one of our most experienced and respected senators whose parliamentary work has included select committees into a certain maritime incident, school funding and establishment of a national integrity commission. As chair of the Senate standing committee of privileges since 2013, she has handled a substantial volume of sensitive inquiries that made highly significant recommendations for the protection of the privileges of all parliamentarians. This work will continue. In 2013, she became deputy leader of the government in the Senate when I became leader. Through our work together in those roles I came to know and depend upon Jacinta\u2019s consistency, reliability and trustworthiness. Jacinta puts the Labor party and the team first. As Senate leader I am personally grateful for her contribution, and for her friendship. I especially acknowledge the role that Senator Collins has played since assuming the role of manager of opposition business in the Senate in the current parliament. In this position, as when she was manager of government business, she has been an integral part of Labor\u2019s leadership team in the Senate. Her consistency and her resolve have been invaluable. The Senate will be poorer for her departure. I wish Jacinta and her family all the very best. \u201cIt has been an extraordinary privilege to be here,\u201d Jacinta Collins says. At a doorstop the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, has attacked the question time shenanigans: Today we had the longest question time in the history of federation. We didn\u2019t have a long question time because the government wanted to answer questions. The same government that last year shut down question time so they could roll Malcolm Turnbull today kept question time going and going so that they didn\u2019t have to vote on a motion about a royal commission for people with disabilities being abused.\u201d Burke rebutted suggestions from the government that the Coalition would\u2019ve voted for the motion by noting at 12.15pm they all voted against it in the Senate. Asked if Labor had the six of seven crossbench votes to pass the motion, Burke said he wouldn\u2019t speak for the crossbench but the government \u201cwouldn\u2019t have gone to such lengths\u201d if it had the numbers to defeat the motion. He also made it into the Senate: How Mike Bowers saw the record-breaking question time: Derryn Hinch has spoken to David Speers from Sky News about why he supported the medevac bill. Asked about the concerns of security agencies, Hinch, who received a security briefing before voting to support the legislation, said this: The agencies are worried that word does get out and does get back to Indonesia, the fishing villages, it does get there, they are well plugged in, they have mobile phones. I think the government\u2019s talk about reopening Christmas Island and the flood of boats coming, that is doing more I think to \u2018stir the beast\u2019 than anything that the crossbench or Labor are doing.\u201d That\u2019s a sound I haven\u2019t heard in a while \u2013 the press gallery bell has rung, indicating someone has dropped by for a doorstop (that\u2019s how it used to be done, but now we get alerts via email). It\u2019s Tony Burke, talking about the day\u2019s events. James Ashby has released a statement: As a member of staff to a Senator, I respect the jurisdiction of the President of the Senate. To that affect, I have surrendered my pass. However there must be a full investigation of this matter, the allegations that proceeded the altercation and a range of other issues regarding the alleged treatment of female staff that may be relevant to this matter.\u201d At 150 minutes, today\u2019s question time was the longest in the history of the Federation. Round of applause! A quick postscript to that postscript \u2013 the government did oppose the motion in the Senate. Just a postscript to that crazy afternoon. Despite the filibuster to avoid the vote on the motion from the Senate, a government spokesman now says the Coalition would not have opposed the disability proposal had it reached the House today, and will not oppose it next week. Thank goodness indeed. The government seems a little jumpy today. This email has been sent from the office of Nola Marino (the chief whip): TO: All Coalition Members and staff FROM: Nola Marino RE: Do not leave the House DATE: 2019 Members are reminded not to leave the House until directed thank you. Regards Nola Patricia Karvelas spoke to Barnaby Joyce on the ABC and mentioned, among other things, the ...*not great* interview with Michael McCormack on Sky News this morning. Joyce says he thinks if he had his time again, McCormack would better explain the \u201cnuance\u201d involved. Scott Morrison turned his response to the disability abuse royal commission call into an attack on Labor over border security. And question time FINALLY ends. At 4.30pm. Go on without me. I\u2019ve lived a good life. I died in here today, and my spirit shall haunt the gallery for question time forever more. And the recommendations: That all unspent foundation partnership funds be returned to the commonwealth immediately; and that these funds be earmarked for expenditure on projects to protect and preserve the reef, to be expended by 30 June 2024. That a review, to be completed by 1 July 2019, be undertaken of the structure of commonwealth funding to protect and preserve the reef; the committee further recommends that the expenditure of unspent foundation partnership funds be guided by the outcome of this review. That the Australian and Queensland governments publish an updated Reef 2050 Plan Investment Framework that provides current figures on established funding by source and priority area. Should a future government decide to maintain the foundation agreement, the committee recommends that all necessary steps be undertaken to ensure that the foundation\u2019s investment of public funds precludes investment in sectors or funds that directly or indirectly contribute to climate change, particularly companies that generate energy from or undertake mining of fossil fuels. Should a future government decide to maintain the foundation agreement, the committee recommends that the Senate order: That \u2014 (a) There be laid on the table by the minister representing the minister for the environment and energy, by no later than 31 October each year; (i) an annual performance statement for the previous financial year that provides information about the Great Barrier Reef Foundation\u2019s performance in achieving the purposes of the Great Barrier Reef 2050 Partnership Program; and; (ii) independent and audited financial statements for the previous financial year for all receipts and payments relating to the Great Barrier Reef 2050 Partnership Program funds, including any co-financed contributions; (b) If the Senate is not sitting when a statement is ready for presentation, the statement is to be presented to the president under standing order 166; (c) This order has effect until the end of the last financial year in which the agreement is operative, following the cessation of the partnership. Should a future government decide to maintain the foundation agreement, that the auditor general undertake a second audit of the partnership in late 2019\u201320 once the final design aspects of the partnership have been finalised. That the Australian government take steps to address and effectively tackle climate change as an underlying cause of economic, social and environmental damage to the Reef and the Australian environment more broadly. The Senate committee looking at the $444m grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has handed down its report. From Peter Whish-Wilson: The Senate Environment &amp; Communications References Committee inquiry report into the Great Barrier Reef 2050 Partnership Program was tabled today by the Chair of the inquiry, Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson. Senator Whish-Wilson said, \u201cThis was the Senate at its best, acting swiftly and working cooperatively to scrutinise, in full, government policy of significant public importance. \u201cThis grant was a desperate attempt to cover up this government\u2019s legacy of reef mismanagement, years of chronic underfunding and disregard for climate change, in the context of an imminent world heritage \u2018in danger\u2019 listing. \u201cIt was clearly a political decision made with no consultation, due diligence or regard for proper process. \u201cIt\u2019s a textbook case of how not to implement public policy, and a perfect example of why we shouldn\u2019t trust the future of a dying reef to a government intent on outsourcing public policy. \u201cThis report and its recommendations are a good opportunity to press reset and build the best blueprint for future reef management, in full consultation with all stakeholders. Some of the conclusions from the committee were: \u201cThe granting of $444m to the Reef Foundation was a highly irresponsible decision, hastily concocted by relevant ministers, without proper consideration of risks and potential effectiveness, no consultation with key stakeholders, and without having undertaken due diligence. \u201cThis \u2018off-the-cuff\u2019 decision has caused massive disruption to existing policy and program delivery, including by existing government agencies. It has all the hallmarks of a government that is not properly managing its responsibility as the guardian of the world heritage listed Great Barrier Reef. \u201cThere were widespread concerns about \u2018whether the foundation was the right organisation to manage such a significant investment\u2019, including \u2018the foundation\u2019s ability to handle such a rapid increase in size and responsibilities, the high cost of administration, and the duplication and governance complexities the Partnership introduces\u2019. \u201cThe most appropriate action for the commonwealth to take is to terminate the foundation partnership. The committee believes this is necessary to help restore trust in the process of commonwealth funding for the reef, if not the entire commonwealth grants process. The committee also considers that this is necessary to ensure that commonwealth funding is spent in the best possible way to help protect and preserve the world\u2019s largest coral reef system.\u201d So far, today has included some sort of altercation between a senator and a staffer in the marble hall, disputes over who historically sexually harassed who at Rooty Hill RSL club, blood on a senator\u2019s door that the bleeder doesn\u2019t recall leaving there but admits to, a senior staffer being banned from the parliament, the deputy prime minister [falsely] declaring rapists and murderers will be coming into the country because of the medevac bill and being called out for the false claims on Sky News and the longest ever question time so the government avoids losing a vote that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Just a totally normal day in the 45th parliament. The president of the Senate, Scott Ryan, on why he revoked James Ashby\u2019s pass: Senators must be free to go about their work in this building. This privilege and protection is not limited to simple proceedings in the chamber. Passholders are granted access to the building on certain conditions on behaviour, amongst others these conditions are in place to protect all occupants and facilitate the work of members and senators. The video footage that I have reviewed records the reported incident between Senator Burston and Mr James Ashby last night, it shows inappropriate behaviour by a passholder towards a senator. Accordingly I have exercised my authority to revoke Mr James Ashby\u2019s pass to access the building and prohibit him from entering the building for the time being. This does not affect his employment, which is not a matter for the presiding officers \u2026 This does not prejudice any other legal or other proceedings that may be undertaken or initiated by the parties involved. Given the seriousness of the incident and evidence immediately available to me, I believe immediate action is necessary and warranted. If further information comes to my attention this decision can be revisited and any subsequent legal action can be taken into account.\u201d Brian Burston on blood on the door: \u201cWhilst I do not recall the incident of blood on the door I now have come to the conclusion that it was myself and I sincerely apologise for that action.\u201d Bill Shorten is calling for a suspension of standing orders: I really hope question time ends before the election. And yet the Senate is STILL not the most broken chamber today. Oh, and Brian Burston has admitted he smeared blood on Pauline Hanson\u2019s office door. Which a parliament house cleaner would have had to clean up. Those people are some of the unsung heroes of this place and they don\u2019t deserve that. We are now in the situation where the government is filibustering by extending question time to avoid a vote that can\u2019t happen. Get excited people! We are less than 10 minutes away from breaking the question time record!!! And people say the government hasn\u2019t achieved anything. The message has still not come from the Senate. We are enduring this for nothing. Tony Smith is also bringing up that there is no matter of public importance to be debated for the House to move on to. That is because Labor pulled it, to ensure that the Senate message, on the disability royal commission, could be dealt with. Smith has invited members from both sides of the House to submit a matter of public importance to be debated. Tony Burke says there is a history of pulling MPIs when there is a genuine issue to be dealt with and the motion from the Senate is considered to be a genuine issue of importance. Tony Smith says the \u201cmessage you are worried about hasn\u2019t arrived. It hasn\u2019t even arrived ... it is not here and that is a fact,\u201d he says. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d Jordon Steele-John says. Smith then says that if question time is going to continue, he thinks some of those members who don\u2019t get a question should \u201cget a go\u201d. If you have a go, you get a go. At asking an actual question that might matter to a particular constituency. Tony Burke says the House has the right \u2018that the business of the day be called on\u2019 and that there is no practice that says that can\u2019t be done, if the House so wills it. Tony Smith says he is unmoved by the argument \u201cthe conventions in this place matter\u201d and that it is \u201cvery clear\u201d when the business of the day can be called on and Burke has misunderstood the standing orders. \u201cIt has never been done and I think, frankly, something that should never be done. I upheld the rights of all the members the other day and I\u2019m going to do it again today,\u201d he says. The end of question time is the prerogative of the prime minister, Tony Smith says. No one can call question time to an end other than the prime minister. He says that in February 2009 question time went for 126 minutes. Tony Burke has moved that the business of the day be called on. Tony Smith is going to \u201caddress this in some detail\u201d. \u201cThere is no hard finish for question time,\u201d Smith says. Meanwhile the Senate is somehow managing to be the chamber with its shit together lately, despite it being, well, the Senate. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: Is the reason you have extended question time because you are afraid the majority of members will vote against the government for a royal commission into disability abuse? Morrison says no, and he will not make it a partisan issue. \u201cCALL THE VOTE, CALL A VOTE,\u201d Jordon Steele-John starts yelling. Tony Smith asks him to be quiet. \u201cI will bloody will not,\u201d Steele-John says. Morrison continues. No one I am speaking to can remember this happening before. In short, to head off losing another vote, and fight off attacks it has lost control of the parliamentary agenda, the government is filibustering by extending question time, which also doesn\u2019t appear to show a whole lot of control over the parliament. Luke Howarth gets a dixer and is doing his best job to pretend like he didn\u2019t see this question for the first time two minutes ago. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: Can he confirm this question time is the longest in the 45th parliament to try to head off a loss on a motion asking for a royal commission into disability abuse? Morrison: Loud noises, also question time is awesome and I love it and I hope it goes forever. Also something about the \u201cweakness that beats in his [Shorten\u2019s] heart\u201d. My question is for the prime minister. How good is saying how good is? How pumped is he? Is strong his favourite word? My question is for the prime minister. What is his favourite season, and is he aware of any alternative opinions? My question is for the minister for defence. What books did he read over the summer, and is he aware of any differing opinions about Big Little Lies? My question is for... Now taking bets on whether we reach the \u201cwhat\u2019s your favourite lettuce\u201d level of dixer. Jordon Steele-John has arrived from the Senate. He is about to hear at least another 45 minutes of pointless questions, involving \u201cstrong\u201d and a variety of nouns. Christopher Pyne is almost glowing, he is so happy. It\u2019s like Aslan himself has descended and anointed him the chosen one. Christopher Pyne just wandered around with papers and dropped them off around the backbench. They appear to be questions. We may be going to 4.30pm people. \u201cI understand that question time is going to be extended,\u201d Michael Keenan just seemed to say. From the Greens: The Senate has supported a Greens motion put by Senator Jordon Steele-John calling for an urgent royal commission into the violence, abuse and neglect of disabled people in institutional and residential settings. The motion will be debated and voted on concurrently by the House following question time today. Senator Steele-John said this was an historic moment for disabled people, who have put up with years of inaction from the major parties. Brendan O\u2019Connor to Michael Keenan in the question time that doesn\u2019t end \u2013 it just goes on and on my friend. He asks Keenan to confirm that no person who worked in his office leaked the raids to the media. Tony Smith moves to rule the question out of order. Tony Burke says that in his previous answer Keenan has referred to the raids, his staff and the leaks to the media. Smith says he\u2019ll allow it. But he\u2019ll hear from Christopher Pyne, in case it is \u201cextra compelling\u201d. Pyne says he thinks it is. Pyne says that Keenan can\u2019t answer on behalf of someone else. Smith asks to hear the question again, does, and rules it in order. Keenan starts in on the \u201ccharacter\u201d of Bill Shorten. Questions started bang on 2pm today. But at 3.15pm we are still going. That is unusual. The government couldn\u2019t be attempting to filibuster, given the motion on a disabilities abuse royal commission it looks like losing once this ends, could it? Michael Keenan finishes by telling Bill Shorten not to get \u201cone of your lesser minions\u201d to ask him questions if he wants information when he could ask him himself. Sooooooo is every backbencher asking a dixer a \u201clesser minion\u201d of the prime minister? Did the minions movies set up a hierarchy where there are greater and lesser members of their society? Is question time a complete sham? I know the answer to at least one of those questions. Brendan O\u2019Connor to Michael Keenan: \u201cHow can the minister possibly stand by the answers he has given to this House, when according to sworn evidence it was his office that saw TV cameras turn up before the police?\u201d Keenan: \u201cMy office and myself dealt with difficult information and sensitive information ... we knew the responsibilities of dealing with that information and upheld those responsibilities every day.\u201d He then turns to why the AWU office was raided. Once the smiles started, they just didn\u2019t stop. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison \u2013 will you support a royal commission into disability abuse \u2013 yes or no? \u201cI will remain open to every single option there is,\u201d Morrison says. But he doesn\u2019t commit to calling a royal commission. Bill Shorten asks Scott Morrison if the government will implement a royal commission into disability abuse if the motion is successful in the House. He doesn\u2019t answer the question and instead focuses on an interjection about the aged care royal commission. He gets quite cranky, and Shorten interjects on relevance. He gets back to the question on the disability abuse royal commission. \u201cThose decisions are not made by the parliament, they are made by the government.\u201d But he leaves it open for the government to decide to do something on its own. \u201cYou better hurry,\u201d Anthony Albanese says, in reference to the motion coming down from the Senate soon. \u201cHow arrogant are the Labor party becoming,\u201d Morrison says, accusing the opposition of being \u201cso sure\u201d it has won the election. Albanese raises a point of order that he was talking about the motion coming from the Senate soon, and Tony Smith points out that members complaining about their interjections being misinterpreted is \u201cquite ironical\u201d. Bill Shorten asks another question on the possibility of a royal commission into disability abuse \u2013 Scott Morrison said it would be a decision of the executive government. Again, Labor is attempting to wedge the government, ahead of the motion reaching the House this afternoon. If it loses that vote, it will be the second time this week it has lost control of the parliamentary agenda. Christopher Pyne is having a chat to Scott Morrison at the table. David Coleman is talking about how we might not know the identity of some of the asylum seekers and refugees on Manus Island and Nauru. Because they have no documents, I presume. Buttttttt, the majority of the 1,000 people or so left on Manus and Nauru have been found to be refugees. We know who these people are. We know practically everything about them. We have been medically evacuating (after court battles) for some years now. We set up a transfer relationship with the United States. None of these arguments seem to be making much sense. Bill Shorten asks Scott Morrison if the government\u2019s position is still to vote against a royal commission into disability abuse. Morrison says \u201cat this point\u201d there are the powers and the ability to address the problems in the sector, but \u201cwe will always remain open\u201d to other ways to address issues. \u201cWhat about black lives matter,\u201d a man yells from the public gallery, before leaving of his own accord. The questions about the disability abuse royal commission are because of what we were telling you about earlier \u2013 that the Senate has voted to call on a royal commission to be established, and has asked the House to make the same call. At this point, the government looks like losing that battle. So with that last part of the answer, Morrison just gave the government some wriggle room, in the case it does lose. What is the cost to the budget of weakening border security, Andrew Laming asks Josh Frydenberg. \u201cVery high,\u201d Frydenberg solemnly reports. In May 2017 Labor called for a royal commission into disability abuse, Bill Shorten says to Scott Morrison, and given the ongoing reports of abuse, will the government call a royal commission into this? Scott Morrison says the government takes the reports very seriously, and is working on addressing them, and that there have been numerous inquiries into the abuse. He says he believes the NDIS will help. He is reading from a piece of paper with quite a lot of highlighted text on it, because this question would not have been a surprise. He says the government has established safeguards to prevent abuse. But he does not commit to a royal commission. Joel Fitzgibbon asks a question about why the Liberal party didn\u2019t tell the National party it was shelving the big stick legislation. That part of the question is ruled out of order. But only after he repeats it, because Michael McCormack has some sort of physical contortion and spits out \u201cYOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK ABOUT THE DROUGHT\u201d in what I can only assume is a bug in the program. The rest of the question is about why the big stick legislation has been dumped, and Scott Morrison again jumps up with \u201canother Labor MP talking rubbish\u201d, because, again, suddenly facts matter. As a gallery wag joked to me this morning: \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the nuance.\u201d Morrison ends with an attack on Bill Shorten and how \u201cthe weaknesses that is inside him\u201d is infecting the country. Or something. I just think, given the 45th parliament\u2019s previous transgressions, that we should avoid talking about anything inside any MP doing anything to the country. Michaelia Cash\u2019s full statement to the Senate: As senators would be aware the Australian Workers Union is currently taking legal action against the Registered Organisations Commission. The case has been brought about because the AWU is refusing to demonstrate whether a number of donations made by the AWU when Mr Bill Shorten was national secretary, were properly authorised. This includes a $100,000 donation to GetUp! of which Mr Shorten was a founding member. I was referring to what the case was about including a $100,000 donation to GetUp! of which Mr Shorten was a founding member and a $25,000 donation to Mr Bill Shorten\u2019s own election campaign. As senators would be aware I have been subpoenaed by the AWU to give evidence in the federal court proceeding. I can confirm to the Senate that on 25 October 2017 I advised the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee that a then staff member in my office had resigned his employment. I told the Senate committee at the time. I have just been advised that without my knowledge one staff member in my office in the course of discussions with journalists indicated that he had received information that a raid may take place. I am advised this information came from a media source. The statement I made to the Senate estimates committee was based on the advice given to me. The AWU\u2019s legal action is in the course of hearing before the federal court of Australia this week. As I am yet to give evidence to the case I am subject to restrictions in relation to what I can be told about the evidence that is being given by other witnesses. Although Senator Wong and other Labor senators have provided commentary on the case during question time I have no time to verify if what Senator Wong has said is correct. Memories, light the corners of my mind.... Michael McCormack is attempting to talk about border security and, I think, infrastructure? But he doesn\u2019t sound overly confident about what he\u2019s talking about either, so it\u2019s hard to tell. \u201cThe people smugglers understand Labor is weak on border security,\u201d Peter Dutton says. \u201cStop sending them signals,\u201d yells a Labor MP. Shayne Neumann is up. \u201cSHAYNE!\u201d yells the government benches. Neumann asks Peter Dutton a question on the contract, worth almost half a billion dollars, awarded to Paladin, which was, according to the AFR\u2019s excellent reporting on this issue, the only company invited to tender in a closed tender process: Dutton says there are checks and balances to check this stuff, and if there are issues, the department will look at it. He then starts in on the latest rendition of \u2018why are you burning down our borders\u2019. Peter Dutton is doing his new, improved rendition of just how safe are you. With the protest I missed Rebekha Sharkie\u2019s question to Paul Fletcher. But she is not happy with the answer. Tony Smith had this advice: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t built it, you don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Scott Morrison says about Labor\u2019s attitude towards border security. But I guess Medicare is different? The small business minister, Michaelia Cash, has given her explanation to the Senate about whether the tipoff to the media about the police raids on the AWU came from her office. Cash starts by reminding everyone the police were investigating \u201ca $100K donation to GetUp of which Bill Shorten is a founding member and $25k to Bill Shorten\u2019s own election campaign\u201d. Penny Wong labels that \u201cfear and smear\u201d and asks that she answer the question \u2013 about her former media adviser, David De Garis, naming her former chief of staff, Ben Davies, as the source of his information about the raids, which he then passed on to the media. Cash gave some basic facts: That she has been issued a subpoena to give evidence in the AWU federal court case On 25 October 2017 she told Senate estimates that a then staff member (De Garis) had resigned his employment. And then stuck to her guns: \u201cI have been advised that without my knowledge (De Garis) indicated he received information a raid may take place. I\u2019m advised this came \u2018from a media source\u2019 - [my statement to Senate estimates was] based on the advice given to me ... \u201cThe AWU\u2019s legal action is in the course of hearing in the federal court this week. As I\u2019m yet to give evidence I\u2019m subject to restrictions about what I can be told about evidence given by other witnesses ... I have no way to verify what Senator Wong says is correct.\u201d So we learn very little from that. Cash is due to give evidence in the case on Friday, and will appear at Senate estimates next week. A protest has broken out in the public gallery. Numerous people are standing up one at a time from different galleries, calling out about the need for action on climate change. \u201cSpeak up, we can\u2019t hear you,\u201d yells a government MP. There is applause from others in the gallery. The security guards don\u2019t know where the next sentence is coming from. Each is leaving when asked. It is not all \u2018young people\u2019 either \u2013 quite a few older people have joined in on this. After two energy questions, the government is back to border protection. Scott Morrison is telling the parliament \u2013 and the world at large \u2013 to combat the various threats to the nation, you need to understand the problems, you need to run an economy able to resource enforcement efforts and \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have the conviction to take the action, and follow through\u201d. \u201cThey are weak and their weaknesses will infect this nation,\u201d Scott Morrison says in conclusion to his last question. Andrew Hastie is now asking Scott Morrison to describe what is needed for \u201cstrong borders and to keep Australians safe and secure\u201d. A lot of nuance, apparently. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: \u201cHas the government dumped its 11th signature energy policy since the election?\u201d Morrison: \u201cNow we have another member of the Labor party just coming up here and speaking rubbish.\u201d Morrison only yesterday described facts as \u201cnuance\u201d. The Tveeder transcription service is down, so there will be a lot of paraphrasing today. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison The Labor leader asks the prime minister to confirm that the government has dumped the big stick legislation from the agenda, that it\u2019s a minority government and why is Malcolm Turnbull no longer prime minister? Morrison says the government will take the big stick legislation to the election and their big stick is bigger than Labor\u2019s energy policy. Or something. Just before question time begins and we hear the latest round of \u2018borders under attack from doctors\u2019, you might want to check out the Guardian\u2019s latest politics podcast, featuring Kerryn Phelps and Kon Karapanagiotidis. God forbid we actually follow the orders of doctors like we would in any other situation. It\u2019s extraordinary to see the attack on the integrity of our medical profession, doctors are the most trusted profession in this country, politicians are the least trusted. So if you\u2019re asking the Australian people which side they are going to choose they are going to trust the doctors. It\u2019s really important for you to know that when we make these medical assessments this work often takes months, we FOI medical files, we get second opinions, this is a slow, arduous, forensic process to try and assess people\u2019s cases \u2013 in contrast to how our prime minister is talking about it, with total disrespect to our medical profession, their standards and their integrity and their professionalism. This legislation is about saving lives, we\u2019ve had 13 people die and this is about stopping any more deaths, that\u2019s what this is about. Since when did we become a nation that thinks we\u2019re a safer nation when we leave people to die?\u201d \u2013 Kon Karapanagiotidis, CEO of Asylum Seeker Resource Centre And love is all around ... in the federation chamber: Tim Watts, who made headlines when he took Ben Simmons\u2019 (also known as Kendall Jenner\u2019s s.o, don\u2019t @ me) exclusion from last year\u2019s NBA All-Star game to the federal parliament, has risen again this year, with some better news: I rise to claim victory on the occasion of Australian Ben Simmons\u2019 selection in the NBA All-Star game being held in Charlotte, North Carolina this weekend. Last year in this chamber, I used the outrage of Ben\u2019s exclusion from the 2018 All-Star game to draw attention to the golden generation of Australians currently repping Australia in the L \u2026 and the way that these extraordinary Aussies truly represent the confident, modern nation that we have become \u2013 a nation of migrants, and the most successful multicultural nation on earth. Last year, I noted that the nine Australians in the NBA included an Indigenous Australian, four children of immigrants and two refugees. This year I\u2019m proud to report that there are now a record 11 Australians in the NBA ... including Deng Adel, a South Sudanese refugee who moved with his family to Sunshine in my electorate and started his basketball journey at the mighty Sunshine Longhorns and is now playing with the Cleveland Cavaliers alongside fellow Aussie and NBA champion Matthew Dellavedova. There\u2019s been a lot of nonsense said about migrants and refugees in this parliament in recent times. But let me tell you - ball don\u2019t lie \u2013 these players show that immigration is nation building and that Australia is made stronger by saying welcome to immigrants from around the world. Twitter has pulled up this from 2016. Would he go with Aslan now? After pulling the big stick legislation to head off a likely defeat, the government faces a battle on a new front, after the Senate passed a motion calling on the parliament to establish a royal commission into disability abuse. The Greens senator Jordon Steele-John has been pushing this for quite some time and failed in his attempts to have disability abuse included in the aged care royal commission. So Labor, the Greens and enough of the crossbench banded together to pass the below motion in the Senate. Now it\u2019s going one step further, with Labor having cancelled its matter of public importance debate in order to give the motion time to reach the House, where, at this stage, it looks like having the numbers to pass it. Which, if so, will be the second time this week the government is not in control of the parliamentary agenda. Watch. This. Space. To move\u2014 (1) That the Senate\u2014 (a) notes that: (i) despite the hard-won progress of the disability rights movement, disabled Australians continue to be subjected to discrimination and are routinely denied the right guaranteed them under international law, (ii) this discrimination creates and sustains the barriers to employment, education, transport, social and political participation experienced by disabled Australians and, most concerning, manifests itself in horrific violence, abuse and neglect to which they are subjected, and (iii) from July to September 2018, over 184 incidents of abuse and neglect were reported to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (the Commission) \u2013 the Commission has also released data that shows in the same three months it received 62 reports of expected and unexpected deaths, 91 reports of injuries, 34 complaints against individual staff or service providers and 75 cases of unauthorised restrictive practices; and (b) calls on the House of Representatives Government to request His Excellency the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia issue Letter Patent to support the immediate establishment of establish a royal commission to inquire into violence, abuse and neglect of disabled people with a disability. (2) That a message be sent to the House of Representatives seeking its concurrence in this resolution. Did it just get chilly in here? The attorney general\u2019s office released the transcript of his interview with Kieran Gilbert on Sky News this morning. It includes this exchange between Christian Porter, as the first law officer and Gilbert: Porter: \u201cWell, what we do know is that there are 300 people who, it appears, have already got or are close to getting certification from the two doctors. Now we are in a race against time to try and go through each of those 300 to determine whether or not there are charges pending; whether or not they\u2019re awaiting trial; whether or not they\u2019re awaiting sentence; whether or not there are credible allegations; whether or not there\u2019s credible intelligence that an offence may have been committed\u2026\u201d Gilbert: \u201cSurely you have some understanding on these islands already?\u201d Porter: \u201cAs I said in parliament yesterday, there\u2019s been reporting and we are working through all of the cases that we think may be the subject of a medical transfer. But there\u2019s reporting of a potential transferee on Manus Island charged with four counts of sexual penetration of a minor under the PNG Summary Offences and Crimes Against Children Act \u2026\u201d Gilbert: \u201cSo not convicted?\u201d Porter: \u201cNot convicted but\u2026\u201d Gilbert: \u201cAlleged?\u201d Porter: \u201cBut \u2013 alleged, if you want to put it that way.\u201d Gilbert: \u201cWell, that\u2019s normally the way lawyers do it. Normally you do say alleged.\u201d Porter: \u201cWell, I would say charged with a serious offence.\u201d Gilbert: \u201cOkay, well, say charged but you can\u2019t say rapist or criminal until they\u2019re convicted. That\u2019s the way the law works.\u201d Porter: \u201cWell, we\u2019re \u2013 again, the point is this \u2013 that a person could be convicted of rape or murder but not yet sentenced and the minister\u2026\u201d Gilbert: \u201cBut have you got any evidence of that happening?\u201d Porter: \u201cWell, we are going through all of the people and we are in a race against time to do that. But the reality is that people who may have or have been charged or who are awaiting sentence or who are awaiting trial for serious criminal offences can now be brought to Australia and we have no ability to stop \u2026.\u201d Gilbert: \u201cSo 800 people are in limbo, in continuing limbo, on the basis of this esoteric argument that you have got no \u2013 you\u2019ve given me no evidence this morning that there are any individuals in this circumstance.\u201d Porter: \u201cWell, there is\u2026\u201d Gilbert: \u201c\u2026convicted and awaiting sentence.\u201d Porter: \u201cWell, there are many people there who have been charged. There are people who are awaiting trial under sovereign criminal processes of PNG\u2026\u201d Gilbert: \u201cHow many?\u201d Porter: \u201c\u2026and Nauru. Well, we are trying to ascertain that at the moment, Kieran. But the reality is this legislation was rammed through under a gag motion \u2013 we\u2019re now becoming aware that there are 300 people who have already taken the preliminary steps to effect their transfer, and resources and the effort that it takes to have security checks on a person\u2019s background to try and work out whether or not they\u2019re subject to charge \u2026.\u201d Gilbert: \u201cOK, well, on the basis of what we\u2019ve worked out so far, you\u2019ve got no evidence to suggest any of them have been convicted and awaiting sentence. So on that basis, shouldn\u2019t the government, from here on in, say alleged or charged with as opposed to rapists, paedophiles, criminals?\u201d Porter: \u201cWell, we have used language, I think, in appropriate ways. I\u2019ve very clearly set out in parliament, in question time, how the law works. Very clearly set it out. Now, if someone wants to argue.\u201d Gilbert: \u201cBut it\u2019d be nice if the government used the appropriate language \u2013 in the sense of alleged or charged with \u2013 as opposed to convicting the individuals before they have the right in court.\u201d Porter: \u201cWell, again, I can put to you quite clearly that someone can be convicted of a serious criminal offence and we have no discretion \u2026\u201d Gilbert: \u201cBut we don\u2019t have any evidence of that. None.\u201d Porter: \u201cWell, we are trying to gather that evidence at the moment but we \u2026\u201d Gilbert: \u201cWell, at that point, why did you make the argument?\u201d Porter: \u201cBut Kieran, we did not bring this legislation into parliament. We did not effect this change. And the reality is that it puts us, our government, our border protection, our security intelligence agencies, under enormous time pressure to try and work out who in that list of 300 people \u2013 and it will be a larger list than that \u2013 may have these issues attached to them.\u201d Chris Bowen and Mark Butler have held a press conference to blast the government for dumping the big stick. Labor doesn\u2019t support this policy but the Bowen/Butler argument is the government did, and this is yet another energy policy that has now bitten the dust. The government says it will take the policy to the coming election, and seek a mandate. As well as the policy expiring pre-election, the withdrawal of the bill has removed an opportunity for Labor and the Greens to pass an amendment that would have stopped the Morrison government from underwriting new coal power stations. Much of the to and fro at the press conference was around that point: what Labor would do to stop taxpayers underwriting now a legislative path isn\u2019t available. Bowen and Butler have made it clear if the government signs a contract with a private operator to underwrite a generation project, the ALP will honour it. Labor has also made it abundantly clear they don\u2019t want the government to go down that path. There\u2019s a but coming on honouring contracts. Bowen and Butler told reporters the government, in their view, would need to pass legislation underpinning any contract in order to make the arrangement lawful. In the event no supportive legislation is passed, then there is a valid question whether the contract will be lawful. Bowen said Labor would honour lawful contracts, not unlawful ones. What that means, in simple terms, is there is some wriggle room here, depending on what happens over the next few months. Greg Hunt says he\u2019ll leave it to Angus Taylor to explain why the big stick divesture bill is now off the agenda. \u201cOur goal is very clear,\u201d Hunt says. \u201cWe\u2019re for lower electricity prices and Mr Shorten is for higher electricity prices.\u201d Michaelia Cash\u2019s former chief of staff Ben Davies has declined to say who told him federal police were set to raid the AWU\u2019s offices, saying that doing so may incriminate him. The federal court heard on Tuesday that Davies had told Cash\u2019s former media adviser David De Garis about the raids. De Garis said he went on to \u201corganise\u201d to leak the information to the media with an aide to the then-justice minister, Michael Keenan. On Thursday, Davies was asked by the AWU\u2019s barrister, Herman Borenstein QC, who told him police were going to execute search warrants on the union\u2019s Melbourne and Sydney offices on 24 October, 2017. Davies declined to answer, claiming privilege against self-incrimination. \u201cRegardless of if Mr De Garis is prosecuted, there remains a real risk that Mr Davies could be prosecuted,\u201d Davies\u2019 lawyer, Richard Dalton SC, told the court. Justice Mordecai Bromberg accepted this, but is now considering whether to compel Davies to answer the questions in the interests of justice. The Hinkler MP says he has called for the meeting, because the legislation is vitally important in his home state of Queensland. \u201cThe Queensland government owns all the poles and wires, 70% of the generators and the only retailer in town,\u201d he said. \u201cQueensland Labor is taking more more than $1.5bn from customers who have no other choice for providers.\u201d The Nats are just waiting on the whip to call the meeting officially. Keith Pitt has called for an emergency meeting for Nationals MPs to talk about the pulling of the big stick divestment legislation from the agenda. The Nationals, who have been pushing for reform, want a please explain on this one. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security has issued its report on the Coalition\u2019s bill to lower the bar for stripping terrorists of Australian citizenship. It\u2019s an odd document \u2013 because Labor has backed down on its threat to issue a dissenting report (a hard no) opting instead for a minority report (best characterised as a \u201cyes, but\u201d) but then made recommendations at odds with the Coalition members. The committee recommended: That it review the operation of the current citizenship stripping powers by 1 December 2020 Subject to that review, the new bill giving the home affairs minister more powers should then be passed. That in itself is significant \u2013 that a committee chaired by Liberal MP Andrew Hastie would call for a further review and put the bill on the backburner when Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison have talked up its urgency. In its minority report Labor warned the bill is likely unconstitutional, referring to its advice from Peter Hanks and evidence from academics including Kim Rubenstein and George Williams. Labor recommended: The bill in its current form not be passed The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor review the current citizenship stripping powers Twice in its minority report Labor members referred to \u201cthis dissenting report\u201d, which does tend to put up in lights that it intended to dissent and then softened its stance. Shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus has issued a statement explaining the stance: \u201cPeter Dutton and Scott Morrison are trying to rush legislation through the parliament that could result in terrorists taking the Australian government to the high court \u2013 and winning. The committee heard expert evidence that the proposed legislation was likely unconstitutional, would not survive a high court challenge, and risked completely destroying the government\u2019s ability to revoke the citizenship of any terrorist. Labor always puts the safety of Australians first and approaches national security in a bipartisan manner. There is nothing more important than keeping Australians safe. Labor will issue a minority report on this bill on the basis that the government has made no efforts to show it is constitutional. Labor stands ready to negotiate on other parts of the bill which do not risk a high court challenge.\u201d Mike Bowers has a \u201cwork experience kid\u201d today \u2013 gallery stalwart Lyndal Curtis has turned her very fine mind to photography. Here\u2019s how she saw some of this morning. The latest chapter in the War of the Roses: Senate edition, has dropped Peter Dutton had his regular chat to Ray Hadley this morning, and managed, if that is even possible, to go even further in his attacks on the medical evacuation bill: Ray look, Scott Morrison and I were talking yesterday about our different options, speaking to the generals and what not at the National Security Committee. You know we\u2019ve both lived through boats and the aftermath of it and from our perspective the most important thing here is to make sure that we get national security right, that we protect our borders. We\u2019ve spoken to the sailors who pulled the kids out of the water, the half-eaten torsos, those people, those sailors, members of Border Force, I mean they\u2019re people still to this very day with PTSD and they\u2019ve never recovered and some never will. The most important thing for us is to make sure that boats don\u2019t start, don\u2019t get back through. The Labor party has made it much harder for us to do that now, but we just double down our determination to make sure they don\u2019t get through and that\u2019s the bigger important issue for both of us and for the government. Labor and the crossbench are working together in the Senate to strengthen protections in the encryption legislation. The government introduced a bill to extend the legislation\u2019s powers to anti-corruption bodies and Labor and the crossbench are now amending it with the other fixes that Labor abandoned in December. The first amendment \u2013 which just passed 37 to 28 \u2013 provides that law enforcement agencies cannot ask telecommunications providers to do anything that \u201cwould or may create a material risk that otherwise secure information would or may in the future be collected, accessed, used, manipulated, disclosed or otherwise compromised by an unauthorised third party\u201d. Liberal senator Linda Reynolds complained that the bar of whether something \u201cmay\u201d harm third parties is too low, and it is too impractical to determine future harm. Still, the problem for Labor is that even if these amendments pass the Senate they won\u2019t become law unless the House of Representatives passes them, and there aren\u2019t too many sitting days left. \u201cWhat we have learnt is the government is so wedded to bankrolling coal that they are prepared to pull a signature piece of their legislation. Secondly, we have learnt the government are so scared of hearing what the Australian people through the parliament has to say that they are now prepared to run away and pull things off the agenda,\u201d Adam Bandt told Sky this morning about the pulling of the big-stick divesture bill. \u201cWhat does the government stand for?\u201d The speech ended with an anecdote about the first time Morrison met Aboriginal people, as a young child, and was cautious but then found them to be welcoming. It\u2019s not clear who this anecdote was for. He then commented on the welcoming and forgiving nature of Aboriginal communities in a way that could be interpreted as putting the burden of reconciliation back on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. He said: \u201cThe miracle worked in an apology is not when it is offered, but when it is accepted and that forgiveness takes place. That is when true reconciliation occurs.\u201d When Bill Shorten stood up he spoke about racism. \u201cIf this parliament cannot admit the racism still exists in 2019, then we\u2019re just wasting the time of our First Australians today.\u201d There was a dig at past policies, inaction on recommendations from reports \u201cleft to gather dust\u201d and a criticism of emergency measures such as the Northern Territory Intervention \u2014 which was extended under Labor. He challenged Morrison\u2019s use of a \u201cpartnership\u201d to describe the government\u2019s relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, alluding to the Turnbull/Morrison government\u2019s rejection of the Indigenous Voice proposal from the Uluru Statement. \u201cIf we say that we want partnership with our first Australians then we don\u2019t get to pick and choose our partners\u2019 values or priorities ... you don\u2019t get to tell your partner what to think.\u201d Shorten also reaffirmed previously announced policies \u2013 a referendum on the constitutional changes proposed in the Uluru Statement in Labor\u2019s first term, if elected; compensation for stolen generations through a national Healing Fund. The influence of senators Pat Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy, and Linda Burney MP, was, as it has been for the past few years, very clear. Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten just delivered two very different speeches, showing two very different approaches to Indigenous affairs. Morrison began by thanking his special envoy for Indigenous affairs, Tony Abbott, as \u201csomeone who has had a profound impact on my understanding and appreciation of Indigenous Australians and the challenges they face in Australia\u201d, and spoke about a 2009 visit he made with Abbott and Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion to a remote community, where he saw a memorial plaque for a 6-year-old girl who was raped and drowned. He said: \u201cI\u2019d like to tell you that this no longer happens but we all know it does, even though we\u2019re often told we shouldn\u2019t say so and talk about these things, but we should.\u201d He went on to talk about the refresh process, including the tripartite deal struck with Coag which will give states, territories and a coalition of peak Indigenous organisations equal say in setting and accountability for meeting the new Closing the Gap targets. More on that here. He said the failure of the Closing the Gap targets was one of a hubristic belief in the power of bureaucratic solutions to fix complex problems \u2013 very true \u2013 and that nothing would change until Aboriginal people were partners in the process \u2013 also true. He then said he was not going to offer a lofty goal as prime minister but instead focus his efforts on education, announcing a new policy, designed by Abbott, to freeze the Hecs debt of teachers who go to work in remote communities and waiving it if they stay there for at least four year. The policy is intended to attract the \u201cbest teachers\u201d to remote schools \u2013 it\u2019s not quite clear how that quality bar will be set and what criteria will be used to define \u201cbest\u201d. Chris Bowen and Mark Butler have called a press conference for 12 in the opposition courtyard (where the serious opposition pressers are held). I\u2019m not a betting gal, but I\u2019d stake my cat (who is priceless) that this is about the pruned big stick energy legislation ending up in the chipper (for now). Also in the Senate this morning: Cory Bernardi: Mr President, I woke up this morning to read about a very unedifying incident involving a senator and a staffer that occurred last night outside the Great Hall. I wonder what the role of the presiding officers is in investigating this, because it is of deep concern if alleged assaults can take place in this building without deep investigation. I wonder what your role is in this? Scott Ryan: I have been in discussions with the Speaker this morning and those discussions continue. We will be looking into this matter as a matter of urgency. The prime minister and Indigenous affairs minister have released their official response to the latest Closing the Gap report: Australia\u2019s Closing the Gap targets will be redeveloped in partnership with Indigenous Australians for the first time with a direct focus on education as the key to unlocking the potential of this and future generations. The prime minister said the 2019 Closing the Gap report highlighted successes across the country but that refreshed targets were an opportunity to work together to accelerate progress. \u201c... The original targets were well intentioned but developed without the collaboration and accountability for states and territories and without input from Indigenous Australians. \u201cWe want a Closing the Gap framework that\u2019s developed alongside Indigenous Australians with targets based on science. That\u2019s why the partnership we took and agreed through the Council of Australian Governments late last year is so important. These things take time, and we are committed to getting it right.\u201d The prime minister said his focus through the refreshed targets would be on education as the key area that can drive generational change, kickstarted by a funding boost for a suite of Indigenous education initiatives. \u201cEducation is the key to skills, to better health, to jobs,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOur new suite of initiatives builds on the record investments we\u2019re making from the high chair to higher education to ensure the next generation of Indigenous businessmen and women, academics and workers get the education they need to have a foundation for a successful life.\u201d The package includes: \u00b7 Teacher boost for remote Australia \u2013 Removing all or part of the Help debt for 3,100 students to encourage more teachers to work and stay working in very remote areas \u00b7 Youth Education Package \u2013 $200 million extra support to give more Indigenous students the support and mentoring they need through their secondary studies \u00b7 Getting kids to school \u2013 working community by community and school by school to invest $5 million in remote and very remote areas for projects that support and promote school attendance The minister for Indigenous affairs, Nigel Scullion, said the new education measures were designed to build on the success of existing government policies developed in partnership with local communities. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen huge success in working with Indigenous communities and organisations over the last five years, to deliver real and meaningful changes. The Indigenous Advancement Strategy has been able to double the number of Indigenous organisations delivering services to Indigenous people since its establishment in 2013,\u201d Minister Scullion said. Minister Scullion also announced an additional commitment to the Indigenous business sector with the Indigenous Procurement Policy 2.0. \u201cThe Indigenous Procurement Policy, better known as the IPP, has supercharged growth in the Indigenous business sector with 1,473 Indigenous businesses delivering 11,933 contracts worth over $1.83 billion since its establishment in 2015. This is a spectacular increase from the 30 Indigenous businesses winning just $6.2 million in contracts in 2012-13,\u201d Minister Scullion said. \u201cSo from 1 July 2019, the Indigenous Procurement Policy 2.0 will introduce a target of 3 per cent of the value of commonwealth contracts are to be awarded to Indigenous businesses within a decade, adding to the existing IPP target that 3 per cent of the number of commonwealth contracts are to go to Indigenous businesses. \u201cWe are investing further in what we know, what the data shows and what Indigenous communities tell us, works.\u201d After months of yelling about the big stick, which then became a somewhat smaller stick, the government has pulled its legislation from the notice paper, after facing the risk of having the bill amended to prohibit funding for coal-fired power generation projects. So what is left of the big stick will now go to the election, as a Coalition policy. This is all very fine and normal. Bill Shorten was asked about the One Nation ... saga? Telenovela? Little lunch? I don\u2019t know. He had this to say: Well, violence is unacceptable. The footage which I\u2019ve seen is really \u2013 it has no place in parliament. What we\u2019re seeing is that some of these small parties are just consumed by themselves. It would be comic except it\u2019s not, it\u2019s violence and unparliamentary conduct. Clearly the One Nation party has descended back into chaos, which it tends to do. And on the medical evacuation bill reaction from the government: I think this country in 2019 is not the same nation as 2001. I do not believe that Australians want a government which governs by slogans and fear. We can have strong borders in this country \u2013 and I\u2019m grateful for the work of Australian Border Force, the ADF and our public service \u2013 but strong borders does not need to come at the price of humane treatment of people who\u2019ve been in our care for half a decade or more. I totally repudiate the attacks of the government, seeking to whip up fear and hysteria, seeking to lure people smugglers to entice people onto boats to come to Australia. Under a government I lead, we will turn back boats where it is safe to do so. People who seek to come to Australia by boat will go to Nauru and will be regionally processed to third-party nations. But this nation has voted yesterday to say that for people who\u2019ve been in our care for literally thousands of days, where their treating doctors say there is an issue or an illness requiring medical evacuation, we\u2019ve been prepared to codify what the government is already doing. Never forget this government has bought 900 people from Manus and Nauru to Australia. Hundreds of sick people and members of their family. None of them have gone back. So I actually think that what we\u2019re fighting about or disagreeing about, the substance isn\u2019t as great as the government says. But in 2019, this is a government who\u2019s run out of offering Australians hope. They just want to rule by fear and by slogans. They should be ashamed of themselves for luring people to Australia by somehow implying that this government hasn\u2019t got strong borders. Here is some of what the PM had to say at the International Women\u2019s Day breakfast which was held this morning in Parliament House (parliament isn\u2019t scheduled to sit again until April after this next week, so they are holding it now. And yes, there is an International Men\u2019s Day and it is in November). Last year Kelly [O\u2019Dwyer] addressed the National Press Club and she had something to say that I think is timeless. She said, \u201cGender equality isn\u2019t about pitting girls against boys. Or women against men. It\u2019s about recognising that girls and women deserve an equal stake in our economy and our society. It\u2019s not about conflict.\u201d It\u2019s about what the message of the day is about. Which is about doing this together. She said, \u201cLife is not a zero sum game, we\u2019re on a life journey together.\u201d And she\u2019s right about that. Kelly said she was speaking as the mother of a son and a daughter. I suspect, on occasion, those boys and girls are against each other, but I\u2019m sure Mum and Dad sort it out. I\u2019m the blessed father of two beautiful young girls and they are of course the joy of my and Jenny\u2019s life. And my girls, like all of our children, allow us as parents to see the world through new eyes, through young eyes, through fresh eyes. And when I see the girls I want them to be able to pursue their passions. I want them to be absolutely confident that they can chase their dreams, whatever they are. And receive the same rewards for their hard work and their beliefs and their passions as their male counterparts, as indeed I\u2019ve had the blessing to do over my life. I want them as adults to have real choices so they can decide what works best for them and their families and not be judged for it. I want them to be free from harassment and violence. I want them to be able to walk the streets of Australia. And I want them to be safe in their home, both today and always in the future. Now our priorities. As the prime minister I\u2019ve laid out three priorities from the very first day. Keeping our economy strong, keeping Australians safe and keeping Australians together. It is very much the theme of today. Economic opportunities, the choices and security that can come with it, [are] at the heart of what my government is seeking to do for a more prosperous, safe and cohesive Australia. Last year\u2019s landmark release of the Women\u2019s Economic Security Statement by Kelly delivered for women by helping boost their skills and employability, backing them to start their own businesses, importantly, and giving women more options to secure their financial independence when they need it most, particularly in their retirement. And that is the agenda we\u2019re working to with increased flexibility for paid parental leave and supporting entrepreneurship opportunities for women and the Stem programs for girls, which I know Karen Andrews is a keen and passionate advocate for as science minister. And we\u2019ve asked the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to inquire into sexual harassment in the workplace. We\u2019re fully engaged in keeping women safe by working together to combat violence against women and this is a shared and equal objective of all members of our parliament. Too many women dying. Horrifically, on average one woman every week. And far too many others suffering in silence. We\u2019ve all reflected on the horrific death of Aiia Maasarwe which rocked the country and she was a guest to our country, she was a visitor to our country. But it really did shake us. It wasn\u2019t the first time this had happened, obviously. But it was an event I think that cried out to the country that this must stop, and stop it must. Linda Burney spoke ahead of the latest Closing the Gap report release: The 2014 budget brought down by this government was horrendous for Aboriginal affairs. $500 million was ripped out of the Aboriginal affairs budget. You do not fix the issues in Aboriginal communities by taking away half a billion dollars out of the budget. There needs to be a recommitment to partnership with Aboriginal people and organisations. We are calling on that partnership. We are saying very clearly that peak Aboriginal organisations and Aboriginal communities have the answers to the social issues that dog those communities. Scott Morrison today says he\u2019s going to make an announcement about removing HECS fees for teachers to go and work in remote communities. Well that just ignores the fact that 79% of Aboriginal people live in urban environments. In fact, that number is very real. 79% of Aboriginal people living in urban environments. Yes, the issues in remote communities are shocking. They need to be addressed, but the Prime Minister and this government ignores that two thirds of Aboriginal people actually live in urban environments. When you look at the record of the Morrison Government in Aboriginal affairs, it is shocking. CDP for example is languishing out there in the bush. Labor will reform CDP program. The changes to the Indigenous Advancement Strategy have been an absolute disaster for Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal organisations. We will reform that. ...Can I just finish off by saying this, Aboriginal people and peak organisations have formed a coalition and they are working towards partnership. Labor agrees with that partnership. And we are calling the Morrison Government to truly make a commitment and make that partnership a reality. The issues in Aboriginal affairs will not be fixed by bureaucrats or politicians in Canberra. The issues in Aboriginal affairs will be fixed by those bureaucrats and us politicians listening to peak organisations and listening to what\u2019s happening in those Aboriginal communities. That\u2019s where the answers are. Kieran Gilbert (and earlier, Laura Jayes) from Sky News have spent the morning forcing government ministers to back up some of their claims arising from the medical evacuation bill. Some have held up better than others. Hakeem al-Araibi and Craig Foster attended a friendly on the parliament soccer oval this morning. Things to watch out for today: Michaelia Cash will have to deliver a five-minute explanation to the Senate ahead of question time, about what has come out of the AWU raids federal court case so far. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation grant Senate inquiry report should also be tabled (it was delayed yesterday, by the valedictory speeches). The Greens think they have the numbers to amend the government\u2019s \u201cbig stick\u201d energy legislation, to ensure the government can\u2019t underwrite coal-fired power projects for energy generation. Closing the Gap will be one of the first things the House turns its attention to this morning. From Calla Wahlquist\u2019s report: A coalition of peak Indigenous organisations is preparing to pressure state and federal governments for a greater share of Closing the Gap funding following the release of the 2019 report card, which found only two of the seven targets were on track. The group is hoping to sign an agreement with the Council of Australian Governments by the end of February outlining a tripartite agreement to update the targets, four of which have expired. The historic deal was struck in December and will ensure control over and responsibility for the targets is shared between Indigenous people, the federal government and state and territory governments. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is expected to promote the new arrangement in his first Closing the Gap update in parliament on Thursday, which will also highlight progress made against key areas like life expectancy, employment and child mortality, despite those targets not being on track. Pauline Hanson was door-stopped about \u2026 all of that, this morning. She said: I\u2019m not going to continue with this. I want to deal with these things today. I\u2019ve got \u2026 I think it\u2019s retaliation and it\u2019s a shame this is happening in parliament. It\u2019s not what I want to see happen. Asked if there were any substance to the claims, she said: None whatsoever. Absolutely none. And, you know, he really needs to go and get some anger management. It\u2019s a real shame. I don\u2019t need to see this, I hold this place up very highly. What\u2019s happened is so wrong. What happened last night? Well, it wasn\u2019t a fight, you know. That will come out, I can\u2019t speak on behalf of James Ashby because I wasn\u2019t there at the time. So thank you. The one story everyone is talking about today, though, no matter what their political persuasion, is this one (as reported by Paul Karp and Chris Knaus). The former One Nation senator Brian Burston has denied allegations that he sexually harassed a staff member and retaliated against Pauline Hanson, his former leader, by accusing her of making unwanted advances towards him. After Hanson used a speech in the Senate on Tuesday night to accuse an unnamed senator of \u201cserious sexual harassment\u201d, Burston confirmed that he was the politician involved. But Burston said on Wednesday night that one of the reasons he left One Nation was because of sexual harassment from Hanson over two decades. And then this happened: Burston was also involved in a physical clash with Hanson\u2019s adviser James Ashby in Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday. Pictures published by News Corp show the pair grappling with each other after Burston, who left One Nation last year in a public falling out, made his accusations against Hanson. Burston claims Mr Ashby approached him as he and his wife were leaving a function. He claims he was injured when he tried to grab a phone Ashby was waving in his face. \u2018I told him to fuck off,\u2019 Burston said. \u2018I lost it.\u2019 Guardian Australia has seen a complaint of sexual harassment made against Burston late last year, as part of a settled unfair dismissal claim. The complaint alleges that Burston made an inappropriate advance on a distressed staff member. She said he had asked whether he could \u201c\u2018fuck\u2019 me to make things better\u201d. A spokeswoman for Burston denied that the senator had propositioned the staff member, stressing that a 70-year old man would not use the word \u2018fuck\u2019. There is a whole other week after this! This first week has been quite something, hasn\u2019t it. February is shaping up to be quite the year. The scare campaign over the medical evacuation bill is in full flight, with Michael McCormack the latest government minister to prove he hasn\u2019t read the bill, has read the bill and doesn\u2019t understand it, or is wilfully lying about it. Say it with me The. Government. Appoints. The. Panel . The. Panel. Can. Only. Overturn. Rejections. For. Transfer. On. Medical. Grounds. The. Minister. Can. Reject. Transfer. Applications. On. Criminality. And. Security. Grounds. I think this eye twitch is now part of me. In other news, the 11th Closing the Gap report will be handed down, the first for Scott Morrison since he became prime minister. It\u2019s not great news. We\u2019ll have more on that, and on Hakeem al-Araibi\u2019s visit to the parliament football oval. Mike Bowers is already out and about and you have the brains of Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp, as well as the specialities of the rest of the Guardian\u2019s brains trust. In a personal tragedy, I still haven\u2019t found a coffee. But we endure. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>Davos is no place for fighting. It is where chief executives fly to in private jets to discuss the dire consequences of climate change, where hot-money speculators deliver homilies on responsible investing, and the world\u2019s media receive every falling cliche with unctuous warmth. Yet last month it was here in Switzerland, amid the sharp shooters and roadblocks, that a very revealing skirmish broke out.</p> <p>At a panel devoted to \u201cmaking digital globalization inclusive\u201d (for Davos is mainly a hollow-eyed human re-enactment of the drabbest Economist editorials), computer tycoon Michael Dell was asked what he thought about a 70% tax on earnings of more than $10m a year. The very idea provoked speakers and audience to peals of laughter. What a joke, to take money away from these deserving multimillionaires! Dell, the 39th richest person in the world, replied that he and his wife already give to charity: \u201cI feel much more comfortable with our ability \u2026 to allocate those funds than I do giving them to the government.\u201d Who needs the imprecise squall of democracy when a man worth $33bn can decide what the masses need? He went on: \u201cI don\u2019t think it will help the growth of the US economy. Name a country where that\u2019s worked \u2013 ever.\u201d Fervent agreement followed until economist Erik Brynjolfsson butted in, citing one country that had had such high tax rates: \u201cThe United States \u2026 from about the 1930s to the 1960s \u2026 and those were pretty good years for growth.\u201d Brynjolfsson is not known for his socialism and his intervention was far milder than that made two days later by historian Rutger Bregman (\u201cTaxes, taxes, taxes \u2026 all the rest is bullshit\u201d), but still, the aromatic consensus had been broken.</p> <p>Were I Anand Giridharadas\u2019s publisher, I would broadcast that exchange as an advertisement for his latest book, in which he takes aim at his favourite targets. The elevation of business people to \u201cleaders\u201d, whose views somehow soar above self-interest; the nose-wrinkling dismissal of messy politics; the blimpish disregard for even recent history \u2013 all are present and shown as incorrect in <em>Winners Take All</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As reporting assignments go, this calls not so much for a flak jacket as a sick bag</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The big questions animating this book are the ones central to western politics today: why is the state of affairs made nonsense by the economic crisis still in place? What explains both the governing class\u2019s lack of serious response to 2008\u2019s banking crash, and the vast inequality that continues in its wake? Rather than economic or political analysis, <em>Winners Take</em><em> All</em> is a study of the alibis and strategies used by Dell and his kind to justify inertia. Giridharadas takes us inside charitable foundations and back-slapping summits to meet management consultants, greying politicians and a few of the most important names in philanthropy. His is the view from the panel discussion, the venture capitalist\u2019s boardroom and the fundraiser with its bespoke canapes.</p> <p>As reporting assignments go, this calls not so much for a flak jacket as a sick bag. In a Manhattan crammed with visiting dignitaries for UN week, Bill Clinton convenes a conference at which the audience is told: \u201cEmpowering girls and women is the hot new branding thing!\u201d David Miliband gazes on as the boss of Western Union chides the prime minister of Sweden: \u201cOne of the issues in the politicians, with all due respect, Mr Prime Minister, is that you guys are voted by local people, but you\u2019re responsible for global issues.\u201d Never mind that Mr Western Union is beholden to his shareholders, it\u2019s the nation state that\u2019s parochial.</p> <p>Giridharadas boards a cruise ship bound for the Bahamas, doubling as a floating conference for entrepreneurs apparently hungry for social justice. Into this arena is beamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a>, whose exposing of the US\u2019s surveillance regime led to his exile in Moscow. He talks to the assembled cruisers about the necessity of heretical thinking, before the Silicon Valley moneyman interviewing him breaks in: \u201cSo I invest in founders for a living. And I gotta tell you \u2026 I smell a founder here \u2026 there\u2019s probably investors waiting for you here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e060d03cac967292ee3bf88ee707416f28cac6c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e060d03cac967292ee3bf88ee707416f28cac6c7/0_596_3992_2396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silicon Valley, California \u2026 one of the elite\u2019s hubs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silicon Valley, California \u2026 one of the elite\u2019s hubs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SpVVK/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Witnessing such hubris and hypocrisy must have been hard on the stomach; it does, however, make superb hate-reading. Through these vignettes, Giridharadas depicts an elite he dubs MarketWorld, an international nexus of consultants and business people and centrist politicians who want \u201cto change the world while also profiting from the status quo\u201d. Its hubs include Silicon Valley and Wall Street, its feeding stations Davos and all the other expensive talking shops. Its denizens have access to political power and millions to buy wider influence, through donating to universities and museums. In his bemused defensiveness over higher taxes, Dell was the embodiment of MarketWorld. The billionaires in this book prefer markets to governments, policies to politics, and love solutions that are win-win \u2013 which is another way of saying that they should never lose. Theirs is conservatism camouflaged in radical adjectives; change you can\u2019t believe in.</p> <p>In this exotic land, Giridharadas is an insider-outsider. Having spent half a chapter beating up McKinsey management consultants, he later reveals that he worked there. Pages are spent laying into TED talks, even though the author has delivered two. His wife is Priya Parker, who describes her business as helping \u201cactivists, elected officials, corporate executives, educators, and philanthropists create transformative gatherings\u201d of precisely the kind her husband skewers in this book. As for networking, Giridharadas admits to mingling with \u201cthe ultra-rich in antler-decorated mansions overlooking the Roaring Fork Valley\u201d. Fair enough: a man\u2019s got to eat \u2013 and he might as well eat devilled eggs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Power has been put in the hands of a group that believes trade unions are merely cartels and hell is other people voting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That background allows him precious access and imbues the text with a catty intimacy that is hugely enjoyable. His one-liners and storytelling zest make Giridharadas the guy who you want to hang out with on the sidelines of that earnest cocktail party. But his analysis could do with some deepening. The ugly vanity of MarketWorld may be eye-catching, but what makes it unfair is that it is bankrolled by the rest of us, through lower wages and low taxes on wealth. Simply put, we pay the billionaires to tell us what to do. What gives their demands such amplification isn\u2019t just their money, vital though that is, it is that they and their friends in government have razed many of the countervailing institutions, whether organised labour or local government. <em>Winners Take All</em> doesn\u2019t name it, but what it\u2019s really describing is an institutional crisis in which the political landscape has been cleared of its forces for representation and reformation. Instead, power has been put in the hands of a group that believes trade unions are merely cartels, thinkers are far inferior to \u201cthought leaders\u201d and hell is other people voting.</p> <p>Giridharadas\u2019s answer to all this is simple: a bigger and more powerful state. \u201cThe government is us,\u201d he quotes Italian philosopher Chiara Cordelli approvingly. And he is right that it is high time politics took back the ground it has lost to policy. But barely more than a line is spent acknowledging that there are plenty of times the government is not us \u2013 when it is taking away our benefits, when it is displacing us from our homes, or when it is cutting taxes for corporations while closing children\u2019s centres.</p> <p>Arguments aside, this is a good book whose most subtle and powerful moments come when Giridharadas finds other insiders with a hankering to be on the outside, agents of change<strong> </strong>who know that the system they work within only shortchanges us. People such as Darren Walker, the sharp-minded African American head of the Ford Foundation charity, who knows the root problem goes deeper than poverty and bad luck; it is inequality. Riding his black limousine into \u201cthe belly of the beast\u201d, a private equity firm, Walker plans how he will broach that argument, but finds himself in front of an impassive audience and resorts to a familiar vaudeville act of telling his harsh life story: born in a hospital run by a charity, raised single-handedly by his mum, working as a busboy aged 12 \u2026 The executives respond by asking how he motivates staff.</p> <p>In this way, banal humiliation is heaped on a good and relatively powerful man trying to reform a system that, on all the available evidence, may not be reformable.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World is published by Allen Lane (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "Davos is no place for fighting. It is where chief executives fly to in private jets to discuss the dire consequences of climate change, where hot-money speculators deliver homilies on responsible investing, and the world\u2019s media receive every falling cliche with unctuous warmth. Yet last month it was here in Switzerland, amid the sharp shooters and roadblocks, that a very revealing skirmish broke out. At a panel devoted to \u201cmaking digital globalization inclusive\u201d (for Davos is mainly a hollow-eyed human re-enactment of the drabbest Economist editorials), computer tycoon Michael Dell was asked what he thought about a 70% tax on earnings of more than $10m a year. The very idea provoked speakers and audience to peals of laughter. What a joke, to take money away from these deserving multimillionaires! Dell, the 39th richest person in the world, replied that he and his wife already give to charity: \u201cI feel much more comfortable with our ability \u2026 to allocate those funds than I do giving them to the government.\u201d Who needs the imprecise squall of democracy when a man worth $33bn can decide what the masses need? He went on: \u201cI don\u2019t think it will help the growth of the US economy. Name a country where that\u2019s worked \u2013 ever.\u201d Fervent agreement followed until economist Erik Brynjolfsson butted in, citing one country that had had such high tax rates: \u201cThe United States \u2026 from about the 1930s to the 1960s \u2026 and those were pretty good years for growth.\u201d Brynjolfsson is not known for his socialism and his intervention was far milder than that made two days later by historian Rutger Bregman (\u201cTaxes, taxes, taxes \u2026 all the rest is bullshit\u201d), but still, the aromatic consensus had been broken. Were I Anand Giridharadas\u2019s publisher, I would broadcast that exchange as an advertisement for his latest book, in which he takes aim at his favourite targets. The elevation of business people to \u201cleaders\u201d, whose views somehow soar above self-interest; the nose-wrinkling dismissal of messy politics; the blimpish disregard for even recent history \u2013 all are present and shown as incorrect in Winners Take All. The big questions animating this book are the ones central to western politics today: why is the state of affairs made nonsense by the economic crisis still in place? What explains both the governing class\u2019s lack of serious response to 2008\u2019s banking crash, and the vast inequality that continues in its wake? Rather than economic or political analysis, Winners Take All is a study of the alibis and strategies used by Dell and his kind to justify inertia. Giridharadas takes us inside charitable foundations and back-slapping summits to meet management consultants, greying politicians and a few of the most important names in philanthropy. His is the view from the panel discussion, the venture capitalist\u2019s boardroom and the fundraiser with its bespoke canapes. As reporting assignments go, this calls not so much for a flak jacket as a sick bag. In a Manhattan crammed with visiting dignitaries for UN week, Bill Clinton convenes a conference at which the audience is told: \u201cEmpowering girls and women is the hot new branding thing!\u201d David Miliband gazes on as the boss of Western Union chides the prime minister of Sweden: \u201cOne of the issues in the politicians, with all due respect, Mr Prime Minister, is that you guys are voted by local people, but you\u2019re responsible for global issues.\u201d Never mind that Mr Western Union is beholden to his shareholders, it\u2019s the nation state that\u2019s parochial. Giridharadas boards a cruise ship bound for the Bahamas, doubling as a floating conference for entrepreneurs apparently hungry for social justice. Into this arena is beamed Edward Snowden, whose exposing of the US\u2019s surveillance regime led to his exile in Moscow. He talks to the assembled cruisers about the necessity of heretical thinking, before the Silicon Valley moneyman interviewing him breaks in: \u201cSo I invest in founders for a living. And I gotta tell you \u2026 I smell a founder here \u2026 there\u2019s probably investors waiting for you here.\u201d Witnessing such hubris and hypocrisy must have been hard on the stomach; it does, however, make superb hate-reading. Through these vignettes, Giridharadas depicts an elite he dubs MarketWorld, an international nexus of consultants and business people and centrist politicians who want \u201cto change the world while also profiting from the status quo\u201d. Its hubs include Silicon Valley and Wall Street, its feeding stations Davos and all the other expensive talking shops. Its denizens have access to political power and millions to buy wider influence, through donating to universities and museums. In his bemused defensiveness over higher taxes, Dell was the embodiment of MarketWorld. The billionaires in this book prefer markets to governments, policies to politics, and love solutions that are win-win \u2013 which is another way of saying that they should never lose. Theirs is conservatism camouflaged in radical adjectives; change you can\u2019t believe in. In this exotic land, Giridharadas is an insider-outsider. Having spent half a chapter beating up McKinsey management consultants, he later reveals that he worked there. Pages are spent laying into TED talks, even though the author has delivered two. His wife is Priya Parker, who describes her business as helping \u201cactivists, elected officials, corporate executives, educators, and philanthropists create transformative gatherings\u201d of precisely the kind her husband skewers in this book. As for networking, Giridharadas admits to mingling with \u201cthe ultra-rich in antler-decorated mansions overlooking the Roaring Fork Valley\u201d. Fair enough: a man\u2019s got to eat \u2013 and he might as well eat devilled eggs. That background allows him precious access and imbues the text with a catty intimacy that is hugely enjoyable. His one-liners and storytelling zest make Giridharadas the guy who you want to hang out with on the sidelines of that earnest cocktail party. But his analysis could do with some deepening. The ugly vanity of MarketWorld may be eye-catching, but what makes it unfair is that it is bankrolled by the rest of us, through lower wages and low taxes on wealth. Simply put, we pay the billionaires to tell us what to do. What gives their demands such amplification isn\u2019t just their money, vital though that is, it is that they and their friends in government have razed many of the countervailing institutions, whether organised labour or local government. Winners Take All doesn\u2019t name it, but what it\u2019s really describing is an institutional crisis in which the political landscape has been cleared of its forces for representation and reformation. Instead, power has been put in the hands of a group that believes trade unions are merely cartels, thinkers are far inferior to \u201cthought leaders\u201d and hell is other people voting. Giridharadas\u2019s answer to all this is simple: a bigger and more powerful state. \u201cThe government is us,\u201d he quotes Italian philosopher Chiara Cordelli approvingly. And he is right that it is high time politics took back the ground it has lost to policy. But barely more than a line is spent acknowledging that there are plenty of times the government is not us \u2013 when it is taking away our benefits, when it is displacing us from our homes, or when it is cutting taxes for corporations while closing children\u2019s centres. Arguments aside, this is a good book whose most subtle and powerful moments come when Giridharadas finds other insiders with a hankering to be on the outside, agents of change who know that the system they work within only shortchanges us. People such as Darren Walker, the sharp-minded African American head of the Ford Foundation charity, who knows the root problem goes deeper than poverty and bad luck; it is inequality. Riding his black limousine into \u201cthe belly of the beast\u201d, a private equity firm, Walker plans how he will broach that argument, but finds himself in front of an impassive audience and resorts to a familiar vaudeville act of telling his harsh life story: born in a hospital run by a charity, raised single-handedly by his mum, working as a busboy aged 12 \u2026 The executives respond by asking how he motivates staff. In this way, banal humiliation is heaped on a good and relatively powerful man trying to reform a system that, on all the available evidence, may not be reformable. \u2022 Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World is published by Allen Lane (\u00a312.99).

Take automation: Scott Corfe, chief economist at the Social Market Foundation, pointed out that automation did not necessarily mean fewer jobs \u2013 just different ones. And politicians were wrong to assume that these would largely be in programming; in fact, programming was likely to be automated in future, while more creative skills would still be in demand. \u201cThe key thing is to enable people to reskill and move around the job market in a more nimble way than they currently can do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Paul Faulkner, chief executive of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, questioned the idea that an ever-changing, unknown jobs future was something new. \u201cEvery generation will have felt that way.\u201d</p> <p>Were students graduating without the skills needed by employers? It was important not to confuse learning skills with content that becomes quickly outdated, said Kathy Armour, pro vice-chancellor (education) at the University of Birmingham, while Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and chief executive of Aston University, said content matters but mainly as \u201cthe context around which you can develop skills and attributes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"122a90a4445bca6b0ce60bf1678c8e34229fe030\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/122a90a4445bca6b0ce60bf1678c8e34229fe030/0_44_5507_3304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Rowley, Paul Faulkner, Kathy Armour and Sonia Hickey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Rowley, Paul Faulkner, Kathy Armour and Sonia Hickey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The consensus was that whatever the future of work looked like, it would demand creativity.</p> <p>Julie Ward, Labour MEP for north-west England, stressed the importance of including arts in the emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics as key subjects, so that Stem becomes Steam. Parents who advised their children that taking arts subjects would harm their job prospects were making a mistake, she said.</p> <p>Yvonne Brown, senior lecturer in management and human resources at Coventry University, said universities needed to ensure the way they assessed students encouraged teamwork and a creative approach to learning. It wasn\u2019t just creativity that employers looked for, added Graham Thompsett, people capability director at Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 it was also curiosity. \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough of that.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Rowley, partner and head of education at KPMG, said his company did not focus on a particular degree or content but on softer skills, which he argued should be taught to students at an earlier stage in the education system.</p> <p>Work experience was essential in developing these skills, speakers agreed. Professor Philip Plowden, vice-chancellor of Birmingham City University, said work placements or experiential learning were invaluable in closing attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Not everyone approached the world of work from the same starting point: many students at Birmingham City came from deprived backgrounds and even short placements could help demystify office life and behaviour. \u201cWe talk about preparing students for an unknown future,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a lot of my students it\u2019s an unknown present.\u201d</p> <p>Work placements had another value too \u2013 in preserving students\u2019 innate abilities. \u201cI think sometimes universities inadvertently stamp out creativity,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI have watched law students coming in with oodles of common sense from their everyday lives. You start teaching them and within about a year they can give you a lecture on contract law, but can\u2019t solve a problem any more they could probably have solved when they came in.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said another way of equipping students with transferable skills was enabling them to work closely with researchers to become independent learners and researchers in their own right.</p> <p>But students needed to pick up more than learning skills from universities to have successful careers, argued Frances Howell, managing director and head of corporate banking Midlands Region, at HSBC. \u201cAnother thing that\u2019s really important is around building the strength and skills of individuals to manage mental wellbeing,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Jason Arday, senior teaching fellow in the Centre for Education Studies at the University of Warwick, said students felt they were paying a lot of money to be at university and that had changed attitudes towards the skills institutions needed to deliver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"10d9e9364293349ed80357546087218c560beebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10d9e9364293349ed80357546087218c560beebb/0_180_4781_2869/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandy Lindsay, Scott Corfe and Jason Arday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandy Lindsay, Scott Corfe and Jason Arday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it was not all up to universities, said Thompsett. Employers needed to change too.

      "bodyText": "A few numbers are enough to sum up how far the world of work is changing. More than six million workers fear their jobs could be replaced by machines in the next 10 years. Around 1.1 million people now work in the gig economy, using online platforms to find small, often on-demand, jobs. And a third of graduates find themselves mismatched to the jobs they secure on graduation. What universities can do to prepare their graduates for an unknown future was the subject of a roundtable, sponsored by HSBC, held in Birmingham last week and attended by senior academic leaders, employers and policy-makers. It emerged that the numbers did not paint the full picture. Take automation: Scott Corfe, chief economist at the Social Market Foundation, pointed out that automation did not necessarily mean fewer jobs \u2013 just different ones. And politicians were wrong to assume that these would largely be in programming; in fact, programming was likely to be automated in future, while more creative skills would still be in demand. \u201cThe key thing is to enable people to reskill and move around the job market in a more nimble way than they currently can do,\u201d he said. Paul Faulkner, chief executive of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, questioned the idea that an ever-changing, unknown jobs future was something new. \u201cEvery generation will have felt that way.\u201d Were students graduating without the skills needed by employers? It was important not to confuse learning skills with content that becomes quickly outdated, said Kathy Armour, pro vice-chancellor (education) at the University of Birmingham, while Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and chief executive of Aston University, said content matters but mainly as \u201cthe context around which you can develop skills and attributes\u201d. The consensus was that whatever the future of work looked like, it would demand creativity. Julie Ward, Labour MEP for north-west England, stressed the importance of including arts in the emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics as key subjects, so that Stem becomes Steam. Parents who advised their children that taking arts subjects would harm their job prospects were making a mistake, she said. Yvonne Brown, senior lecturer in management and human resources at Coventry University, said universities needed to ensure the way they assessed students encouraged teamwork and a creative approach to learning. It wasn\u2019t just creativity that employers looked for, added Graham Thompsett, people capability director at Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 it was also curiosity. \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough of that.\u201d Mike Rowley, partner and head of education at KPMG, said his company did not focus on a particular degree or content but on softer skills, which he argued should be taught to students at an earlier stage in the education system. Work experience was essential in developing these skills, speakers agreed. Professor Philip Plowden, vice-chancellor of Birmingham City University, said work placements or experiential learning were invaluable in closing attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Not everyone approached the world of work from the same starting point: many students at Birmingham City came from deprived backgrounds and even short placements could help demystify office life and behaviour. \u201cWe talk about preparing students for an unknown future,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a lot of my students it\u2019s an unknown present.\u201d Work placements had another value too \u2013 in preserving students\u2019 innate abilities. \u201cI think sometimes universities inadvertently stamp out creativity,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI have watched law students coming in with oodles of common sense from their everyday lives. You start teaching them and within about a year they can give you a lecture on contract law, but can\u2019t solve a problem any more they could probably have solved when they came in.\u201d Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said another way of equipping students with transferable skills was enabling them to work closely with researchers to become independent learners and researchers in their own right. But students needed to pick up more than learning skills from universities to have successful careers, argued Frances Howell, managing director and head of corporate banking Midlands Region, at HSBC. \u201cAnother thing that\u2019s really important is around building the strength and skills of individuals to manage mental wellbeing,\u201d she said. Jason Arday, senior teaching fellow in the Centre for Education Studies at the University of Warwick, said students felt they were paying a lot of money to be at university and that had changed attitudes towards the skills institutions needed to deliver. But it was not all up to universities, said Thompsett. Employers needed to change too. This meant working more closely with universities to develop skills and find suitable \u2013 and diverse \u2013 recruits. Plowden said he would \u201cvehemently disagree\u201d with any suggestion that universities were just about getting a job. But for Cameron it was \u201cbase level hygiene\u201d. While he appreciated the sense of civic engagement, morals and values he derived from his university education, his ability to appreciate it all had been underpinned by the fact that he was employed, and universities failed their students if they did not give them that opportunity. For Sandy Lindsay, founder and chair at the communications consultancy Tangerine, apprenticeships offered one solution. She set up the Juice Academy, a digital marketing apprenticeship programme, because she felt digital marketing was too fast-changing to be taught at the slow pace of a university setting. Yet she felt the government\u2019s current apprenticeship programme was a missed opportunity, lacking essential flexibility. And Plowden agreed that the bureaucracy involved was such that the apprenticeship system \u201cmakes us look like Usain Bolt\u201d. Slowness was particularly problematic in the pace of change on diversity, argued Arday. He was concerned at the persistent attainment gap between white and black and minority ethnic students and felt this was reinforced by the dearth of people of colour in leadership positions in universities or industry. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a model reflective of the student population,\u201d he argued.

      "body": "<h2>Veronetta</h2> <p>This is the \u201cother Verona\u201d, the right bank of the Adige, across from the historic centre. For us, it is the authentic part of the city, popular with the big student population for its cheap street food, pubs and late-night bars. Walk across any of the Adige bridges and the crowds disappear, though there is still plenty to see: the Roman theatre, overlooking the river, and adjoining archaeological museum explain how much ancient history is still waiting to be excavated; higher up, the 16th-century <a href=\"http://giardinogiusti.com/it/\" title=\"\">Giardino Giusti</a> is one of Italy\u2019s finest landscaped gardens. Veronetta is also called Little Jerusalem, as medieval pilgrims to the Holy Land were reminded of Jerusalem by the neighbourhood\u2019s steep hills and cypress trees. Today, volunteers run free <a href=\"http://www.veronaminorhierusalem.it/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Hierusalem Tours</a> on selected dates, when five churches normally closed to the public can be visited (next one 26 February).</p> <h2>Biblioteca Capitolare</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eee1c3c5e32eb3e7a1c86007c664db8ad4f455a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eee1c3c5e32eb3e7a1c86007c664db8ad4f455a/0_209_2673_1604/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Front detail of the Capitolare Library, Verona, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Like everyone in Verona, I visited this library on a school trip, didn\u2019t understand anything and quickly forgot about it. But when I went back recently, I discovered a hidden jewel: the oldest library in Europe, dating to AD517, with a splendid collection of manuscripts and illustrated <em>codici</em>. For me, it is one of the most interesting cultural sights in the city. The library conjures up The Name of the Rose, with display cabinets of priceless books.

Housed in what was supposedly the Montecchi family palazzo (the Montagues in Shakespeare), this could have become a tourist trap but the wonderful owner, Daniela Mazzucco, has never allowed that to happen. Visitors may get a shock when they read the menu, though, as Verona\u2019s favourite meat is horse, especially <em>pastisada</em>, a rich stew on a bed of polenta. But there are plenty of vegetarian options, too: big salads and an unforgettable Amarone wine risotto.

On a street close to the river, it has long been a meeting place for musicians, artists, winemakers and students. It is open till 2am, with a packed terrace in summer. There is an excellent choice of wines, especially from the neighbouring vineyards of Valpolicella and Soave, but also craft beers and cocktails, and the local bubbly, Durello, which makes a change from prosecco. A glass of house wine is \u20ac1.50 and there is music, usually jazz, every Thursday.

In summer, when the river is fairly slow flowing, most people end up taking a dip.

And at \u20ac2 for a return trip, it\u2019s a great way to take in views over Verona and the surrounding hills. The funicular comes out by 14th-century <a href=\"https://verona.com/en/verona/castel-san-pietro/\" title=\"\">Castel San Pietro</a> (closed for restoration). Also at the top is <a href=\"https://reteodorico.com/\" title=\"\">Ristorante Re Teodorico</a>, whose terrace is perfect for a sunset <em>aperitivo</em>, even if an Aperol spritz costs \u20ac5.

Young Veronesi love the party dresses and romantic outfits designed by young owner-stylist Matilde Daniele. She opened her showroom while still a philosophy student at university, encouraged by her mother, who runs a nearby clothing factory where the outfits are made. She only produces four or five copies of each design, so it is almost like haute couture but at off-the-peg prices.<br>\u2022 <em>Vicolo San Marco in Foro 3, on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/loversverona/\" title=\"\">Facebook</a></em></p> <h2>La Lanterna \u2013 vegetarian restaurant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e46283254362ed78d1061aa64d6f2922712c6ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e46283254362ed78d1061aa64d6f2922712c6ff/0_800_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pasta dish on a bed of spinach at Ristorante La Lanterna, Verona, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Given how meat-heavy Veronese cuisine is, you may not expect to see many vegetarian restaurants but over the past few years a number have opened up. La Lanterna is the pioneer of organic vegan cuisine and reinterprets Veneto dishes without meat or dairy (two courses about \u00a325). Try<em> bigoli </em>(fat spaghetti) with a carbonara or rag\u00f9 sauce, a classic <em>grigliata mista</em>, but of seitan, tofu and vegan sausage, or more exotic dishes using tempeh and nori. The wines are organic and there is even gluten-free craft beer. Two inventive chefs, both called Fabio, opened La Lanterna in 2013 when they became vegans and abandoned their jobs cooking with animal produce in a local pizzeria.<br>\u2022 <em>Piazzetta Portichetti 6, <a href=\"http://www.lalanternaverona.it/\" title=\"\">lalanternaverona.it</a></em></p> <h2>Teatro Filarmonico</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4155c5b386c9cf468e33a4b236b21c2d34b3f74c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4155c5b386c9cf468e33a4b236b21c2d34b3f74c/0_197_5740_3444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teatro Filarmonico, Verona, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Many visitors imagine that Verona\u2019s musical scene begins and ends with summer operas in our Roman amphitheatre, but the outdoor season runs from June to September and, for the rest of the year, the same orchestra and chorus offer opera and concerts in the intimate Teatro Filarmonico.

There is an excellent choice of wines, especially from the neighbouring vineyards of Valpolicella and Soave, but also craft beers and cocktails, and the local bubbly, Durello, which makes a change from prosecco. A glass of house wine is \u20ac1.50 and there is music, usually jazz, every Thursday. It also rents bikes by the hour, and runs guided bike tours with lunch and wine (\u20ac32pp). \u2022 Vicolo Cadrega 8, osterialacarega.com Adige rafting This is a unique experience, two hours of thrills for \u20ac25pp, from one end of the city to the other. Even locals are surprised to see their city from down below as they paddle under a dozen bridges, stop off at the Castelvecchio castle, and finish at the ruins of the 300-year-old Venetian customs house. In summer, when the river is fairly slow flowing, most people end up taking a dip. There is also a popular evening trip, Raft &amp; Wine, including stop-offs with plates of prosciutto and mountain cheese, pasta or risotto and dessert, for \u20ac35pp. \u2022 adigerafting.it Funicolare di Castel San Pietro This cable railway was abandoned in the 1970s but recently reopened. And at \u20ac2 for a return trip, it\u2019s a great way to take in views over Verona and the surrounding hills. The funicular comes out by 14th-century Castel San Pietro (closed for restoration). Also at the top is Ristorante Re Teodorico, whose terrace is perfect for a sunset aperitivo, even if an Aperol spritz costs \u20ac5. The journey up takes a few minutes and it\u2019s fun to walk back down the zigzag stairs that lead to the Roman-built Ponte Pietra. \u2022 Via Santo Stefano, funicolarediverona.it Lovers Boutique This Aladidn\u2019s cave of a boutique is down a quiet alleyway by the famous Pozzo dell\u2019Amore, the medieval Well of Love, near packed Piazza delle Erbe. Young Veronesi love the party dresses and romantic outfits designed by young owner-stylist Matilde Daniele. She opened her showroom while still a philosophy student at university, encouraged by her mother, who runs a nearby clothing factory where the outfits are made. She only produces four or five copies of each design, so it is almost like haute couture but at off-the-peg prices. \u2022 Vicolo San Marco in Foro 3, on Facebook La Lanterna \u2013 vegetarian restaurant Given how meat-heavy Veronese cuisine is, you may not expect to see many vegetarian restaurants but over the past few years a number have opened up. La Lanterna is the pioneer of organic vegan cuisine and reinterprets Veneto dishes without meat or dairy (two courses about \u00a325). Try bigoli (fat spaghetti) with a carbonara or rag\u00f9 sauce, a classic grigliata mista, but of seitan, tofu and vegan sausage, or more exotic dishes using tempeh and nori. The wines are organic and there is even gluten-free craft beer. Two inventive chefs, both called Fabio, opened La Lanterna in 2013 when they became vegans and abandoned their jobs cooking with animal produce in a local pizzeria. \u2022 Piazzetta Portichetti 6, lalanternaverona.it Teatro Filarmonico Many visitors imagine that Verona\u2019s musical scene begins and ends with summer operas in our Roman amphitheatre, but the outdoor season runs from June to September and, for the rest of the year, the same orchestra and chorus offer opera and concerts in the intimate Teatro Filarmonico. Founded in 1761, it is a jewel of a theatre, staging unforgettable productions of Don Giovanni or Turandot, and ballets such as Swan Lake. Just behind it is an even more intimate venue, Teatro Ristori, recently restored to its former glory and presenting an eclectic programme from jazz to baroque, with Sunday brunch and wine concerts. \u2022 Via dei Mutilati 1, arena.it Soave day trip Verona is surrounded by vineyards, with Valpolicella on one side and Soave on the other. I make Valpolicella wines but for a day trip nothing beats the fortified medieval town that has given its name to Soave\u2019s renowned white wines. The 13th-century Castello Scaligero di Soave has been magnificently restored and a tour of the 1898 Cantina di Soave, a cooperative of 2,000 viticoltori, is a must. For lunch, the cheap and cheerful Alla Rocca, known as La Bigoleria, serves bigoli with a huge choice of sauces for \u20ac8 a time. On the first Sunday of the month, a huge antiques market takes over Soave\u2019s steep streets. The 131 bus from central Verona stopping right outside Soave\u2019s walls. Stay Hotel Trieste is an arty boutique hotel well located for all the sights and the bus and railway stations, with doubles from \u20ac90 B&amp;B \u2022 Flights were provided by easyJet, which flies to Verona from Gatwick from \u00a376 return.

Most councils have also warned they will still be reducing a range of services, from adult social care to libraries and recycling, while raising charges and fees.</p> <p>The Local Government Information Unit thinktank says eight years of austerity have cost English councils 40% of their central funding. Last week Somerset and Northamptonshire county councils reversed winter gritting cuts amid outcry when untreated roads caused car accidents, while unrepaired potholes and cuts to libraries have grated with residents.</p> <p>\u201cYears of chronic underfunding has left local government on life support,\u201d said the chief executive of the thinktank, Dr Jonathan Carr-West.

Begum told the Times they all married foreign Isis fighters and she initially settled in Raqqa, where the sight of a \u201cbeheaded head\u201d in a bin had not fazed her. Begum confirmed reports that Sultana died in 2016 in an airstrike on Raqqa. She gave a conflicting account of the so-called caliphate. \u201cThere was so much oppression and corruption that I don\u2019t think they deserved victory,\u201d she said. However, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t regret coming here.\u201d The solicitor who represented Shamima Begum\u2019s family said she should be allowed to return and treated as a victim, as Scotland Yard originally characterised the girls. But the case will pose a dilemma for the Foreign Office and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, who would have to decide whether Begum should be allowed back to the UK.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>People\u2019s vote pressure mounts \u2013 </strong>Jeremy Corbyn is being warned of resignations from his frontbench if he fails to back a people\u2019s vote on Brexit. Anti-Brexit MPs believe it is time to make the move after May rejected Labour\u2019s calls for a customs union. The shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, has called for Labour to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/labour-mp-submits-plan-for-referendum-on-brexit-deal\">\u201cget to the bit of our conference policy where it supports a people\u2019s vote\u201d</a>. The Commons is due to vote today on a government motion laying out the next stage of Brexit negotiations \u2013 and Hardline Brexit supporters are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/hardline-brexiters-threaten-to-vote-down-theresa-mays-motion\">threatening to inflict another defeat on May</a> because they fear the government is effectively ruling out leaving the EU with no deal. The Labour MP Geraint Davies has tabled an amendment calling for a referendum. \u201cThere is a hidden majority in the house that want to support this position \u2026 but we are running out of time,\u201d Davies said. Senior Labour figures including Keir Starmer have met with ministers to repeat Corbyn\u2019s five demands for supporting a Brexit deal and call for changes to Theresa May\u2019s red lines. Further meetings are expected next week.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Portraits by serial murderer \u2013 </strong>The FBI has released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/13/serial-killer-samuel-little-drawings-victims-fbi\">sketches made by a serial killer of his alleged victims</a> in the hope that they may help solve dozens of unsolved homicides.

The FBI says Little, who is 78, is in poor health and is expected to remain in a Texas prison where he is serving life without parole over three murders in California.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Secret Nissan millions \u2013 </strong>Labour has accused the business secretary, Greg Clark, of misleading MPs by failing to tell parliament that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/14/greg-clark-accused-of-misleading-mps-over-61m-payment-to-nissan\">\u00a361m package of state aid had been granted to Nissan</a>. The details emerged this month when the car maker changed its mind about building the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. The government has argued that the promise was vetted by the independent Industrial Development Advisory Board and not required to be reported to parliament.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Court brands Manafort a liar \u2013 </strong>Paul Manafort told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/13/federal-judge-finds-manafort-lied-to-mueller\">lies about liaising with an alleged Russian intelligence operative</a> even after he had agreed to cooperate with Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry, a judge has ruled. The determination frees the Trump-Russia investigators from a plea deal with Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman. As part of the deal, Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice. Other charges against him were dropped. By then, Manafort had been convicted of eight criminal counts in a separate fraud case brought against him by Mueller in Virginia. Mueller has said the lies told to investigators amount to new crimes.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Opportunity lost \u2013 </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/13/nasa-makes-final-attempt-to-communicate-with-mars-rover-opportunity\">Mars Opportunity rover is dead</a>, Nasa scientists have lamentingly announced.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Local government is on life support\u2019 Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray delivering an elegant sufficiency of news. Almost all councils in England plan to increase council tax from April and three-quarters intend to raise it above 2.75%, research reveals. Most councils have also warned they will still be reducing a range of services, from adult social care to libraries and recycling, while raising charges and fees. The Local Government Information Unit thinktank says eight years of austerity have cost English councils 40% of their central funding. Last week Somerset and Northamptonshire county councils reversed winter gritting cuts amid outcry when untreated roads caused car accidents, while unrepaired potholes and cuts to libraries have grated with residents. \u201cYears of chronic underfunding has left local government on life support,\u201d said the chief executive of the thinktank, Dr Jonathan Carr-West. The local government ministry says councils are to receive an extra \u00a31bn in the coming year. * * * Airbus to stop making A380 \u2013 Airbus has announced this morning that it will end production of its flagship A380 superjumbo, potentially putting UK jobs at risk. The firm said it had made the \u201cpainful\u201d decision after the Emirates airline cuts its latest order of the jetliners from 162 to 123. The Airbus chief executive, Tom Enders, said: \u201cThe A380 is not only an outstanding engineering and industrial achievement. Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft. Hence today\u2019s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide.\u201d Emirates is yet to take delivery of 14 of the aircraft, parts of which are made in the UK. * * * \u2018I just want to come home\u2019 \u2013 The former East London schoolgirl Shamima Begum, who fled Britain to join Islamic State at age 15, says she is nine months\u2019 pregnant and wants to come home. Begum, who is in a Syrian refugee camp, told the Times that she fled the jihadists\u2019 last remaining enclave in Baghuz after her two other children died from illness and malnutrition. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child.\u201d She and fellow Bethnal Green Academy pupils Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase flew from Gatwick airport to Turkey in 2015, then entered Syria. Begum told the Times they all married foreign Isis fighters and she initially settled in Raqqa, where the sight of a \u201cbeheaded head\u201d in a bin had not fazed her. Begum confirmed reports that Sultana died in 2016 in an airstrike on Raqqa. She gave a conflicting account of the so-called caliphate. \u201cThere was so much oppression and corruption that I don\u2019t think they deserved victory,\u201d she said. However, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t regret coming here.\u201d The solicitor who represented Shamima Begum\u2019s family said she should be allowed to return and treated as a victim, as Scotland Yard originally characterised the girls. But the case will pose a dilemma for the Foreign Office and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, who would have to decide whether Begum should be allowed back to the UK. * * * People\u2019s vote pressure mounts \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn is being warned of resignations from his frontbench if he fails to back a people\u2019s vote on Brexit. Anti-Brexit MPs believe it is time to make the move after May rejected Labour\u2019s calls for a customs union. The shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, has called for Labour to \u201cget to the bit of our conference policy where it supports a people\u2019s vote\u201d. The Commons is due to vote today on a government motion laying out the next stage of Brexit negotiations \u2013 and Hardline Brexit supporters are threatening to inflict another defeat on May because they fear the government is effectively ruling out leaving the EU with no deal. The Labour MP Geraint Davies has tabled an amendment calling for a referendum. \u201cThere is a hidden majority in the house that want to support this position \u2026 but we are running out of time,\u201d Davies said. Senior Labour figures including Keir Starmer have met with ministers to repeat Corbyn\u2019s five demands for supporting a Brexit deal and call for changes to Theresa May\u2019s red lines. Further meetings are expected next week. * * * Portraits by serial murderer \u2013 The FBI has released sketches made by a serial killer of his alleged victims in the hope that they may help solve dozens of unsolved homicides. Samuel Little has confessed to murdering 90 women over nearly four decades. Little targeted \u201cmarginalized and vulnerable women who were often involved in prostitution and addicted to drugs\u201d, according to the FBI. It hopes the information will generate tips and clues from the public that could help solve the dozens of homicides. The FBI says Little, who is 78, is in poor health and is expected to remain in a Texas prison where he is serving life without parole over three murders in California. * * * Secret Nissan millions \u2013 Labour has accused the business secretary, Greg Clark, of misleading MPs by failing to tell parliament that a \u00a361m package of state aid had been granted to Nissan. The details emerged this month when the car maker changed its mind about building the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. The government has argued that the promise was vetted by the independent Industrial Development Advisory Board and not required to be reported to parliament. * * * Court brands Manafort a liar \u2013 Paul Manafort told lies about liaising with an alleged Russian intelligence operative even after he had agreed to cooperate with Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry, a judge has ruled. The determination frees the Trump-Russia investigators from a plea deal with Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman. As part of the deal, Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice. Other charges against him were dropped. By then, Manafort had been convicted of eight criminal counts in a separate fraud case brought against him by Mueller in Virginia. Mueller has said the lies told to investigators amount to new crimes. * * * Opportunity lost \u2013 The Mars Opportunity rover is dead, Nasa scientists have lamentingly announced. It was only meant to survive for 90 Martian days and cover 1km after its landing in 2004, but was able to keep buggying on for 15 years and 45km until a dust storm cut off communications for good. Opportunity\u2019s twin Spirit rover wore out in 2011, while the larger Mars Curiosity rover is still going after more than six years.

Lunchtime read: Neo-Nazi who wants to run Slovakia In 2013 the far-right politician Marian Kotleba won a shock victory in Slovakia\u2019s regional elections. He moved into the governor\u2019s mansion in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica \u2013 where he set up a basement gym for his burly entourage, and brought in a printing press to pump out pamphlets railing against corrupt politicians, \u201cGypsy criminals\u201d, promiscuity, abortion and homosexuality as threats to Slovak life. Three years later, Kotleba lost his governorship but managed to take his far-right party into parliament, where it won 14 out of 150 seats in the Slovak legislature. In March he will run for president. Shaun Walker tracks the rise of a political extremist who venerates Slovakia\u2019s past as a Nazi puppet state. Sport Tottenham gave their Champions League hopes a huge boost by crushing Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund with a second-half goal blitz sparked by Son Heung-min in the first leg of their quarter-final. In Amsterdam, Marco Asensio scored a late winner for Real Madrid in a 2-1 victory over Ajax, who were left to rue a goal disallowed by the VAR. The IAAF has emphatically rejected a report that it wants the women\u2019s Olympic 800m champion, Caster Semenya, to be classified as a biological male when her landmark case is heard next week. The British Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist Callum Skinner has urged his fellow athletes to sign up for a new global body that he says will stand up for their rights \u2013 and ensure they are no longer treated with \u201cdisdain\u201d by the IOC and Wada. Shannon Gabriel has been suspended for the first four ODIs against England following the on-field altercation in St Lucia that prompted Joe Root to tell him \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay\u201d. And after six days of suspension due to an outbreak of equine flu, there was a sense of relief for jockeys, bookies and punters as hooves hit the turf again at Plumpton. Business Japan\u2019s economic growth for the last three months of 2018 rebounded from a slump the previous quarter, growing at an annual rate of 1.4%. Cabinet Office data shows recovery in exports, consumer demand, investments and government spending. GDP had contracted during the July-September quarter. Japan plans to raise its consumption tax in October from 8% to 10%, which could slow consumer spending.

awarding of the grant last year \u201ca highly irresponsible decision, hastily concocted by relevant ministers\u201d and calls for a fresh review of the structure of all government funding meant to protect the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>It recommends such a review be completed by July this year and used to guide the spending of remaining money from the grant.</p> <p>\u201cThis grant was a

was a chance for governments to \u201creset\u201d and come up with a better plan for future management of the reef that involved proper consultation with all stakeholders.</p> <p>Other findings by the majority committee, made up of Labor and Greens senators, are that the \u201c\u2018off-the-cuff decision has caused massive disruption to existing policy and program delivery, including by existing government agencies\u201d.</p> <p>The report says the most appropriate action would be to \u201cterminate the foundation partnership\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe committee believes this is necessary to help restore trust in the process of commonwealth funding for the reef, if not the entire commonwealth grants process,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>The report also recommends the federal and Queensland governments publish an updated Reef 2050 Plan investment framework that outlines current figures on established funding listed by both the source and priority area for spending.</p> <p>It says if the reef partnership remains in place, \u201cthe committee recommends that all necessary steps be undertaken to ensure that the foundation\u2019s investment of public funds precludes investment in sectors or funds that directly or indirectly contribute to climate change\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

      "bodyText": "A committee examining the government\u2019s decision to award $443.3m to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has recommended unspent funds from the controversial grant be returned to the commonwealth and reserved for future reef projects. The final report, tabled in the Senate on Thursday, calls the awarding of the grant last year \u201ca highly irresponsible decision, hastily concocted by relevant ministers\u201d and calls for a fresh review of the structure of all government funding meant to protect the Great Barrier Reef. It recommends such a review be completed by July this year and used to guide the spending of remaining money from the grant. \u201cThis grant was a desperate attempt to cover up this government\u2019s legacy of reef mismanagement, years of chronic underfunding and disregard for climate change, in the context of an imminent world heritage \u2018in danger\u2019 listing,\u201d the committee\u2019s chair, Peter Whish-Wilson, said. \u201cIt was clearly a political decision made with no consultation, due diligence or regard for proper process.\u201d Whish-Wilson said the report was a chance for governments to \u201creset\u201d and come up with a better plan for future management of the reef that involved proper consultation with all stakeholders. Other findings by the majority committee, made up of Labor and Greens senators, are that the \u201c\u2018off-the-cuff decision has caused massive disruption to existing policy and program delivery, including by existing government agencies\u201d. The report says the most appropriate action would be to \u201cterminate the foundation partnership\u201d. \u201cThe committee believes this is necessary to help restore trust in the process of commonwealth funding for the reef, if not the entire commonwealth grants process,\u201d the report says. The report also recommends the federal and Queensland governments publish an updated Reef 2050 Plan investment framework that outlines current figures on established funding listed by both the source and priority area for spending. It says if the reef partnership remains in place, \u201cthe committee recommends that all necessary steps be undertaken to ensure that the foundation\u2019s investment of public funds precludes investment in sectors or funds that directly or indirectly contribute to climate change\u201d. Coalition senators on the committee wrote a dissenting report stating they did not support the findings of the majority committee and \u201cthere has been exceptional transparency about this grant\u201d. The environment minister, Melissa Price, said on Thursday afternoon the reef \u201cneeds action, not politics\u201d and the government was providing the funding at a critical time. \u201cAnyone who steps back from the political point-scoring of late, must acknowledge the outstanding calibre of the scientific, environmental, community and business credentials of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who genuinely care about protecting the reef will support the fact that governments, scientists, communities and the private sector are now working together to achieve real outcomes that will help this natural wonder.\u201d The Senate inquiry was established last year after it was revealed the $443.3m grant had been awarded to the small foundation without a tender process. In hearings in July, the foundation\u2019s managing director, Anna Marsden, told senators the foundation was offered the money in a private meeting between its chair, John Schubert, the then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg, who at the time was the environment and energy minister. An official audit by the Australian National Audit Office published in January criticised the government for applying insufficient scrutiny to numerous aspects of the proposal. The audit found the department was given just 11 days to find a private organisation to deliver the record grant, announced in April last year, and it suggested the foundation as the \u201cobvious partner\u201d after just three. The audit also found that the administration costs associated with the grant could be as high as $86.41m. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws last year showed the department warned the government there was a \u201csignificant\u201d risk on-the-ground reef projects could be delayed because the small foundation would have to expand its operations first.",

      "body": "<p>Let\u2019s talk about sex, shall we? Fashion and sex, that is. First things first: any conversation about sex needs to be an honest one, so let\u2019s cut straight to the chase. Sex appeal will always be an integral part of fashion, even if sexy has become a less straightforward compliment after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">MeToo</a>. So please, there\u2019s no point pretending that we are too woke to care about looking hot these days. We still care. Nobody is taking vows of sartorial chastity here. But perhaps we are making some progress in how we think about sex and fashion if we are more conscious of whose rules are being played by, and whose needs are being met. As long as the survival of the human race depends on sex, looking attractive isn\u2019t going out of fashion. But there is room for evolution.</p> <p>It is Valentine\u2019s weekend, and dressing for date night is the hot spot where the rules of attraction meet the rules of social convention. Which means that some Valentine looks might just be a little different this year, in the MeToo afterglow. The neckline might be altered, or the skirt might be a new length. Or maybe the clothes are the same but you might wear different underwear or decide against the high court shoes with toe cleavage, and look \u2013 and feel \u2013 different as a result. The way we dress for date night through the years reveals so much about our changing attitudes to sex. Braless under a silk blouse in the midst of the sexual emancipation of the early 70s. Spike-heeled and armoured in sequins in the competitively charged, battle-of-the-boardroom 80s. Unravelled and lipstick-smudged in the fog of 90s grunge when a Saturday night was more about getting high than getting laid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0857cb0f58c8f8dab901c107e6e61ebac0692472\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0857cb0f58c8f8dab901c107e6e61ebac0692472/0_0_2840_4256/667.jpg\" alt=\"A Gucci model at Paris fashion week \u2026 dressed in a way that might work for a portrait sitting with Leonardo da Vinci rather than Helmut Newton.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Gucci model at Paris fashion week \u2026 dressed in a way that might work for a portrait sitting with Leonardo da Vinci rather than Helmut Newton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is 18 months \u2013 three seasons, in fashion terms \u2013 since the MeToo movement was born. In that time, fashion\u2019s centre of gravity has shifted away from sex. Hemlines are longer, silhouettes are looser. From London to Milan to Paris to New York, on glitzy spotlit runways polished to a mirror shine and on catwalks marked out with tape on concrete floors, a new course is being set. From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/stella-mccartney\" title=\"\">Stella McCartney</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/erdem\" title=\"\">Erdem</a>, <a href=\"https://uk.coach.com/\" title=\"\">Coach</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/28/jonathan-anderson-gives-exhibition-craft-loewe-paris\" title=\"\">Loewe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dior\" title=\"\">Dior</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/max-mara\" title=\"\">Max Mara</a>, there are skirts that swish the ankle and sleeves that graze the fingertips. Fashion has shifted the emphasis from skin to fabric. As a sweeping generalisation, there are more sweeping hemlines. Gucci, the runaway fashion success story of this decade, peoples its catwalks and advertising campaigns with women who would appear to be dressed in a way that might work for a portrait sitting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/davinci\" title=\"\">Leonardo da Vinci</a> rather than for one with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/26/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Helmut Newton</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/21/roland-mouret-this-much-i-know\" title=\"\">Roland Mouret</a>, a fashion icon for two decades, has recently gravitated away from the siren curves of his Galaxy dress, revisiting the pleats and cascades he learned while working with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/14/yohji-yamamoto-designer-v-and-a\" title=\"\">Yohji Yamamoto</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/10/issey-miyake-45-years-at-the-forefront-of-fashion\" title=\"\">Issey Miyake</a> in his 20s. At his spring/summer 19 show, models wore badges in support of the MeToo movement and catwalked on the roof of the National Theatre to the sound of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeDksSfuqaU\" title=\"\">Aretha Franklin singing Natural Woman</a>. Mouret said at the time that the new silhouette felt like a redefinition of his relationship with the female body. In the second half of her decade in fashion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/victoria-beckham\" title=\"\">Victoria Beckham</a>, too, has pivoted firmly away from fitted dresses and toward loose, fluid separates. Such silhouettes \u2013 once the hallmark of alternative, arthouse fashion \u2013 have become mainstream. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/s_p_v_n_c_e/\" title=\"\">Vanessa Spence</a>, design director at Asos, confirms the shift is happening on the high street. \u201cThe midi length has become a staple in our fashion vocabulary. Necklines still vary, but we have recently seen more of a focus on the back as an exposed area.\u201d Sexy, she says, is no longer a concept that takes up more bandwidth in womenswear than men\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s the same across the sexes \u2013 which is surely a good thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e35e84b1a0562534ae1f007a35ffaead82d34f9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e35e84b1a0562534ae1f007a35ffaead82d34f9a/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The emphasis has switched from skin to fabric\u2019 \u2026 model Kaia Gerber at the Max Mara show during Milan fashion week spring/summer 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The emphasis has switched from skin to fabric\u2019 \u2026 model Kaia Gerber at the Max Mara show during Milan fashion week spring/summer 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacopo Raule/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There will always be cross-pollination between sex and fashion, but MeToo has prompted a conversation about healthy boundaries around nudity and exposure. Changing facilities backstage at fashion shows are one issue being brought into the spotlight. It was long considered perfectly normal for an assortment of well-wishers, journalists, celebrities, friends of the designer \u2013 most, of course, with a camera phone in their pocket \u2013 to crowd immediately after a show into the open-plan backstage area where models were scrambling out of their show looks and into their own clothes. A year ago, New York fashion week was the first to address this, pledging \u201ca safe and respectful working environment\u201d with private changing areas. During London fashion week last September, the British model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/09/edie-campbell-says-fashion-world-complicit-in-abuse-of-models\" title=\"\">Edie Campbell</a> spoke to Radio 4 about the ongoing lack of privacy at some London shows, describing it as \u201cbizarre, uncomfortable and humiliating\u201d. Awareness is growing that an expectation of endless female nudity is not a healthy baseline for any industry.</p> <p>The meteoric impact of MeToo on what it means to dress up and look your best became clear a year ago, when the Golden Globes was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2018/jan/08/golden-globes-fashion-highlights-from-the-red-carpet-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the first red carpet to turn black</a>. It was a gesture of female solidarity from Hollywood\u2019s women, in an industry reeling in the Weinstein fallout. A black dress for black tie is hardly revolutionary, yet the dresses became the story of the night. The winners\u2019 list is now a distant memory, but the red carpet blackout remains a landmark moment. The world was reminded of the power of an outfit \u2013 even one that stays within the guardrails of convention \u2013 to send a powerful message. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/natalie-portman\" title=\"\">Natalie Portman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/elisabeth-moss\" title=\"\">Elisabeth Moss</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\" title=\"\">Meryl Streep</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/angelinajolie\" title=\"\">Angelina Jolie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/penelopecruz\" title=\"\">Pen\u00e9lope Cruz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/salma-hayek\" title=\"\">Salma Hayek</a> wore long black gowns with long sleeves. In each case, the dress had a decorative element that lightened the mood \u2013 a sheer layer, a split in the skirt or a portrait neckline. Many actresses left husbands and boyfriends at home to pair up with female activists for the night, which threw into sharp relief the traditional award show optics that see an actress nominated for an Oscar totter in a tiny, pastel-toned frock on the arm of a man in a suit, as if she were a magician\u2019s assistant about to be put in a box and sawn in half.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68b36ca21729cb5318bb9681f0416dcc4397fe80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68b36ca21729cb5318bb9681f0416dcc4397fe80/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At the Golden Globes women wore black as a gesture of solidarity and in support of anti-harrassment campaigns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the 2017 Golden Globes women wore black as a gesture of solidarity and in support of anti-harrassment campaigns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if the first half of 2018 belonged to a swelling tide of demure black-tie dressing, the second half was dominated by an angry backlash against catwalk near-nudity. The exit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/phoebe-philo\" title=\"\">Phoebe Philo</a> from C\u00e9line after 10 years had been felt as a body blow by women who had held dear her philosophy that catwalk fashion could be an elevated woman-friendly wardrobe rather than date-bait. It was with unfortunate timing that her successor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/hedi-slimane\" title=\"\">Hedi Slimane</a>, unveiled a debut dominated by doll-sized party dresses \u2013 one that seemed the polar opposite of what the house had stood for under Philo \u2013 on the very day of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brett-kavanaugh\" title=\"\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> sexual misconduct hearings in Washington last September. Emotions were running high, and Slimane\u2019s dolly-drop aesthetic became a lightning rod for female fury.</p> <p>Male designers mansplaining female sexuality to the women who buy their clothes is not new. But the context has changed, and in fashion, context is all. Engagement with the world is what makes fashion more than simply clothes. It is, quite literally, what makes it fashion. Two months after Slimane\u2019s show, the Victoria\u2019s Secret models came bounding down their runway, with the tried-and-tested formula of bouncy breasts and jutting hipbones, angel wings and skimpy boudoir lace knickers which made this the most popular fashion show in the world just a few years ago.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s talk about sex, shall we? Fashion and sex, that is. First things first: any conversation about sex needs to be an honest one, so let\u2019s cut straight to the chase. Sex appeal will always be an integral part of fashion, even if sexy has become a less straightforward compliment after MeToo. So please, there\u2019s no point pretending that we are too woke to care about looking hot these days. We still care. Nobody is taking vows of sartorial chastity here. But perhaps we are making some progress in how we think about sex and fashion if we are more conscious of whose rules are being played by, and whose needs are being met. As long as the survival of the human race depends on sex, looking attractive isn\u2019t going out of fashion. But there is room for evolution. It is Valentine\u2019s weekend, and dressing for date night is the hot spot where the rules of attraction meet the rules of social convention. Which means that some Valentine looks might just be a little different this year, in the MeToo afterglow. The neckline might be altered, or the skirt might be a new length. Or maybe the clothes are the same but you might wear different underwear or decide against the high court shoes with toe cleavage, and look \u2013 and feel \u2013 different as a result. The way we dress for date night through the years reveals so much about our changing attitudes to sex. Braless under a silk blouse in the midst of the sexual emancipation of the early 70s. Spike-heeled and armoured in sequins in the competitively charged, battle-of-the-boardroom 80s. Unravelled and lipstick-smudged in the fog of 90s grunge when a Saturday night was more about getting high than getting laid. It is 18 months \u2013 three seasons, in fashion terms \u2013 since the MeToo movement was born. In that time, fashion\u2019s centre of gravity has shifted away from sex. Hemlines are longer, silhouettes are looser. From London to Milan to Paris to New York, on glitzy spotlit runways polished to a mirror shine and on catwalks marked out with tape on concrete floors, a new course is being set. From Stella McCartney to Erdem, Coach to Loewe, Dior to Max Mara, there are skirts that swish the ankle and sleeves that graze the fingertips. Fashion has shifted the emphasis from skin to fabric. As a sweeping generalisation, there are more sweeping hemlines. Gucci, the runaway fashion success story of this decade, peoples its catwalks and advertising campaigns with women who would appear to be dressed in a way that might work for a portrait sitting with Leonardo da Vinci rather than for one with Helmut Newton. Roland Mouret, a fashion icon for two decades, has recently gravitated away from the siren curves of his Galaxy dress, revisiting the pleats and cascades he learned while working with Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake in his 20s. At his spring/summer 19 show, models wore badges in support of the MeToo movement and catwalked on the roof of the National Theatre to the sound of Aretha Franklin singing Natural Woman. Mouret said at the time that the new silhouette felt like a redefinition of his relationship with the female body. In the second half of her decade in fashion, Victoria Beckham, too, has pivoted firmly away from fitted dresses and toward loose, fluid separates. Such silhouettes \u2013 once the hallmark of alternative, arthouse fashion \u2013 have become mainstream. Vanessa Spence, design director at Asos, confirms the shift is happening on the high street. \u201cThe midi length has become a staple in our fashion vocabulary. Necklines still vary, but we have recently seen more of a focus on the back as an exposed area.\u201d Sexy, she says, is no longer a concept that takes up more bandwidth in womenswear than men\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s the same across the sexes \u2013 which is surely a good thing.\u201d There will always be cross-pollination between sex and fashion, but MeToo has prompted a conversation about healthy boundaries around nudity and exposure. Changing facilities backstage at fashion shows are one issue being brought into the spotlight. It was long considered perfectly normal for an assortment of well-wishers, journalists, celebrities, friends of the designer \u2013 most, of course, with a camera phone in their pocket \u2013 to crowd immediately after a show into the open-plan backstage area where models were scrambling out of their show looks and into their own clothes. A year ago, New York fashion week was the first to address this, pledging \u201ca safe and respectful working environment\u201d with private changing areas. During London fashion week last September, the British model Edie Campbell spoke to Radio 4 about the ongoing lack of privacy at some London shows, describing it as \u201cbizarre, uncomfortable and humiliating\u201d. Awareness is growing that an expectation of endless female nudity is not a healthy baseline for any industry. The meteoric impact of MeToo on what it means to dress up and look your best became clear a year ago, when the Golden Globes was the first red carpet to turn black. It was a gesture of female solidarity from Hollywood\u2019s women, in an industry reeling in the Weinstein fallout. A black dress for black tie is hardly revolutionary, yet the dresses became the story of the night. The winners\u2019 list is now a distant memory, but the red carpet blackout remains a landmark moment. The world was reminded of the power of an outfit \u2013 even one that stays within the guardrails of convention \u2013 to send a powerful message. Natalie Portman, Elisabeth Moss, Meryl Streep, Angelina Jolie, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Salma Hayek wore long black gowns with long sleeves. In each case, the dress had a decorative element that lightened the mood \u2013 a sheer layer, a split in the skirt or a portrait neckline. Many actresses left husbands and boyfriends at home to pair up with female activists for the night, which threw into sharp relief the traditional award show optics that see an actress nominated for an Oscar totter in a tiny, pastel-toned frock on the arm of a man in a suit, as if she were a magician\u2019s assistant about to be put in a box and sawn in half. But if the first half of 2018 belonged to a swelling tide of demure black-tie dressing, the second half was dominated by an angry backlash against catwalk near-nudity. The exit of Phoebe Philo from C\u00e9line after 10 years had been felt as a body blow by women who had held dear her philosophy that catwalk fashion could be an elevated woman-friendly wardrobe rather than date-bait. It was with unfortunate timing that her successor, Hedi Slimane, unveiled a debut dominated by doll-sized party dresses \u2013 one that seemed the polar opposite of what the house had stood for under Philo \u2013 on the very day of the Brett Kavanaugh sexual misconduct hearings in Washington last September. Emotions were running high, and Slimane\u2019s dolly-drop aesthetic became a lightning rod for female fury. Male designers mansplaining female sexuality to the women who buy their clothes is not new. But the context has changed, and in fashion, context is all. Engagement with the world is what makes fashion more than simply clothes. It is, quite literally, what makes it fashion. Two months after Slimane\u2019s show, the Victoria\u2019s Secret models came bounding down their runway, with the tried-and-tested formula of bouncy breasts and jutting hipbones, angel wings and skimpy boudoir lace knickers which made this the most popular fashion show in the world just a few years ago. This time the spectacle was met with critical scorn (website Vox ran a feature with the headline The Stubborn Irrelevance Of The Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show), falling ratings and \u2013 most tellingly \u2013 declining sales. London fashion week has never been afraid of controversy. While other cities have reacted to the new climate by shying away from the idea of sex altogether, designers Christopher Kane and Michael Halpern are among those tackling the new rules of sexy dressing head-on, and reaching for a new body-positive, female-first way to talk about sex on the catwalk. A frank curiosity about sex has always been part of Kane\u2019s aesthetic \u2013 his spring 2014 season featured sweaters embroidered with illustrations of the reproductive organs of flowers \u2013 and in February last year, he waded into the MeToo debate with a collection adorned with drawings and quotes from the seminal 70s manual The Joy Of Sex. Six months later, he was back with a spring 2019 collection soundtracked by a David Attenborough narration about sexual behaviour in animals and Marilyn Monroe talking about how society defined her as a sex object and then despised her because of it. \u201cThere are no taboos in my studio,\u201d Kane said after that show. \u201cTo be bluntly honest,\u201d he told Vogue at the time, \u201cwe wear clothes to attract members of the opposite sex and of our own sex.

      "body": "<p>In December 2013, Marian Kotleba, a former secondary school teacher who had become Slovakia\u2019s most notorious political extremist, arrived to begin work at his new office \u2013 the governor\u2019s mansion in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, the country\u2019s sixth-largest city. Kotleba venerated Slovakia\u2019s wartime Nazi puppet state, and liked to dress up in the uniforms of its shock troops, who had helped to round up thousands of Jews during the Holocaust. Now, in the biggest electoral shock anyone could remember in the two decades since Slovakia\u2019s independence, the people of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and the surrounding region had voted for the 37-year-old Kotleba to be their governor. The four-storey mansion, with its vaulted ceilings and gilded pillars, would be his workplace for the next four years.</p> <p>Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica is a tranquil kind of place, with a genteel Mitteleuropa charm: the centre has pavement cafes, neat rows of burgher houses and a number of handsome baroque churches. At eight minutes to every hour, a clock in the central square plays a dainty jewellery-box jingle. And now, it had the dubious distinction of being the first place in modern Europe to have elected a person widely regarded as a neo-fascist to a major office.</p> <p>For the next four years, heavy-set men in the green shirts of Kotleba\u2019s Our Slovakia party guarded the door of the administration building; they worked out in a gym that was constructed for them in the basement of the governor\u2019s office. Journalists, for the most part, were forbidden to enter. Kotleba branded the mainstream media liars, and said he would communicate directly with the people. An industrial printing press, brought into the building early in his term, pumped out regular pamphlets called Our Slovakia, which were sent across the region, and later, the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/01/how-a-slovakian-neo-nazi-got-elected-podcast\">How a Slovakian neo-Nazi got elected \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The colourful, four-page leaflets were packed with the tropes that had defined Kotleba\u2019s campaign: decent Slovaks were being exploited and terrorised by corrupt politicians, \u201cGypsy criminals\u201d and shadowy international forces. Articles railed against promiscuity, abortion and homosexuality, all of which threatened the traditional family and the Slovak nation. Often, there was a personal appeal from Kotleba not to believe the \u201ctendentious opinions\u201d about him in the media. Tall, stocky and balding, and always wearing a neatly trimmed moustache, Kotleba looked equal parts supply teacher and gang leader. He had a purposeful strut and a boxer\u2019s habit of shifting his weight from one foot to the other. At meetings and rallies, he spoke in a hectoring, insistent tone about the urgency of his tasks.</p> <p>In many of the smaller settlements there were simply not enough jobs, and the most talented people got out as soon as they could. There was a vague resentment at being seen as second-class citizens inside the European Union, and a more acute feeling that the Slovak political class was isolated from the masses and only interested in lining its pockets. Soon enough, the same issues would fuel the rise of rightwing populism across the region. Within a few years, after migration and nationalism had taken over the political agenda, much of Europe would also be grappling with the far-right\u2019s success at the ballot box. But back in 2013, nobody was expecting a neo-Nazi to win an election. How was it possible that 55% of voters had backed someone this extreme?</p> <p>Three years later, Kotleba pulled off another electoral shock, using his platform as governor to take his far-right party into parliament after a vigorous campaign in small towns across the country. Our Slovakia won 14 out of 150 seats in the Slovak legislature. In March, he will run for president.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In Slovakia, regional governors are responsible for the unglamorous nitty-gritty of local administration: bus timetables, road maintenance and some education and healthcare. The country\u2019s population of about 5.5 million is divided into eight regions; in the west, the capital, Bratislava, brushes against the Austrian border and is just a short hop from Vienna. In the east, the country stretches to the Ukrainian border. Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, the largest region by area, is right in the middle, a three-hour train ride from the capital. The city of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica itself is something of an intellectual hub, with four theatres and a well-regarded university, but the surrounding region is regarded as a hinterland of dessicated industrial plants and unprofitable agricultural concerns. Most of the small towns, linked by winding and poorly paved roads, were the sort of places whose names caused metropolitan Slovaks to raise their eyebrows in consternation.</p> <p>During his campaign, Kotleba had promised to stand up for the \u201cdecent people\u201d. They had been getting a raw deal, he said, exploited by both the \u201cpolitical mafia\u201d in charge of the country, and \u201cGypsy parasites\u201d. Many Slovak politicians used inflammatory language about the country\u2019s Roma community, but Kotleba took it a step further. Members of his party, in their distinctive green shirts, even prowled trains on special vigilante patrols designed to \u201cprevent Gypsy criminality\u201d.</p> <p>In land and property disputes that broke out with Roma families, Kotleba frequently sent party members to intimidate the Roma or force them off land they were deemed to be occupying. The tales of such heroic rescue operations coming to the aid of \u201cdecent people\u201d were written up in lurid detail in the pamphlets cranked out by the printing press. Instead of being the crazed ravings of a fringe lunatic, they now came imprinted with the approval of a man serving in high office.</p> <p>Kotleba rebuffed my attempts to talk with him, saying he did not trust western journalists, so, instead, I met Milan Uhr\u00edk, who was Kotleba\u2019s deputy in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and is now an MP from his party. We drank coffee in a shopping mall outside his home town of Nitra, an hour\u2019s drive away from Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. Regarded as the polished face of Kotleba\u2019s party, Uhr\u00edk had a couple of days\u2019 worth of light stubble and wore a checked shirt. He spoke to me softly in fluent English, and although he was friendly enough, within seven minutes of us sitting down, he was on the defensive, insisting unprompted that he had no problems with \u201cthe Jews\u201d. He repeatedly denied Kotleba or the party was racist or fascist, batting away criticism with wide-eyed mock-surprise and the predictable retort that the real victims of discrimination were white Slovaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"918766de74ec782933517148c8f17fe64cf992db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/918766de74ec782933517148c8f17fe64cf992db/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slovak police detaining Marian Kotleba during a rally in Bratislava in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slovak police detaining Kotleba during a rally in Bratislava in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Koller/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Uhr\u00edk ran over what he saw as the achievements of Kotleba\u2019s time in office, which he lamented were fairly miserly only because the central government had blocked them from doing more. I asked him what he was most proud of, and he buried himself in his phone, looking for the right English translation. \u201cAh, pickaxes, that\u2019s the word,\u201d he said with a boyish grin. \u201cPickaxes and shovels \u2013 that was our programme.\u201d The policy in question hit on two of Kotleba\u2019s favourite themes in one: Roma and roads. It involved long-term unemployed people being put to manual labour on the roads, using the simplest of tools. It employed around 90 people, many of them Roma. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t work with computers, or do some business, they were simplest people on the labour market, but they have to do something because when they sit at home and do nothing they just start drinking, stealing and doing some criminal stuff,\u201d he said. Kotleba\u2019s programme was widely criticised for being both demeaning and pointlessly inefficient. It was soon shut down by the regional parliament \u2013 in Uhr\u00edk\u2019s mind, because they were alarmed by its success.</p> <p>Uhr\u00edk was on his way to Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica to plot strategy with Kotleba, and gave me a lift in his roomy black Mercedes, bought with money from his successful pre-politics IT career, he said. We drove past a shopping centre where the Kotleba green-shirts were doing unsolicited, informal security patrols, a new offshoot of the train-patrol programme. \u201cThe Gypsy gang was threatening the managers who were selling clothes in shops,\u201d he said, gesturing at the mall as we sped past. \u201cThe police did nothing. When our members come, the Gypsies have more respect for our members than for the police. The police cannot do anything because they\u2019re too scared to be marked as racist.\u201d</p> <p>Uhr\u00edk spent a lot of time talking about \u201cGypsies\u201d, mostly involving him explaining how the party was not racist, in terms that sounded incredibly racist. After an hour\u2019s drive through a hilly landscape of golden fields and trees that were just starting to turn with the onset of autumn, he dropped me off in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. He bade me farewell, and promised to intercede personally on my behalf with his boss, although he looked doubtful. A few days later, the final rebuttal came by email. Kotleba would wait to see what kind of article I wrote, before deciding whether to speak to me in the future.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Slovakia\u2019s short history as an independent state began in 1993, when Czechoslovakia split in two. Four years previously, crowds across the old country had surged into city squares and demanded the end of the Moscow-backed communist regime, in a series of demonstrations that became known as the Velvet Revolution. The old order melted away without violence, and enthusiasm for the new politics was high: in the 1990 elections, the first after the Velvet Revolution, the turnout was over 96%. The 1993 divorce with the Czechs was also peaceful \u2013 but ahead lay a difficult transition, involving the speedy creation of a new economy and new political institutions, as well as the search for new national identities after four decades of communism. The country joined the EU in 2004.</p> <p>These momentous changes formed the backdrop to the younger years of Marian Kotleba, who was born in 1977 in S\u00e1sov\u00e1, a drab suburb of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. But from S\u00e1sov\u00e1\u2019s collection of nine-storey apartment blocks filled with boxy, functional apartments, the political shifts would have felt distant. There wasn\u2019t much to do, and subcultures flourished among the bored youth. At least one of Marian\u2019s older brothers was involved with a clique of far-right skinheads, but Marian was a quiet, shy kid. He kept his head down and didn\u2019t say much, according to the recollections of his contemporaries.</p> <p>After completing an economics degree at the local university, followed by a masters, he got a job at a local secondary school teaching IT. One of his former students, Michal Dzurko, told me Kotleba was a competent but strict teacher, who would sometimes play videogames with his favoured students after classes. During these sessions of a game called Unreal Tournament, Dzurko recalls Kotleba taking delight in introducing characters named after other teachers at the school. \u201cYeah bitch, take that,\u201d he would yell, as he shot his computerised colleagues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0968c7e6a133cf1edf807a705bde48e14485b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0968c7e6a133cf1edf807a705bde48e14485b45/0_72_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marian Kotleba at a commemoration of the anniversary of the death of a Slovak general, in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kotleba at a commemoration of the anniversary of the death of a Slovak general, in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day in 2005, Kotleba\u2019s students realised their IT teacher had a secret life, when they saw him on the news, leading a gang of neo-fascists parading through the nearby town of Zvolen holding flaming torches. There on television was Kotleba\u2019s boyish face, adorned with a thin moustache, a gap shaved in the middle to create the effect of a half-opened drawbridge. He wore a black peaked cap and a black shirt, with an armband featuring the double cross of the wartime Slovak state, a close Nazi ally. The uniform was almost identical to those of the Hlinka Guard, the fascist state\u2019s shock troops.</p> <p>Now that the quiet teacher\u2019s alter-ego had been outed, Kotleba brought his ragtag band of extremists into a political party called Slovak Unity, of which he was leader. It was not a success: in 2006 elections it got just 0.16% of the vote. Dzurko, Kotleba\u2019s former student, had fallen in with an extreme-right crowd as he progressed through school. At home, he spent long hours reading conspiracy websites about Jewish cabals and the oppression of the Slovak people and on Friday nights would go out and look for fights. And yet, even for people like Dzurko, Kotleba was seen as a bit of a joke. After the 2006 elections, Dzurko and friends saw Kotleba in the street and began shouting \u201cZero! Point! Sixteen! Percent!\u201d at him.</p> <p>After being crushed at the polls, the party was liquidated by the courts in 2006 for its overtly anti-democratic nature. Kotleba took a brief break from politics, opening a shop in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica called \u201cKKK \u2013 English fashion\u201d. The three Ks were meant to represent the three Kotlebas, but the Ku Klux Klan reference was fairly obvious, especially given the clothing on sale \u2013 T-shirts and hoodies with far-right emblems and insignia. Kotleba and his followers regularly dressed in Hlinka Guard uniforms (making minor alterations, as the actual uniforms were illegal). \u201cWe are Slovaks, not Jews, and that is why we are not interested in the Jewish issue,\u201d he said in 2009, when asked about the wartime deportations of the Jews from Slovakia by the very unit in whose uniform he was dressed.</p> <p>Soon, he was back in politics with a new outfit called People\u2019s Party Our Slovakia. This time, Kotleba was much more careful when it came to the party programme, and obviously neo-Nazi or anti-democratic policies were excised. It didn\u2019t help much, though. At elections in 2010 and 2012, the party got less than 2% of votes.</p> <p>It was clear that full-on neo-Nazi ideology was never going to garner more than fringe support, but Kotleba saw that by softening the message a bit, there was a much larger electorate potentially available. The black uniforms were swapped for green T-shirts bearing the party logo. Sometimes he even wore a shirt and jacket. He stopped talking about the Jews and started talking more about the Roma. Antisemitism wasn\u2019t much of a vote-winner in Slovakia, but promising recriminations against the country\u2019s Roma community would be much more effective. Locked out of education and the workplace, many of Slovakia\u2019s 400,000 Roma were trapped in a spiral of disenfranchisement, poverty and sometimes crime. \u201cAfter decades of marginalisation you can\u2019t just change it in a few years,\u201d Michal Va\u0161ecka, a Slovak sociologist, told me. \u201cAnd if anyone tries to do something openly to help the Roma, it\u2019s political suicide.\u201d Indeed, any time even basic employment or housing rights programmes were launched, Kotleba and others would complain about the Roma getting special treatment. Kotleba didn\u2019t call them Roma, but used the semi-pejorative \u201ccigani\u201d (\u201cGypsies\u201d), and he promised to get tough with them.</p> <p>Kotleba thus relaunched himself as a straight-talking, no-nonsense guy, who would stand up for decent people \u2013 <em>slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia</em>. This became his refrain. He repeated it, again and again, in his campaign speeches and literature. Slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia would be protected from economic corruption, slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia would be shielded against moral decay, slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia would no longer be terrorised by \u201cGypsy criminality\u201d. The man who had only recently marched in the uniforms of Holocaust perpetrators was now portraying himself as the paragon of decency.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Slovak political scene in 2013 was dominated by the Smer (\u201cDirection\u201d) party, headed by prime minister Robert Fico. The party had been tainted with a number of corruption scandals, cronyism and links to shady oligarchs. In many ways, the supposedly centre-left Smer was similar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/11/viktor-orban-hungary-prime-minister-reckless-football-obsession\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>\u2019s far-right Fidesz, in neighbouring Hungary. \u201cNeither Fidesz nor Smer have a clear ideological direction, and both Orb\u00e1n and Fico are very adaptive politicians,\u201d said Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi, a former Hungarian MP who is now a visiting fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna. The Hungarian electoral system, together with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s ruthlessness, allowed him to take a much firmer grip of his country than his Slovak counterpart: Smer dominated the electoral scene, but often had to govern in coalition.</p> <p>The 2013 election for Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica governor was meant to be a formality for Vladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka, a local Smer functionary. He had been in the job for four years, and was combining his post as regional governor with a job as an MEP. With a neatly trimmed shades-of-grey moustache, receding grey hair and spectacles, Ma\u0148ka looked every inch the classic Smer man. He was a competent technocrat, born in the region, and he worked Stakhanovite hours \u2013 but with the double workload he was only in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica two-and-a-half days per week, flying in from Brussels or Strasbourg. He was not personally accused of corruption scandals but was tarnished by association with Smer. During the campaign, a mischievous series of billboard advertisements appeared, of unknown provenance, featuring a photograph of Ma\u0148ka and thanking voters for his enormous salary.</p> <p>Among Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica\u2019s small group of far-right skinheads, there was an excitement about the newly ascendant Kotleba, but at the same time he was cultivating a new type of voter. The area around Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica was once dotted with silver and tin mines, which had brought prosperity for centuries. But the treasure had long been exhausted, and with the collapse of the socialist agricultural system, the small towns and villages were in a sorry state. Many of those who had opportunities to do so departed for Bratislava, Austria or Britain: out of a regional population of 650,000, the local government estimated that roughly 50,000 people had left in the decade since EU accession. Many of those who remained in the provinces felt isolated from the regional government in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, let alone from Bratislava or Brussels. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here; all the clever people have gone,\u201d several different people muttered to me wistfully, during my travels around the region.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"323459bb18c01e81013f9b2446bf0667683e659e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/323459bb18c01e81013f9b2446bf0667683e659e/0_341_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The faces of Kotleba and Jozef Tiso carried during an anti-extreme right rally in Bratislava.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The faces of Kotleba and Jozef Tiso carried during an anti-extreme right rally in Bratislava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daniel Vra\u017eda, a burly and tenacious local reporter who has lived his whole life in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, had first noticed Kotleba in 2005, when he caught the public eye with his torchlit marches, but initially dismissed him as a nobody, as most people did. Now, though, Vra\u017eda was travelling around the region watching Kotleba campaign, and could see with his own eyes how the revamped politician was connecting with the people he met. Nobody had ever bothered to campaign in the small towns before, but Kotleba went to these places, where it was hardly less surprising to see a real politician appear in the flesh than it would have been to see a herd of elephants stroll into town.</p> <p>He held small gatherings, listened to people\u2019s grievances, and told them that everyone was stealing from them, the decent people, the slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia. Vra\u017eda looked on, and thought that if he didn\u2019t know what Kotleba really stood for, he too might have been persuaded by a lot of the messaging. Kotleba promised new and better local roads, a fairer deal for all, and action against the Roma. The specifics were left vague. \u201cHe told everyone he would make order with the Gypsies, but he never explained how,\u201d Vrazda told me. \u201cSo, one person could imagine a job-creation programme, while another person could imagine baseball bats.\u201d</p> <p>Ma\u0148ka, on the other hand, used his few campaign appearances to boast about the apparent economic prosperity he had brought. \u201cMa\u0148ka kept talking about \u20ac160m (\u00a3140m) he had attracted to the region, thinking people would thank him for this,\u201d said Vra\u017eda. \u201cBut they\u2019re earning \u20ac400 a month, and these numbers mean nothing to them. The numbers are probably true, but if ordinary people tried to find the money, they wouldn\u2019t. And then Marian Kotleba came along and said, \u2018I\u2019ve found the money. It\u2019s in the pockets of Vladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Despite all this, on election night things went more or less as planned for Ma\u0148ka. He got a fraction less than half the vote, meaning there would be a run-off. Kotleba was the surprise runner-up, but he was way behind, on 21%. Conventional wisdom dictates that if an extremist candidate sneaks into the final round of voting, the moderate will see them off, a hypothesis borne out by two generations of Le Pens in France, among many others. In parts of the Slovak media there was alarm that a neo-Nazi had made it to a run-off, but everyone expected the second vote to be a formality. \u201cI have absolutely no doubt that Mr Ma\u0148ka is going to win the second round without a single problem,\u201d prime minister Robert Fico said in a television interview. He added, with a laugh: \u201cEven a sack of potatoes would beat Marian Kotleba.\u201d</p> <p>And then the unthinkable happened. In the first round, Ma\u0148ka had been just 600 votes short of an outright majority; this time he was trounced, with Kotleba receiving 55% of the vote. The turnout was still a miserly 25%, but it seemed that while many Ma\u0148ka voters had not bothered to turn up to vote for a second time, Kotleba had energised a different set of new voters with his promises to stand up for the \u201cdecent people\u201d.</p> <p>When I met Ma\u0148ka recently to discuss the 2013 vote, it was clear the subject is still a raw one. He remains an MEP, but mention his name even now in Slovak political circles and someone will say \u201csack of potatoes\u201d with a snigger. Ma\u0148ka arrived at our breakfast meeting with a bag of props, including literature filled with graphs and pie charts showing how successful his time in office had been. He placed on the table a glass award he had won in 2013 for running the most transparent region in Slovakia. The US ambassador, with whom he used to play tennis, had personally awarded it to him, he said.</p> <p>Ma\u0148ka didn\u2019t seem to think actually winning the approval of voters had even been part of his duties. \u201cI didn\u2019t campaign, I was busy working and solving all the problems,\u201d he told me, about the time between the first and second rounds of voting. \u201cWe had solved everything, the region was healthy, I was very happy.\u201d Five years later, he still looked genuinely confused by the result.</p> <p>A few weeks after the vote, Kotleba was confirmed as the new governor at a formal event where a chunky ceremonial chain was placed around his neck, as Ma\u0148ka and top city officials looked on, shell-shocked.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During his first year in office, Kotleba employed dozens of his party members in jobs at the local administration. Green-shirted security guards blocked the doors, giving the place the air of a cult headquarters. One of his first moves was to remove the EU flag from the administration building, in line with his belief that Slovakia should withdraw from both the EU and Nato.</p> <p>Kotleba did not have control of the regional parliament, which tried to frustrate his initiatives at every turn, but he set about making his influence felt wherever he could. He was particularly put out by programmes promoting human rights and tolerance in schools, and issued guidelines suggesting that instead of doing that, it would be better if the schools held beauty pageants. These were aimed at \u201cgirls learning to present themselves as ladies, and for them to see that there is still a world that values women\u2019s dignity and spiritual beauty\u201d. Some schools ignored the recommendations and still held the anti-extremism sessions; others did indeed hold beauty contests. Kotleba\u2019s Kulturkampf continued in other areas, as he cancelled a contemporary dance festival he deemed to contain \u201cpornography\u201d, as well as an EU-funded project to resettle people with mental disabilities from a decaying communist-era facility into smaller supported housing units, and reintegrate them into society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eea2fc84ce7e69e3da5e056b1578529ff195f68a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eea2fc84ce7e69e3da5e056b1578529ff195f68a/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marian Kotleba in parliament in Bratislava in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kotleba in parliament in Bratislava in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vladim\u00edr \u0160im\u00ed\u010dek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the time came to campaign across the nation for the 2016 parliamentary elections, Kotleba and his party made good use of the deft double messaging common to extremists trying to go mainstream: putting on a more humane face for the general public, while providing clear signals for the core support. He attended an extreme-right march in Bratislava, where he wished everyone present \u201ca happy White day\u201d, to raucous applause. The party handed out charitable donations to youth sports clubs and other approved causes, but the amount on several occasions was \u20ac1,488, a number widely used as code by neo-Nazis. (The number 14 refers to the Fourteen Words, a white supremacist slogan, while 88 stands for Heil Hitler, as H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.) Uhr\u00edk told me it was merely a coincidence.</p> <p>In interviews, Kotleba claimed to be outraged at accusations of racism, and said he was simply defending the \u201cdecent people\u201d, who were now endangered by a new threat: the large numbers of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe from Africa and the Middle East. All the previous rhetoric about the Roma could now be grafted on to a new and even more threatening \u201cenemy\u201d. He was largely shunned by state television, but was active on Facebook and other social media, and stepped up his leafleting by mail. The leader, with an entourage of green-shirted disciples, travelled to the forgotten towns and villages once again, promising to restore dignity to the forgotten peoples of Slovakia, stripped from them so cruelly by the corrupted, decadent Slovak elites.</p> <p>As the parliamentary vote approached, the political rhetoric across the spectrum shifted closer towards Kotleba. Politicians across central Europe said they did not wish to support migrants when there were still so many people living in poverty in their home countries, and Slovakia was no exception. \u201cIslam has no place in Slovakia,\u201d said prime minister Fico, nailing his colours to the rightwing, anti-refugee mast. Two Slovak researchers, Viera \u017d\u00faborov\u00e1 and Ingrid Bor\u00e1rosov\u00e1, concluded that the endless mainstream discussion of the migration topic \u201clogically had to bring advantages for the party which had been for years presenting itself with Eurosceptic politics and hostility against minorities\u201d. While it\u2019s possible that Smer wooed some of Kotleba\u2019s voters by claiming the migration issue as their own, adopting the same kind of inflammatory language perhaps signalled to others that Kotleba had been right all along. His party won 8% of the vote and ended up with 14 seats in parliament.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In Bratislava, the result sent shockwaves through polite society. Previously, it had been possible to dismiss Kotleba as a freakshow in the provinces; now he was at the heart of national politics. There was a hand-wringing discussion about how to treat the country\u2019s newest parliamentarians \u2013 reminiscent of debates happening elsewhere as parties formerly considered fringe extremists began taking government offices. Andrej Kiska, who occupied the largely symbolic presidential role, was the one liberal force in Slovak politics, and refused to invite Kotleba to the presidential palace as is customary with heads of new parliamentary parties. \u201cLet\u2019s draw a clear line: these people are fascists and we won\u2019t cooperate or talk with them,\u201d he told Slovaks, explaining his decision.</p> <p>At the liberal newspaper Denn\u00edk N in Bratislava, editorial staff held discussions to decide how to cover Slovakia\u2019s newest political force. \u201cAll of us know that he\u2019s a fascist who is pretending to be a guy wearing a suit,\u201d editor-in-chief Mat\u00fa\u0161 Kostoln\u00fd told me. He felt the paper should cover the actions of Kotleba\u2019s MPs, but not carry interviews with them or treat them like regular parliamentarians. \u201cI did a lot of research about how this was handled in other countries, and basically there are no good solutions. If he were in power, he\u2019d be attacking the system we live in, so why should public television discuss his toxic ideas?\u201d</p> <p>Others weren\u2019t so sure. The veteran war correspondent Andrej B\u00e1n argued that while Kotleba himself should be blacklisted, it was worth engaging with party members. B\u00e1n thought it was necessary to listen to Kotleba\u2019s supporters, and later set up an organisation called Forgotten Slovakia, which organised public discussions in small towns across the country.</p> <p>Polling showed that some of the most radical Kotleba fans were young Slovaks, most of whom consumed their news via Facebook. Among 18- to 21-year-olds, Kotleba\u2019s party had got more votes than any other at the 2016 parliamentary elections. In one region, schools organised mock elections among students, and Kotleba won every time. \u201cThey poison the well of young people. If you start at age 11, then by 16 you can have a brainwashed Nazi. Without Facebook, Kotleba wouldn\u2019t be in parliament,\u201d claimed Va\u0161ecka, the sociologist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c01f92b90cbf7cd68ba6c6d2cf4fc018cb50654a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c01f92b90cbf7cd68ba6c6d2cf4fc018cb50654a/98_89_2024_2244/902.jpg\" alt=\"Slovakia\u2019s president, Andrej Kiska.\" width=\"902\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slovakia\u2019s president, Andrej Kiska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A number of NGOs began organising discussion groups in schools to try to increase political engagement among young people. Michal Dzurko, Kotleba\u2019s former student, had flirted with extremism but later became a committed campaigner against it. He travelled to schools to hold discussion sessions with radical young pupils. The children asked many questions, and often he could see that there were new thought processes whirring in some of their heads. \u201cNobody had taught them the basics of how to be a citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can tell you all the parts of a fucking maple leaf in Latin because that\u2019s what they teach in school, but nobody teaches them media literacy or how the world works.\u201d</p> <p>Soon, it was time to think about who would stand against Kotleba in the November 2017 regional elections, in which he wanted to secure another four-year term as Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica governor. J\u00e1n Lunter, a wealthy local businessman, was keen to run, and thought the best way to beat Kotleba was to offer a positive agenda, rather than to focus on the evils of Kotleba\u2019s ideology and try to shame people into not voting for an extremist. Born into a farming family but a longstanding vegetarian, Lunter had begun producing tofu in the early 1990s, back when vegetarian foods were hard to come by. By 2017, the company was producing seven tonnes of tofu per day, selling it across central Europe, and employed 200 people at its factory just outside Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. With a creased face and boomerang eyebrows, he looked slightly dishevelled in a suit, giving him simultaneous airs of respectability and relatability. He was by no means a charismatic orator, but he was possessed of a Zen-like calm that he would maintain all through the electoral campaign. Importantly, he was not a career politician, and had no links to Smer or other established political forces. The main political parties, and most other interested independents, stepped back to give Lunter the best chance of winning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0d9568045d499c0b73e7cc94204b94f40caefe29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d9568045d499c0b73e7cc94204b94f40caefe29/1267_13_778_936/416.jpg\" alt=\"J\u00e1n Lunter.\" width=\"416\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J\u00e1n Lunter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lunter\u2019s son Ondrej, who ran his father\u2019s campaign, engaged a set of Bratislava consultants to help craft the messaging, led by Peter Hajdin, a youthful 45-year-old with a fortnight\u2019s worth of beard. Hajdin had worked on President Kiska\u2019s campaign in 2014, helping him to a surprise victory against Fico, the Smer prime minister who had been keen to transfer to the presidential palace. For Lunter, Hajdin thought of a fairly straight campaign that would promote him as a decent, honest, hard-working businessman. The words Kotleba, Nazi, extremism or anything similar were not to be used. It was better to communicate with people by showing them a different vision of politics, he thought, rather than by yelling at them. The care and energy put into the campaign was in stark contrast to Ma\u0148ka\u2019s run four years earlier. Hajdin created slick branding, starting with the logo \u2013 a white, all-caps LUNTER in a chunky, no-nonsense font, embossed on a red rectangle. \u201cI wanted something like a Swiss chocolate logo, something tasty you\u2019d like to have a bite of,\u201d he told me in the offices of his Bratislava agency. Three campaign teams toured the region with balloons, leaflets and big smiles.</p> <p>In Bzov\u00edk, a typical town of around 1,000 residents an hour\u2019s drive from Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Kotleba had won comfortably in 2013. Michaela Urban, a community organiser who helped organise campaigning for Lunter in 2017, admitted that she herself had voted for Kotleba in 2013. \u201cI knew absolutely nothing about him \u2013 it was just about voting against Ma\u0148ka. I don\u2019t think many people knew that much about him then.\u201d In the four years of his governorship, Kotleba came to the town frequently, she said, to check on the progress of restorations to the 17th-century castle. He also repaired a road to the village that had been bothering locals for years. \u201cA few people like the ideology, but most people like him because it seems he takes an interest,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it seemed likely that many people did also approve of aspects of Kotleba\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cEverywhere I went, people asked me what I would do about the Gypsies, and said at least Kotleba did something,\u201d Lunter told me, about his campaign visits around the region. Like many Slovak towns, Bzov\u00edk had a completely segregated Roma community, who lived in a settlement down a muddy track on the outskirts, where houses were stacked together higgledy-piggledy, unlike the neat bungalows in the rest of the town. Ownership rights were murky, even though the community has been there for generations. \u201cAnimals are more protected in this country than Roma people,\u201d 47-year-old Eva Gre\u0161kov\u00e1 complained to me, as she cooked lunch inside one of the houses. Tensions had increased over the years of the Kotleba governorship, she said, as the governor\u2019s rhetoric removed any vestigial taboo around open discrimination against Roma. She had a litany of unpleasant cases, from muttered abuse on the street to bus drivers refusing to take Roma kids on board.</p> <p>As the vote approached, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica was on edge. A dance theatre to which Kotleba had cut funding rehearsed a new show about the battle between good and evil, to premiere shortly after the election. They created posters featuring a man trying to jump over a ravine, with a demonic green hand emerging from the depths to pull him in. The posters read \u201cGood/Evil Prevails\u201d. The theatre rehearsed two alternate endings, to be used depending on the electoral result.</p> <p>On election night, everyone awaited the votes from the countryside nervously, remembering what had happened four years ago. In a number of small towns and villages like Bzov\u00edk, Kotleba won a majority again, but by midnight it was clear that Lunter would easily win the overall vote, and the celebrations began in the restaurant the Lunter team had hired. By the time Lunter and his small entourage arrived at the governor\u2019s office to take up their new jobs a few weeks later, almost everything had been stripped from the walls and cabinets, but there were a few curious discoveries. In a side-room off the governor\u2019s office they found a camp bed. Kotleba, apparently, had been sleeping there. In a cabinet, they found three different drafts of a grovelling letter to the Russian ambassador apparently written by Kotleba, in which he said he wanted to buy a Russian car and hoped for any assistance possible from Russia. When I met Lunter, he retrieved the drafts from a grey folder marked \u201cKotleba\u201d that he still keeps in his office, and read one out with a smirk. It was not clear if any version of the letter was ever sent, but it appeared to bolster rumours of illicit funding from Moscow, which Uhr\u00edk strongly denied to me.</p> <p>In the days after the vote, dancers from the theatre went around town with a red marker and crossed out the \u201cevil\u201d on their posters, so that they now read simply, \u201cGood prevails\u201d. After four years, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica had finally got rid of Kotleba. Lunter, asked what his first act as governor would be, said he planned to open the windows of the regional administration building and let in some fresh air.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Back in 2013, Kotleba had benefited from a perfect storm of hometown factors \u2013 complacent incumbent, widespread disillusion, low voter turnout, and slick online and in-person campaigning \u2013 to win victory. The years of Roma isolation and alienation also helped, with Kotleba\u2019s unpleasant rhetoric finding a receptive audience among many frustrated rural residents. With a well thought-out campaign, Lunter was able to beat him easily, despite not being a particularly charismatic politician. Although he is now an established fixture in Slovak politics, Kotleba is ultimately seen as too much of a genuine extremist to win real majorities nationally. Ahead of March\u2019s presidential elections, most polling has him unlikely to break double figures.</p> <p>It would be nice to think that, after four years of Kotleba, the people of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica had an epiphany and realised he was a charlatan and a racist. But Kotleba all along was a symptom, not a diagnosis, and it\u2019s hard to draw the conclusion that all is well with politics in Slovakia. Kotleba \u2013 whose current presidential campaign posters say \u201cFamily is a man and a woman: Stop LGBT\u201d and \u201cfinally a Slovak president\u201d \u2013 is often mentioned in a pairing with Boris Koll\u00e1r, a flamboyant businessman whose party, We Are Family, also made it into parliament in 2016 on a vague \u201cfamily values\u201d programme. Kotleba attracted a large proportion of angry provincial men, while Koll\u00e1r attracted large numbers of disillusioned women from the regions, according to Slovak pollsters.</p> <p>When I met Koll\u00e1r in his parliamentary office recently, he was dressed in a sharp suit and characteristically loud tie. \u201cVoters don\u2019t read election programmes, voters decide based on emotions,\u201d he told me as he chomped on expensive chocolates. Koll\u00e1r has 10 children from nine different women, yet says he named his party We Are Family because his focus was on \u201ctraditional conservative values when it comes to the family\u201d. Was it some kind of joke, I asked. \u201cI have shown I can look after my children, it\u2019s proof I can look after all the children,\u201d he said, clarifying that his traditionalism was mainly focused on opposing the expansion of LGBT rights. When I asked what his solution to the issue of Roma poverty and isolation was, he looked at me very seriously, and said: \u201cWe\u2019ll buy them 700,000 plane tickets and send them all to England and see how you like it.\u201d He lifted his head back and gave a huge roar of laughter. Then he said: \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d Koll\u00e1r set up his party five months before the elections; he got nearly 7% of the vote and now has 11 MPs.</p> <p>The response of prime minister Fico and his ruling Smer party to the rise of these populist and extremist parties was to try to stifle them by pilfering their playbook. Fico called journalists \u201cdirty anti-Slovak prostitutes\u201d, claimed anti-government protests were organised by George Soros, and continued the rhetoric against migrants and refugees. Protests against his government erupted last spring over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/slovakia-pm-defends-countrys-reputation-after-journalist-jan-kuciak-murder\" title=\"\">the murder of investigative journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak</a> and his fiancee. They were shot dead at home, as Kuciak was investigating alleged ties between government-linked figures and organised crime, and the killings shocked the urban elite. The protesters who flooded the central squares in cities across the country were mainly middle-class, liberal Slovaks. I even met some government ministry employees at one protest in Bratislava last April. They said it was time for a different kind of politics, without corruption and ties to organised crime. The protesters had no party orientation, but protested under the slogan For a Decent Slovakia. To everyone\u2019s surprise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/slovakias-prime-minister-robert-fico-resigns-journalist-murder\" title=\"\">Fico stepped aside</a> in March last year, although Smer is still in government. A countrywide movement was formed, outside party politics, holding rallies and meetings under the Decent Slovakia brand, to keep up the pressure on the ruling elite.</p> <p>It was that same word \u2013 decency \u2013 of which Kotleba was so fond. Indeed, some of the core demands of the Kotleba greenshirts were not so different to those of the middle-class protesters in Bratislava. Both wanted a crackdown on graft, new politicians who listened, and were demanding respect and decency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/10/we-the-people-the-battle-to-define-populism\">\u2018We the people\u2019: the battle to define populism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>President Kiska, the one prominent progressive politician in the country, is not standing for re-election next month, and while Kotleba is unlikely to win, progressive Slovaks are worried about \u0160tefan Harabin, a former minister of justice known for colourful insults, disdain for the media and occasional nationalist rhetoric. The establishment, Smer-backed candidate is Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, a vice-president of the European Commission\u2019s Energy Union, who has little experience of electoral politics. If Harabin gets to the second round and picks up the votes of Kotleba and other nationalists, he may have a shot at winning.</p> <p>Before leaving Slovakia, I paid a visit to the presidential palace, a grand, gaudily renovated complex in central Bratislava, where I chatted with Rado Ba\u0165o, a political advisor to the president with a James Joyce quote tattooed on one arm and a sloth on the other. He said the focus groups his team had carried out showed a surprisingly large crossover between Kotleba voters and Kiska voters. Many of the same people who voted for a progressive liberal in favour of minority rights as president had backed a far-right extremist party in parliamentary elections. It suggested that actual policies mattered less than the perception of a willingness to shake up the system, he said. \u201cSlovak politics is no longer divided between left and right. People don\u2019t care if parties are leftwing or rightwing. They just want the government to get shit done.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2019. An earlier version suggested Kotleba lost his governorship before taking his party into parliament, but it was after. It also referred to \u0160tefan Harabin as a former high-court judge; he is a former minister of justice, but remains a judge; and Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d is a vice-president at the European Commission, not a deputy commissioner.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In December 2013, Marian Kotleba, a former secondary school teacher who had become Slovakia\u2019s most notorious political extremist, arrived to begin work at his new office \u2013 the governor\u2019s mansion in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, the country\u2019s sixth-largest city. Kotleba venerated Slovakia\u2019s wartime Nazi puppet state, and liked to dress up in the uniforms of its shock troops, who had helped to round up thousands of Jews during the Holocaust. Now, in the biggest electoral shock anyone could remember in the two decades since Slovakia\u2019s independence, the people of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and the surrounding region had voted for the 37-year-old Kotleba to be their governor. The four-storey mansion, with its vaulted ceilings and gilded pillars, would be his workplace for the next four years. Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica is a tranquil kind of place, with a genteel Mitteleuropa charm: the centre has pavement cafes, neat rows of burgher houses and a number of handsome baroque churches. At eight minutes to every hour, a clock in the central square plays a dainty jewellery-box jingle. And now, it had the dubious distinction of being the first place in modern Europe to have elected a person widely regarded as a neo-fascist to a major office. For the next four years, heavy-set men in the green shirts of Kotleba\u2019s Our Slovakia party guarded the door of the administration building; they worked out in a gym that was constructed for them in the basement of the governor\u2019s office. Journalists, for the most part, were forbidden to enter. Kotleba branded the mainstream media liars, and said he would communicate directly with the people. An industrial printing press, brought into the building early in his term, pumped out regular pamphlets called Our Slovakia, which were sent across the region, and later, the country. The colourful, four-page leaflets were packed with the tropes that had defined Kotleba\u2019s campaign: decent Slovaks were being exploited and terrorised by corrupt politicians, \u201cGypsy criminals\u201d and shadowy international forces. Articles railed against promiscuity, abortion and homosexuality, all of which threatened the traditional family and the Slovak nation. Often, there was a personal appeal from Kotleba not to believe the \u201ctendentious opinions\u201d about him in the media. Tall, stocky and balding, and always wearing a neatly trimmed moustache, Kotleba looked equal parts supply teacher and gang leader. He had a purposeful strut and a boxer\u2019s habit of shifting his weight from one foot to the other. At meetings and rallies, he spoke in a hectoring, insistent tone about the urgency of his tasks. In many of the smaller settlements there were simply not enough jobs, and the most talented people got out as soon as they could. There was a vague resentment at being seen as second-class citizens inside the European Union, and a more acute feeling that the Slovak political class was isolated from the masses and only interested in lining its pockets. Soon enough, the same issues would fuel the rise of rightwing populism across the region. Within a few years, after migration and nationalism had taken over the political agenda, much of Europe would also be grappling with the far-right\u2019s success at the ballot box. But back in 2013, nobody was expecting a neo-Nazi to win an election. How was it possible that 55% of voters had backed someone this extreme? Three years later, Kotleba pulled off another electoral shock, using his platform as governor to take his far-right party into parliament after a vigorous campaign in small towns across the country. Our Slovakia won 14 out of 150 seats in the Slovak legislature. In March, he will run for president. * * * In Slovakia, regional governors are responsible for the unglamorous nitty-gritty of local administration: bus timetables, road maintenance and some education and healthcare. The country\u2019s population of about 5.5 million is divided into eight regions; in the west, the capital, Bratislava, brushes against the Austrian border and is just a short hop from Vienna. In the east, the country stretches to the Ukrainian border. Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, the largest region by area, is right in the middle, a three-hour train ride from the capital. The city of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica itself is something of an intellectual hub, with four theatres and a well-regarded university, but the surrounding region is regarded as a hinterland of dessicated industrial plants and unprofitable agricultural concerns. Most of the small towns, linked by winding and poorly paved roads, were the sort of places whose names caused metropolitan Slovaks to raise their eyebrows in consternation. During his campaign, Kotleba had promised to stand up for the \u201cdecent people\u201d. They had been getting a raw deal, he said, exploited by both the \u201cpolitical mafia\u201d in charge of the country, and \u201cGypsy parasites\u201d. Many Slovak politicians used inflammatory language about the country\u2019s Roma community, but Kotleba took it a step further. Members of his party, in their distinctive green shirts, even prowled trains on special vigilante patrols designed to \u201cprevent Gypsy criminality\u201d. In land and property disputes that broke out with Roma families, Kotleba frequently sent party members to intimidate the Roma or force them off land they were deemed to be occupying. The tales of such heroic rescue operations coming to the aid of \u201cdecent people\u201d were written up in lurid detail in the pamphlets cranked out by the printing press. Instead of being the crazed ravings of a fringe lunatic, they now came imprinted with the approval of a man serving in high office. Kotleba rebuffed my attempts to talk with him, saying he did not trust western journalists, so, instead, I met Milan Uhr\u00edk, who was Kotleba\u2019s deputy in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and is now an MP from his party. We drank coffee in a shopping mall outside his home town of Nitra, an hour\u2019s drive away from Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. Regarded as the polished face of Kotleba\u2019s party, Uhr\u00edk had a couple of days\u2019 worth of light stubble and wore a checked shirt. He spoke to me softly in fluent English, and although he was friendly enough, within seven minutes of us sitting down, he was on the defensive, insisting unprompted that he had no problems with \u201cthe Jews\u201d. He repeatedly denied Kotleba or the party was racist or fascist, batting away criticism with wide-eyed mock-surprise and the predictable retort that the real victims of discrimination were white Slovaks. Uhr\u00edk ran over what he saw as the achievements of Kotleba\u2019s time in office, which he lamented were fairly miserly only because the central government had blocked them from doing more. I asked him what he was most proud of, and he buried himself in his phone, looking for the right English translation. \u201cAh, pickaxes, that\u2019s the word,\u201d he said with a boyish grin. \u201cPickaxes and shovels \u2013 that was our programme.\u201d The policy in question hit on two of Kotleba\u2019s favourite themes in one: Roma and roads. It involved long-term unemployed people being put to manual labour on the roads, using the simplest of tools. It employed around 90 people, many of them Roma. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t work with computers, or do some business, they were simplest people on the labour market, but they have to do something because when they sit at home and do nothing they just start drinking, stealing and doing some criminal stuff,\u201d he said. Kotleba\u2019s programme was widely criticised for being both demeaning and pointlessly inefficient. It was soon shut down by the regional parliament \u2013 in Uhr\u00edk\u2019s mind, because they were alarmed by its success. Uhr\u00edk was on his way to Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica to plot strategy with Kotleba, and gave me a lift in his roomy black Mercedes, bought with money from his successful pre-politics IT career, he said. We drove past a shopping centre where the Kotleba green-shirts were doing unsolicited, informal security patrols, a new offshoot of the train-patrol programme. \u201cThe Gypsy gang was threatening the managers who were selling clothes in shops,\u201d he said, gesturing at the mall as we sped past. \u201cThe police did nothing. When our members come, the Gypsies have more respect for our members than for the police. The police cannot do anything because they\u2019re too scared to be marked as racist.\u201d Uhr\u00edk spent a lot of time talking about \u201cGypsies\u201d, mostly involving him explaining how the party was not racist, in terms that sounded incredibly racist. After an hour\u2019s drive through a hilly landscape of golden fields and trees that were just starting to turn with the onset of autumn, he dropped me off in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. He bade me farewell, and promised to intercede personally on my behalf with his boss, although he looked doubtful. A few days later, the final rebuttal came by email. Kotleba would wait to see what kind of article I wrote, before deciding whether to speak to me in the future. * * * Slovakia\u2019s short history as an independent state began in 1993, when Czechoslovakia split in two. Four years previously, crowds across the old country had surged into city squares and demanded the end of the Moscow-backed communist regime, in a series of demonstrations that became known as the Velvet Revolution. The old order melted away without violence, and enthusiasm for the new politics was high: in the 1990 elections, the first after the Velvet Revolution, the turnout was over 96%. The 1993 divorce with the Czechs was also peaceful \u2013 but ahead lay a difficult transition, involving the speedy creation of a new economy and new political institutions, as well as the search for new national identities after four decades of communism. The country joined the EU in 2004. These momentous changes formed the backdrop to the younger years of Marian Kotleba, who was born in 1977 in S\u00e1sov\u00e1, a drab suburb of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. But from S\u00e1sov\u00e1\u2019s collection of nine-storey apartment blocks filled with boxy, functional apartments, the political shifts would have felt distant. There wasn\u2019t much to do, and subcultures flourished among the bored youth. At least one of Marian\u2019s older brothers was involved with a clique of far-right skinheads, but Marian was a quiet, shy kid. He kept his head down and didn\u2019t say much, according to the recollections of his contemporaries. After completing an economics degree at the local university, followed by a masters, he got a job at a local secondary school teaching IT. One of his former students, Michal Dzurko, told me Kotleba was a competent but strict teacher, who would sometimes play videogames with his favoured students after classes. During these sessions of a game called Unreal Tournament, Dzurko recalls Kotleba taking delight in introducing characters named after other teachers at the school. \u201cYeah bitch, take that,\u201d he would yell, as he shot his computerised colleagues. One day in 2005, Kotleba\u2019s students realised their IT teacher had a secret life, when they saw him on the news, leading a gang of neo-fascists parading through the nearby town of Zvolen holding flaming torches. There on television was Kotleba\u2019s boyish face, adorned with a thin moustache, a gap shaved in the middle to create the effect of a half-opened drawbridge. He wore a black peaked cap and a black shirt, with an armband featuring the double cross of the wartime Slovak state, a close Nazi ally. The uniform was almost identical to those of the Hlinka Guard, the fascist state\u2019s shock troops. Now that the quiet teacher\u2019s alter-ego had been outed, Kotleba brought his ragtag band of extremists into a political party called Slovak Unity, of which he was leader. It was not a success: in 2006 elections it got just 0.16% of the vote. Dzurko, Kotleba\u2019s former student, had fallen in with an extreme-right crowd as he progressed through school. At home, he spent long hours reading conspiracy websites about Jewish cabals and the oppression of the Slovak people and on Friday nights would go out and look for fights. And yet, even for people like Dzurko, Kotleba was seen as a bit of a joke. After the 2006 elections, Dzurko and friends saw Kotleba in the street and began shouting \u201cZero! Point! Sixteen! Percent!\u201d at him. After being crushed at the polls, the party was liquidated by the courts in 2006 for its overtly anti-democratic nature. Kotleba took a brief break from politics, opening a shop in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica called \u201cKKK \u2013 English fashion\u201d. The three Ks were meant to represent the three Kotlebas, but the Ku Klux Klan reference was fairly obvious, especially given the clothing on sale \u2013 T-shirts and hoodies with far-right emblems and insignia. Kotleba and his followers regularly dressed in Hlinka Guard uniforms (making minor alterations, as the actual uniforms were illegal). \u201cWe are Slovaks, not Jews, and that is why we are not interested in the Jewish issue,\u201d he said in 2009, when asked about the wartime deportations of the Jews from Slovakia by the very unit in whose uniform he was dressed. Soon, he was back in politics with a new outfit called People\u2019s Party Our Slovakia. This time, Kotleba was much more careful when it came to the party programme, and obviously neo-Nazi or anti-democratic policies were excised. It didn\u2019t help much, though. At elections in 2010 and 2012, the party got less than 2% of votes. It was clear that full-on neo-Nazi ideology was never going to garner more than fringe support, but Kotleba saw that by softening the message a bit, there was a much larger electorate potentially available. The black uniforms were swapped for green T-shirts bearing the party logo. Sometimes he even wore a shirt and jacket. He stopped talking about the Jews and started talking more about the Roma. Antisemitism wasn\u2019t much of a vote-winner in Slovakia, but promising recriminations against the country\u2019s Roma community would be much more effective. Locked out of education and the workplace, many of Slovakia\u2019s 400,000 Roma were trapped in a spiral of disenfranchisement, poverty and sometimes crime. \u201cAfter decades of marginalisation you can\u2019t just change it in a few years,\u201d Michal Va\u0161ecka, a Slovak sociologist, told me. \u201cAnd if anyone tries to do something openly to help the Roma, it\u2019s political suicide.\u201d Indeed, any time even basic employment or housing rights programmes were launched, Kotleba and others would complain about the Roma getting special treatment. Kotleba didn\u2019t call them Roma, but used the semi-pejorative \u201ccigani\u201d (\u201cGypsies\u201d), and he promised to get tough with them. Kotleba thus relaunched himself as a straight-talking, no-nonsense guy, who would stand up for decent people \u2013 slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia. This became his refrain. He repeated it, again and again, in his campaign speeches and literature. Slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia would be protected from economic corruption, slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia would be shielded against moral decay, slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia would no longer be terrorised by \u201cGypsy criminality\u201d. The man who had only recently marched in the uniforms of Holocaust perpetrators was now portraying himself as the paragon of decency. * * * The Slovak political scene in 2013 was dominated by the Smer (\u201cDirection\u201d) party, headed by prime minister Robert Fico. The party had been tainted with a number of corruption scandals, cronyism and links to shady oligarchs. In many ways, the supposedly centre-left Smer was similar to Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s far-right Fidesz, in neighbouring Hungary. \u201cNeither Fidesz nor Smer have a clear ideological direction, and both Orb\u00e1n and Fico are very adaptive politicians,\u201d said Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi, a former Hungarian MP who is now a visiting fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna. The Hungarian electoral system, together with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s ruthlessness, allowed him to take a much firmer grip of his country than his Slovak counterpart: Smer dominated the electoral scene, but often had to govern in coalition. The 2013 election for Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica governor was meant to be a formality for Vladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka, a local Smer functionary. He had been in the job for four years, and was combining his post as regional governor with a job as an MEP. With a neatly trimmed shades-of-grey moustache, receding grey hair and spectacles, Ma\u0148ka looked every inch the classic Smer man. He was a competent technocrat, born in the region, and he worked Stakhanovite hours \u2013 but with the double workload he was only in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica two-and-a-half days per week, flying in from Brussels or Strasbourg. He was not personally accused of corruption scandals but was tarnished by association with Smer. During the campaign, a mischievous series of billboard advertisements appeared, of unknown provenance, featuring a photograph of Ma\u0148ka and thanking voters for his enormous salary. Among Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica\u2019s small group of far-right skinheads, there was an excitement about the newly ascendant Kotleba, but at the same time he was cultivating a new type of voter. The area around Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica was once dotted with silver and tin mines, which had brought prosperity for centuries. But the treasure had long been exhausted, and with the collapse of the socialist agricultural system, the small towns and villages were in a sorry state. Many of those who had opportunities to do so departed for Bratislava, Austria or Britain: out of a regional population of 650,000, the local government estimated that roughly 50,000 people had left in the decade since EU accession. Many of those who remained in the provinces felt isolated from the regional government in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, let alone from Bratislava or Brussels. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here; all the clever people have gone,\u201d several different people muttered to me wistfully, during my travels around the region. Daniel Vra\u017eda, a burly and tenacious local reporter who has lived his whole life in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, had first noticed Kotleba in 2005, when he caught the public eye with his torchlit marches, but initially dismissed him as a nobody, as most people did. Now, though, Vra\u017eda was travelling around the region watching Kotleba campaign, and could see with his own eyes how the revamped politician was connecting with the people he met. Nobody had ever bothered to campaign in the small towns before, but Kotleba went to these places, where it was hardly less surprising to see a real politician appear in the flesh than it would have been to see a herd of elephants stroll into town. He held small gatherings, listened to people\u2019s grievances, and told them that everyone was stealing from them, the decent people, the slu\u0161n\u00ed \u013eudia. Vra\u017eda looked on, and thought that if he didn\u2019t know what Kotleba really stood for, he too might have been persuaded by a lot of the messaging. Kotleba promised new and better local roads, a fairer deal for all, and action against the Roma. The specifics were left vague. \u201cHe told everyone he would make order with the Gypsies, but he never explained how,\u201d Vrazda told me. \u201cSo, one person could imagine a job-creation programme, while another person could imagine baseball bats.\u201d Ma\u0148ka, on the other hand, used his few campaign appearances to boast about the apparent economic prosperity he had brought. \u201cMa\u0148ka kept talking about \u20ac160m (\u00a3140m) he had attracted to the region, thinking people would thank him for this,\u201d said Vra\u017eda. \u201cBut they\u2019re earning \u20ac400 a month, and these numbers mean nothing to them. The numbers are probably true, but if ordinary people tried to find the money, they wouldn\u2019t. And then Marian Kotleba came along and said, \u2018I\u2019ve found the money. It\u2019s in the pockets of Vladim\u00edr Ma\u0148ka.\u2019\u201d Despite all this, on election night things went more or less as planned for Ma\u0148ka. He got a fraction less than half the vote, meaning there would be a run-off. Kotleba was the surprise runner-up, but he was way behind, on 21%. Conventional wisdom dictates that if an extremist candidate sneaks into the final round of voting, the moderate will see them off, a hypothesis borne out by two generations of Le Pens in France, among many others. In parts of the Slovak media there was alarm that a neo-Nazi had made it to a run-off, but everyone expected the second vote to be a formality. \u201cI have absolutely no doubt that Mr Ma\u0148ka is going to win the second round without a single problem,\u201d prime minister Robert Fico said in a television interview. He added, with a laugh: \u201cEven a sack of potatoes would beat Marian Kotleba.\u201d And then the unthinkable happened. In the first round, Ma\u0148ka had been just 600 votes short of an outright majority; this time he was trounced, with Kotleba receiving 55% of the vote. The turnout was still a miserly 25%, but it seemed that while many Ma\u0148ka voters had not bothered to turn up to vote for a second time, Kotleba had energised a different set of new voters with his promises to stand up for the \u201cdecent people\u201d. When I met Ma\u0148ka recently to discuss the 2013 vote, it was clear the subject is still a raw one. He remains an MEP, but mention his name even now in Slovak political circles and someone will say \u201csack of potatoes\u201d with a snigger. Ma\u0148ka arrived at our breakfast meeting with a bag of props, including literature filled with graphs and pie charts showing how successful his time in office had been. He placed on the table a glass award he had won in 2013 for running the most transparent region in Slovakia. The US ambassador, with whom he used to play tennis, had personally awarded it to him, he said. Ma\u0148ka didn\u2019t seem to think actually winning the approval of voters had even been part of his duties. \u201cI didn\u2019t campaign, I was busy working and solving all the problems,\u201d he told me, about the time between the first and second rounds of voting. \u201cWe had solved everything, the region was healthy, I was very happy.\u201d Five years later, he still looked genuinely confused by the result. A few weeks after the vote, Kotleba was confirmed as the new governor at a formal event where a chunky ceremonial chain was placed around his neck, as Ma\u0148ka and top city officials looked on, shell-shocked. * * * During his first year in office, Kotleba employed dozens of his party members in jobs at the local administration. Green-shirted security guards blocked the doors, giving the place the air of a cult headquarters. One of his first moves was to remove the EU flag from the administration building, in line with his belief that Slovakia should withdraw from both the EU and Nato. Kotleba did not have control of the regional parliament, which tried to frustrate his initiatives at every turn, but he set about making his influence felt wherever he could. He was particularly put out by programmes promoting human rights and tolerance in schools, and issued guidelines suggesting that instead of doing that, it would be better if the schools held beauty pageants. These were aimed at \u201cgirls learning to present themselves as ladies, and for them to see that there is still a world that values women\u2019s dignity and spiritual beauty\u201d. Some schools ignored the recommendations and still held the anti-extremism sessions; others did indeed hold beauty contests. Kotleba\u2019s Kulturkampf continued in other areas, as he cancelled a contemporary dance festival he deemed to contain \u201cpornography\u201d, as well as an EU-funded project to resettle people with mental disabilities from a decaying communist-era facility into smaller supported housing units, and reintegrate them into society. When the time came to campaign across the nation for the 2016 parliamentary elections, Kotleba and his party made good use of the deft double messaging common to extremists trying to go mainstream: putting on a more humane face for the general public, while providing clear signals for the core support. He attended an extreme-right march in Bratislava, where he wished everyone present \u201ca happy White day\u201d, to raucous applause. The party handed out charitable donations to youth sports clubs and other approved causes, but the amount on several occasions was \u20ac1,488, a number widely used as code by neo-Nazis. (The number 14 refers to the Fourteen Words, a white supremacist slogan, while 88 stands for Heil Hitler, as H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.) Uhr\u00edk told me it was merely a coincidence. In interviews, Kotleba claimed to be outraged at accusations of racism, and said he was simply defending the \u201cdecent people\u201d, who were now endangered by a new threat: the large numbers of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe from Africa and the Middle East. All the previous rhetoric about the Roma could now be grafted on to a new and even more threatening \u201cenemy\u201d. He was largely shunned by state television, but was active on Facebook and other social media, and stepped up his leafleting by mail. The leader, with an entourage of green-shirted disciples, travelled to the forgotten towns and villages once again, promising to restore dignity to the forgotten peoples of Slovakia, stripped from them so cruelly by the corrupted, decadent Slovak elites. As the parliamentary vote approached, the political rhetoric across the spectrum shifted closer towards Kotleba. Politicians across central Europe said they did not wish to support migrants when there were still so many people living in poverty in their home countries, and Slovakia was no exception. \u201cIslam has no place in Slovakia,\u201d said prime minister Fico, nailing his colours to the rightwing, anti-refugee mast. Two Slovak researchers, Viera \u017d\u00faborov\u00e1 and Ingrid Bor\u00e1rosov\u00e1, concluded that the endless mainstream discussion of the migration topic \u201clogically had to bring advantages for the party which had been for years presenting itself with Eurosceptic politics and hostility against minorities\u201d. While it\u2019s possible that Smer wooed some of Kotleba\u2019s voters by claiming the migration issue as their own, adopting the same kind of inflammatory language perhaps signalled to others that Kotleba had been right all along. His party won 8% of the vote and ended up with 14 seats in parliament. * * * In Bratislava, the result sent shockwaves through polite society. Previously, it had been possible to dismiss Kotleba as a freakshow in the provinces; now he was at the heart of national politics. There was a hand-wringing discussion about how to treat the country\u2019s newest parliamentarians \u2013 reminiscent of debates happening elsewhere as parties formerly considered fringe extremists began taking government offices. Andrej Kiska, who occupied the largely symbolic presidential role, was the one liberal force in Slovak politics, and refused to invite Kotleba to the presidential palace as is customary with heads of new parliamentary parties. \u201cLet\u2019s draw a clear line: these people are fascists and we won\u2019t cooperate or talk with them,\u201d he told Slovaks, explaining his decision. At the liberal newspaper Denn\u00edk N in Bratislava, editorial staff held discussions to decide how to cover Slovakia\u2019s newest political force. \u201cAll of us know that he\u2019s a fascist who is pretending to be a guy wearing a suit,\u201d editor-in-chief Mat\u00fa\u0161 Kostoln\u00fd told me. He felt the paper should cover the actions of Kotleba\u2019s MPs, but not carry interviews with them or treat them like regular parliamentarians. \u201cI did a lot of research about how this was handled in other countries, and basically there are no good solutions. If he were in power, he\u2019d be attacking the system we live in, so why should public television discuss his toxic ideas?\u201d Others weren\u2019t so sure. The veteran war correspondent Andrej B\u00e1n argued that while Kotleba himself should be blacklisted, it was worth engaging with party members. B\u00e1n thought it was necessary to listen to Kotleba\u2019s supporters, and later set up an organisation called Forgotten Slovakia, which organised public discussions in small towns across the country. Polling showed that some of the most radical Kotleba fans were young Slovaks, most of whom consumed their news via Facebook. Among 18- to 21-year-olds, Kotleba\u2019s party had got more votes than any other at the 2016 parliamentary elections. In one region, schools organised mock elections among students, and Kotleba won every time. \u201cThey poison the well of young people. If you start at age 11, then by 16 you can have a brainwashed Nazi. Without Facebook, Kotleba wouldn\u2019t be in parliament,\u201d claimed Va\u0161ecka, the sociologist. A number of NGOs began organising discussion groups in schools to try to increase political engagement among young people. Michal Dzurko, Kotleba\u2019s former student, had flirted with extremism but later became a committed campaigner against it. He travelled to schools to hold discussion sessions with radical young pupils. The children asked many questions, and often he could see that there were new thought processes whirring in some of their heads. \u201cNobody had taught them the basics of how to be a citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can tell you all the parts of a fucking maple leaf in Latin because that\u2019s what they teach in school, but nobody teaches them media literacy or how the world works.\u201d Soon, it was time to think about who would stand against Kotleba in the November 2017 regional elections, in which he wanted to secure another four-year term as Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica governor. J\u00e1n Lunter, a wealthy local businessman, was keen to run, and thought the best way to beat Kotleba was to offer a positive agenda, rather than to focus on the evils of Kotleba\u2019s ideology and try to shame people into not voting for an extremist. Born into a farming family but a longstanding vegetarian, Lunter had begun producing tofu in the early 1990s, back when vegetarian foods were hard to come by. By 2017, the company was producing seven tonnes of tofu per day, selling it across central Europe, and employed 200 people at its factory just outside Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. With a creased face and boomerang eyebrows, he looked slightly dishevelled in a suit, giving him simultaneous airs of respectability and relatability. He was by no means a charismatic orator, but he was possessed of a Zen-like calm that he would maintain all through the electoral campaign. Importantly, he was not a career politician, and had no links to Smer or other established political forces. The main political parties, and most other interested independents, stepped back to give Lunter the best chance of winning. Lunter\u2019s son Ondrej, who ran his father\u2019s campaign, engaged a set of Bratislava consultants to help craft the messaging, led by Peter Hajdin, a youthful 45-year-old with a fortnight\u2019s worth of beard. Hajdin had worked on President Kiska\u2019s campaign in 2014, helping him to a surprise victory against Fico, the Smer prime minister who had been keen to transfer to the presidential palace. For Lunter, Hajdin thought of a fairly straight campaign that would promote him as a decent, honest, hard-working businessman. The words Kotleba, Nazi, extremism or anything similar were not to be used. It was better to communicate with people by showing them a different vision of politics, he thought, rather than by yelling at them. The care and energy put into the campaign was in stark contrast to Ma\u0148ka\u2019s run four years earlier. Hajdin created slick branding, starting with the logo \u2013 a white, all-caps LUNTER in a chunky, no-nonsense font, embossed on a red rectangle. \u201cI wanted something like a Swiss chocolate logo, something tasty you\u2019d like to have a bite of,\u201d he told me in the offices of his Bratislava agency. Three campaign teams toured the region with balloons, leaflets and big smiles. In Bzov\u00edk, a typical town of around 1,000 residents an hour\u2019s drive from Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Kotleba had won comfortably in 2013. Michaela Urban, a community organiser who helped organise campaigning for Lunter in 2017, admitted that she herself had voted for Kotleba in 2013. \u201cI knew absolutely nothing about him \u2013 it was just about voting against Ma\u0148ka. I don\u2019t think many people knew that much about him then.\u201d In the four years of his governorship, Kotleba came to the town frequently, she said, to check on the progress of restorations to the 17th-century castle. He also repaired a road to the village that had been bothering locals for years. \u201cA few people like the ideology, but most people like him because it seems he takes an interest,\u201d she said. Nevertheless, it seemed likely that many people did also approve of aspects of Kotleba\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cEverywhere I went, people asked me what I would do about the Gypsies, and said at least Kotleba did something,\u201d Lunter told me, about his campaign visits around the region. Like many Slovak towns, Bzov\u00edk had a completely segregated Roma community, who lived in a settlement down a muddy track on the outskirts, where houses were stacked together higgledy-piggledy, unlike the neat bungalows in the rest of the town. Ownership rights were murky, even though the community has been there for generations. \u201cAnimals are more protected in this country than Roma people,\u201d 47-year-old Eva Gre\u0161kov\u00e1 complained to me, as she cooked lunch inside one of the houses. Tensions had increased over the years of the Kotleba governorship, she said, as the governor\u2019s rhetoric removed any vestigial taboo around open discrimination against Roma. She had a litany of unpleasant cases, from muttered abuse on the street to bus drivers refusing to take Roma kids on board. As the vote approached, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica was on edge. A dance theatre to which Kotleba had cut funding rehearsed a new show about the battle between good and evil, to premiere shortly after the election. They created posters featuring a man trying to jump over a ravine, with a demonic green hand emerging from the depths to pull him in. The posters read \u201cGood/Evil Prevails\u201d. The theatre rehearsed two alternate endings, to be used depending on the electoral result. On election night, everyone awaited the votes from the countryside nervously, remembering what had happened four years ago. In a number of small towns and villages like Bzov\u00edk, Kotleba won a majority again, but by midnight it was clear that Lunter would easily win the overall vote, and the celebrations began in the restaurant the Lunter team had hired. By the time Lunter and his small entourage arrived at the governor\u2019s office to take up their new jobs a few weeks later, almost everything had been stripped from the walls and cabinets, but there were a few curious discoveries. In a side-room off the governor\u2019s office they found a camp bed. Kotleba, apparently, had been sleeping there. In a cabinet, they found three different drafts of a grovelling letter to the Russian ambassador apparently written by Kotleba, in which he said he wanted to buy a Russian car and hoped for any assistance possible from Russia. When I met Lunter, he retrieved the drafts from a grey folder marked \u201cKotleba\u201d that he still keeps in his office, and read one out with a smirk. It was not clear if any version of the letter was ever sent, but it appeared to bolster rumours of illicit funding from Moscow, which Uhr\u00edk strongly denied to me. In the days after the vote, dancers from the theatre went around town with a red marker and crossed out the \u201cevil\u201d on their posters, so that they now read simply, \u201cGood prevails\u201d. After four years, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica had finally got rid of Kotleba. Lunter, asked what his first act as governor would be, said he planned to open the windows of the regional administration building and let in some fresh air. * * * Back in 2013, Kotleba had benefited from a perfect storm of hometown factors \u2013 complacent incumbent, widespread disillusion, low voter turnout, and slick online and in-person campaigning \u2013 to win victory. The years of Roma isolation and alienation also helped, with Kotleba\u2019s unpleasant rhetoric finding a receptive audience among many frustrated rural residents. With a well thought-out campaign, Lunter was able to beat him easily, despite not being a particularly charismatic politician. Although he is now an established fixture in Slovak politics, Kotleba is ultimately seen as too much of a genuine extremist to win real majorities nationally. Ahead of March\u2019s presidential elections, most polling has him unlikely to break double figures. It would be nice to think that, after four years of Kotleba, the people of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica had an epiphany and realised he was a charlatan and a racist. But Kotleba all along was a symptom, not a diagnosis, and it\u2019s hard to draw the conclusion that all is well with politics in Slovakia. Kotleba \u2013 whose current presidential campaign posters say \u201cFamily is a man and a woman: Stop LGBT\u201d and \u201cfinally a Slovak president\u201d \u2013 is often mentioned in a pairing with Boris Koll\u00e1r, a flamboyant businessman whose party, We Are Family, also made it into parliament in 2016 on a vague \u201cfamily values\u201d programme. Kotleba attracted a large proportion of angry provincial men, while Koll\u00e1r attracted large numbers of disillusioned women from the regions, according to Slovak pollsters. When I met Koll\u00e1r in his parliamentary office recently, he was dressed in a sharp suit and characteristically loud tie. \u201cVoters don\u2019t read election programmes, voters decide based on emotions,\u201d he told me as he chomped on expensive chocolates. Koll\u00e1r has 10 children from nine different women, yet says he named his party We Are Family because his focus was on \u201ctraditional conservative values when it comes to the family\u201d. Was it some kind of joke, I asked. \u201cI have shown I can look after my children, it\u2019s proof I can look after all the children,\u201d he said, clarifying that his traditionalism was mainly focused on opposing the expansion of LGBT rights. When I asked what his solution to the issue of Roma poverty and isolation was, he looked at me very seriously, and said: \u201cWe\u2019ll buy them 700,000 plane tickets and send them all to England and see how you like it.\u201d He lifted his head back and gave a huge roar of laughter. Then he said: \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d Koll\u00e1r set up his party five months before the elections; he got nearly 7% of the vote and now has 11 MPs. The response of prime minister Fico and his ruling Smer party to the rise of these populist and extremist parties was to try to stifle them by pilfering their playbook. Fico called journalists \u201cdirty anti-Slovak prostitutes\u201d, claimed anti-government protests were organised by George Soros, and continued the rhetoric against migrants and refugees. Protests against his government erupted last spring over the murder of investigative journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak and his fiancee. They were shot dead at home, as Kuciak was investigating alleged ties between government-linked figures and organised crime, and the killings shocked the urban elite. The protesters who flooded the central squares in cities across the country were mainly middle-class, liberal Slovaks. I even met some government ministry employees at one protest in Bratislava last April. They said it was time for a different kind of politics, without corruption and ties to organised crime. The protesters had no party orientation, but protested under the slogan For a Decent Slovakia. To everyone\u2019s surprise, Fico stepped aside in March last year, although Smer is still in government. A countrywide movement was formed, outside party politics, holding rallies and meetings under the Decent Slovakia brand, to keep up the pressure on the ruling elite. It was that same word \u2013 decency \u2013 of which Kotleba was so fond. Indeed, some of the core demands of the Kotleba greenshirts were not so different to those of the middle-class protesters in Bratislava. Both wanted a crackdown on graft, new politicians who listened, and were demanding respect and decency. President Kiska, the one prominent progressive politician in the country, is not standing for re-election next month, and while Kotleba is unlikely to win, progressive Slovaks are worried about \u0160tefan Harabin, a former minister of justice known for colourful insults, disdain for the media and occasional nationalist rhetoric. The establishment, Smer-backed candidate is Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, a vice-president of the European Commission\u2019s Energy Union, who has little experience of electoral politics. If Harabin gets to the second round and picks up the votes of Kotleba and other nationalists, he may have a shot at winning. Before leaving Slovakia, I paid a visit to the presidential palace, a grand, gaudily renovated complex in central Bratislava, where I chatted with Rado Ba\u0165o, a political advisor to the president with a James Joyce quote tattooed on one arm and a sloth on the other. He said the focus groups his team had carried out showed a surprisingly large crossover between Kotleba voters and Kiska voters. Many of the same people who voted for a progressive liberal in favour of minority rights as president had backed a far-right extremist party in parliamentary elections. It suggested that actual policies mattered less than the perception of a willingness to shake up the system, he said. \u201cSlovak politics is no longer divided between left and right. People don\u2019t care if parties are leftwing or rightwing. They just want the government to get shit done.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2019. An earlier version suggested Kotleba lost his governorship before taking his party into parliament, but it was after. It also referred to \u0160tefan Harabin as a former high-court judge; he is a former minister of justice, but remains a judge; and Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d is a vice-president at the European Commission, not a deputy commissioner. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Yet many Conservative MPs voted against it in the full knowledge that it was not the final word on the subject. Two weeks later, most of them lined up behind the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/29/brexit-vote-commons-latest-news-developments-liam-fox-says-may-now-saying-withdrawal-deal-text-must-be-rewritten-politics-live?page=with:block-5c50a0bde4b084eaaff7fade\" title=\"\">Brady amendment,</a> which gives the bulk of May\u2019s original deal a second chance.</p> <p>Amid the fog of the conflict, it can be tempting to assume that more has been settled in the politics of Brexit than is the case. The reality is that most of the big options, and some small ones, are still in play. Just as May\u2019s deal may yet survive largely intact, complete with a version of the Northern Ireland backstop, so other options that stretch from a Norway-style soft Brexit to an exit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/13/brexit-latest-news-developments-pmqs-olly-robbins-wrong-to-claim-may-will-use-threat-of-extending-article-50-to-pass-deal-barclay-says-politics-live\" title=\"\">without a deal</a> \u2013 all of which have their supporters at Westminster \u2013 cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>The underlying reasons for this uncertainty are unchanged too. The European issue is huge, complex and divisive. Parliament and government are still struggling to adjust to a referendum vote they mostly do not support and which is not easy to implement. And we have a hung parliament. The combination is a recipe for instability and uncertainty. </p> <p>Ever since the vote for the Brady amendment on 29 January, May has claimed that she has a \u201csubstantial and sustainable\u201d majority for her attempt to fettle the backstop and get the deal through the Commons. Well, of course she says that. It\u2019s in her interest. She wants to weaken the will of her rebels.</p> <p>But that does not make it true. The majority for Brady was a single frame from a moving film. The movie has already moved on. May\u2019s motion for today\u2019s debate got into trouble with the Tory rebels yesterday precisely because it acknowledges another truth \u2013 that there is also a Westminster majority against no deal \u2013 that the rebels will not accept. Substantial majority? Pull the other one.</p> <p>That is the same reason why reports of the death of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/labour-support-for-yvette-coopers-brexit-amendment-in-doubt\" title=\"\">Cooper-Boles amendment</a> have also been premature and exaggerated. That amendment, which proposed an extension to the article 50 process to prevent a no-deal Brexit, went down by 23 votes two weeks ago. One of the reasons it fell, however, is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/30/government-looks-to-exploit-labour-divisions-over-brexit\" title=\"\">24 Labour MPs voted</a> against it or abstained. Some of them did so, in part, because they didn\u2019t want to be tarred with voting to prolong Brexit when, in fact, it may be prolonged anyway \u2013 exactly as the UK\u2019s chief negotiator Olly Robbins was <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-02-12/exclusive-uk-chief-brexit-negotiator-olly-robbins-warns-mps-the-choice-is-mays-deal-or-extension/\" title=\"\">overheard predicting</a> this week.</p> <p>Whatever happens in the Commons tonight, these alternatives not only live to fight another day but may also win in the end. This week, May called on Tory MPs to hold their nerve while she continues her quest for a saleable version of the backstop. But the same advice applies with equal force to the moderates across the Commons who want to emerge with a softer Brexit deal than May has proposed. Their moment could yet come.</p> <p>To say this is not to be in denial. On the contrary, it is to recognise the facts. Looking through the history of Brexit since July 2016 when she became prime minister, three truths can be discerned about May\u2019s approach. The first is that she needs to deliver the least-worst Brexit deal for the country. The second is that she is determined to avoid no-deal. The third is that she wants Brexit to be delivered by the Conservative party and its parliamentary allies.</p> <p>Her problem, all along, is that these three ducks won\u2019t line up. That is extremely unlikely to change. The real problem is that third duck. May remains absolutely Tory-focused on Brexit. But there are not enough Tory and DUP MPs who will vote for the kind of deal she craves. The 15 January rejection, in which 118 Tory MPs voted against her deal, undoubtedly exaggerated the internal opposition. But those 118 will not all come back into line at the end of the month, or in March. Some of them will. Some of them won\u2019t \u2013 perhaps including the DUP.</p> <p>In other words, a Brexit deal will only happen with some opposition support. But how much will May need? Not even the chief whip knows. Jeremy Corbyn, who supports Brexit but who wants the Tories to own it, blurs many calculations. Yet not all of the Labour MPs who failed to support Cooper-Boles are supporters of May\u2019s deal. Some them just don\u2019t want to be responsible for an article 50 extension. What is more, they may get their wish, if what Robbins was overheard saying in that Brussels hotel bar on Tuesday night by ITV News\u2019s Angus Walker were to happen.</p> <p>Ever since 29 January, when the Brady amendment was carried and the Cooper-Boles amendment was lost, many have assumed that the die was cast. There is a mood of fatalism in remainer Britain that, after those votes, May is finally going to deliver a Tory-facing Brexit. Yes, that could happen. But the facts and the numbers don\u2019t yet support that view. Facts and numbers still count for a lot, even in a hall of mirrors. But leadership counts for even more.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Amid the fog of the conflict, it can be tempting to assume that more has been settled in the politics of Brexit than is the case. The reality is that most of the big options, and some small ones, are still in play. Just as May\u2019s deal may yet survive largely intact, complete with a version of the Northern Ireland backstop, so other options that stretch from a Norway-style soft Brexit to an exit without a deal \u2013 all of which have their supporters at Westminster \u2013 cannot be ruled out. The underlying reasons for this uncertainty are unchanged too. The European issue is huge, complex and divisive. Parliament and government are still struggling to adjust to a referendum vote they mostly do not support and which is not easy to implement. And we have a hung parliament. The combination is a recipe for instability and uncertainty. Ever since the vote for the Brady amendment on 29 January, May has claimed that she has a \u201csubstantial and sustainable\u201d majority for her attempt to fettle the backstop and get the deal through the Commons. Well, of course she says that. It\u2019s in her interest. She wants to weaken the will of her rebels. But that does not make it true. The majority for Brady was a single frame from a moving film. The movie has already moved on. May\u2019s motion for today\u2019s debate got into trouble with the Tory rebels yesterday precisely because it acknowledges another truth \u2013 that there is also a Westminster majority against no deal \u2013 that the rebels will not accept. Substantial majority? Pull the other one. That is the same reason why reports of the death of the Cooper-Boles amendment have also been premature and exaggerated. That amendment, which proposed an extension to the article 50 process to prevent a no-deal Brexit, went down by 23 votes two weeks ago. One of the reasons it fell, however, is that 24 Labour MPs voted against it or abstained. Some of them did so, in part, because they didn\u2019t want to be tarred with voting to prolong Brexit when, in fact, it may be prolonged anyway \u2013 exactly as the UK\u2019s chief negotiator Olly Robbins was overheard predicting this week. Whatever happens in the Commons tonight, these alternatives not only live to fight another day but may also win in the end. This week, May called on Tory MPs to hold their nerve while she continues her quest for a saleable version of the backstop. But the same advice applies with equal force to the moderates across the Commons who want to emerge with a softer Brexit deal than May has proposed. Their moment could yet come. To say this is not to be in denial. On the contrary, it is to recognise the facts. Looking through the history of Brexit since July 2016 when she became prime minister, three truths can be discerned about May\u2019s approach. The first is that she needs to deliver the least-worst Brexit deal for the country. The second is that she is determined to avoid no-deal. The third is that she wants Brexit to be delivered by the Conservative party and its parliamentary allies. Her problem, all along, is that these three ducks won\u2019t line up. That is extremely unlikely to change. The real problem is that third duck. May remains absolutely Tory-focused on Brexit. But there are not enough Tory and DUP MPs who will vote for the kind of deal she craves. The 15 January rejection, in which 118 Tory MPs voted against her deal, undoubtedly exaggerated the internal opposition. But those 118 will not all come back into line at the end of the month, or in March. Some of them will. Some of them won\u2019t \u2013 perhaps including the DUP. In other words, a Brexit deal will only happen with some opposition support. But how much will May need? Not even the chief whip knows. Jeremy Corbyn, who supports Brexit but who wants the Tories to own it, blurs many calculations. Yet not all of the Labour MPs who failed to support Cooper-Boles are supporters of May\u2019s deal. Some them just don\u2019t want to be responsible for an article 50 extension. What is more, they may get their wish, if what Robbins was overheard saying in that Brussels hotel bar on Tuesday night by ITV News\u2019s Angus Walker were to happen. Ever since 29 January, when the Brady amendment was carried and the Cooper-Boles amendment was lost, many have assumed that the die was cast. There is a mood of fatalism in remainer Britain that, after those votes, May is finally going to deliver a Tory-facing Brexit. Yes, that could happen. But the facts and the numbers don\u2019t yet support that view. Facts and numbers still count for a lot, even in a hall of mirrors. But leadership counts for even more. \u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",

Young activists of color were recognized for their gun violence prevention leadership For decades, activists of color in cities like such as St Louis, Oakland, Chicago and New York have been working nonstop to fund violence prevention programs, demand more action from politicians, mentor young people, and intervene in the lives of kids vulnerable to violence. But they have only rarely been offered the national spotlight. At the March for Our Lives in Washington DC, a series of charismatic young activists of color, from Alex King and D\u2019Angelo McDade to Edna Chavez, Naomi Wadler, Christopher Underwood and Zion Kelly, spoke powerfully about their experience of gun violence. March for Our Lives expanded to nearly 200 local chapters The gun violence prevention organization founded by Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school students has expanded across the country. Jackie Corin, one of the Parkland leaders, is now working to train regional organizers, and expand the group\u2019s network across the country, in preparation for leading even bigger youth voter registration and turnout efforts in 2020.",

Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said that as a result the cabinet minister had \u201cdodged scrutiny\u201d over the promises he had made to Nissan in October 2016 to boost manufacturing in Sunderland after Brexit. At the time Clark had refused to say exactly what assurances he had given Nissan, even saying there was \u201cno chequebook\u201d involved, despite intense pressure on him to reveal how he had persuaded the company to demonstrate confidence in the UK. The business secretary promised MPs from the floor of the Commons that any offer of taxpayer support for Nissan would ultimately be reported to parliament once it had formally been agreed, in remarks seized upon by Labour. Clark said on 31 October 2016 that all proposals for state aid were \u201csubject to rigorous external scrutiny\u201d by the independent Industrial Development Advisory Board (IDAB) and were reported on to parliament. A package worth \u00a361m was ultimately granted to Nissan in June 2018, but it was kept secret until earlier this month, when the Japanese car maker changed its mind, and decided it would not make the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland after all. Long-Bailey said: \u201cThe government has dodged scrutiny of the assurances it gave to Nissan ever since it was first brought to light. While Labour is in favour of supporting UK industry, we do not support sweetheart deals with no strategy or transparency.\u201d Clark has said that Nissan would have to reapply for state aid after abandoning its commitment to make the X-Trail in Sunderland, which had it gone ahead would have created 740 jobs at the Sunderland plant, which employs 7,000 people. Long-Bailey also wrote a letter to Clark, accusing him of failing \u201cto keep your own promise to Nissan\u201d and called on him to \u201cdemand that the prime minister rules out a no-deal Brexit \u2013 a promise we know you have made abundantly clear in private and must now have the guts to make in public\u201d. Car makers have repeatedly warned of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, with Ford and Toyota and the trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders among those who have gone public with their concerns. Last week, Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business select committee, extracted a promise from Clark that he would in future notify the committee every time a company had been granted a state aid package. A total of \u00a3150m in state aid to car makers, including Toyota, Ford and BMW has also been granted without MPs being made aware of them, in a wide-ranging programme to help key manufacturers retain confidence in the UK after the country leaves the European Union. Richard Harrington, a junior business minister, confirmed in a written answer that while the \u00a361m package was scrutinised by the IDAB, parliament was not notified. Justifying Clark\u2019s decision, Harrington said: \u201cOnly if the secretary of state wished to act contrary to the board\u2019s recommendation (which was not the case with the Nissan award), he shall (if the board [the IDAB] requests) lay a statement before parliament.\u201d The junior minister added: \u201cThere is no obligation to do so when he acts in accordance with their recommendation.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2019.

The need for dignity is inherent to being human, and connected to our love of humankind. Pride, on the other hand, is a facade, it\u2019s about a craving for exclusionary recognition and an answer to the question of who is superior to whom. It is divisive. But when crowds are desperate enough, it is easy for political actors to reduce the need for human dignity to a vindictive clamour for pride. And this is what rightwing populism does.</p> \n<p>It is dangerous and unfortunate that so much public anger is being organised and mobilised by rightwing populists and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/06/strongman-authoritarian-leaders-days-numbered-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-prince\" title=\"\">ruthless autocrats</a> such as Donald Trump, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Turkey and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. They point at journalists, scientists and the political establishment and say: they\u2019re the ones who have been messing with people\u2019s dignity. These leaders usually emerge from the privileged classes but make people believe that they will bring the elite to their knees and allow them to take back their dignity. This is why at Trump rallies and Brexit demonstrations we see faces shaped by the struggle for survival lit up and filled with a new energy. These are souls rediscovering the ability to say no to a world that has been whipped into submission for decades by the capitalist motto, There Is No Alternative (Tina).</p> \n<p>Despite the dominant economic assumption that humans function best when driven by the fear of losing out materially, and the desire to always acquire more, the human soul \u2013 the strangest matter on the planet \u2013 also needs meaning to hold on to. By now, even the diehard devotees of capitalism know (as we saw at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos\" title=\"\">Davos</a>) that neoliberalism\u2019s economic mechanisms are dysfunctional, its main narrative is collapsing, and that a collapsing story cannot produce inspirational heroes. At the same time people around the world feel the pain of their broken dignity and are angry about having been deceived. This is why they are so eager to be energised by remedies that are too simple to be true, to find visible targets for their anger and, most important, to latch on to false hopes. They are good to go; ready to follow new heroes promising them greatness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"edaf5a64-4a66-4417-9fbf-ffa94c0b020a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h810bO-4LIs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Following a hero who reminds them of their own basic human power delivers such a sweet and fundamental joy that they are prepared to compromise anything and everything to do it. It\u2019s to do with a complex part of the human soul that the dominant economic system has overlooked for so long, and now this human need jeopardises the very system that shaped it: Brexit is threatening free trade, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/19/trump-money-wars-economic-sanctions-trade-tariffs-backfiring\" title=\"\">protectionism</a> is messing with the first commandment of neoliberal economics, laissez-faire.</p> \n<p>Few leaders have openly confronted this rise of nationalism and nativism. Few are ready to talk actively about the possibility of a better world, to say there<em> </em><em>is</em> an alternative, built not on vindictive pride but peaceful human dignity. That is why there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-knows-yesterdays-radicalism-can-become-tomorrows-common-sense\" title=\"\">so much excitement</a> about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the new star on the left of US politics and the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives. She is a rare voice, and she knows that the fight is not only about material inequality.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/06/viktor-orban-crossed-red-lines-hungary-eu\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n has crossed all the red lines.

Put together by former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s <a href=\"https://diem25.org/what-is-diem25/\" title=\"\">Democracy in Europe</a> movement, its manifesto lists its aspirations \u2013 democracy, transparency, pluralism \u2013 and much else that no sane person would oppose. But there is no mention of the human soul or human dignity. For an organisation that speaks of internationalising the opposition by standing shoulder to shoulder with US senator Bernie Sanders and reminding us that Tina is a manufactured illusion, I wonder \u2013 as a supporter of this movement \u2013 where the words are that would light up faces shaped by the struggle for survival.</p> \n<p>As we have seen in Turkey, the US and parts of Europe, rightwing populists disrupt rational thinking and energise the masses by creating movements of their own. They benefit from the opposition defensively making nervous jokes about ruthless leaders, they dismantle institutions and, finally, they reshape their countries so they can coast on the waves of political madness. And this is a global matter that needs a global solution. Protecting human dignity from populism\u2019s dangerous demand for pride while taking on the dominant global economic system will require a hell of a lot of solidarity.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Ece Temelkuran is a Turkish journalist and author of How to Lose a Country</p>",

The battle for dignity has been replaced by an aggressive assertion of pride \u2013 in the nation, or in a particular version of \u201cthe people\u201d. Between the words \u201cdignity\u201d and \u201cpride\u201d there is a world of difference, and that difference is at the heart of the global political and moral mess confronting us now. The need for dignity is inherent to being human, and connected to our love of humankind. Pride, on the other hand, is a facade, it\u2019s about a craving for exclusionary recognition and an answer to the question of who is superior to whom. It is divisive. But when crowds are desperate enough, it is easy for political actors to reduce the need for human dignity to a vindictive clamour for pride. And this is what rightwing populism does. It is dangerous and unfortunate that so much public anger is being organised and mobilised by rightwing populists and ruthless autocrats such as Donald Trump, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Turkey and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. They point at journalists, scientists and the political establishment and say: they\u2019re the ones who have been messing with people\u2019s dignity. These leaders usually emerge from the privileged classes but make people believe that they will bring the elite to their knees and allow them to take back their dignity. This is why at Trump rallies and Brexit demonstrations we see faces shaped by the struggle for survival lit up and filled with a new energy. These are souls rediscovering the ability to say no to a world that has been whipped into submission for decades by the capitalist motto, There Is No Alternative (Tina). Despite the dominant economic assumption that humans function best when driven by the fear of losing out materially, and the desire to always acquire more, the human soul \u2013 the strangest matter on the planet \u2013 also needs meaning to hold on to. By now, even the diehard devotees of capitalism know (as we saw at Davos) that neoliberalism\u2019s economic mechanisms are dysfunctional, its main narrative is collapsing, and that a collapsing story cannot produce inspirational heroes. At the same time people around the world feel the pain of their broken dignity and are angry about having been deceived. This is why they are so eager to be energised by remedies that are too simple to be true, to find visible targets for their anger and, most important, to latch on to false hopes. They are good to go; ready to follow new heroes promising them greatness. Following a hero who reminds them of their own basic human power delivers such a sweet and fundamental joy that they are prepared to compromise anything and everything to do it. It\u2019s to do with a complex part of the human soul that the dominant economic system has overlooked for so long, and now this human need jeopardises the very system that shaped it: Brexit is threatening free trade, Trump\u2019s protectionism is messing with the first commandment of neoliberal economics, laissez-faire. Few leaders have openly confronted this rise of nationalism and nativism. Few are ready to talk actively about the possibility of a better world, to say there is an alternative, built not on vindictive pride but peaceful human dignity. That is why there is so much excitement about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the new star on the left of US politics and the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives. She is a rare voice, and she knows that the fight is not only about material inequality. While watching a video of one of her speeches, I flicked through the recently published European New Deal, so far the only solid political document for an alternative economic model for the old continent. Put together by former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s Democracy in Europe movement, its manifesto lists its aspirations \u2013 democracy, transparency, pluralism \u2013 and much else that no sane person would oppose. But there is no mention of the human soul or human dignity. For an organisation that speaks of internationalising the opposition by standing shoulder to shoulder with US senator Bernie Sanders and reminding us that Tina is a manufactured illusion, I wonder \u2013 as a supporter of this movement \u2013 where the words are that would light up faces shaped by the struggle for survival. As we have seen in Turkey, the US and parts of Europe, rightwing populists disrupt rational thinking and energise the masses by creating movements of their own. They benefit from the opposition defensively making nervous jokes about ruthless leaders, they dismantle institutions and, finally, they reshape their countries so they can coast on the waves of political madness. And this is a global matter that needs a global solution. Protecting human dignity from populism\u2019s dangerous demand for pride while taking on the dominant global economic system will require a hell of a lot of solidarity. \u2022 Ece Temelkuran is a Turkish journalist and author of How to Lose a Country",

      "bodyText": "Pauline Hanson\u2019s senior adviser James Ashby has had his parliamentary pass revoked by the Senate president following an altercation with former One Nation senator Brian Burston. Burston has vowed to refer the incident on Wednesday evening at Parliament House to the police and to seek a restraining order against Ashby but also offered an apology for smearing blood on the door of Hanson\u2019s office that evening. Burston and Hanson have been locked in combat over her decision to air allegations that he sexually harassed a former staffer, prompting him to retaliate by accusing the One Nation leader of making two unwelcome advances towards him. The ill-will between the pair \u2013 which prompted Burston to split from the party last year \u2013 appeared to boil over on Wednesday night, when Burston was involved in a physical altercation with Ashby after they were seated at the same table at the Minerals Council dinner. Video recordings and images show Burston and Ashby tussling outside the Great Hall. On Thursday afternoon the Senate president, Scott Ryan, told the Senate he had reviewed video footage of \u201cthe reported incident between Senator Burston and Mr James Ashby\u201d and concluded \u201cit shows inappropriate behaviour by a pass-holder towards a senator\u201d. \u201cAccordingly I have exercised my authority to revoke Mr James Ashby\u2019s pass to access the building and prohibit him from entering the building for the time being,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cSenators must be free to go about their work in this building, this privilege and protection is not limited to simple proceedings in the chamber.\u201d Ryan said the ruling \u2013 which speaker of the house Tony Smith assented to \u2013 does not affect Ashby\u2019s employment nor prejudice any other legal proceedings that may be undertaken. \u201cGiven the seriousness of the incident and evidence immediately available to me I believe immediate action is necessary and warranted. \u201cIf further information comes to my attention this decision can be revisited and any subsequent legal action can be taken into account.\u201d Ashby told Guardian Australia he respected the Senate president\u2019s jurisdiction and \u201cto that affect, I have surrendered my pass\u201d. Ashby also called for a full investigation of the altercation and issues that preceded it. He also said there should be a probe into \u201ca range of other issues regarding the alleged treatment of female staff that may be relevant to this matter\u201d. Following the president\u2019s remarks in the Senate, Burston stood and said: \u201cWhilst I do not recall the incident of blood on the door I now have come to the conclusion that it was myself and I sincerely apologise for that action.\u201d In an earlier statement Burston\u2019s wife Rosalyn said they were surprised to be seated with Ashby at a dinner function in parliament. Ashby left the table half an hour earlier to \u201cdeliberately ambush\u201d the pair as they left, she said. Burston \u201cthrew his arms at an object in self-defence\u201d when Ashby \u201cpounced\u201d on them, she said. Burston\u2019s new party leader, Clive Palmer, has also stood by the senator, accusing One Nation of \u201ccheap tricks\u201d. \u201cFrom day one when Senator Burston announced he was joining the United Australia Party he has been attacked and vilified,\u201d Palmer said. On Thursday, Burston announced he was referring the matter to police and had sought a restraining order against Ashby, accusing him of \u201crepeated acts of harassment and aggression\u201d. His office issued a statement saying the vision in public circulation did not show the entire incident. Ashby was approached for a response. Burston also denied all allegations against him and said: \u201cIt is clear that James Ashby has set up Senator Burston to look badly for political purpose, all in breach of parliamentary rules.\u201d This week\u2019s turmoil began when Hanson made a speech about an unnamed senator in the Senate on Tuesday night, using parliamentary privilege to say that the senator had engaged in \u201cserious sexual harassment\u201d. A copy of a complaint by a former Burston staffer late last year, obtained by Guardian Australia, showed a woman had accused him of sexual harassment. She said she had been distressed by an office incident and Burston had offered to \u201c\u2018fuck\u2019 me to make things better\u201d. \u201cI refused his approach, but inside my world shattered,\u201d she said. Burston initially declined to comment on the allegations when approached by Guardian Australia. His staff were subsequently responding to Guardian Australia\u2019s questions when Burston interjected, describing the allegations as \u201cgarbage\u201d and \u201call bullshit\u201d. A spokeswoman said Burston would not say the word \u201cfuck\u201d, something with which his wife, Rosalyn, agreed. \u201cMy husband never says fuck,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Later on Wednesday night, News Corp reported that Burston had said \u201cfuck you\u201d to a reporter. Of the altercation with Ashby, Burston told News Corp, \u201cI told him to fuck off. I lost it.\u201d Burston has also promised to retaliate against Hanson and fellow One Nation senator, Peter Georgiou, in a speech in the Senate on Thursday evening. He earlier described Hanson as a \u201cwoman scorned\u201d and accused her of two unwelcome advances. Hanson laughed off the allegations. \u201cI\u2019m 64 \u2026 but I tell you what, I\u2019m not that desperate,\u201d she told Sky News.",

Asylum rejections from June 2018, when the coalition of the Five Star Movement and the League came to power, to September 2018 totalled 19,460, ISPI said. \u201cThe decree will keep increasing the number of illegal immigrants in Italy,\u201d Matteo Villa, a research fellow for the ISPI\u2019s migration programme, told the Guardian. \u201cAccording to our estimates, there could be more than 670,000 asylum seekers who will find themselves living irregularly in Italy, partly because the government does not have the capacity to deport them.\u2019\u2019 Arrivals to Italy have decreased by more than 80% since their peak. According to figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 23,126 people arrived in Italy in 2018, compared with 118,914 in 2017. According to UN figures, 2,458 migrants reached the country from October 2018 to January 2019, the period covered by the most recent ISPI figures. The majority of the people whose asylum requests were denied in recent months arrived in Italy in 2017. It can take an average of 19 months for Italian authorities to respond to an asylum application. The Italian government has promised to repatriate 500,000 people. To date it has repatriated about 500 migrants per month \u2013 fewer than the average of the previous government. \u201cWe calculated it would take almost a century to repatriate all the migrants denied asylum,\u201d Villa said. Meanwhile, expulsions of migrants denied humanitarian protection have continued from reception centres around Italy. Many of those expelled are likely to become homeless. In January more than 500 people were ousted from a refugee reception centre in Castelnuovo di Porto, a town close to Rome, in the first major eviction since the Salvini decree was brought into law. A further 50 were expelled last week from the Cara di Mineo reception centre in Sicily, one of the largest in Europe. Charities said a Nigerian man who killed himself this month had recently been denied a residence permit. Prince Jerry, 25, a chemistry graduate, was continuing his studies at university having arrived from Libya on a boat two and a half years ago. In mid-January his appeal to stay in the country was rejected and he \u201cfell into a deep depression\u201d, according to sources close to Jerry. He had been staying in Tortona in Piedmont at the time of his death. Father Alex Zanotelli, a member of the Comboni missionaries in Verona, described Jerry\u2019s death as \u201ca state murder, the bitter fruit of the Salvini decree, which besides insecurity produces deaths\u201d. \u2022 In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.",

      "bodyText": "A petition in Bavaria on preserving species diversity, popularly known as the \u201csave the bees\u201d campaign, has garnered sufficient support to enforce significant changes to the state\u2019s farming practices. The organisers reached their target of securing the signatures of 10% of eligible voters in the southern German state well before the Wednesday evening deadline. Environmental groups behind the push to radically change farming methods, including turning more grassland into meadow and ensuring a third of farms are organic over the next decade, are due to meet politicians to discuss the next stage in their drive. As part of the campaign, thousands of people have rallied in the streets dressed in bee costumes, as well as staging a mass buzz-in in an attempt to produce the loudest ever buzz in the world. The carnivalesque mood has helped secure popular support for the serious aims of the campaign to secure a long-term political commitment to safeguard the diversity of flora and fauna and improve the habitats of insects and birds, whose populations have plummeted in recent years. Among the demands are for 20% of land to be made bee-friendly within the next six years, and 30% by 2030. Environmental education in schools and businesses should also be increased. The fact that more than 1 million people had signed the petition by Wednesday evening means politicians will ignore its demands at their peril. The campaign was backed by the Greens, the Bavarian Ecological Democratic Party (\u00d6DP) and conservation groups. Ludwig Hartmann of the Greens said the more people signed the petition, the clearer the message was to Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union government under the leadership of Markus S\u00f6der. \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn the tide and set a new course for effective nature conservation in Bavaria,\u201d he said. Some farmers have criticised the campaign, however, saying their efforts to embrace environmentally-friendly policies while the financial pressures on them increase have often been ignored. \u201cWe are already doing a lot, but often this is dismissed,\u201d said Walter Heidl, the president of the Bavarian Farmers\u2019 Association. The campaign also demands that farmers rescue hedges and trees and preserve habitat on stream and river banks.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has shelved its energy bill after acknowledging it cannot legislate its much-vaunted \u201cbig stick\u201d policy without copping an unwanted amendment to its bill blocking taxpayer support for new coal plants. Despite pressing the urgency of the legislation for months, the government has now abandoned efforts to legislate it before the May election and will instead take it to the people in an effort to secure a mandate. The tactical retreat sparked an immediate backlash from the Nationals. Queensland National Keith Pitt told Guardian Australia it was \u201cconcerning\u201d the package had been shelved. \u201cCost of living is one of the biggest issues facing my constituents, and high energy prices cost business,\u201d Pitt said. He said that mechanism was the only option federally to force the state government in Queensland to lower power prices. The government\u2019s decision to pull the bill came as the Greens and Labor had the requisite numbers on the crossbench to impose an amendment in the House of Representatives stopping the commonwealth from underwriting investment in new coal plants \u2013 which would have imposed the second major defeat on the floor in a week. The prospects for the bill looked no better in the Senate. A number of crossbenchers were telegraphing potential amendments, including one proposal from the Centre Alliance to impose a divestiture power across the economy rather than confining it to the energy sector. An economy-wide divestiture power would be attractive to the Nationals, who have long championed beefed up competition laws to break up the major supermarket chains to assist smaller competitors and suppliers. The withdrawal of the bill removes an opportunity to put a legislative brake on coal underwriting, which the Morrison government is still pursuing, with a view to having proposals settled before the May election. Greens climate change spokesman Adam Bandt said it was important to do what was necessary to stop that plan from proceeding. \u201cThe idea that after a summer where Australia has been burning and other parts of the country are under water, that the government would take public money for schools and hospitals and give it to coal power stations, is reprehensible,\u201d Bandt said. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, told reporters on Thursday he believed the government would need legislation to underpin a new contract with a private company wanting to build a coal plant with taxpayer underwriting. He repeated a previous statement that Labor would honour contracts the government entered into despite its strenuous opposition to new coal generation, but he added Labor would only be obliged to honour a contract if it was \u201clawful\u201d. Since unveiling the \u201cbig stick\u201d package, the government has suffered a bombardment from the energy sector, which has been implacably opposed to the package, as have major business groups and a number of policy experts, including the person the Coalition chose to conduct a review of competition policy, the prominent economist Ian Harper. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, accepted the impossibility of the task on Thursday morning. \u201cOur legislation to prohibit energy market misconduct is an important reform that aims to hold the big energy companies to account and drive competition in the market and lower prices for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be taking this policy to the election which forms a key plank in our response to the ACCC inquiry into retail electricity prices\u201d. \u201cIt was on the Labor party\u2019s watch when they were last in government that electricity prices doubled and now they are obstructing key reforms which save money for Australian families and businesses.\u201d The government was forced to amend the package before it came to parliament because of objections from Liberals concerned that Coalition government did not, as a point of principle, pass laws breaking up private companies. After objections from backbenchers, Frydenberg adjusted the package last year to make it clear that the federal court, and not a minister, was to be the decision maker if a divestiture was to be ordered, and the package would sunset in 2025. The Senate last year also referred the package to a committee inquiry, ensuring it was impossible to pass the package in the upper house before 18 March.",

An attorney for Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax responded to reports that one of the two women accusing him of sexual assault will be meeting with the district attorney to discuss possible criminal charges. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine has the details on the federal judge ruling in the Paul Manafort case today: Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former presidential campaign chairman, was found to have intentionally made false statements to Mueller\u2019s team, the FBI and a grand jury about his dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik. The finding means that Mueller\u2019s team is no longer obliged to endorse the lighter punishment that Manafort was promised for his crimes when he agreed to cooperate with investigators and tell them the truth. Manafort denied lying. Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued the order on Wednesday evening at the federal court in Washington DC. Jackson said Mueller\u2019s team had established that Manafort lied about three disputed issues \u2013 his interactions with Kilimnik, a payment he took from a pro-Trump campaign group, and another investigation that has not been identified. Check back for the full story. With Republican leadership calling for Representative Ilhan Omar to be removed from committees, even after her apology, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made her position clear Wednesday. One of the two women who have accused Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault will meet with the district attorney to discuss possible criminal charges. Representative Ilhan Omar emerged swinging from the controversy around her tweets when she challenged Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration\u2019s new special envoy to Venezuela with a checkered political career, at Wednesday\u2019s House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. Abrams worked as an assistant secretary of state for human rights and assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs the Reagan administration, at a time US foreign policy in Latin America destabilized the region. His appointment last month raised concerns for human rights advocates. In 1991, he admitted to withholding information from Congress about the Iran-Contra affair, and was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush in 1992. Omar referenced his guilty pleas immediately on Wednesday, saying, \u201cI fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful.\u201d \u201cIf I could respond to that - \u201d Abrams said. \u201cThat was not a question,\u201d Omar said, cutting him off. Omar continued, bringing the focus to the 1981 El Mozote massacre in El Salvador, in which \u201cmore than 800 civilians, including children as young as 2 years old were brutally murdered by US-trained troops.\u201d \u201cYou later said that the US policy in El Salvador was a \u2018fabulous achievement,\u2019\u201d Omar said. \u201cYes or no: do you still think so?\u201d \u201cFrom the day that President Duarte was elected in a free election to this day, El Salvador has been a democracy,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fabulous achievement.\u201d Omar responded: \u201cYes or no: Do you think that massacre was a fabulous achievement that happened under our watch?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous question, and I will not respond to it,\u201d Abrams said, visibly agitated. \u201cYes or no?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Chairman, I am not going to respond to that kind of personal attack, which is not a question,\u201d Abrams said, but Omar pressed on, asking now about Venezuela. \u201cYes or no: would you support an armed faction within Venezuela that engages in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide if you believe they were serving US interests, as you in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua?\u201d \u201cI am not going to respond to that question,\u201d Abrams said, crossing his arms angrily. \u201cI don\u2019t think this entire line of questioning is meant to be real questions, so I will not reply. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cWhether under your watch, a genocide will take place and you will look the other way because American interests are being upheld is a fair question. The American people want to know that any time we engage a country that we think about what our actions could be and how we believe our values are being furthered. That is my question. Will you make sure that human rights are not violated and we uphold international and human rights?\u201d After trying to get his own potshots in about whether \u201cthere is a question in there,\u201d Abrams answered that upholding human rights and protecting people against genocide\u201cis always the position of the United States.\u201d Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking over for Ben Jacobs. Happy Wednesday. Congressional negotiators are expected unveil the text of compromise to keep the government open in the next few hours The legislation is expected to be voted on Thursday and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said \u201c\u2018It won\u2019t be a perfect deal but it\u2019ll be a good deal.\u201d President Donald Trump has yet to make a public statement about whether he supports the legislation. Funding for the government expires at midnight on Friday. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is joining a lobbying firm linked to former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld is expected to move towards launching a primary challenge against Donald Trump on Friday. Weld, a moderate Republican, left the GOP in 2016 to become the running mate for Libertarian Gary Johnson. He has since returned to his past party affiliation. The House approved a resolution to end U.S. aid for the Saudi-backed military coalition in Yemen by a margin of 248-177. A similar resolution passed the Senate in December but did not come up for a vote in the House before the end of the congressional session. It is expected to pass again in the Senate and could potentially spark the first veto of the Trump Adminstration. In a rare occurrence, a procedural motion to recommit passed on the floor of the House of Representatives today. These are offered by the minority party as one last opportunity to change legislation. No motion to recommit ever passed in the eight years that Republicans controlled the House. One today passed the House unanimously. It condemned anti-Semitism and efforts to delegitimize the state of Israel. The full language reads: This Motion to Recommit states it is in the national interests of the United States to combat anti-Semitism at home and abroad. With an unfortunate rise in anti-Semitism and attempts to delegitimize Israel, the United States House of Representatives must emphasize the importance of combating anti-Semitism and reject all movements that deny Israel\u2019s right to exist. It comes days after Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was condemned by Democratic leaders for \u201canti Semitic comments.\u201d Omar voted for the motion. Texas Democrat Colin Allred is not on Capitol Hill this week because he is taking paternal leave. The freshman from suburban Dallas returned home to Texas to be with his wife Alexandra in advance of the birth of their first child Jordan on Tuesday. Allred is not expected to return to Washington until the end of February. Ted Cruz is now pushing legislation to pay for a border wall by having El Chapo pay for it. Cruz has introduced a legislation that would steer all money forfeited by cartel members like Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman towards construction of a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Guzman was convicted by a jury in Brooklyn on Tuesday and faces life in federal prison. Trump says \u201cthe wall is very very on its way.\u201d He adds \u201cIt\u2019s big wall, a strong wall.\u201d He adds that in order to get past it, migrants have to be in very good shape. \u201cThey will be able to climb Mount Everest a lot easier.\u201d Trump also says he is \u201ccontinuing to review\u201d the congressional budget deal. Trump says \u201cthe prosecutors did an incredible job\u201d in the trial of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman while speaking to Major County Sheriffs and Major Cities Chiefs Association Joint Conference Bloomberg reports that Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is stepping down. Tom Barrack, a close friend of Donald Trump who chaired Trump\u2019s Inaugural Committee, apologized after dismissing criticism of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. At an event in Abu Dhabi, Barrack said \u201cSo whatever happened in Saudi Arabia, the atrocities in America are equal or worse to the atrocities in Saudi Arabia.\u201d He added \u201cThe atrocities in any autocratic country are dictated by the rule of law. So for us to dictate what we think is the moral code there when we have a young man and a regime that\u2019s trying to push themselves into 2030 I think is a mistake.\u201d In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, Barrack said: Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cwas atrocious and is inexcusable\u201d and added \u201cI apologize for not making this clear in my comments.\u201d Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is joining Turnberry Solutions, a lobbying firm linked to former Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski that is named after a Scottish golf course owned by the president. Lewandowski is also formally joining the firm, which had long operated out of a rowhouse where Lewandowski lived in Washington. The Justice Department is investigating the leak of private banking records of former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three year jail sentence in March for fraud and campaign finance violations. CNN reports: The bank transactions of Cohen became public last May when lawyer Michael Avenatti posted a memo online outlining numerous payments to Cohen from a company linked to a Russian oligarch, pharmaceutical giant Novartis, AT&amp;T, which owns CNN, and others.The payments went through Essential Consultants LLC, a shell company Cohen created that he also used to make hush money payments to Avenatti\u2019s client, adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, to silence her allegations of an affair with Trump. Trump has denied the affair. At the time, Cohen\u2019s attorney alleged his bank records were illegally obtained. If he becomes the Democratic presidential nominee Cory Booker said last night \u201che will be looking to women first\u201d to be his running mate. In an interview on MSNBC, the New Jersey Democrat said: \u201cWe have such a great field of leaders. I think that you will rarely see a Democratic ticket anymore without gender diversity, race diversity. I think it\u2019s something that we should have. So I\u2019m not going to box myself in. But should I become it, you know I\u2019ll be looking to women first.\u201d As negotiations move forward on a deal to avoid a government shutdown, Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri says that one red line for Trump is back pay for federal contractors who were out of work during the 35-day partial government shutdown in December and January. A sentencing date has been set for Sam Platten, a lobbyist with ties to Paul Manafort, who pled guilty for failing to register as a foreign agent. The prosecution of Platten stemmed from the Mueller probe and his work on behalf of Ukranian oligarch. In particular, Platten funneled money from the oligarch to buy tickets to events tied to Trump\u2019s inauguration. Mark Kelly already has picked up his first congressional endorsement in Arizona\u2019s Senate race. Tom O\u2019Halleran, a moderate Democrat representing a rural district won by Trump has endorsed him. The former astronaut is seeking to challenge appointed Republican incumbent Martha McSally in 2020. However, he still may face a primary from Reuben Gallego, a progressive three-term congressman from Phoenix. Chris Christie has interesting insights into Donald Trump\u2019s use of nicknames. Axios reports: \u201cIf he respects you, you don\u2019t get a nickname, because he\u2019s afraid what\u2019s going to come back.\u201d \u201cSo Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer gets a nickname, because [Trump] has no respect for Schumer.\u201d \u201cBut Nancy Pelosi\u2019s got no nickname. It\u2019s just Nancy. And if she doesn\u2019t have a nickname by now, she ain\u2019t getting any.\u201d Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Donald Trump still did not commit to signing legislation to avoid another partial government shutdown. Well, we haven\u2019t gotten it yet. We\u2019ll be getting it and we\u2019ll be looking for land mines\u2014because you could have that. It\u2019s been known to happen before to people. But we have not gotten it yet. It\u2019ll be sent to us at some point. And we\u2019ll take a very serious look at it. We have a lot of things happening right now. We\u2019re building a lot of wall, right now with money that we already have. When people see what we\u2019re doing, I think they\u2019ll be very surprised. We\u2019re doing a lot of work. And we have planned to do a lot of work. But I have not seen it yet. I appreciate all the work the Republicans are doing because they\u2019re really going against a radical left. It\u2019s a radical left. And they\u2019re going against it very hard and they\u2019re fighting. But we\u2019re in very good shape and we\u2019re going to take a look at it when it comes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a shutdown. A shutdown would be a terrible thing. I think a point was made with the last shutdown; people realized how bad the border is, how unsafe the border is. I think a lot of good points were made, but I don\u2019t want to see another one\u2014there\u2019s no reason for it. We\u2019re going to look at the legislation when it comes and I\u2019ll make a determination then.\u201d On a conference call with donors last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy blamed the GOP push to repeal Obamacare as the key driver behind Republicans losing the House in 2018. In particular, McCarthy pointed the finger at the hard-right Freedom Caucus which pushed to remove protections for pre-existing conditions from the bill The Washington Post reports: \u201cWhen we couldn\u2019t pass the repeal of Obamacare the first way through, an amendment came because the Freedom Caucus wouldn\u2019t vote for\u201d the original House bill, McCarthy said. \u201cThat amendment put [the] preexisting condition campaign against us, and so even people who are running for the very first time got attacked on that. And that was the defining issue and the most important issue in the race.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s account accurately describes the dynamics of passing the American Health Care Act, the Republican ACA alternative, in 2017: After an initial version of the bill was withdrawn due to opposition from both the Freedom Caucus and GOP moderates, Meadows and Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) crafted an amendment that would give states the ability to waive protections for people with preexisting conditions. After being widely condemned for anti-Semitic comments this week, Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar is now taking her frustrations out on Capitol Hill reporters. New York mayor Bill de Blasio is delaying a planned trip to New Hampshire this weekend after a police officer was murdered yesterday. De Blasio is one of a number of Democrats still mulling a presidential bid. The House is expected to pass a bipartisan spending bill to avert another government shutdown on Thursday night, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on Wednesday. The bill would then go to the Senate, where party leaders there have expressed optimism. Trump has not publicly committed to signing the agreement \u2013 but congressional leaders are hopeful and keen to note that he also hasn\u2019t publicly committed to not signing it. If the president does not sign the bill, part of the US government would shut down at midnight on Friday. Hoyer called the measure \u2013 which includes $1.375bn for new fencing along the border, far less than Trump demanded for a steel or concrete wall \u2013 a \u201creasonable compromise\u201d and expressed confidence it would easily pass the chamber. A vote would not be held until at least Thursday evening, after a funeral mass for long-serving former congressman John Dingell in Washington and to allow time for members to return from North Carolina, where a funeral service is being held for congressman Walter Jones. The Maryland Democrat, fresh from a trip to the border, emphasized that he encountered no \u201ccrisis\u201d as described by the president. Fencing, he said, should be part of a much broader solution. Asked whether there would be further repercussions for Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who apologized this week over online remarks that were widely condemned as anti-semitic, Hoyer said the conference responded \u201cstrongly\u201d and would do so again in the future. \u201cCongresswoman Omar apologized,\u201d he said. \u201cApologies are appropriate. The real test is the actions going forward. ... And frankly if that doesn\u2019t pan out there may be further actions.\u201d He rejected the comparison to congressman Steve King, a Republican from Iowa who was stripped of his committee assignments after questioning why white supremacy was offensive. \u201cCongressman King for years has been using language and taking actions which belie the values of our country and reflected adversely on his party and on the Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cHis party finally after years and years decided to take action. Very frankly, there\u2019s another member of their party who on a regular basis uses similar language and similar denigration of people, nationalities, race, disability and that\u2019s the president of the United States. \u201c Former astronaut Mark Kelly is already facing questions only a day into his run for U.S. Senate in Arizona. According to public records, Kelly voted in the 2012 Republican presidential primary. However, a spokesman told Huffington Post that Kelly voted for Obama in the general election. The Senate Rules Committee has voted to advance a proposal to speed up the process for the Senate to consider judicial nominations and limit the debate needed before a vote. Republicans have pushed this as a way to confirm even more Trump nominees on the federal bench. The House will likely vote on legislation to keep the government open tomorrow. Most Democrats and some Republicans expected to support it in the lower chamber. It will then advance to the Senate where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he supports it. It is likely to get the necessary votes there to advance to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk who can either sign it or veto it. Trump has not given clear signals about the legislation but a veto would lead to another government shutdown and place the burden on his shoulders. The Washington Post reports that Donald Trump has installed \u201ca room sized golf simulator\u201d in the White House Per the Post: President Trump has installed a room-sized \u201cgolf simulator\u201d game at the White House, which allows him to play virtual rounds at courses all over the world by hitting a ball into a large video screen, according to two people told about the system. That system replaced an older, less sophisticated golf simulator that had been installed under President Obama, according to two people with knowledge of the previous system. Trump\u2019s system cost about $50,000, and was put in during the last few weeks in a room in his personal quarters, a White House official said A former Air Force intelligence agent has been charged with defecting to Iran. In an indictment, the government says Monica Elfriede Witt defected to Iran and aided the Revolutionary Guard in targeting the United States. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer says the text of the government funding bill will be available later this afternoon and that it would likely be voted on Thursday. Democrats are recruiting Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot who lost a 2018 congressional race, to run again Mitch McConnell in 2020. McGrath received national attention when she launched a campaign with a web video about her career as an Marine pilot. However, she would face an uphill race against McConnell in the deep red state of Kentucky. McConnell, who was first elected in 1984, has built a formidable political machine in his home state which Trump won handily in 2016. Although it looks like a deal to fund the government past February 15 and avoid another shutdown is progressing, there are still some snags. One of them is whether federal contractors should get back pay from the 35 day partial shutdown in December and January. Although federal workers have received backpay, contractors have not. Elizabeth Warren has formally announced a campaign manager. Days after officially launching her campaign and six weeks after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren has named veteran operative Roger Lau to be her campaign manager. Lau had previously been her campaign manager on her 2018 re-election bid for the Senate. Mitch McConnell appears to back the deal to keep the government open. He told reporters today \u201cIt won\u2019t be a perfect deal but it\u2019ll be a good deal.\u201d President Donald Trump may have just invoked, either intentionally or unintentionally, a long running Internet meme on Twitter. Progressive groups are launching an effort to draft Congressman Reuben Gallego to run for Senate in Arizona. Gallego, a three-term congressman who served in Iraq, has long been considered a rising star in Arizona politics and a potential statewide candidate. However, his trajectory was upset when Mark Kelly, an astronaut and husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, announced his candidacy Tuesday for the seat. The seat is currently held by appointed incumbent Martha McSally and the race in November 2020 would be a special election to fill the remaining two years of the term that the late John McCain was first elected to in 2016. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg is prepared to spend at least $500 million of his fortune to defeat Donald Trump in 2020. Bloomberg is mulling a presidential campaign but is prepared to spend that sum regardless of if he runs. Politico reports: Bloomberg has not yet announced whether he will run in the Democratic primary. If he runs, he will use that half-billion-dollar stake \u2014 roughly $175 million more than the Trump campaign spent over the course of the entire 2016 election cycle \u2014 to fuel his campaign through the 2020 primary season, with the expectation that the sum represents a floor, not a ceiling, on his potential spending. If Bloomberg declines to seek the presidency, his intention is to run an unprecedented data-heavy campaign designed to operate as a shadow political party for the eventual Democratic nominee. Kamala Harris has made two more hires in the crucial early state of Iowa. The Des Moines Register reports: California Sen. Kamala Harris is hiring Zack Davis and Nora Walsh-DeVries to help lead Iowa operations for her 2020 presidential run. Harris\u2019 campaign announced Tuesday that Davis will serve as the Democrat\u2019s Iowa senior advisor and Walsh-DeVries as Iowa political director. Davis recently served as state director for Let America Vote, and before that he was state director for NextGen Climate in 2016. Davis also worked for Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 Iowa campaigns. Walsh-DeVries recently served as Iowa outreach director for Need to Vote and she was campaign manager for Iowa gubernatorial candidate John Norris during the 2018 cycle. She also worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign during the 2016 cycle. Speaking to reporters outside the White House this morning, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was equivocal about whether Trump would support the deal to avoid a government shutdown \u201cWe want to see what the final piece of legislation looks like. It\u2019s hard to say definitively whether or not the president is going to sign it until we know everything that\u2019s in it. Unlike Nancy Pelosi we actually like to read legislation before we agree to it. The president isn\u2019t fully happy, as he said yesterday with everything that\u2019s in the legislation but there are some positive pieces of it.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day the president is going to build the wall\u201d The mayor of Edmond, Oklahoma could be re-elected after dying last year. Charles Lamb, who died last year, made it into a runoff yesterday against former mayor Dan O\u2019Neil. Deceased candidates have won a number of elections in the past. Most recently, Dennis Hof, a Nevada brothel owner, was elected to the state house in November 2018. Hof had died the month before. A former top Trump aide is subpoenaing journalists as part of a lawsuit. Jason Miller, a former top Trump campaign aide, has subpoenaed J. Arthur Bloom, a former Daily Caller reporter, in a defamation lawsuit over a story that reported a claim that Miller impregnated a stripper and then unwittingly gave her a pill to cause her to miscarry. Miller denied the allegation and filed a lawsuit against the person who reported the claim. Bloom told The Daily Beast he will not comply with the subpoena. Former Vermont governor Howard Dean will lead a new Democratic exchange for voter data. The exchange has come about after long internal wrangling within the party about how to keep its tech infrastructure up to date. The Associated Press reports: In an interview with The Associated Press, Dean confirmed that he\u2019s signed on to lead a planned data exchange hammered out by DNC officials, state party leaders and Democratic consultants. The agreement still requires the expected approval from state party leaders gathering Wednesday in Washington, but it would end more than 18 months of internal party wrangling that has dogged DNC Chairman Tom Perez amid fights over money and control. \u201cThis is a big breakthrough,\u201d Dean said. \u201cThis is a model we\u2019ve needed, and Republicans have it already. I\u2019d sort of given up that we could get it done.\u201d The arrangement would allow the national party, state parties and independent political action groups on the left to share voter data in real time during campaigns. That means, for example, that a field worker for a congressional campaign in Iowa and another for an independent political action committee knocking on doors in Florida could update a master voter file essentially as they work. When a presidential campaign spends big money on consumer data to update voter profiles, the new information would go into the file as well. And all participating organizations would have access to the latest information. Good morning. We are less than 72 hours from another government shutdown as congressional negotiators continue to hammer out details of a deal to fund the government and President Donald Trump will meet with Ivan Duque Marquez of Colombia today. It\u2019s Wednesday in American politics.",

Shamima Begum, 19, said she fled the jihadists\u2019 last remaining enclave in Baghuz, eastern Syria, as she was tired of life on a battlefield and feared for her unborn child after her two other children died. \u201cI was weak,\u201d she told the Times from the al-Hawl refugee camp in north-eastern Syria. \u201cI could not endure the suffering and hardship that staying on the battlefield involved. But I was also frightened that the child I am about to give birth to would die like my other children if I stayed on. So I fled the caliphate. Now all I want to do is come home to Britain.\u201d She and two of her fellow Bethnal Green academy pupils, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, made headlines when they flew from Gatwick to Turkey in February 2015, then entered Syria. Begum and Abase were both 15, while Sultana was 16. They had told their parents they were simply going out for the day. The Guardian understands the Begum family believe the woman identified in the Syrian camp is Shamima. Begum told the Times she initially settled in Raqqa where she married a Dutch convert after three weeks. She said life there alternated between normality and atrocity, and added that the sight of a \u201cbeheaded head\u201d in a bin had not fazed her. \u201cMostly it was a normal life in Raqqa, every now and then bombing and stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I saw my first severed head in a bin it didn\u2019t faze me at all. It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam.\u201d She said Sultana and Abase, along with another young woman, Sharmeena Begum, also from Bethnal Green \u2013 who travelled to Syria two months before the trio and is not a relative of Begum\u2019s \u2013 had also married foreign Isis fighters. Sultana was reported to have died in 2016 in an airstrike on Raqqa, and Begum confirmed this in the interview. She gave a conflicting account of the so-called caliphate. \u201cThere was so much oppression and corruption that I don\u2019t think they deserved victory,\u201d she said. However, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t regret coming here.\u201d Begum said her family had moved down the Euphrates valley as Isis retreated, eventually ending up in its final stronghold of Baghuz. But after the deaths of her one-year-old daughter and three-month-old son in recent months from illness and malnutrition she decided to flee. She left Baghuz two weeks ago along a three-mile long corridor east of Baghuz. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters allied to the Syrian Democratic Forces and she has not seen him since, according to the Times. She said Sharmeena Begum and Abase were believed to have remained in Isis\u2019s final stronghold. \u201cI heard from other women only two weeks ago that the two were still alive in Baghuz,\u201d Shamima Begum said. \u201cBut with all the bombing, I am not sure whether they have survived. \u201cThey were strong \u2026 I respect their decision.

Shamima Begum\u2019s emergence, pregnant with her third child, poses a dilemma for the Foreign Office first as to whether she could be offered consular assistance, and possibly helped out of the camp the Times found her in.

      "bodyText": "Paul Manafort lied about his interactions with an alleged Russian intelligence operative even after agreeing to cooperate with Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry, a judge ruled on Wednesday. Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former presidential campaign chairman, was found to have breached his plea deal by making false statements to the special counsel\u2019s team, the FBI and a grand jury about his dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik. The finding means that Mueller\u2019s team is no longer obliged to endorse the lighter punishment that Manafort was promised for his crimes when he agreed to cooperate with investigators and tell them the truth. Manafort denied lying. Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued the order on Wednesday evening at the federal court in Washington. Jackson said Mueller\u2019s team had established that Manafort lied about three disputed issues \u2013 his interactions with Kilimnik, a payment he took from a pro-Trump campaign group and another investigation that has not been identified. She said Mueller\u2019s team had failed to establish that Manafort lied on two other subjects \u2013 his recent contacts with Trump administration officials, and Kilimnik\u2019s role in a conspiracy to obstruct justice for which they were both indicted. Mueller is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at boosting Trump\u2019s bid for the White House, and any coordination between Russian operatives and Trump\u2019s team. Manafort, 69, was accused by Mueller of lying about the fact he had shared polling data on the 2016 election with Kilimnik, a former colleague on election campaigns for pro-Kremlin politicians in eastern Europe. Manafort is also said to have misled investigators about plans that he and Kilimnik were developing for a settlement relating to Russia\u2019s aggressive actions in Ukraine. Kilimnik, 48, trained at a university connected to Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, formerly known as the GRU, which allegedly spearheaded the Kremlin\u2019s effort to disrupt the US election in 2016. Mueller has also previously said that Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s deputy on the Trump campaign, described Kilimnik as \u201ca former Russian intelligence officer with the GRU\u201d. Kilimnik denies that characterization. The special counsel moved to tear up Manafort\u2019s plea deal in November, alleging that the former campaign chairman had breached the agreement by continuing to lie. Mueller said the lies amounted to new crimes. Manafort was known to have met Kilimnik twice during 2016. He passed the polling data to Kilimnik during an August meeting in New York, according to investigators. Mueller\u2019s team also found Manafort met Kilimnik in Spain during 2017. Manafort\u2019s attorneys strenuously denied that he had intentionally misled the investigators. They said he could not remember some details and worked to promptly clarify any misstatements. His attorneys did not deny that Manafort gave Kilimnik the polling data, instead stating that he had not lied about it but was merely \u201cunable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed\u201d. As part of the plea deal struck last September, Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice, in relation to unregistered lobbying work for pro-Russian politicians. Other charges against him were dropped. By then, Manafort had been convicted of eight criminal counts in a separate fraud case brought against him by Mueller in Virginia.",

      "bodyText": "The former One Nation senator Brian Burston has denied allegations that he sexually harassed a staff member and retaliated against Pauline Hanson, his former party leader, by accusing her of making unwanted advances towards him. After Hanson used a speech in the Senate on Tuesday night to accuse an unnamed senator of \u201cserious sexual harassment\u201d, Burston confirmed that he was the politician involved. But Burston has since hit back at Hanson by accusing her of sexually harassing him, claims the One Nation leader has rubbished as untrue and laughable. Tensions appeared to reach breaking point when Burston was involved in a physical clash with Hanson\u2019s adviser James Ashby in Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday night. The pair\u2019s altercation near the great hall was captured on video, and Burston appeared with a bandaged hand in the Senate on Thursday. Burston claims Ashby approached him as he and his wife were leaving a function. He claims he was injured when he tried to grab a phone Ashby was waving in his face. \u201cI told him to fuck off,\u201d Burston told News Corp. \u201cI lost it.\u201d Guardian Australia has seen a complaint of sexual harassment made against Burston late last year, as part of a settled unfair dismissal claim. The complaint alleges that Burston made an inappropriate advance on a distressed staff member. She said he had asked whether he could \u201c\u2018fuck\u2019 me to make things better\u201d. \u201cI refused his approach, but inside my world shattered,\u201d she said. A spokeswoman for Burston denied that the senator propositioned the staff member, stressing that a 70-year old man would not use the word \u201cfuck\u201d. Asked if the former staffer had lodged a Fair Work Commission complaint, the spokeswoman replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d Burston interjected that the allegations were \u201call bullshit\u201d and \u201cgarbage\u201d. He said Hanson \u2013 whom he described as \u201ca woman scorned\u201d \u2013 was engaging in payback because he left One Nation over other issues, including the party\u2019s stance on company tax. Burston\u2019s wife, Ros, corroborated the denial of Burston\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cMy husband never says fuck,\u201d she said. Hanson\u2019s Tuesday night speech accused an unnamed senator of sexual harassment and said the matter was \u201cunder investigation\u201d by an unnamed entity. \u201cWhat is disappointing is that this parliament has allowed the horrible treatment of staff to continue without this senator being forced to go through some form of training to prevent poor treatment of his employees,\u201d Hanson said in the Senate. Burston\u2019s spokeswoman said to expect a \u201cbombshell\u201d on Thursday evening in the Senate adjournment debate, when Burston is expected to take aim at the Hanson and her One Nation colleague Peter Georgiou. Burston told News Corp on Wednesday night that one of the reasons he had left One Nation was because of sexual harassment from Hanson. \u201cRight back when we had our first One Nation AGM at the Rooty Hill RSL [in 1998], that was the first time she hit on me,\u201d he said. He claimed that Hanson \u201crubbed her fingers up my spine\u201d while listening to the national anthem and she had propositioned him after he was elected in 2016, at her home in Queensland and in Canberra. Hanson dismissed the accusations. \u201cI\u2019m 64 \u2026 but I tell you what, I\u2019m not that desperate,\u201d she told Sky News. Burston and Hanson fell out bitterly before Burston left One Nation last June. The tensions manifested months earlier when Hanson picked Malcolm Roberts as the party\u2019s No 1 Senate pick in Queensland. Burston split with his leader on the government\u2019s company tax cut bill, a move she saw as a stab in the back. He eventually quit the party to sit as an independent, and is now aligned with the United Australia party.",

Similar proportions plan to raise charges and fees.</p> <p>Despite council tax bills soaring, many residents face further cuts in services. Most councils warned that they would be reducing a range of services, from adult social care to libraries and recycling.</p> <p>The annual survey by the Local Government Information Unit thinktank found that cuts were increasingly visible and that after eight years of austerity \u2013 which has cost English councils 40% of their central funding \u2013 half of councils felt cuts were now \u201cnegatively affecting relationships with citizens\u201d.</p> <p>Cuts to services such as pothole repair, waste collection, school crossing patrols and libraries proved especially unpopular, the research found.

      "bodyText": "Almost all councils in England plan to increase council tax from April and three-quarters intend to raise it above 2.75%, research reveals. The maximum rise allowed without a local referendum is 2.99%. Similar proportions plan to raise charges and fees. Despite council tax bills soaring, many residents face further cuts in services. Most councils warned that they would be reducing a range of services, from adult social care to libraries and recycling. The annual survey by the Local Government Information Unit thinktank found that cuts were increasingly visible and that after eight years of austerity \u2013 which has cost English councils 40% of their central funding \u2013 half of councils felt cuts were now \u201cnegatively affecting relationships with citizens\u201d. Cuts to services such as pothole repair, waste collection, school crossing patrols and libraries proved especially unpopular, the research found. Last week Somerset and Northamptonshire county councils reversed winter gritting cuts after a public outcry when untreated roads caused several car accidents during the recent cold snap. One in 20 councils said they were concerned that funding cuts were now so deep that they would struggle to deliver the legal minimum level of services. Almost one in 10 anticipate legal challenges from the public against proposed cuts in service provision. The survey found 80% of councils have no confidence that the current model of local government finance is sustainable. More than half have drawn down reserves to stay afloat. More than three-quarters have borrowed cash to invest in commercial property in the hope the returns will cover budget gaps. \u201cNow more than ever we need a thriving, resilient local government sector to weather the storm of national uncertainty, but years of chronic underfunding has left local government on life support,\u201d said the chief executive of the thinktank, Dr Jonathan Carr-West. Councils are increasingly concerned over the instability of their finances, amid fears that up to 15 authorities may follow Northamptonshire county council into insolvency. Others fear that the cost of balancing the budget will come at the expense of vital services. Cllr Richard Watts, the chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s resources board, said: \u201cThis survey illustrates the severity of the challenge facing councils, with government grant funding at the lowest it has been for decades at the same time as demand for services, such as adult social care, children\u2019s services and homelessness support, has grown.\u201d Nearly a third of councils (29%) were planning cuts from April in adult social care, 24% plan to reduce children\u2019s care services, 16% to reduce special education and disability support, one in 10 plan to cut homelessness support and nearly a fifth will cut grants to the local Citizens Advice bureaux.

One rather hopes not, if this car crash of forced collaboration, muddled thinking and hasty installation art is anything to go by.</p> <p>The show takes as its premise the idea that a hugely influential, agenda-setting exhibition staged 63 years ago might be re-created for the present day with just as much impact. The original spectacle, titled <a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/this-is-tomorrow/\">This Is Tomorrow</a>, opened at the Whitechapel in 1956, then a gritty outpost in London\u2019s wild <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2018/feb/13/east-end-in-colour-london-david-granick\">East End</a>.</p> <p>It was a landmark event, helping to launch the careers of its thirtysomething participants, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/07/richard-hamilton-called-him-daddy-pop\">pop artists Richard Hamilton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/23/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Eduardo Paolozzi</a>, to architects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/08/urbandesign.artsobituaries\">Alison and Peter Smithson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/20/james-stirling-tate-britain-drawings\">James Stirling</a>. It has since been the subject of endless PhDs, reconstructions and revisions, taking on an aura as a seminal moment in the development of the modern British psyche. So the stage was set for the inevitable finale: the re-enactment.</p> <p>The chief difference between the original and the homage is that many of the former\u2019s participants already knew each other and had something interesting to say. In other words, there was a reason for the exhibition to happen. By contrast, the motivations for the current show betray a pining nostalgia for the past and loss of confidence in the present.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"564d40a1be27e0ce439b5bf8263a3d89d382f8a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/564d40a1be27e0ce439b5bf8263a3d89d382f8a7/0_0_4000_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Participating artists and architects (left to right) Rana Begum, Rachel Armstrong, Zhao Liqun, Pablo Alfonso Resales Abad, Miguel Esteban, Marina Tabassum, David Kohn, Andres Jaque, Kapwani Kiwanga, Owen Wilson, Hardeep Pandhal, Simon Fujiwara, Cecile B Evans and Nicholas Lobo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creative blind dates \u2026 (left to right) Rana Begum, Rachel Armstrong, Zhao Liqun, Pablo Alfonso Resales Abad, Miguel Esteban, Marina Tabassum, David Kohn, Andres Jaque, Kapwani Kiwanga, Owen Watson, Hardeep Pandhal, Simon Fujiwara, Cecile B Evans and Nicholas Lobo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Spicer/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of this is intentional. The flipping of the title implies that all is not well: this is a show of speculation and trepidation, not emphatic proclamations about what\u2019s coming next. While the postwar mood was one of optimism, with the end of rationing, the launch of wholesale reconstruction projects and the foundation of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/series/nhs-at-70\">free health service</a>, the present outlook is significantly more bleak. In a world of Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/europe-brexit-britain-state-politics-fit-for-purpose\">Brexit</a>, right-wing populism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\">environmental armageddon</a>, we have more worries than ever. One of them is how to make a meaningful group show out of artists\u2019 and architects\u2019 competing ambitions.</p> <p>Curator Lydia Yee began by asking a handful of participants who they would be interested in working with, the result being a kind of creative blind date where few of the participants knew each other. Her choices were good, and considerably broader than the 1956 show, cutting a cross-section through some of the most interesting architects and artists working today around the world, hailing from Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France, Germany, Iran, Mexico, Spain, Tanzania and the US. There are also considerably more women than the mostly white male line-up in the original show.</p> <p>Each pairing was given a budget of \u00a310,000 and a dangerously open brief to make something vaguely relating to the future. The result is the ragbag you might expect, with some provocative things in the mix, but a general sense of incoherence.</p> <p>Amalia Pica and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/25/churchill-college-cowan-court-review-cambridge-university-6a-architects\">6a architects</a> have built a holding pen for visitors made of sheep fencing, herding gallery-goers into a little obstacle course that sees them crawling through gates, on to a weighing scale and into a fold populated with farmyard toys. It feels like a wry comment on the modern gallery experience, as well as being a useful place to leave the kids while you see the rest of the show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5667d6cc91a193ed2df4476a87f1eb897f490363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5667d6cc91a193ed2df4476a87f1eb897f490363/0_0_4000_2654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phoenix Will Rise by Rana Begum and Marina Tabassum Architects.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phoenix Will Rise by Rana Begum and Marina Tabassum Architects.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Spicer/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their agricultural maze zigzags around a faceted star-shaped pavilion by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/28/david-adjaye-architect-holocaust-memorial-british-ghanaian\">David Adjaye</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/03/frieze-new-york-art-fair-political\">Kapwani Kiwanga</a>, whose walls of dichroic glass form a pastel rainbow of reflections as you pass around and through it.

It\u2019s a heady cocktail, but worth watching the whole video for a sideways look at some of the stranger invisible forces shaping Manhattan\u2019s skyline.</p> <p>Upstairs, you find a scaffolding frame from which some oversized Meccano components dangle, the result of a collaboration via Skype between <a href=\"https://frieze.com/article/mariana-castillo-deball-looks-method-mania\">Mariana Castillo Deball</a> and <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/office/tatiana-bilbao\">Tatiana Bilbao</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Is This Tomorrow?\u201d asks a new exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery. One rather hopes not, if this car crash of forced collaboration, muddled thinking and hasty installation art is anything to go by. The show takes as its premise the idea that a hugely influential, agenda-setting exhibition staged 63 years ago might be re-created for the present day with just as much impact. The original spectacle, titled This Is Tomorrow, opened at the Whitechapel in 1956, then a gritty outpost in London\u2019s wild East End. It was a landmark event, helping to launch the careers of its thirtysomething participants, from pop artists Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi, to architects Alison and Peter Smithson and James Stirling. It has since been the subject of endless PhDs, reconstructions and revisions, taking on an aura as a seminal moment in the development of the modern British psyche. So the stage was set for the inevitable finale: the re-enactment. The chief difference between the original and the homage is that many of the former\u2019s participants already knew each other and had something interesting to say. In other words, there was a reason for the exhibition to happen. By contrast, the motivations for the current show betray a pining nostalgia for the past and loss of confidence in the present. Some of this is intentional. The flipping of the title implies that all is not well: this is a show of speculation and trepidation, not emphatic proclamations about what\u2019s coming next. While the postwar mood was one of optimism, with the end of rationing, the launch of wholesale reconstruction projects and the foundation of a free health service, the present outlook is significantly more bleak. In a world of Trump, Brexit, right-wing populism and environmental armageddon, we have more worries than ever. One of them is how to make a meaningful group show out of artists\u2019 and architects\u2019 competing ambitions. Curator Lydia Yee began by asking a handful of participants who they would be interested in working with, the result being a kind of creative blind date where few of the participants knew each other. Her choices were good, and considerably broader than the 1956 show, cutting a cross-section through some of the most interesting architects and artists working today around the world, hailing from Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France, Germany, Iran, Mexico, Spain, Tanzania and the US. There are also considerably more women than the mostly white male line-up in the original show. Each pairing was given a budget of \u00a310,000 and a dangerously open brief to make something vaguely relating to the future. The result is the ragbag you might expect, with some provocative things in the mix, but a general sense of incoherence. Amalia Pica and 6a architects have built a holding pen for visitors made of sheep fencing, herding gallery-goers into a little obstacle course that sees them crawling through gates, on to a weighing scale and into a fold populated with farmyard toys. It feels like a wry comment on the modern gallery experience, as well as being a useful place to leave the kids while you see the rest of the show. Their agricultural maze zigzags around a faceted star-shaped pavilion by David Adjaye and Kapwani Kiwanga, whose walls of dichroic glass form a pastel rainbow of reflections as you pass around and through it. It is a pleasing and elegantly made thing, but would perhaps feel more at home at a furniture fair. A dose of subversive mischief comes from Andr\u00e9s Jaque and Jacolby Satterwhite, who have built a big black mountain of gloopy foam and plastic flowers, in which a series of monitors play a stream of consciousness collage on the unlikely intersection of high-end real estate, Grindr, pornography and pollution displacement in New York. It\u2019s a heady cocktail, but worth watching the whole video for a sideways look at some of the stranger invisible forces shaping Manhattan\u2019s skyline. Upstairs, you find a scaffolding frame from which some oversized Meccano components dangle, the result of a collaboration via Skype between Mariana Castillo Deball and Tatiana Bilbao. Something appears to have been lost in translation, or maybe the wifi broke. The promising pairing of Rana Begum and Marina Tabassum next door is also disappointing, consisting of a banal white box with a circular roof light cut out, clad with spray-painted crumpled metal. Like many of the other pairings, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It often feels as if each party thought the other one was in charge \u2013 the result being that the responsibility fell between two stools. Just as you might be about to give up, a piece comes along that makes the exhibition worth visiting. Simon Fujiwara (an artist who first trained as an architect) and David Kohn (an architect who frequently collaborates with artists) have concocted an exquisitely crafted model of their imaginary museum for the most hyped artwork in history: The Salvator Mundi Experience. Duck your head inside their doll\u2019s-house world to be treated to a dedicated attraction where the story of the long-lost \u201cmale Mona Lisa\u201d is re-enacted step by step, from the Room of Rediscovery, recreating the staircase scene where the painting by Leonardo da Vinci was spotted, to a restoration studio mock-up, to the Christie\u2019s Experience. There is also a suite of galleries dedicated to how the artwork \u2013 which was auctioned for $450m in 2017 \u2013 might be displayed and interpreted for the social media generation, including a wall-size screen that responds to visitors\u2019 facial expressions, reducing the holy visage to an interactive Instagram filter. It beautifully skewers the commodification of the painting, the role of the mega-museum, and the strange future of the multimedia visitor experience \u2013 depicting a world that very much is tomorrow, whether we like it or not. \u2022 Is This Tomorrow? is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, until 12 May.",

If someone fluffed a line or got someone\u2019s name wrong or said something stupid, it was mortifying. But nowadays, those are the sort of people who are given jobs on TV.\u201d</p> <p>He likened Partridge to presenters such as Piers Morgan. \u201cThe producers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/16/good-morning-britain-piers-morgan-itv\">Good Morning Britain</a> are not tearing their hair out thinking: \u2018I wish he\u2019d stop saying something offensive.\u2019 They\u2019re thinking: \u2018That\u2019s why he\u2019s on the show.\u2019 We had to ignore that, because if you put Alan in a world where his crass buffoonery is part of the selling point, there\u2019s nowhere for him to fall.\u201d</p> <p><em>This Time with Alan Partridge starts on BBC</em><em> One on 25 February at 9.30pm</em></p>",

In fact, Partridge is so familiar to fans the production can essentially rest on its laurels. \u201cYou can just remove all the comedy and have Alan looking seriously at the camera,\u201d said Neil Gibbons, and be left with nothing more than \u201cthe anticipation of what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d The magazine show format lets viewers see Partridge\u2019s rambles during live takes, as well as between-takes shots of his ego being soothed by Lynn, his long-suffering assistant. It also features Partridgean tirades on everything from hand hygiene (leading him to lurk outside the BBC toilets doing spot-checks on colleagues) to hacking. There was one distinct problem of putting him in that setup, though, said Gibbons: \u201cIn the early days of Alan, there was a tightrope he was walking because there was an expectation of professionalism. If someone fluffed a line or got someone\u2019s name wrong or said something stupid, it was mortifying. But nowadays, those are the sort of people who are given jobs on TV.\u201d He likened Partridge to presenters such as Piers Morgan. \u201cThe producers of Good Morning Britain are not tearing their hair out thinking: \u2018I wish he\u2019d stop saying something offensive.\u2019 They\u2019re thinking: \u2018That\u2019s why he\u2019s on the show.\u2019 We had to ignore that, because if you put Alan in a world where his crass buffoonery is part of the selling point, there\u2019s nowhere for him to fall.\u201d This Time with Alan Partridge starts on BBC One on 25 February at 9.30pm",
