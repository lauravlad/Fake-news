The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced on Thursday it was launching an enforcement process which could lead to a formal investigation. Corbyn said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Racism, religious bigotry and misogyny have no place whatsoever in any part of our movement. And we will root out antisemitism in our party, and in society at large.

But he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Where he is completely wrong is we can\u2019t resolve these issues with Brexit because Brexit makes delivery on them that much harder.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and for all the comments. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: While he said Labour should focus its fire on the Conservatives, Jeremy Corbyn said he was \u201cutterly determined\u201d to rid the Labour party of antisemitism during his speech in Dundee. Corbyn also said the \u201creal divide in our society\u201d is about poverty and class and called on his own party to unite. The Labour peer, Lord Falconer, said he would not lead an investigation into antisemitism if the EHRC opened its own. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, set out a proposal on the backstop that was quickly shot down by the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay. The DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds also rejected it, saying it represented \u201cnothing new\u201d. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events here. And, for those wanting to read more, my colleagues Peter Walker, Daniel Boffey and Heather Stewart have the full story: Lord Falconer, the Labour peer who has been in negotiations with the party about being appointed to examine its handling of antisemitism cases, has said he would take a step back if the Equality and Human Rights Commission decided to hold its own formal investigation. He has told Jewish News: In light of the commission coming in, I think we\u2019ve got to put it on hold, see what the commission is going to do. If they are minded to do an investigation, they will have a range of statutory powers to get documents, emails, Whatsapp messages and witnesses, and they will do an investigation that will be completely independent from the Labour party. So there is no point in me, with my firm of solicitors, coming in and doing exactly the same thing because it won\u2019t carry the same degree of statutory support as the commission has. Michel Barnier\u2019s proposal on the backstop has not gone down well with the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, who has tweeted: Nor was it particularly popular with the Brexit-supporting DUP, whose deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, had this to say: The EU\u2019s chief negotiator outlined his ideas in a series of tweets following Theresa May\u2019s speech earlier today: A little more from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech in Dundee. He has insisted he is \u201cutterly determined\u201d to rid the Labour party of antisemitism. He said that, rather than fighting within itself, his party should turn its fire on the Tories, whom he criticised for their \u201cdesperate\u201d handling of Brexit negotiations and austerity policies. With Labour struggling to deal with complaints of antisemitism, he said the party \u201cmust lead the fight against all types of racism\u201d. The only thing that can hold us back is if we were to turn our fire on each other rather than on the Tory government and the wealthy establishment interests they represent. His speech came after an equality watchdog began enforcement action that could lead to it gaining access to internal communications between staff handling complaints. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced on Thursday it was launching an enforcement process which could lead to a formal investigation. Corbyn said: Racism, religious bigotry and misogyny have no place whatsoever in any part of our movement. And we will root out antisemitism in our party, and in society at large. And I am utterly determined to achieve that. He said it was important to return Labour to power both at Westminster and at Holyrood, so the party could deliver \u201creal change\u201d. To get there, we as a party have to be united. That doesn\u2019t mean we have no room for debate and disagreement, discussion. They are the lifeblood of our democracy. But there is no justification for the abuse of anybody. Responding to the Guardian\u2019s investigation, which has found teachers are cleaning and paying for books and pens to plug the gaps in school funding, the Lib Dems\u2019 education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, has said: We are clearly in the midst of a crisis over school funding and these revelations must result in direct action by the Conservatives. This investigation should shame the Tory government. With teachers covering for cleaners and parents donating money for essential services there is no way Conservative ministers can deny there is a lack of funding for our schools. The secretary of state must begin an urgent listening exercise with frontline staff and reverse the budget cuts pursued after coalition, otherwise this crisis will only get worse. To fail to act is to leave both teachers and children in the midst of what is clearly a crisis. You can read the full story here: A disabled MP has said she has to continuously fight with parliamentary authorities to get the support she needs to do her job. During a debate on International Women\u2019s Day, Marsha De Cordova said she has been denied the help she needs, adding: \u201cIt has made it very difficult for me.\u201d The Labour MP for Battersea and shadow disabilities minister said the House of Commons is \u201cthe one place where equality should be\u201d and where people \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to fight for the support they need\u201d. She was talking about the inequalities women still face in 2019, saying they are \u201cso much worse for working class women, for black women, women from ethnic minorities, and like myself, disabled women\u201d. And it is as a disabled woman that I want to just share something. I have faced many barriers in my life, many barriers in education, the workplace and so forth. So, actually getting elected here was a huge achievement, but unfortunately obtaining the additional support that I need in this place to operate and function as an MP has been challenging. I\u2019m having to continuously fight for additional support. De Cordova said the authorities know she has additional needs but said they told her they would not support them. It has made it very difficult for me. I should be here, the people of Battersea have sent me to represent them, I shouldn\u2019t be fighting the authorities here to get the additional support that I need. But I will fight on, because that is what I have had to do throughout all of my life, to continue to fight. A House of Commons spokesman has said: It is vital that all democratically elected MPs are able to carry out their duties in and around Parliament, and we are very sorry to hear that Ms De Cordova has found it difficult to get adequate support from parliamentary authorities. We have provided tailored support and tools to Ms De Cordova and are committed to addressing any outstanding concerns. Eleven candidates have been confirmed for the upcoming Newport West by-election following the death of the Labour MP, Paul Flynn. Newport city council published the full list of parliamentary candidates on Friday evening for the vote, which will be held on 4 April and will represent the first electoral test following the UK\u2019s planned exit from the EU on 29 March. The city has traditionally been a safe seat for Labour, but the result will be seen by commentators as a sign of how party support has been affected by Brexit, for which Newport voted by 56% to 44%. The confirmed candidates are: Labour \u2013 Ruth Jones Conservatives \u2013 Matthew Evans Ukip \u2013 Neil Hamilton Plaid Cymru \u2013 Jonathan Clark Welsh Liberal Democrats \u2013 Ryan Jones Green Party \u2013 Amelia Womack Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party \u2013 Richard Suchorzewski Renew \u2013 June Davies SDP \u2013 Ian McLean The For Britain Movement \u2013 Hugh Nicklin Democrats and Veterans Party \u2013 Phillip Taylor Flynn held the Newport West seat for 32 years and had a majority of 5,658 (13% of those who voted in 2017). Here are some more details from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech to the Scottish Labour conference in Dundee. Advance excerpts had indicated he would seek to downplay the significance of the battles over crises over Brexit and Scottish independence by claiming \u201cthe real divide in our society\u201d is about poverty and class and by focusing on climate change as one of the most pressing issues facing the UK. My colleague, Severin Carrell, was at the conference and reports that the Labour leader has told delegates: It\u2019s working class communities that suffer the worst pollution and the worst air quality. It\u2019s working class people who will lose their jobs as resources run dry. And it is working class people who will be left behind as the rich escape rising sea levels. Big corporations will never do anything serious about it. The Conservative government will never do anything serious about it either. But Labour will make it a central objective of our industrial strategy. We need to reduce our net emissions to zero by 2050 at the latest - it\u2019s not just an ecological priority, it\u2019s a socialist priority too. Some of Labour\u2019s pro-EU parliamentarians believe Corbyn\u2019s remarks were designed to highlight his hostility to the anti-Brexit forces within the party. Ian Murray, a Scottish Labour MP at the forefront of the pro-Europe campaign, said Corbyn was right to point out poverty and climate had been overshadowed by Brexit. But he added: Where he is completely wrong is we can\u2019t resolve these issues with Brexit because Brexit makes delivery on them that much harder. His timing is off. The most meaningful vote on Brexit, the biggest vote in parliamentary history, is next Tuesday. So we need laser-like focus on that please, and the rest we can deal with later. Stephen Doughty, a pro-referendum Welsh Labour backbencher, said Brexit is a \u201cright-wing Tory project that threatens communities that depend on Labour. [There] is no such thing as a Labour Brexit or a jobs-first Brexit\u201d. \u2022 Theresa May has urged parliament to \u201cget it done\u201d and back her Brexit deal, in an impassioned speech that offered no new concessions for wavering MPs before next week\u2019s crucial vote. Speaking at a dockside warehouse in the pro-leave town of Grimsby, May repeatedly declined to accept any personal responsibility for the ongoing uncertainty or give any clues as to what she would do if the vote was lost. The speech prompted a withering response from the CBI, whose deputy head said the prime minister\u2019s message was \u201cnot good enough\u201d. \u2022 The EU has made a counter offer to Theresa May in what would effectively result in a border being drawn in the Irish Sea, a scenario which the British government has already ruled out. The prime minister\u2019s apparent attempt to apportion the blame on the state of the negotiations to the EU left senior figures in Brussels deeply unimpressed. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said that he was confused by her suggestion that \u201cone more push\u201d by the EU could win the House of Commons around to the deal. \u201cThe Brexit date is getting ever closer. The ball is still rolling toward the cliffs of Dover,\u201d he said. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn has said poverty and climate change are far greater priorities for Labour and the country than Brexit. In advance excerpts of a speech to the Scottish Labour conference, Corbyn said his party was not \u201cobsessed by constitutional questions like the others are. We\u2019re obsessed with tackling the problems people face in their daily lives.\u201d In what appeared to be a deliberate attempt to shift the focus away from his party\u2019s deep divisions over Brexit, Corbyn said the greatest challenge posed to the UK was global warming. \u2022 Relatives of people killed by security forces have met the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, and asked her to resign for defending fatal shootings by soldiers during the Troubles. A delegation of family members sat down with Bradley at Stormont House in Belfast on Friday to express concern over her comments in Westminster on Wednesday, when she said security force killings were not crimes and were the actions of people \u201cfulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way\u201d. Bradley invited the relatives to her office to repeat apologies she made on Thursday, but Frances Meehan, whose brother Michael Donnelly was shot with a plastic bullet in 1981, said her position was \u201cuntenable\u201d. Relatives of people killed by security forces have met the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, and asked her to resign for defending fatal shootings by soldiers during the Troubles. A delegation of family members sat down with Bradley at Stormont House in Belfast on Friday to express concern over her comments in Westminster on Wednesday, when she said security force killings were not crimes and were the actions of people \u201cfulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way\u201d. Bradley invited the relatives to her office to repeat apologies she made on Thursday, but Frances Meehan, whose brother Michael Donnelly was shot with a plastic bullet in 1981, said her position was \u201cuntenable\u201d. Addressing the media after the meeting, Meehan said Bradley\u2019s apology was not sufficient to undo the damage given her position in cabinet. Relatives for Justice, a group of bereaved families that sent members to the meeting, said afterwards: \u201cThey looked her in the eye and told her she needed to resign.\u201d Michel Barnier has been tapping away on his iPhone in the last half an an hour to outline a bit more about what the EU is prepared to offer the UK How to see this? One view is that the EU is making these proposals public in order to mitigate the impact of a \u2018blame game\u2019 if talks break down. We\u2019re hearing that Jeremy Corbyn is due to take the stage in about ten minutes at the Scottish Labour conference in Dundee. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has told ambassadors from member states that the block is willing to give Britain a unilateral exit from single customs territory while preserving other elements of the backstop agreement, according to FT Brussels Corresondent Mehreen Khan. The government is to launch a multi-million pound advertising campaign in the next fortnight directed at EU citizens who need to register to remain in the country post-Brexit. It will coincide with a national rollout of the special \u201csettled status\u201d phone app, which has been in testing for the past six months. The Home Office is working on a media blitz involving billboards, and newspaper, radio and TV adverts, in a multitude of languages to alert those who do not already know of the need to register in the next two years. The adverts are expected to spell out information that EU citizens in the UK will need to remain lawfully in the country whatever the outcome of next week\u2019s crunch votes on Brexit. While the Home Office has not unveiled them yet, their presence in high streets across the UK will bring the reality of Brexit home to all British citizens as well as the 3.8 million citizens estimated to be settled in the UK [Read on]. There is a great deal of unhappiness in Brussels at the prime minister\u2019s apparent attempt to apportion the blame on the state of the negotiations to the EU. \u201cIf she wanted to send a message to the EU, why is she in Grimbsy\u201d, said one diplomat. A second said the ring-round of leaders by the prime minister was a sign of \u201cdesperation\u201d. The French ambassador to the US, G\u00e9rard Araud, tweeted a more optimistic message: \u201cThe last days of any complex negotiation are always chaotic and full of drama. Each party needs to show it has fought to the last man.\u201d \u201cThreats are uttered, doors are slammed. Usually, agreement is eventually reached.\u201d He added: In the first top-level Brussels reaction to Theresa May\u2019s speech today, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has said that he was confused by her suggestion that \u201cone \u201cone more push\u201d by the EU could win the House of Commons around to the deal. \u201cThe Brexit date is getting ever closer. The ball is still rolling toward the cliffs of Dover,\u201d he said. The Guardian\u2019s Brussels Bureau Chief, Daniel Boffey, also reports: Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, in response to the speech, told reporters: \u201cWe stand united. We are not interested in the blame game, we are interested in the result. We are still working. Earlier in the day, the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, while critical of the UK, did offer some hope that a further concession could be in order with just days to go before the deal comes before the Commons. \u201cWe\u2019ve already agreed to a review clause so I think we have made a lot of compromises and what\u2019s not evident is what the UK Government is offering the EU and Ireland should they wish us to make any further compromises, we receive no offer as to what they would give us in return for any changes\u201d, Varadkar said. \u201cIt would require a change of approach by the UK Government to understand that Brexit is a problem of their creation, what was agreed is already a compromise. They failed to secure ratification of this so it should be a question of what they are willing to offer us.\u201d Here was Barnier\u2019s reaction, via Sky News: The Government\u2019s internal divisions over the handling of Brexit talks have undermined its own position in talks with the EU, a parliamentary committee has found. The criticism emerged in interim findings of an inquiry of the House of Commons EU Scrutiny Committee, after it took evidence from witnesses including the former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab. Evidence from the four Leave-backing MPs suggested that separate - and sometimes conflicting - policies were developed by the Department for Exiting the EU and 10 Downing Street. The committee said: \u201cOne of the most striking themes to have emerged from our evidence so far concerns the way in which the UK Government itself has handled the process of negotiation internally. The cross-party report has been unanimously-agreed by members of a committee that include veteran Brexit supporters as well as MPs pushing for a second referendum. The committee\u2019s chair, Bill Cash, said: \u201cParliament is facing a series of momentous decisions in the coming days and weeks, which will shape the future of our nation. \u201cIt is essential that we in this House, as individual representatives of our constituents, have all the information we need to inform these decisions. As a Select Committee, we have a duty to assist in this process \u2013 as does the Government.\u201d Number 10 have just tweeted a video to tie in with International Women\u2019s Day. But will there be any more traction in that row which was sparked earlier in Grimsby when May only took one question from a female journalist? Tory MPs from he hardline pro Brexit European Research Group (ERG) are unlikely to back Theresa May\u2019s deal when it comes up for its latest \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 in parliament on Tuesday, a key figure from the group has indicated in the wake of the prime minister\u2019s speech today. Mark Francois, vice-chairman of the ERG, also said he believed that the British public would get \u201cextremely angry\u201d if Britain did not leave the EU on March 29 after the Prime Minister had repeatedly promised that this would happen. That anger would be fuelled by a public belief that Brexit had been foiled by members of the civil service and senior Cabinet Ministers \u201cconspiring,\u201d he told the BBC. MPs were all waiting to see what the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, came back with from Brussels in the latest round of negotiations, which are centred on British attempts to ensure that the Irish backstop is underlined as a temporary arrangement. \u201cBut if there are really no changes to this treaty or if the changes are all sort of weak and legally meaningless then you are basically asking the same question that you asked over a month ago,\u201d said Francois. \u201cLogic suggests if you ask the same answer then you get the same answer. On a side note, Francois was embroiled in a spat on the BBC\u2019s Politics Today with the writer Will Self Theresa May has urged parliament to \u201cget it done\u201d and back her Brexit deal in an impassioned speech which, however, offered no new concessions for wavering MPs ahead 0f next week\u2019s crucial vote. Speaking to energy workers in a dockside warehouse in the leave heartland of Grimsby, May also repeatedly declined to accept any personal responsibility for the ongoing uncertainty, or give any clues as to what she will do if the vote is lost. Instead, she urged the EU to make new concessions over the Irish backstop insurance policy \u2013 the issue that saw many of her MPs vote against the deal the first time \u2013 before expected last-ditch talks in Brussels this weekend. May also lashed out at Jeremy Corbyn for, as she put it, seeking to frustrate Brexit, and implored Labour MPs in leave-voting seats, such as the Grimsby MP Melanie Onn, who was there, to back her deal. If her plan was voted down again in the Commons on Tuesday, May told the crowd, the result would be more economic uncertainty and delay, and the possibility of Brexit being either watered down or even overturned. A vote against the deal would mean \u201cnot completing Brexit and getting on with all the other important issues people care about, just yet more months and years arguing\u201d, May said. \u201cIf we go down that road, we might never leave the EU at all.\u201d She added: \u201cMy message to those MPs who agree with me that we should not risk that is simple: the only certain way to avoid it is to back the deal the government has secured with EU on Tuesday. Let\u2019s get it done.\u201d The government will not have completed all of the secondary legislation needed to prepare for life after Brexit by the time of the UK\u2019s scheduled withdrawal from the EU on March 29, Downing Street has said. Confirming what had already been revealed in a piece on Conservative Home by the former agrictulture minister, George Eustice, a spokeswoman said that certain pieces of legislation have been \u201cdeprioritised\u201d and will be dealt with after Brexit day. But she insisted that all \u201cvital\u201d changes to the statute book will be ready in time for the UK\u2019s withdrawal, whether it happens with or without a deal with the EU. \u201cWe are on track to deliver the Statutory Instruments (SIs) we need for exit day and we have already laid over 80% of these,\u201d said Number 10. Jeremy Corbyn has downplayed the significance of the crisis over Brexit and the divisive battle over Scottish independence five years ago by claiming \u201cthe real divide in our society\u201d is about poverty and class. In advance excerpts before he addresses a Scottish Labour conference later on Friday, Corbyn said his party was not \u201cobsessed by constitutional questions, like the others are. We\u2019re obsessed with tackling the problems people face in their daily lives\u201d. In a deliberate attempt to shift the focus away from Brexit and his party\u2019s deep divisions over strategy on the EU, Corbyn said the greatest challenge to the UK and humanity was posed by global warming. \u201cWe are facing a climate crisis. There\u2019s no bigger threat to our future. And fundamentally, the destruction of our climate is a class issue,\u201d he said. He continued: \u201cWe believe that the real divide in our society is not between people who voted yes or no for independence. And it\u2019s not between people who voted to remain or to leave the EU. \u201cThe real divide is between the many \u2013 who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes \u2013 and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards and dodge their taxes. So let me spell it out: our mission is to back the working class, in all its diversity.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is due to speak at the Scottish Labour conference at 4.30pm, but some interesting developments are already coming out of Dundee. The Guardian\u2019s Severn Carrell reports that Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, has apologised to the party\u2019s two Scottish MEPs after their calls for a second EU referendum were deleted from the guide to this weekend\u2019s spring conference. Leonard faced accusations of censorship from his predecessor Kezia Dugdale on Wednesdy after it emerged the conference report from MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler was edited to take out their support for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d, and replaced by anodyne remarks saying Brexit was a tragedy. Dugdale also berated him for failing to organise a motion or event which celebrated their service to the party: Martin is one of Labour\u2019s longest serving parliamentarians, who first became an MEP in 1984, while Stihler first became an MEP in 1999. She has already resigned from the European parliament due to Brexit, and Martin would lose his seat if the UK quits the EU. Leonard told BBC Radio Scotland he had apologised to Stihler and Martin, blaming the editing on a mix-up. He said changes were needed to their text because it did not reflect party policy, but said their protests were not properly taken into account. \u201cWhat was published in the programme did not fully reflect what was put in by them, and I have apologised to them for that|: that shouldn\u2019t have happened. That shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d he told Good Morning Scotland. May has been accused by the Labour MP Jo Stevens of \u201ccomplete hypocrisy\u201d for saying that the EU\u2019s behaviour will determine the outcome of next week\u2019s vote. \u201cIf Theresa May is really interested in getting this right, there\u2019s an easy solution: ask the public what they want,\u201d Stevens said in a statement issue by the Best for Britain pressure group. Some analysis now of May\u2019s speech. By any measure, there was a plea to Brussels there, but there was also a further bid to scare her own Brexiteer MPs into backing the deal. In particular, she wielded the prospect of a second referendum as a bogeyman, despite it appearing (for now) that the votes just aren\u2019t there in parliament to make such a poll a reality. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby points a key passage that would seem to be directed at wavering pro-Brexit MPs: Those sections in May\u2019s speech about workers rights are also coming under scruinty. The Prime Minister said that concerns for workers\u2019 rights after Brexit should be allayed by her promise to allow Parliament to vote on whether to adopt any new protections proposed by the EU. \u201cLeaving with a deal will mean workers are protected,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if they back the Brexit deal on Tuesday, MPs will give our whole economy a boost.\u201d May\u2019s claims are a \u201cmassive red herring,\u201d says the Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin. A row has now broken out in Grimsby over why May only took one question from a woman on International Womens\u2019s Day. May left the podium to an angry shouted question from ITV\u2019s Libby Wiener as to why she only took one question from a woman, the Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker reports. May has responded: So, reaction now, and many people are distinctly unimpressed by her failure to give direct answers to many of the questions posed to her afterwards. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker, who was among those who had asked her what personal responsibility she took for the chaos surround the Brexit talks, tweets: .. and that\u2019s it. May disappears behind a shelving unit of wooden crates. Is it still possible for the UK to leave the EU on March 29 or is a delay inevitable? May says that if MPs vote for the deal then the \u201cusual channels\u201d can get together. Is she going to take No Deal off the table? It\u2019s the third time she has answered the question, says May, who adds that the best thing that MPs could do to end uncertainty is by voting for her deal on Tuesday. \u201cIf MPs don\u2019t vote for that deal then we know we will see ongoing uncertainty,\u201d she adds. May says her message to the EU also is that now is the moment for both sides to get the deal through and bring the deal back to parliament on Tuesday. Rob Hutton from Bloomberg tells her that a ship has sailed on a smooth and orderly Brexit. Britain is already in chaos and business leaders are pulling their hair out. Does she owe them an apology? May says that now is the moment \u201cto get this done\u201d and for parliament to \u201ccome together\u201d and back the deal. \u201cWe have a responsibility to deliver to this country the Brexit which people voted for,\u201d says May. BBC is up next and asks her if she is trying to shift blame away from her and on to the EU. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker says her that the UK is three weeks away from Brexit and workers in the room have no idea what is going to happen. How much responsibility does she take for the chaos? May is taking questions now from the media. The microphone didn\u2019t pick up the first one to her but the PM says that voting for the deal enables the UK to leave the EU in a \u201csmooth and orderly way\u201d. May doubles down on her pleas to MPs to support her deal on Tuesday. The British people have already moved on. They are ready for this to be settled. \u201cLet\u2019s get it down,\u201d she repeats for at least the second time. Never leaving the EU would amount to a political failure and do \u201cprofound damage\u201d to people\u2019s faith in democracy, says May. Some of those who had voted in the referendum had voted for the first time ever. Why should they ever vote again if their wishes were not acted on? The EU might insist on new conditions if a delay to Brexit was put into action, says May. That might lead to a form of Brexit that does not match up to the Brexit that people had voted for. It could mean no end to free movement (one of the key parts of the deal she has negotiated), no new trade deals... or even lead to a second referendum. Here\u2019s the appeal to the EU - \u201cit\u2019s in both of our interests.\u201d European leaders tell her that time is running out, says May, and her message to them is that now is the moment to act. The deal \u201cneeds just one more push\u201d to address the specific concern of MPs. \u201cIf MPs reject the deal nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis.\u201d Options would include \u201cgoing on arguing\u201d with a delay potentially creating more problems. MPs voted against her deal last week for various reasons, says May, who adds that the backstop policy was the biggest cause of concern for those (on her side of the House of Commons presumably) who voted against. There were \u201cgenuine concerns\u201d that there was no way out of the backstop, she adds, and these have been taken Brussels. She emphasises the importance of the Belfast Agreement. If the deal is accepted then businesses would start to invest in a major way again and money that could have been spent on a No deal would be invested elsewhere. There would be a giant \u201copen for business sign,\u201d says May. There\u2019s a section on foreign affairs - the UK would continue to wield influence on the world stage through the UN security council an its diplomatic and military resources - and one on workers rights. Brexit would not be a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in terms of the latter and the UK would continue to be in a position to safeguard workers rights outside of the EU. It\u2019s about (yes, you\u2019ve guessed it) \u201ctaking back control.\u201d May says that the Brexit vote was about sending a message that things needed to change and goes on to use Grimsby - where one of the UK\u2019s largest Leave votes was recorded - as an example of that. May says that the UK is lucky to have London and its thriving economy but it was no good for growth to be concentrated there. The government has formulated an industrial strategy that would empower towns and cities such as Grimsby. \u201cThat is the opportunity that awaits our country if we agree the Brexit deal. We can build the stronger communities of the future.\u201d But Brexit does not belong to the MPs in parliament, says May, \u201cit belongs to the whole country.\u201d Next comes a fairly contentious claim: Everyone wants to get \u201cit\u201d done, \u201cpast the bitter debates and out of the EU as a successful country.\u201d May says that, if her deal fails to win a majority in the Commons next week, Britain may not leave the EU for many months, it may not leave with the protections that have been negotiated or \u201cwe may never leave\u201d. If the deal she has negotiated is not embraced then the only certainly would be ongoing uncertainty, months more argying about Brexit when Britain could be focussing on the domestic agenda such as the NHS. The MPs will take a decision on Tuesday - her latest meaningful vote on her Brexit deal - and it is up to them to act responsibly and abide by voters\u2019 wishes, she says. The result of the referendum was \u201cclose\u201d and could have gone the other way, but the result needs to be acted on. Theresa May is on her feet and has started her speech in Grimsby in which she is expected to make an appeal to the EU to give her a better Brexit deal. She\u2019s begun by talking about the merits of offshore wind. The UK is a \u201cworld leader\u201d apparently. Standby for the Brexit talks metaphors. Karen Bradley\u2019s position is completely and utterly untenable and she needs to resign, families of those killed by the security forces in Northern Ireland have said after a meeting with the Northern Ireland Minister. Speaking after the meeting, Frances Meehan, whose brother was shot dead by the British Army in 1980, called for Mrs Bradley to resign. \u201cI wanted to meet her because I wanted to look her in the eye to tell her how I felt about her comments in the House of Commons,\u201d she said. Bradley had reached out to a number of victims\u2019 groups following her remarks in the Commons on Wednesday that killings carried out by the police and military during the Troubles were not crimes, rather actions of people \u201cfulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way\u201d. Some refused to meet Mrs Bradley but on Friday morning a delegation of relatives did travel to Stormont House in Belfast to discuss the furore. Bradley\u2019s remarks in the Commons on Wednesday that killings carried out by the police and military during the Troubles were not crimes, rather actions of people \u201cfulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way\u201d, sparked fury among some victims and political parties. Theresa May\u2019s speech in Grimsby is imminent, and the Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker is in position. \u2022 Jeremy Hunt has said relations with the EU will be \u201cpoisoned for many years to come\u201d if Brussels fails to budge in the Brexit talks, as the cabinet ministers leading the negotiations put on hold tentative plans to return to the Belgian capital. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had been expected to resume their haggling on the Irish backstop on Friday. \u2022 Theresa May will make a last-ditch attempt to persuade the EU to give her a better Brexit deal on Friday, as she struggles to hold her crumbling government together following a day of cabinet embarrassments in Westminster. The prime minister will plead with EU leaders to offer further concessions, as it became clear that talks in Brussels have stalled and hardline Eurosceptics in her party are likely to vote down the deal for a second time in parliament next week. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn has said that that his party\u2019s priority was to stop a no-deal Brexit, but insisted that Labour was not \u201cbacking away\u201d from a second referendum. He said that Theresa May\u2019s planned speech today sounded like a sign of \u201cdesperation\u201d and that his party would not be supporting her deal next Tueday, but would vote to take a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit off the table. \u2022 The Home Office is the wrong department to manage immigration after Brexit, says a highly critical report by the Institute for Government (IfG) thinktank. The department is pressing ahead with the full rollout of a registration scheme for an estimated 3.8 million EU citizens from 30 March, but the report lays bare systemic flaws in the Home Office and calls for an \u201curgent\u201d root-and-branch review of its immigration operations. Following her gaffe about state killings, Karen Bradley has been meeting today in Northern Ireland with families bereaved by security force violence. We\u2019ll have a news story on that shortly. In the meantime, the Irish writer Una Mullally writes in the Guardian that Brexit has led to the return of anti-English sentiment in Ireland, while comments from British politicians like Bradely are part of the mood music. Every clanger from a British politician \u2013 Karen Bradley\u2019s offensive and ignorant statement exonerating British soldiers for their crimes in Northern Ireland; the border mess, exacerbated by the Conservative government\u2019s tactical alliance with the DUP; the clueless remarks emanating from the House of Commons \u2013 has not just confirmed, but elevated our suspicions that English (and Brexit was always about Englishness, not Britishness, nor the oxymoron that is now the \u201cUnited\u201d Kingdom) apathy, ignorance and entitlement towards Ireland is as dominant as ever. Downing Street has been engaging in some expectation management ahead of the Grimsby speech. The Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh has this: Jeremy Corbyn has said that that his party\u2019s priority was to stop a no-deal Brexit, but insisted that Labour was not \u201cbacking away\u201d from a second referendum. Speaking during a visit to a site in north London where new homes are set to be built, the Labour leader said that Theresa May\u2019s speech today sounded like \u201ca sign of desperation\u201d. \u201cWe will not be supporting her deal next Tuesday - we will be voting to take no-deal off the table and we will once again be putting our proposals - our five pillars - which are a customs union, market access and protection of rights in this country that have been obtained through the EU.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve taken those proposals to the European Union - they are a good basis for negotiation - they are a way forward. It\u2019s time that she got on board and recognised there is a deal that could command a majority in the House.\u201d Grimsby has presumably been selected as the backdrop for May\u2019s speech today on account of it being one of the most eurosceptic regions in Britain. An overwhelming majority of constituents in north East Lincolnshire\u2013 69.9% \u2013 voted to Leave during the referendum. For a bit more on why the vote went as it did you could do worse than read this piece from Tim Burrows, who wrote after a visit last year: Grimbarians feel isolated many times over: from London, from the rest of the country, from the docks where husbands said goodbye to wives before a few treacherous weeks at sea, and from the dead fishing industry through which it faced the world. Grimsby has become a place where municipal decisions are always pending. There are no guarantees with this latest wave of hopes: it could all be scuppered by more political infighting, or private enterprise pulling out. Who knows what will happen after Brexit. We don\u2019t have specific set time yet for Theresa May\u2019s speech today in Grimsby but it\u2019s expected at around 12.30. If the advance guidance is anything to go by, the Prime Minister will effectively plead with the EU to meet her halfway on Brexit talks or risk Britain leaving the union without an agreement. She will say: Just as MPs will face a big choice next week, the EU has to make a choice too. \u201cIt is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal. We are working with them but the decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote. In the meantime let\u2019s hope Her Majesty\u2019s Press Corps will make it time to hear her utter those words.. The EU\u2019s 27 ambassadors have been called for a meeting with the European commission\u2019s negotiating team at 3pm in Brussels but sources stressed that there had not been any positive developments in the talks. Diplomats are instead expecting the commission to update them on the latest, and confirm the member states\u2019 resolve to reject the UK\u2019s recent proposals on the Irish backstop. The UK wants an arbitration panel to have the final say on whether the backstop arrangement should come to an end. The commission\u2019s negotiators have turned down the idea. The meeting of ambassadors will be held shortly after Theresa May has finished a speech in Grimbsy, where she will call on the EU to budge on their position. \u201cJust as MPs will face a big choice next week, the EU has to make a choice too\u201d, the prime minister is expected to say. \u201cIt is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal. We are working with them but the decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote.\u201d Eyebrows are also very definitely being raised at this latest attempt at an apology by Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley. In an interview late yesterday evening with the Press Association, she made clear she would not be resigning after saying that killings carried out by the police and military during the Troubles were not crimes, rather actions of people \u201cfulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way\u201d. She also rejected the suggestion she was out of her depth in the role. \u201cI am determined to prove myself by delivering for the people of Northern Ireland,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is an enormous honour to be Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, it\u2019s an enormous honour to serve the people of Northern Ireland and Government, and it is something I really want to deliver on.\u201d Mrs Bradley added: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said it and I want to say sorry to all those people, all those families that have been kind enough to share their experiences with me. \u201cI want to say sorry to them because I didn\u2019t want to cause hurt or pain or distress to them in any way, and what I want to do is deliver for them, and I am absolutely determined I will do. A few eyebrows might be raised at this. DUP leader Arlene Foster has been named Female Politician of the Year at an awards event in London organised by the publishers of Asian Voice. The accolade - bestowed on Foster at an event hosted by the Labour MP Keith Vaz - comes after the DUP leader has appeared to wield significant influence over the course of government policy. At the same time though, it also comes an Irish Times Poll found that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland are dissatisfied with her. Not all of the government Statutory Instruments (SIs) \u2013 mechanisms to ensure that EU laws that apply in Britain are incorporated into domestic law \u2013 will now be passed before the Brexit date (for now) of March 29. That\u2019s according to the former agriculture minister, George Eustice, who writes today in Conservative Home: The civil service has done a sterling job preparing for no deal. We are in the process of laying hundreds of Statutory Instruments to make retained EU law operable. There are a few that have been de-prioritised and will not be done by the end of March but, when I went through the small number that were being left behind, it was pretty clear that they were a collection of inconsequential rules that were either not particularly relevant to the UK anyway or were where alternative powers already existed. The Labour MP Naz Shah has called for an apology from Andrea Leadsom after the Commons Leader suggested Islamophobia should be treated as a Foreign Office issue. In a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May, Shah said: \u201cThis comment exposes profound ignorance of race issues at the top of Government. This is not a trivial matter. \u201c A bit of local by-election action meanwhile ( the only one taking place this week) and the the Green Party has snatched a council seat from the Tories. The Conservative defeat by more than 400 votes came in a contest in the Haddenham &amp; Stone ward of Aylesbury Vale District Council caused by the death of a Tory councillor. Voting was: Green 1,210, C 781, LD 333, Lab 59. The turnout was 32%. The council is due to be abolished next year in a major restructuring of local government in Buckinghamshire which would see four district councils and the county council replaced with a single unitary authority. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that future generations will blame the EU if it fails to come to an agreement at this point in the Brexit negotiations. \u201cThis is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badly if we get this wrong,\u201d Hunt told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme this morning \u201cWe want to remain the best of friends with the EU. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn\u2019t inject poison into our relations for many years to come. That\u2019s what the UK has said we want to do, it\u2019s what most people in the UK want and feel very strongly about. \u201cBut it does need the EU also to be flexible in these negotiations and understand that we now have a very, very clear ask. We know what it would take to get a deal through the House of Commons, and that is for a significant change to allow the Attorney General to change his advice to the Government and say we couldn\u2019t be trapped in a customs union forever.\u201d What\u2019s he up? One obvious conclusions is that he is atteming to establish blame early in the minds of British voters. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston also has this: Apart from the May and Corbyn speeches today, other political stories include: \u2022 Claims in a highly critical report by the Institute for Government (IfG) thinktank that the Home Office is the wrong department to manage immigration after Brexit. The department is pressing ahead with the full rollout of a registration scheme for an estimated 3.8 million EU citizens from 30 March, but the report lays bare systemic flaws in the Home Office and calls for an \u201curgent\u201d root-and-branch review of its immigration operations. \u2022 Ongoing calls for the Northern Ireland Secretary to resign following her latest gaffe. The calls come not just from Labour but from relatives of people killed in Northern Ireland by the military. \u2022 A renewed political focus on knife crime, with one of Britain\u2019s most senior police officers demanding \u201charsh\u201d sentences for criminals caught carrying knives. \u2022 Analysis by the social reform think tank the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), which found that the benefits freeze has pushed 200,000 people into poverty. Jeremy Hunt has said relations with the EU will be \u201cpoisoned for many years to come\u201d if Brussels fails to budge in the talks, as the cabinet ministers leading the negotiations put on hold tentative plans to return to the Belgian capital. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had been expected to resume their haggling on the Irish backstop on Friday. But after what Cox described as \u201crobust\u201d talks earlier in the week, during which Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator rejected the latest British proposals, the two sides appeared to be in a stalemate. A visit by Cox and Barclay had not been confirmed for Friday. But if talks had progressed on the British ideas for winning over MPs to the Brexit deal, sources on both sides had suggested that the cabinet ministers would be in Brussels, ahead of a sign-off by the prime minister during a possible Sunday visit to the EU\u2019s headquarters. UK officials insisted that the situation remained \u201cfluid\u201d and that both men were on standby, should there be a breakthrough. Good morning and welcome to Guardian live blog coverage of a crunch day of Brexit brinkmanship and British party political turmoil \u2013 or, as one former Conservative minister put it, \u201cthe last days of Rome\u201d. Regulars will know that this blog attracts a lot of comments so if you want to get my attention it might be easiest to Tweet me. Today\u2019s key moving stories are: A last-ditch attempt by Theresa May to persuade the EU to give her a better Brexit deal as she struggles to hold her crumbling government together following a string cabinet embarrassments in Westminster. In a speech in the Brexit stronghold of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, the prime minister will plead with EU leaders to offer further concessions, as it became clear that talks in Brussels have stalled and hardline Eurosceptics in her party are likely to vote down the deal for a second time in parliament next week. An address by Jeremy Corbyn to Scottish Labour\u2019s Spring conference, which comes after the former leader of Scottish labour launched an attack on her successor. In a letter that was leaked this week, Kezia Dugdale was highly criticial of Richard Leonard\u2019s approach to Brexit. The party\u2019s crisis over allegations of antisemitism continues to rumble on meanwhile after Britain\u2019s equality watchdog said it believes the party may have \u201cunlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs\u201d as it announced the first step of a statutory inquiry into the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints.",

      "bodyText": "The impact of the funding crisis in England\u2019s schools is laid bare in a Guardian investigation that reveals a system falling apart at the seams, with teachers covering for canteen staff and cleaners while essential funds are raised by parent donations and \u201ccharity\u201d non-uniform days. Teachers and parents who responded to a Guardian callout complained there was not enough money even for basics such as textbooks, stationery and science equipment. They say children with special educational needs (SEN) are the hardest hit, as schools facing deficits struggle to fund additional support. Schools that cannot afford cleaners are dirty and falling into disrepair. Staff have been made redundant, class sizes have gone up, subjects have been scrapped and teaching hours cut, as headteachers resort to desperate measures to make ends meet. \u2022 In North Yorkshire, one secondary school is raising funds by holding extra non-uniform days \u2013 six a year, at the end of each half term \u2013 potentially earning an additional \u00a33,000 for the school\u2019s funds. \u2022 Teachers in schools in Essex and inner London are being asked to stand in after lunchtime supervision was cut. In one Somerset school, teachers are doing cleaning duties as cleaning staff have been cut. \u2022 Schools have set up Amazon wishlists and crowd-funding pages \u201cso parents can buy such luxuries as pencils, glue sticks, rulers etc\u201d according to one school in the east of England. \u2022 Hours are being reduced at both the start and end of the day to save money. In Birmingham many primary school pupils are being sent home at lunchtime on Fridays; pupils at one Kent grammar school are being asked to come in late one morning. \u2022 Managers in Gloucestershire are delaying turning on heating until November, even though teachers and students are wearing coats indoors to stay warm. \u2022 Photocopying is strictly rationed, pastoral care and mental health support has been cut, and teachers are asked to teach subjects in which they are not specialists. \u2022 Pupils with special educational needs are getting less attention because of cuts to teaching and support staff, with schools concentrating their remaining resources on those with the highest levels of disability. In the run-up to the spending review later this year, pressure is mounting on the government to address the crisis. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cThis is simply not acceptable. How on earth does the government think we can deliver a world-class education system under such conditions?\u201d Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said it was \u201cparticularly troubling\u201d that children with special educational needs were often the worst off. \u201cThis government should be ashamed. It is a disgrace that in one of the richest countries in the world, schools are forced to beg for funding from parents,\u201d Rayner said. \u201cThe principle of free education regardless of income is a human right but it is being undermined by Tory cuts to our schools. A whole generation of students are paying the price for austerity.\u201d The Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, Layla Moran, said: \u201cThis investigation should shame the Tory government. With teachers covering for cleaners and parents donating money for essential services there is no way Conservative ministers can deny there is a lack of funding for our schools \u2026 to fail to act is to leave both teachers and children in the midst of what is clearly a crisis.\u201d Last week, in an unprecedented move, school governors from all over the country descended on Westminster to add their voices to the protest. \u201cAs a governor of long standing, I can confirm that these cuts are very real and very damaging,\u201d said Diana Boyd, chair of governors at Elm Grove primary school in Brighton. \u201cIt is essential the government understands their impact on children \u2013 who are, after all, the future of our country.\u201d Figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies show that sixth form colleges have seen funding cut by 21% since 2010 as overall school funding has slumped by 8% in real terms in the same period. Many who responded to the Guardian said their school had lost staff, with a direct impact on behaviour and learning. Some schools were reluctant to take SEN children on roll because of staff cuts.

      "body": "<p>In his article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/07/debunking-myth-that-anti-zionism-is-antisemitic\" title=\"\">Debunking the myth that anti-Zionism is antisemitic</a>, 7 March), Peter Beinart makes the common error that trips up many people trying to understand the problems in the Middle East \u2013 he tries to apply logic to it. If A equals B and B equals C then A must equal C simply does not work here. Stating that if anti-Zionism just means being against Israel then anti-Zionism is OK misses the point by a mile and hundreds of years.</p> <p>If Zionism is anything, it is a discussion; everyone seems to think it means something else. We had these discussions at Sunderland Polytechnic Student Union in the 1980s to no great resolution and they are continuing today at Essex University.</p> <p>If people want to attack the appalling behaviour of the state of Israel to Palestinians I would agree with them. If people say they understand Zionism and feel they can tell others what it means, then I cordially suggest they are wrong.<br><strong>John Gessler</strong><br><em>Ex-president, Sunderland Polytechnic Jewish Society</em></p> <p>\u2022 Peter Beinart\u2019s claim that it is not antisemitic to identify as anti-Zionist conveniently ignores the prior predicate: that Jews get to define their own identity and the return to Zion as part of it. In my daily prayers, grace after meals, and many other daily acts, including the direction in which I pray, there is, and always has been, a desire to return to Zion, a specific physical location. There is a wide diversity of views among Jews how to give that practical expression. But we Jews get to define Zionism, and every poll shows that 90% of us recognise it as core to our identity. So oppose the actual policies of the state, support parties that want fundamentally to change the state, have philosophical historic debates about how it came about, but the moment you declare yourself \u201canti-Zionist\u201d you are expropriating the right to define and deny my identity.<br><strong>Justyn Trenner</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I think that Peter Beinart is mistaken. If, say, the Basques or the Kurds had achieved nationhood, then they too are likely to have had difficulties with their neighbours and their internal minorities. Nevertheless, if that nationhood were then challenged, their respective diaspora would have shown similar solidarity towards their new national homeland that many Jews now feel towards Israel. Some people are failing to understand the sensitivities of many (though not all) in our Jewish community.<br><strong>John Whitehead</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 At long last, a proper, objective analysis of the distinction between antisemitism and anti-Zionism. It is failure to recognise this distinction that leads to the accusation of institutional antisemitism in the Labour party, which I deny. In particular, it reveals the antisemitic motivation for the Balfour declaration, which first gave credence to the idea of a \u201cJewish national home\u201d in historic Palestine. How different might the world be today had Balfour, instead, declared: \u201cWe are a democratic, tolerant, multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious society, and we welcome all persecuted minorities, who will no doubt make their own special contribution to our culture.\u201d</p> <p>The answer to antisemitism is the same as the answer to all forms of discrimination: recognition that our common humanity should override all the things that divide us. On that basis, the answer to the Israel/Palestine \u201cproblem\u201d is the \u201cstate for all citizens\u201d proposed by Palestinian members of the Knesset, but in the whole of historic Palestine. It would be a beacon to the world, while still being a special place for Jews.<br><strong>Frank Jackson</strong><br><em>Harlow, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Peter Beinart\u2019s Egyptian-Jewish refugee grandma must be turning in her grave at her grandson\u2019s failure to learn the lessons of history. To change Israel from an ethnic state to a \u201ccivic democracy\u201d is effectively to make it a 23rd Arab state: its first act would be to abrogate Israel\u2019s Law of Return giving Jews safe haven from diaspora antisemitism. To deny Jews a right to their own national symbols and character \u2013 over 90% of Jews are Zionists \u2013 while advocating a Palestinian state is itself antisemitic. To deny Kurds the state which an overwhelming majority of Iraqi Kurds support is anti-Kurdish bigotry.<br><strong>Lyn Julius</strong><br><em>Harif \u2013 UK Association of Jews from the Middle East and North Africa</em></p> <p>\u2022 Peter Beinart\u2019s article was the most thoughtful and considered piece on this subject in the Guardian since Stephen Sedley and Geoffrey Bindman\u2019s forensic contributions to the debate on Labour\u2019s adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/27/antisemitism-ihra-definition-jewish-writers\" title=\"\">30 July 2018</a>). Beinart even dares to suggest that it might be advantageous to Israel\u2019s leaders to conflate antisemitism with criticism of that country\u2019s foreign and domestic policy, an opinion which it has become almost taboo to express in the current climate.<br><strong>Mike Hine</strong><br><em>Kingston upon Thames, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Zionist aim was to establish a Jewish state that would always provide a haven for Jews fleeing persecution and death. The Zionist movement arose not only because of the centuries of suffering but also because when Jews attempted to escape, the gentile world closed its doors to them. Although our country took in 10,000 Jewish child refugees, we refused to take in their parents, most of whom perished. Had there been then a Jewish state, those parents and countless others would have survived. Overwhelmingly Jews support the existence of a Jewish state \u2013 Zionism \u2013 but the majority are critical of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s policies. To criticise the current Israeli government is not antisemitic, but to condemn the existence of Israel usually is.<br><strong>Paul Miller</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In his article (Debunking the myth that anti-Zionism is antisemitic, 7 March), Peter Beinart makes the common error that trips up many people trying to understand the problems in the Middle East \u2013 he tries to apply logic to it. If A equals B and B equals C then A must equal C simply does not work here. Stating that if anti-Zionism just means being against Israel then anti-Zionism is OK misses the point by a mile and hundreds of years. If Zionism is anything, it is a discussion; everyone seems to think it means something else. We had these discussions at Sunderland Polytechnic Student Union in the 1980s to no great resolution and they are continuing today at Essex University. If people want to attack the appalling behaviour of the state of Israel to Palestinians I would agree with them. If people say they understand Zionism and feel they can tell others what it means, then I cordially suggest they are wrong. John Gessler Ex-president, Sunderland Polytechnic Jewish Society \u2022 Peter Beinart\u2019s claim that it is not antisemitic to identify as anti-Zionist conveniently ignores the prior predicate: that Jews get to define their own identity and the return to Zion as part of it. In my daily prayers, grace after meals, and many other daily acts, including the direction in which I pray, there is, and always has been, a desire to return to Zion, a specific physical location. There is a wide diversity of views among Jews how to give that practical expression. But we Jews get to define Zionism, and every poll shows that 90% of us recognise it as core to our identity. So oppose the actual policies of the state, support parties that want fundamentally to change the state, have philosophical historic debates about how it came about, but the moment you declare yourself \u201canti-Zionist\u201d you are expropriating the right to define and deny my identity. Justyn Trenner London \u2022 I think that Peter Beinart is mistaken. If, say, the Basques or the Kurds had achieved nationhood, then they too are likely to have had difficulties with their neighbours and their internal minorities. Nevertheless, if that nationhood were then challenged, their respective diaspora would have shown similar solidarity towards their new national homeland that many Jews now feel towards Israel. Some people are failing to understand the sensitivities of many (though not all) in our Jewish community. John Whitehead London \u2022 At long last, a proper, objective analysis of the distinction between antisemitism and anti-Zionism. It is failure to recognise this distinction that leads to the accusation of institutional antisemitism in the Labour party, which I deny. In particular, it reveals the antisemitic motivation for the Balfour declaration, which first gave credence to the idea of a \u201cJewish national home\u201d in historic Palestine. How different might the world be today had Balfour, instead, declared: \u201cWe are a democratic, tolerant, multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious society, and we welcome all persecuted minorities, who will no doubt make their own special contribution to our culture.\u201d The answer to antisemitism is the same as the answer to all forms of discrimination: recognition that our common humanity should override all the things that divide us. On that basis, the answer to the Israel/Palestine \u201cproblem\u201d is the \u201cstate for all citizens\u201d proposed by Palestinian members of the Knesset, but in the whole of historic Palestine. It would be a beacon to the world, while still being a special place for Jews. Frank Jackson Harlow, Essex \u2022 Peter Beinart\u2019s Egyptian-Jewish refugee grandma must be turning in her grave at her grandson\u2019s failure to learn the lessons of history. To change Israel from an ethnic state to a \u201ccivic democracy\u201d is effectively to make it a 23rd Arab state: its first act would be to abrogate Israel\u2019s Law of Return giving Jews safe haven from diaspora antisemitism. To deny Jews a right to their own national symbols and character \u2013 over 90% of Jews are Zionists \u2013 while advocating a Palestinian state is itself antisemitic. To deny Kurds the state which an overwhelming majority of Iraqi Kurds support is anti-Kurdish bigotry. Lyn Julius Harif \u2013 UK Association of Jews from the Middle East and North Africa \u2022 Peter Beinart\u2019s article was the most thoughtful and considered piece on this subject in the Guardian since Stephen Sedley and Geoffrey Bindman\u2019s forensic contributions to the debate on Labour\u2019s adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism (30 July 2018). Beinart even dares to suggest that it might be advantageous to Israel\u2019s leaders to conflate antisemitism with criticism of that country\u2019s foreign and domestic policy, an opinion which it has become almost taboo to express in the current climate. Mike Hine Kingston upon Thames, Surrey \u2022 The Zionist aim was to establish a Jewish state that would always provide a haven for Jews fleeing persecution and death. The Zionist movement arose not only because of the centuries of suffering but also because when Jews attempted to escape, the gentile world closed its doors to them. Although our country took in 10,000 Jewish child refugees, we refused to take in their parents, most of whom perished. Had there been then a Jewish state, those parents and countless others would have survived. Overwhelmingly Jews support the existence of a Jewish state \u2013 Zionism \u2013 but the majority are critical of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s policies. To criticise the current Israeli government is not antisemitic, but to condemn the existence of Israel usually is. Paul Miller London",

      "bodyText": "The chair of the Institute of Directors, Charlotte Valeur, has used International Women\u2019s Day to criticise FTSE 350 companies for not making enough effort to recruit and promote women and minority-ethnic directors. Scrolling through the list of FTSE 350 companies, one will find brands such as HSBC, which was fined \u00a31.4bn for helping drug cartels launder money in Mexico; Sports Direct, where workers have been exploited to the extent that one woman gave birth in the toilets; and G4S, a company so mired in scandal that it has an entire Wikipedia page dedicated solely to the amount of controversies it has amassed. If a company behaves terribly but its director is a woman, is that still feminism? The reality of women\u2019s work across the world is not that we\u2019re duking it out to see who can make partner first: it\u2019s exploitation, low pay and precariousness. Sexism is bad everywhere, including in boardrooms, but feminism must exist to improve the lives of the majority of women, or it is worth nothing. Valeur may get her wish for more female directors in the FTSE 350, but it makes little difference to the world unless those women use their new power to fundamentally alter the relations between women and capital. I thought about this too during the explosion of the #MeToo movement. When debating the allegations against men like Harvey Weinstein and Philip Green, there was acknowledgment that women often tolerate sexual assault and harassment because of the immense power wielded by the men who mete it out. But there was little discussion around the obvious economic measures that might make it easier for women to leave these kinds of workplaces, or take action against their bosses: measures such as a robust welfare state, stronger trade unions, universal free childcare, better pay and secure affordable housing. If this sounds like socialism, it\u2019s because it is. Only by diminishing the power of the boss class, and giving female workers more access to collectively owned social goods, can we ensure that no woman is forced to choose between sexual and economic exploitation, and poverty. Inessa Armand, the Bolshevik revolutionary who was responsible for allowing Soviet women to divorce, have abortions, participate in politics and access childcare knew that only fundamental change to the economic system could make life better for women. \u201cIf women\u2019s liberation is unthinkable without communism, then communism is unthinkable without women\u2019s liberation,\u201d she argued. Among the hashtags and vacuous corporate slogans that now flood International Women\u2019s Day, it\u2019s easy to forget that it was first celebrated 110 years ago by the Socialist Party of America to honour the New York garment workers\u2019 strike, which had been held by female workers a year earlier. Eight years after the first International Women\u2019s Day, female revolutionaries in Russia effectively overthrew the tsar with a series of protests and strikes, which also won them the right to vote. It\u2019s not novel to tie socialism and feminism together: they are inextricably linked as movements, and always have been. Of course, it\u2019s complacent for any socialist to argue that ending capitalism will simply erase sexism from existence. Gender inequality may be a necessary condition of capitalism, but it is maintained by culture.

      "body": "<p> <strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>After the crossword, the first thing my father would turn to in the paper was the death announcements. It must have been a legacy from the war when that was one of the more reliable ways of finding out if someone you knew had been killed. It\u2019s a habit he passed on to me, and for as long as I can remember I\u2019ve ploughed my way through the demise of people I\u2019ve never heard of. Mostly to be reassured they were a lot older than me, something that gets trickier by the day, and died of an illness for which I have no symptoms. I can\u2019t stand those coy notices that don\u2019t give the deceased\u2019s age or cause of death. My family are under instructions to give as many details as possible. \u201cJohn died of an extremely rare form of cancer, something he never stopped complaining about to the very end.\u201d</p> <p>Today was rather more disconcerting though, because every media outlet broadcast the deaths of two people \u2013 the actor Luke Perry and musician Keith Flint \u2013 who were clearly much loved and well known by everyone except me. I had no idea who either man was. The closest I could get was vaguely remembering having once heard of a band called The Prodigy. If not the music. When cultural icons who are too young to have entered my consciousness start dying then it\u2019s definitely time to start worrying. It\u2019s not being left out of the conversation that I care about.

I\u2019ve long thought that the only reason Failing Grayling is still in a job is because he makes everyone else around him look a little less rubbish.

Another outlier is that, despite declaring war on China, paintballing Spanish trawlers and sending in the tanks to deal with knife crime, Gavin Williamson only has a rating of -4.</p> <p>But the biggest surprise is that Liam Fox has a rating of +22. Type \u201cdisgraced former\u201d into Google and the first result you get is Fox in his former role as defence secretary. A minister who has achieved almost nothing during his time in office. His latest appearance before a Commons select committee was a car crash.

He then insisted that even if he knew which tariffs were due to be set in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to tell anyone because business needed the uncertainty, before committing the entire imagined Brexit dividend on subsidies for farmers. Tory party members must be a forgiving lot.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>A packed reception at Speaker\u2019s House \u2013 one of the finest private residences in London, so you can see why John Bercow is so reluctant to move on \u2013 for the launch of Women of Westminster, a very readable history of the 491 women elected to parliament in the past 100 years written by the Labour MP Rachel Reeves.</p> <p>The first speech was by Theresa May, who had hotfooted it from a prime minister\u2019s questions in which she had made the unusual claim that the rise in knife crime was the result of increased affluence under a Conservative government.

As regular readers will know, Anna has already been married to Robert twice. The first wedding, for which my wife and I got about 10 days notice, took place in the kitchen of her husband\u2019s parents in Minneapolis. It was a very small affair - so much so that at the time it was scheduled to start my wife and I were the only people present as everyone else, the bride and groom included, was still asleep \u2013 but very moving. I cried a lot.</p> <p>The second wedding was a rather bigger do, a ceremony conducted by our son under a wooden pergola he and his friends had constructed in our back garden, followed by a party in a south London bar. I cried a lot at that one too. The third wedding is a return to Minneapolis for all those who for some reason weren\u2019t able to make it to the first two. After some thought, my wife and I have decided not to go to this one. Partly because she and Robert are coming to the UK in June, but mainly because we\u2019re concerned that if we do go then it will only encourage her to have a fourth wedding.</p> <p>When Anna first told us she was getting married, she assured us that she wanted her wedding to be extremely low key. God knows what would have happened if she had made a fuss. I doubt even the Kardashians have dared to get married to the same person three times in a year. Talking of which, I was surprised to see that Forbes Magazine has named Kylie Jenner as the youngest ever self-made billionaire. \u201cSelf-made\u201d is doing a lot of heavy lifting and reminds me of the old joke. How do you make a small fortune? Start off with a large fortune. AKA The Donald trump playbook.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m beginning to wonder if I might not have been a little unfair in labelling Chris Grayling as the most hopeless person in the cabinet, as this week many of his colleagues have appeared keen to wrestle the title from his grasp. Liam Fox simply by being Liam Fox and Andrea Leadsom by declaring that all British Muslims aren\u2019t really British and fall under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Office.</p> <p>After a promising start in which she announced that pensioners who had been disabled for most of their life would not now be expected to have made a miracle cure, we also had Amber Rudd proving her natural habitat was the 1970s by referring to Diane Abbott as a coloured woman. Then we had Karen Bradley. Not content with parading her ignorance that Protestants tended to vote for unionist parties and Catholics for republican parties, the Northern Ireland secretary insisted that the killings committed by the security forces were not crimes. That should go down well in Ireland. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in what I said,\u201d Bradley explained later. Just as well, as no one believes in her either.</p> <p>Still the idiocy bar gets lower. On the Today programme, Jeremy Hunt pronounced that history would judge the EU if it did not break its red lines because the UK was unwilling to break its own. To round off the week, the prime minister went off to Grimsby to tell a small troop of hacks that there are two sides involved in the EU negotiations. With just three weeks to go till 29 March, she has finally noticed. It feels like the end of days. Thank God there\u2019s nothing serious going on like rising knife crime, increased homelessness, an NHS near breaking point and schools in Birmingham forced to close for half a day a week. Otherwise we\u2019d be really screwed.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: 21 days and counting</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2447a65dd540067b0529ddee20248611650614a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2447a65dd540067b0529ddee20248611650614a/0_295_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beachy Head\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beachy Head: \u2018On a clear day you can see the French laughing at us\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

How do you make a small fortune? Start off with a large fortune. AKA The Donald trump playbook. Friday I\u2019m beginning to wonder if I might not have been a little unfair in labelling Chris Grayling as the most hopeless person in the cabinet, as this week many of his colleagues have appeared keen to wrestle the title from his grasp. Liam Fox simply by being Liam Fox and Andrea Leadsom by declaring that all British Muslims aren\u2019t really British and fall under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Office. After a promising start in which she announced that pensioners who had been disabled for most of their life would not now be expected to have made a miracle cure, we also had Amber Rudd proving her natural habitat was the 1970s by referring to Diane Abbott as a coloured woman. Then we had Karen Bradley. Not content with parading her ignorance that Protestants tended to vote for unionist parties and Catholics for republican parties, the Northern Ireland secretary insisted that the killings committed by the security forces were not crimes. That should go down well in Ireland. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in what I said,\u201d Bradley explained later. Just as well, as no one believes in her either. Still the idiocy bar gets lower. On the Today programme, Jeremy Hunt pronounced that history would judge the EU if it did not break its red lines because the UK was unwilling to break its own. To round off the week, the prime minister went off to Grimsby to tell a small troop of hacks that there are two sides involved in the EU negotiations. With just three weeks to go till 29 March, she has finally noticed. It feels like the end of days. Thank God there\u2019s nothing serious going on like rising knife crime, increased homelessness, an NHS near breaking point and schools in Birmingham forced to close for half a day a week. Otherwise we\u2019d be really screwed. Digested week, digested: 21 days and counting",
