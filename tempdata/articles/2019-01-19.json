Images published on Saturday appear to show Prince Philip, wearing tinted glasses, back behind the wheel of a replacement Freelander on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The 97-year-old passed a police eyesight test on Saturday morning as the investigation into Thursday\u2019s crash continued, with police saying \u201cany appropriate action\u201d would be taken if necessary. It also emerged on Saturday that police and councillors had clashed over plans to install speed cameras prior to Thursday\u2019s crash. On Friday, the day after the Land Rover driven by the Queen\u2019s husband was in the collision, Norfolk county council\u2019s environment, development and transport committee approved the installation of cameras and a cut to the speed limit on the A149 near the Sandringham estate. But it has transpired the plans were agreed by police more than two years ago, only to be rejected by councillors, who feared the cameras would become a \u201ccash cow\u201d. Councillors called for further consultation before giving their backing, the Eastern Daily Press reported. Their move prompted Norfolk\u2019s chief constable, Simon Bailey, to raise his concerns about the consequences if there was a serious accident. He wrote to Tom McCabe, Norfolk county council\u2019s executive director of community and environmental services, in September, saying: \u201cWhilst I appreciate the views of the local councillors are a key consideration, as I understand it, the responsibility for and the liability arising from the decision impacts on the council as a whole (particularly given the risk to the council in the event of legal challenge or a fatality).

      "body": "<p>I started writing this essay as I was drinking red wine from a stainless steel goblet at a picnic table in a rest area not far south of Alice Springs, on my way to the 33rd instalment of the legendary annual Barunga festival.</p> <p>It was essential that I finish my wine before I travelled much further as Barunga, in the Northern Territory, is a dry community. Drinking there is outlawed, possession of alcohol is prohibited but not as a response to community requests or desires. Rather it was instituted as part of the Northern Territory intervention that started with an act of parliament and an invasion of Indigenous communities by the Australian Defence Force more than 10 years ago and has never actually ended \u2013 despite several changes in federal government.</p> <p>If anyone is caught taking grog into a restricted community, all of which are Indigenous communities in the NT, the police can confiscate their vehicle. I have been warned, threatened, firsthand by NT police.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul> <p>On my way to Kalkarindji, NT, for the festival celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Wavehill Walkoff in 2016, I was pulled over by about 20 police officers in something like 10 Landcruiser Troopcarriers who were checking every car for alcohol. I have never lived in a dictatorship but after that experience I can imagine what it would feel like.</p> <p>This was on the way to a celebration of one of the landmark moments in the birth of Indigenous land rights. Kalkarindji, where the Whitlam government gave freehold title to the traditional owners in 1975 and where, I was told, under the intervention the federal government stole their land again by forcing the traditional owners to lease their land to the commonwealth.</p> <p>Ironically, when you consider the campaigns against drink driving, in the Kimberley town of Derby in Western Australia it\u2019s impossible to buy alcohol unless you can present car keys to the liquor store staff. I don\u2019t know whose idea that was but it\u2019s spectacularly stupid. It could only have been instituted to stop the homeless Indigenous people, who live under trees in the town, from drinking. It\u2019s still stupid, being only able to buy drink if you are planning to drive away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/i-no-longer-support-changethedate-we-must-change-the-country\">I no longer support #changethedate. We must change Australia | Luke Pearson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you are banned from drinking at home (or your friend\u2019s homes) and cannot afford to drink at the pub what would you do? Yes, I would drink in the park too.</p> <p>What people never consider, what if the reason there are so many Indigenous people drinking in parks and under trees is that they are denied the simple pleasure of drinking at home? If they are lucky enough to have a home at all. Many drinkers have left their communities to have access to alcohol, they have left their families, even children, they have moved away from where they can practice culture. Others drink in town and drive home to community, or drink in their cars on the way home.</p> <p>At Barunga a big screen showed videos, advertising campaigns and community projects from a number of Indigenous communities against drink driving. I have heard firsthand from community workers that the cause of a recent increase in drink driving is the grog bans. If you want to drink and are from an Aboriginal community from the NT you have only limited choices: you could move to a park or under a tree in the nearest town, drink there and be away from community. You could drink at the pub in the nearest town then drive home drunk or you can buy a carton of beer and drink it in the car as you drive back to your community.</p> <p>I have heard of white workers in Indigenous communities flouting the law and getting away with it. I have been told by white people how to get away with it.</p> <p>Also in Barunga, members of the community have asked for permission to open a social club where alcohol is served and the community and the elders can police it. They are sick of people being run over at night when walking the 30km to the community from the \u201cdrinker\u2019s camp\u201d \u2013 the first stop on the road outside the restricted zone \u2013 at night.</p> <p>When I visited Borroloola I was told that the only alcohol was half-strength beer and there was an 18-can limit; too bad if I wanted anything full-strength or gluten free. The nearest other grog was at Cape Crawford, more than 100km away. If Aboriginal people make that 200km round trip they cannot even take their drinks home, they must drink them as they drive or drink on the riverbank (among the crocodiles) or the side of the road where they would probably be arrested for vagrancy.</p> <p>At the liquor store in Katherine a police constable checks ID when you enter. They say they perform this duty, enforce this law, without prejudice. They say the laws are to stop problem drinkers. Everybody knows they exist to stop First Nations people from drinking. They have a \u201cbanned drinkers register\u201d, but I am curious how many white people have made that list.</p> <p>The police don\u2019t check the banned drinkers register anyway, the shop assistant does that. It is necessary, when buying a drink in Alice Springs or Katherine to hand over ID twice, once to police and once to the shop assistant. The police must be there to intimidate blackfellas who have learned over generations to be terrified of the police.</p> <p>How do I know that?</p> <p>Last time I was in Katherine I saw white people hand over their ID to the police and have it handed back after no more than a cursory glance. When an Aboriginal woman walked in they held her up for long enough to check her ID details on a tablet, and possibly they were also recording those details for later. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that they were checking to see if she had any outstanding warrants, something they did not do with any of the white people.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to imagine an Indigenous person being afraid to hand over their ID to a police constable; especially after our history. Even I am nervous about handing the police my ID.</p> <p>In Darwin, where most of the white people of the NT live, the police don\u2019t check ID when buying grog. This is despite the fact that people in Katherine, justifying the police checking my ID, said it was the same across the entire NT.</p> <p>This essay is not about grog, not about drink, not about grog bans. There are many places in Australia where grog has been banned through the decision of the traditional owners, I accept that. This is about a government, about successive governments, who believe they have the right to control Indigenous affairs. This is about white supremacy and a country that does not believe First Nations people deserve, have not the maturity, to manage our own affairs.</p> <p>The issue is summarised by the simple phrase \u201cabout us without us\u201d.</p> <p>What most people do not consider is: what if the problem was never access to grog, what if the problem is despair and depression? The sort of despair and depression that leads young people to suicide, to petrol sniffing, to underage drinking. The sort of despair and depression that leads someone to choose death over the living world. In Darwin I once saved a man\u2019s life. I called him an ambulance when the security guard in the shopping centre, where he was asking for help, refused, deciding instead to remove him. Needless to say the sick man was Aboriginal.</p> <p>That was not the sad thing though. The sad thing was that he kept saying, again and again, that what he really wanted was to see his parents, go to his old-people. That was why, he said, he kept \u2018forgetting\u2019 to take his medication. Deep down, I don\u2019t think he wanted to live.</p> <p>This is not about grog bans. The banning of grog in a community should always be a decision of the community, not something imposed from outside. Such a thing should be part of self-determination, not part of a wholesale removal of rights that white people take for granted.</p> <p>Remember, grog bans don\u2019t just hurt the problem drinkers, they also punish sensible drinkers who live in Indigenous communities. Imagine Christmas if the government had banned alcohol in your suburb. Imagine not even being able to cook with wine, ever.</p> <p>Remember how well prohibition went in the USA. All it did was lead to organised crime. Already white crime gangs smuggle grog into Aboriginal communities, even the government knows about that; that\u2019s why the penalties are so high. Nobody deprived of simple pleasures by outside forces takes it lightly and simply obeys. Nobody.</p> <p>This is not about grog. This is also about suicide and hopelessness. There\u2019s an epidemic of suicide among the youth of Indigenous communities. It\u2019s hard if not impossible to be sure why young people are ending their lives in Indigenous communities, but I would argue that the laws treating our kids like they are second-class citizens and the government telling them their parents are not good enough are certainly not helping.</p> <p>It is not genetics or an inherent moral failure that led to the epidemic of petrol sniffing among Indigenous youth in remote communities. It\u2019s depression and a desperate desire to not have to feel it. It must be, otherwise such an epidemic would infect Indigenous youth in urban areas, in the cities, in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth.</p> <p>This is about paternalism, about a country that even when not being intolerably racist believes the First Nations people are not able to look after ourselves. That\u2019s if I am being generous and assuming the government has the best of intentions and is not just using paternalism as a way to control us.</p> <p>This is about the intervention; not the after-effects so much, although they are unacceptable, but rather the thinking of a government, a bipartisan decision that stripped Indigenous people of our human rights on the basis of a lie. It is not particularly well known, even among Indigenous people, but the \u2018crisis\u2019 that the intervention was intended to solve was manufactured, artificial, fake. The intervention was essentially built on a scaffold of lies; lies that there were child-rape rings in the Northern Territory.</p> <p>When experts investigated the child-rape gang allegations during the intervention they found nothing. Child rape happens but it happens everywhere in Australia, the perpetrators are not of one race or culture. The urge to rape children is a sickness, not a part of any culture. Yet the government is not attempting to intervene across the entire country.</p> <p>They intervened in Indigenous communities but resisted doing anything to stop child rape in the Catholic church. It was always about race.</p> <p>I have spoken to many people about the intervention, Indigenous and not; a common refrain is \u201cit was terrible but at least they saved the children\u201d. Even now people believe the lies, the lies that a moment of research would reveal. I want to know why, even after all this time, the government has not apologised for the lies and why the mainstream media has not held them accountable.</p> <p>It was defamation of an entire culture.</p> <p>People still believe it.</p> <p>You can\u2019t unring a bell.</p> <p>If what is happening every day in the Northern Territory was occurring in another country nobody in Australia would stand for it. If there was a ban on booze entering any white community in any capital city in Australia, imposed on citizens by the government, there would be riots. The only reason people accept what is happening in the NT is that it\u2019s happening to Indigenous people, far out of sight.</p> <p>Australia is racist and happy for Indigenous people to suffer under a paternalistic, colonial iron fist.</p> <p>Indigenous people are forced to accept conditions that no other Australian would tolerate. We are blamed for the effects of colonisation in an extraordinary case of victim blaming. We have had the basics card, grog bans and the intervention layered on top of deaths in custody, high rates of incarceration and lack of prospects.</p> <p>If a paternalistic approach to Aboriginal affairs was ever going to work we, the Aboriginal people, would no longer suffer inequality.</p> <p>Alcohol, petrol sniffing and suicide are huge killers of Indigenous Australians but it could be argued they are not the root problem themselves but are a side-effect of depression, of hopelessness.</p> <p>What Indigenous communities need most right now is hope. People mistrust the system and the government so deeply they can see no hope for a future.</p> <p>Back in 1988, at Barunga festival, the Barunga statement was delivered to the then prime minister, Bob Hawke, who agreed to its terms and promised treaty with First Nations Australians. This event, and the government\u2019s subsequent failure to act, led eventually to Treaty by Yothu Yindi in 1991; perhaps the best known song by an Indigenous Australian in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/08/nt-signs-historic-barunga-agreement-to-begin-indigenous-treaty-talks\">NT signs historic Barunga agreement to begin Indigenous treaty talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr M Yunupingu said in the song Treaty \u201cI heard it on the radio, I saw it on the television\u201d about the lies in 1988, when treaty was offered. That song was written because despite a promise by the prime minister no treaty has ever been negotiated between Indigenous Australians and the people who invaded our continent. In 1991 Bob Hawke, leaving the office of prime minister, hung the Barunga statement on the wall of parliament. It\u2019s still there.</p> <p>At Barunga in 2018, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/08/nt-signs-historic-barunga-agreement-to-begin-indigenous-treaty-talks\">NT government offered a memorandum on treaty</a>, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who had fought for treaty all his life, said he did not know what treaty means anymore. I was there when treaty was promised again, when it went to radio, when even I reported it on social media. But it\u2019s only possible to listen to lies for a limited time before trust becomes impossible. Indigenous people have little reason for hope after all these years of interminable lying. I have only one hope, I hope the politicians do not expect us to trust them. We have no reason to.</p> <p>This essay is not about grog, not really. It\u2019s about self-determination. Grog and alcohol abuse is a symptom, not a cause. The cause is trauma, intergenerational trauma, and the institutional abuse and racism that perpetuates it; trauma that the intervention has worsened. The intervention was never about healing Indigenous communities, or if it was it was the most wrong-headed solution to the problem they could have imagined.</p> <p>It was paternalistic, it was ill-managed, it was a failure and I have begun to believe nobody will ever be held to account. If grog is tearing communities apart so are grog bans. What else should I call it when someone leaves their community never to return, or dies through misadventure, because they cannot drink at home?</p>",

      "bodyText": "I started writing this essay as I was drinking red wine from a stainless steel goblet at a picnic table in a rest area not far south of Alice Springs, on my way to the 33rd instalment of the legendary annual Barunga festival. It was essential that I finish my wine before I travelled much further as Barunga, in the Northern Territory, is a dry community. Drinking there is outlawed, possession of alcohol is prohibited but not as a response to community requests or desires. Rather it was instituted as part of the Northern Territory intervention that started with an act of parliament and an invasion of Indigenous communities by the Australian Defence Force more than 10 years ago and has never actually ended \u2013 despite several changes in federal government. If anyone is caught taking grog into a restricted community, all of which are Indigenous communities in the NT, the police can confiscate their vehicle. I have been warned, threatened, firsthand by NT police. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On my way to Kalkarindji, NT, for the festival celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Wavehill Walkoff in 2016, I was pulled over by about 20 police officers in something like 10 Landcruiser Troopcarriers who were checking every car for alcohol. I have never lived in a dictatorship but after that experience I can imagine what it would feel like. This was on the way to a celebration of one of the landmark moments in the birth of Indigenous land rights. Kalkarindji, where the Whitlam government gave freehold title to the traditional owners in 1975 and where, I was told, under the intervention the federal government stole their land again by forcing the traditional owners to lease their land to the commonwealth. Ironically, when you consider the campaigns against drink driving, in the Kimberley town of Derby in Western Australia it\u2019s impossible to buy alcohol unless you can present car keys to the liquor store staff. I don\u2019t know whose idea that was but it\u2019s spectacularly stupid. It could only have been instituted to stop the homeless Indigenous people, who live under trees in the town, from drinking. It\u2019s still stupid, being only able to buy drink if you are planning to drive away. If you are banned from drinking at home (or your friend\u2019s homes) and cannot afford to drink at the pub what would you do? Yes, I would drink in the park too. What people never consider, what if the reason there are so many Indigenous people drinking in parks and under trees is that they are denied the simple pleasure of drinking at home? If they are lucky enough to have a home at all. Many drinkers have left their communities to have access to alcohol, they have left their families, even children, they have moved away from where they can practice culture. Others drink in town and drive home to community, or drink in their cars on the way home. At Barunga a big screen showed videos, advertising campaigns and community projects from a number of Indigenous communities against drink driving. I have heard firsthand from community workers that the cause of a recent increase in drink driving is the grog bans. If you want to drink and are from an Aboriginal community from the NT you have only limited choices: you could move to a park or under a tree in the nearest town, drink there and be away from community. You could drink at the pub in the nearest town then drive home drunk or you can buy a carton of beer and drink it in the car as you drive back to your community. I have heard of white workers in Indigenous communities flouting the law and getting away with it. I have been told by white people how to get away with it. Also in Barunga, members of the community have asked for permission to open a social club where alcohol is served and the community and the elders can police it. They are sick of people being run over at night when walking the 30km to the community from the \u201cdrinker\u2019s camp\u201d \u2013 the first stop on the road outside the restricted zone \u2013 at night. When I visited Borroloola I was told that the only alcohol was half-strength beer and there was an 18-can limit; too bad if I wanted anything full-strength or gluten free. The nearest other grog was at Cape Crawford, more than 100km away. If Aboriginal people make that 200km round trip they cannot even take their drinks home, they must drink them as they drive or drink on the riverbank (among the crocodiles) or the side of the road where they would probably be arrested for vagrancy. At the liquor store in Katherine a police constable checks ID when you enter. They say they perform this duty, enforce this law, without prejudice. They say the laws are to stop problem drinkers. Everybody knows they exist to stop First Nations people from drinking. They have a \u201cbanned drinkers register\u201d, but I am curious how many white people have made that list. The police don\u2019t check the banned drinkers register anyway, the shop assistant does that. It is necessary, when buying a drink in Alice Springs or Katherine to hand over ID twice, once to police and once to the shop assistant. The police must be there to intimidate blackfellas who have learned over generations to be terrified of the police. How do I know that? Last time I was in Katherine I saw white people hand over their ID to the police and have it handed back after no more than a cursory glance. When an Aboriginal woman walked in they held her up for long enough to check her ID details on a tablet, and possibly they were also recording those details for later. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that they were checking to see if she had any outstanding warrants, something they did not do with any of the white people. It\u2019s not hard to imagine an Indigenous person being afraid to hand over their ID to a police constable; especially after our history. Even I am nervous about handing the police my ID. In Darwin, where most of the white people of the NT live, the police don\u2019t check ID when buying grog. This is despite the fact that people in Katherine, justifying the police checking my ID, said it was the same across the entire NT. This essay is not about grog, not about drink, not about grog bans. There are many places in Australia where grog has been banned through the decision of the traditional owners, I accept that. This is about a government, about successive governments, who believe they have the right to control Indigenous affairs. This is about white supremacy and a country that does not believe First Nations people deserve, have not the maturity, to manage our own affairs. The issue is summarised by the simple phrase \u201cabout us without us\u201d. What most people do not consider is: what if the problem was never access to grog, what if the problem is despair and depression? The sort of despair and depression that leads young people to suicide, to petrol sniffing, to underage drinking. The sort of despair and depression that leads someone to choose death over the living world. In Darwin I once saved a man\u2019s life. I called him an ambulance when the security guard in the shopping centre, where he was asking for help, refused, deciding instead to remove him. Needless to say the sick man was Aboriginal. That was not the sad thing though. The sad thing was that he kept saying, again and again, that what he really wanted was to see his parents, go to his old-people. That was why, he said, he kept \u2018forgetting\u2019 to take his medication. Deep down, I don\u2019t think he wanted to live. This is not about grog bans. The banning of grog in a community should always be a decision of the community, not something imposed from outside. Such a thing should be part of self-determination, not part of a wholesale removal of rights that white people take for granted. Remember, grog bans don\u2019t just hurt the problem drinkers, they also punish sensible drinkers who live in Indigenous communities. Imagine Christmas if the government had banned alcohol in your suburb. Imagine not even being able to cook with wine, ever. Remember how well prohibition went in the USA. All it did was lead to organised crime. Already white crime gangs smuggle grog into Aboriginal communities, even the government knows about that; that\u2019s why the penalties are so high. Nobody deprived of simple pleasures by outside forces takes it lightly and simply obeys. Nobody. This is not about grog. This is also about suicide and hopelessness. There\u2019s an epidemic of suicide among the youth of Indigenous communities. It\u2019s hard if not impossible to be sure why young people are ending their lives in Indigenous communities, but I would argue that the laws treating our kids like they are second-class citizens and the government telling them their parents are not good enough are certainly not helping. It is not genetics or an inherent moral failure that led to the epidemic of petrol sniffing among Indigenous youth in remote communities. It\u2019s depression and a desperate desire to not have to feel it. It must be, otherwise such an epidemic would infect Indigenous youth in urban areas, in the cities, in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth. This is about paternalism, about a country that even when not being intolerably racist believes the First Nations people are not able to look after ourselves. That\u2019s if I am being generous and assuming the government has the best of intentions and is not just using paternalism as a way to control us. This is about the intervention; not the after-effects so much, although they are unacceptable, but rather the thinking of a government, a bipartisan decision that stripped Indigenous people of our human rights on the basis of a lie. It is not particularly well known, even among Indigenous people, but the \u2018crisis\u2019 that the intervention was intended to solve was manufactured, artificial, fake. The intervention was essentially built on a scaffold of lies; lies that there were child-rape rings in the Northern Territory. When experts investigated the child-rape gang allegations during the intervention they found nothing. Child rape happens but it happens everywhere in Australia, the perpetrators are not of one race or culture. The urge to rape children is a sickness, not a part of any culture. Yet the government is not attempting to intervene across the entire country. They intervened in Indigenous communities but resisted doing anything to stop child rape in the Catholic church. It was always about race. I have spoken to many people about the intervention, Indigenous and not; a common refrain is \u201cit was terrible but at least they saved the children\u201d. Even now people believe the lies, the lies that a moment of research would reveal. I want to know why, even after all this time, the government has not apologised for the lies and why the mainstream media has not held them accountable. It was defamation of an entire culture. People still believe it. You can\u2019t unring a bell. If what is happening every day in the Northern Territory was occurring in another country nobody in Australia would stand for it. If there was a ban on booze entering any white community in any capital city in Australia, imposed on citizens by the government, there would be riots. The only reason people accept what is happening in the NT is that it\u2019s happening to Indigenous people, far out of sight. Australia is racist and happy for Indigenous people to suffer under a paternalistic, colonial iron fist. Indigenous people are forced to accept conditions that no other Australian would tolerate. We are blamed for the effects of colonisation in an extraordinary case of victim blaming. We have had the basics card, grog bans and the intervention layered on top of deaths in custody, high rates of incarceration and lack of prospects. If a paternalistic approach to Aboriginal affairs was ever going to work we, the Aboriginal people, would no longer suffer inequality. Alcohol, petrol sniffing and suicide are huge killers of Indigenous Australians but it could be argued they are not the root problem themselves but are a side-effect of depression, of hopelessness. What Indigenous communities need most right now is hope. People mistrust the system and the government so deeply they can see no hope for a future. Back in 1988, at Barunga festival, the Barunga statement was delivered to the then prime minister, Bob Hawke, who agreed to its terms and promised treaty with First Nations Australians. This event, and the government\u2019s subsequent failure to act, led eventually to Treaty by Yothu Yindi in 1991; perhaps the best known song by an Indigenous Australian in the world. Dr M Yunupingu said in the song Treaty \u201cI heard it on the radio, I saw it on the television\u201d about the lies in 1988, when treaty was offered. That song was written because despite a promise by the prime minister no treaty has ever been negotiated between Indigenous Australians and the people who invaded our continent. In 1991 Bob Hawke, leaving the office of prime minister, hung the Barunga statement on the wall of parliament. It\u2019s still there. At Barunga in 2018, when the NT government offered a memorandum on treaty, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who had fought for treaty all his life, said he did not know what treaty means anymore. I was there when treaty was promised again, when it went to radio, when even I reported it on social media. But it\u2019s only possible to listen to lies for a limited time before trust becomes impossible. Indigenous people have little reason for hope after all these years of interminable lying. I have only one hope, I hope the politicians do not expect us to trust them. We have no reason to. This essay is not about grog, not really. It\u2019s about self-determination. Grog and alcohol abuse is a symptom, not a cause. The cause is trauma, intergenerational trauma, and the institutional abuse and racism that perpetuates it; trauma that the intervention has worsened. The intervention was never about healing Indigenous communities, or if it was it was the most wrong-headed solution to the problem they could have imagined. It was paternalistic, it was ill-managed, it was a failure and I have begun to believe nobody will ever be held to account. If grog is tearing communities apart so are grog bans. What else should I call it when someone leaves their community never to return, or dies through misadventure, because they cannot drink at home?",

Minnie wasn\u2019t bonkers, but Bella, with the headscarf collection and interesting mascara, was. As happens in bad drama, Bella flipped as the denouement approached from improbably sweet and mild-mannered into misogynistically conceived psychopath, like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction and Rebecca de Mornay circa The Hand that Rocks the Cradle.</p> <p>But why? Spurned by Uno and his beard, traumatised by something that happened when she was 17 that we can\u2019t get into right now, Bella had last year murdered Josefine, kidnapped Elsa and hidden the child away from prying eyes, ultimately in the island\u2019s lighthouse. The following year, Bella returned to the retreat with new headscarves and the hots for the buff but otherwise boring business drone Johan. How Bella managed to look after Elsa, while having it off with Johan and taking part in a taxing daily programme of therapeutic group activities, was beyond me. And, indeed, perhaps beyond narrative logic.</p> <p>No matter. Minnie found out just before the end credits that not everything weird she had experienced was a hallucination. She stumbled across Josefine\u2019s abducted daughter in her lighthouse prison, only to be confronted and stabbed by the now demented Bella. Escaping to the lighthouse roof, Minnie collapsed looking wan and fetching though, you would imagine, fatally wounded. Not so. She rallied, rescued the girl, witnessed Uno get fatally stabbed by the full-on bonkers Bella and fled to the beach to be saved by Johan, who, though buff and boring, had undergone an unconvincing yacht-based spiritual epiphany and returned to be the hero. In the last shot, Minni\u2019es daughter came racing across tarmac to her mother strapped to a gurney, the suggestion being that, having saved one little girl from a psychopath, Minnie could now be a proper mother to her own child. None of it stood up to a moment\u2019s analysis.</p> <p>Even so, I know what I am going to do this summer. I\u2019m going on retreat. This happens after I watch Swedish dramas: I plan holidays.

In between shifts maintaining an overnight vigil by his coffin, researchers gathered materials with which to commemorate him.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working, we are making films, we are writing texts, but still I don\u2019t think we can accept that this situation is real,\u201d said Anna Mydlarska, head of the museum\u2019s documentary film section, ahead of Adamowicz\u2019s funeral on Saturday. She had first met him during a student strike in the late 1980s. \u201cI am working on all this material in which Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz is alive, and I can\u2019t fully accept and absorb the fact that he is now a part of history, a part of the past.

On Saturday, the streets of its picturesque old town were filled for his funeral in the giant brick St Mary\u2019s Basilica. Black-and-white photos of Adamowicz hung in shop windows as mourners carrying flags of Gda\u0144sk and Pomerania watched the service on big screens outside.</p> <p>The murder of Adamowicz, a staunch defender of minority rights at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/20/gdansk-poland-immigrant-identity-refugees\" title=\"\">time of rising levels of hate crime </a>and an ardent liberal critic of the ruling conservative party\u2019s anti-immigrant politics, has provoked an anguished and often ill-tempered national debate about hate speech and polarisation in Poland\u2019s deeply divided society.</p> <p>\u201cI am convinced that Pawe\u0142 would want me to say the following words,\u201d Dominican priest and anti-communist activist Ludwik Wi\u015bniewski declared in a powerful eulogy that drew applause from the congregation and the crowd outside. \u201cWe must end hate. We must end hate speech. We must end contempt. We must end baseless accusations against others.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pawe\u0142  would want me to say, we must end hate.

Gda\u0144sk was his beloved, and the city is his greatest monument.\u201d</p> <p>Adamowicz rose to prominence in 1988 as a law student at the University of Gda\u0144sk, where he led a student strike in solidarity with workers striking in the city\u2019s shipyard. \u201cIt was a period when people were tired of communism but they were also tired of fighting communism,\u201d recalled Wojciech Szel\u0105g, now a broadcaster, who participated in the strike. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a time of hope, it was a time you could paint only in grey. But I remember thinking that if people like Adamowicz were involved, it was worth it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe stood out \u2013 not just physically, because he was very tall but because he wasn\u2019t the slightest bit aggressive,\u201d said Mydlarska. \u201cHe was always smiling and ready to joke. He spoke slowly. He liked to quote the motto of Gda\u0144sk: <em>Nec temere, nec timide</em>, \u2018neither rashly, nor timidly\u2019 \u2013 he loved that motto.

      "bodyText": "Even as Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz was lying in state at Gda\u0144sk\u2019s European Solidarity Centre, a museum, archive, and public space dedicated to the history and values of the independent trade union born in the city\u2019s shipyards, its grief-stricken staff were preparing his entry into history. The opening of the museum in 2014 was the realisation of a dream for Adamowicz, a Gda\u0144sk native who had long sought to present his city to the world as a symbol of Europe\u2019s hard-won freedom. In between shifts maintaining an overnight vigil by his coffin, researchers gathered materials with which to commemorate him. \u201cWe are working, we are making films, we are writing texts, but still I don\u2019t think we can accept that this situation is real,\u201d said Anna Mydlarska, head of the museum\u2019s documentary film section, ahead of Adamowicz\u2019s funeral on Saturday. She had first met him during a student strike in the late 1980s. \u201cI am working on all this material in which Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz is alive, and I can\u2019t fully accept and absorb the fact that he is now a part of history, a part of the past. People are so shaken, we feel orphaned.\u201d Gda\u0144sk remains in mourning for its mayor, who was stabbed on stage at a charity concert last Sunday evening and died the following day. On Saturday, the streets of its picturesque old town were filled for his funeral in the giant brick St Mary\u2019s Basilica. Black-and-white photos of Adamowicz hung in shop windows as mourners carrying flags of Gda\u0144sk and Pomerania watched the service on big screens outside. The murder of Adamowicz, a staunch defender of minority rights at a time of rising levels of hate crime and an ardent liberal critic of the ruling conservative party\u2019s anti-immigrant politics, has provoked an anguished and often ill-tempered national debate about hate speech and polarisation in Poland\u2019s deeply divided society. \u201cI am convinced that Pawe\u0142 would want me to say the following words,\u201d Dominican priest and anti-communist activist Ludwik Wi\u015bniewski declared in a powerful eulogy that drew applause from the congregation and the crowd outside. \u201cWe must end hate. We must end hate speech. We must end contempt. We must end baseless accusations against others.\u201d But as the debate surrounding the circumstances of Adamowicz\u2019s death continues, attention in Gda\u0144sk is also turning to the life, legacy and personality of a native son who served as its mayor for more than 20 years, transcending many of Poland\u2019s traditional political and cultural divisions. \u201cHe had unbelievable warmth \u2013 you could see the sympathy in his eyes,\u201d said Jerzy Limon, professor of English at the University of Gda\u0144sk, and a friend. \u201cHis love of the city was so strong, he was not one of those politicians who could just go anywhere. Gda\u0144sk was his beloved, and the city is his greatest monument.\u201d Adamowicz rose to prominence in 1988 as a law student at the University of Gda\u0144sk, where he led a student strike in solidarity with workers striking in the city\u2019s shipyard. \u201cIt was a period when people were tired of communism but they were also tired of fighting communism,\u201d recalled Wojciech Szel\u0105g, now a broadcaster, who participated in the strike. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a time of hope, it was a time you could paint only in grey. But I remember thinking that if people like Adamowicz were involved, it was worth it.\u201d \u201cHe stood out \u2013 not just physically, because he was very tall but because he wasn\u2019t the slightest bit aggressive,\u201d said Mydlarska. \u201cHe was always smiling and ready to joke. He spoke slowly. He liked to quote the motto of Gda\u0144sk: Nec temere, nec timide, \u2018neither rashly, nor timidly\u2019 \u2013 he loved that motto. He was part of the Gda\u0144sk tradition of courage without aggression.\u201d After the fall of communism, and still in his 20s, Adamowicz was elected to the city council in 1990, serving as head of the council from 1994 until his election as president of the city in 1998 at the age of 32. Those who knew and worked with him say his worldview was profoundly shaped by the experiences of his parents, who moved to Gda\u0144sk in the 1940s from Vilnius, now the capital of Lithuania, as part of a wave of Polish people expelled from territory seized by the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the second world war.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes it\u2019s hard to be a striker. Or a No 9. Or a nine and a half. Or a fluid high-pressing false 11.</p> <p>There were six forwards of varying types on show as this match kicked off. None of them were your orthodox, meat-and-potatoes centre-forward \u2013 although Eden Hazard did make a dutiful attempt at standing with his back to goal while the ball sailed over his head, taking to the central role with all the refined disdain of a concert violinist making ends meet by delivering flat-pack furniture out of the back of a truck.</p> <p>Of the six it was Alexandre Lacazette who impressed most; who scored a lovely little miniature of a goal to set up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal\u2019s win</a>; and who looked the most at home in his high-pressure wide-right role, both the architect and the executioner of this game\u2019s best moments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-players-extremely-difficult-to-motivate-arsenal\">Maurizio Sarri says Chelsea\u2019s players are \u2018extremely difficult to motivate\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As half-time approached Lacazette could be seen sprinting back 40 yards from the halfway line, legs whirring, gloved hands paddling close to the ground, winning the ball in the left-back position before surging off another 70 yards at full speed in order to close down Kepa Arrizabalaga in the Chelsea area.</p> <p>The Arsenal fans cheered and whooped at the sheer unstinting effort from the man who is, technically, their No 9. Lacazette crouched on the turf, thighs burning, chest heaving. But then he perhaps feels there\u2019s not much point in going into power-saving mode at all while he\u2019s actually on the pitch.</p> <p>Lacazette has completed 90 minutes for Arsenal once since 11 November, although he has now scored eight Premier League goals and assisted five this season having made only 14 starts. He was substituted here too, trudging off on 68 minutes to a standing ovation.</p> <p>And within half an hour of the game ending a Twitter account that appears to emanate from his agent Score Agencies had posted a tweet reading: \u201cEst ce que c\u2019est le remplacement de trop? Next stage .....\u201d, with the hashtags #Lacazette #Gunners #ByeBye\u201d</p> <p>Really? Hashtag ByeBye? Say it ain\u2019t so, Alex. For those opening 45 minutes Lacazette had been the best player on the pitch in what was a frantic, slightly muddled game. Around him, meanwhile, there were differing fortunes for that mixed and muddled attacking six.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Laurent Koscielny\u2019s unusual goal seals victory for Arsenal over Chelsea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the game Maurizio Sarri would rage at his players for their lack of passion, a more digestible reason for his team\u2019s poor performance than sending out players in ill-fitting roles. Once again Hazard looked like a diamond hat pin being used to lever open a tin of soup. To his left Willian dropped his shoulder and tried his one convincing trick, the one where he cuts inside and does what Willian always does. On the right Pedro scurried hopefully without ever threatening to arrive.</p> <p>There was also a change of front-line for Arsenal. Albeit a more successful one, with Aaron Ramsey at the point of the midfield diamond behind Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang and Lacazette. Mesut \u00d6zil was again skulking as a spare part on the bench \u2013 which is at least a change from his other setting: skulking as a spare part on the pitch.</p> <p>For a while Ramsey played the same way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/08/tottenham-chelsea-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">Dele Alli had against Chelsea</a>, operating as a kind of roving forward, bouncer, there to harry and press Jorginho, who is so key to the way Chelsea move the ball forward.</p> <p>Aubameyang moved beautifully and might have had a hat-trick on another day. But it was Lacazette who really caught the eye, a player who is more used than most to finding a hole to fill in this team.</p> <p>He can do it all too: dribbling, holding the ball, passing nicely and haring back to cover. Little wonder the Arsenal support are so fond of him. And rightly so given his obvious hunger for the cause, his willingness to play wide or centrally.</p> <p>In that early period Arsenal were quicker in the challenge, and well-drilled in their high press, swarming around the Jorginho zone with a studied malevolence. The opening goal was coming.</p> <p>With 14 minutes gone Lacazette took the ball inside the Chelsea penalty area, turned away from Pedro with a swivel of the hips, then veered around a stiff-looking Marcos Alonso, defending with all the abrasive agility of a decommissioned Dalek. There seemed no free space to hit from a narrow angle on the right.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes it\u2019s hard to be a striker. Or a No 9. Or a nine and a half. Or a fluid high-pressing false 11. There were six forwards of varying types on show as this match kicked off. None of them were your orthodox, meat-and-potatoes centre-forward \u2013 although Eden Hazard did make a dutiful attempt at standing with his back to goal while the ball sailed over his head, taking to the central role with all the refined disdain of a concert violinist making ends meet by delivering flat-pack furniture out of the back of a truck. Of the six it was Alexandre Lacazette who impressed most; who scored a lovely little miniature of a goal to set up Arsenal\u2019s win; and who looked the most at home in his high-pressure wide-right role, both the architect and the executioner of this game\u2019s best moments. As half-time approached Lacazette could be seen sprinting back 40 yards from the halfway line, legs whirring, gloved hands paddling close to the ground, winning the ball in the left-back position before surging off another 70 yards at full speed in order to close down Kepa Arrizabalaga in the Chelsea area. The Arsenal fans cheered and whooped at the sheer unstinting effort from the man who is, technically, their No 9. Lacazette crouched on the turf, thighs burning, chest heaving. But then he perhaps feels there\u2019s not much point in going into power-saving mode at all while he\u2019s actually on the pitch. Lacazette has completed 90 minutes for Arsenal once since 11 November, although he has now scored eight Premier League goals and assisted five this season having made only 14 starts. He was substituted here too, trudging off on 68 minutes to a standing ovation. And within half an hour of the game ending a Twitter account that appears to emanate from his agent Score Agencies had posted a tweet reading: \u201cEst ce que c\u2019est le remplacement de trop? Next stage .....\u201d, with the hashtags #Lacazette #Gunners #ByeBye\u201d Really? Hashtag ByeBye? Say it ain\u2019t so, Alex. For those opening 45 minutes Lacazette had been the best player on the pitch in what was a frantic, slightly muddled game. Around him, meanwhile, there were differing fortunes for that mixed and muddled attacking six. After the game Maurizio Sarri would rage at his players for their lack of passion, a more digestible reason for his team\u2019s poor performance than sending out players in ill-fitting roles. Once again Hazard looked like a diamond hat pin being used to lever open a tin of soup. To his left Willian dropped his shoulder and tried his one convincing trick, the one where he cuts inside and does what Willian always does. On the right Pedro scurried hopefully without ever threatening to arrive. There was also a change of front-line for Arsenal. Albeit a more successful one, with Aaron Ramsey at the point of the midfield diamond behind Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang and Lacazette. Mesut \u00d6zil was again skulking as a spare part on the bench \u2013 which is at least a change from his other setting: skulking as a spare part on the pitch. For a while Ramsey played the same way Dele Alli had against Chelsea, operating as a kind of roving forward, bouncer, there to harry and press Jorginho, who is so key to the way Chelsea move the ball forward. Aubameyang moved beautifully and might have had a hat-trick on another day. But it was Lacazette who really caught the eye, a player who is more used than most to finding a hole to fill in this team. He can do it all too: dribbling, holding the ball, passing nicely and haring back to cover. Little wonder the Arsenal support are so fond of him. And rightly so given his obvious hunger for the cause, his willingness to play wide or centrally. In that early period Arsenal were quicker in the challenge, and well-drilled in their high press, swarming around the Jorginho zone with a studied malevolence. The opening goal was coming. With 14 minutes gone Lacazette took the ball inside the Chelsea penalty area, turned away from Pedro with a swivel of the hips, then veered around a stiff-looking Marcos Alonso, defending with all the abrasive agility of a decommissioned Dalek. There seemed no free space to hit from a narrow angle on the right. But somehow Lacazette spotted a small square of vacant netting and spanked the ball into it with such thrillingly vicious accuracy it was past Arrizabalaga before he could do any more than flail his arms uselessly. Both these teams remain early-stage projects, half-formed ideas. To his credit Unai Emery has shown that even as he builds this team he is unafraid to bench and shuffle his starriest attacking players, whatever their agents \u2013 or indeed their agents\u2019 social media feeds \u2013 might think about it. But small details can often matter more than positional and tactical cuteness, and there was enough edge and fury in Lacazette\u2019s sublime opening half hour to do for Chelsea here.",

      "bodyText": "A parliamentary inquiry should examine the actions of the Australian federal police which led to the arrest of Hakeem al-Araibi in Thailand, Australia\u2019s peak union body and the Greens have said. Al-Araibi, a 25-year-old Bahraini refugee who has permanent residency in Australia, was arrested on arrival in Bangkok for a holiday, on the basis of an Interpol red notice, which was later lifted. He has been in detention in Bangkok for almost two months, while Thai authorities process an extradition request from Bahrain. Australia\u2019s peak workers group, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has called for a formal inquiry into the AFP\u2019s processes and the role of Australian authorities in the lead up to his arrest. Key questions about the complicated case remain unanswered, including the actions of the AFP and its officers seconded to the country\u2019s Interpol bureau, which alerted Thailand to Al-Araibi\u2019s travel plans because of the red notice against him. The red notice was erroneously issued by Interpol against its own protocols which ban the granting of red notices for refugees on behalf of the country from which the individual fled. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply disturbing that our own authorities would help a country to extradite an Australian resident when they are accused of torturing that person,\u201d said the ACTU president, Michele O\u2019Neil. \u201cWe are\u2026 calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the circumstances around his detention, and the role Australian authorities played in this awful situation. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable for Australian government authorities to help repressive regimes get their hands on people they wish to torture and unfairly detain, and we need to make sure it never happens again.\u201d Guardian Australia has been told the process by which the AFP alerted Thailand to Al-Araibi\u2019s travel was largely automatic, however the details of that process are unclear, as is the reason Al-Araibi\u2019s refugee status went unnoticed or unnoted during the granting of the red notice. The AFP has previously said membership of Interpol creates \u201ccertain obligations\u201d for member countries, that the red notice was not put in place by Australia, and that Thailand would have otherwise become aware of the red notice at the point of Al-Araibi\u2019s arrival. Interpol has repeatedly refused to answer questions about why it granted Bahrain\u2019s request for a red notice, which was issued on the same day Al-Araibi received his visa for Thailand. It also is unclear how Bahrain knew Al-Araibi was intending to travel. Greens senator Nick McKim said his party would work collaboratively with Labor and crossbenchers to establish and conduct the ACTU\u2019s proposed inquiry. \u201cThe handling of Hakeem\u2019s case by Australian authorities certainly warrants the scrutiny of the Senate,\u201d McKim told Guardian Australia. \u201cHakeem\u2019s life and liberty are at serious risk, and we need to get to the bottom of how this terrible situation came to pass.\u201d Mark Dreyfus, the acting shadow minister for justice, would not comment specifically on whether Labor supported an inquiry, but said the opposition party was concerned about Al-Araibi and had joined calls for his release. \u201cWe are focused on supporting the government\u2019s efforts to secure his return to Australia,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cWe have requested a briefing from the Home Affairs department regarding the Interpol notice to ensure that proper processes were followed.\u201d The Home Affairs department and its minister, Peter Dutton, were contacted for comment but neither responded. The foreign affairs department and its minister, Marise Payne, has repeatedly lobbied Thailand and Bahrain, privately and publicly, for Al-Araibi\u2019s release, including in a ministerial visit to Thailand earlier this month. \u201cThe Thai government is well aware, at all levels, of the importance of this matter to Australia,\u201d a spokesman for Payne said. \u201cThe Australian government is making extensive efforts to seek his safe return to Australia, and will continue to advocate for this,\u201d he said. \u201cEmbassy staff continue to make regular consular visits to Mr Al-Araibi at the Bangkok remand prison and are in regular contact with prison authorities about his welfare. We note that there are legal proceedings underway in relation to Mr Al-Araibi and Australia will continue to be in close contact with Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s lawyer and Thai authorities in relation to the case.\u201d The spokesman did not respond to specific questions about the parliamentary inquiry.",

Some, however, have raised questions about her liberal bona fides, given some of the more conservative positions she has taken in the past on issues including immigration and gun control. \u201cShe\u2019s evolved on so many issues,\u201d said Dylan Meyer, an ISU senior who has followed Gillibrand\u2019s career since she entered the Senate. \u201cTime will tell [what she really believes].\u201d The senator\u2019s most immediate challenge will be to build the kind of name recognition she will need to stand out in what\u2019s expected to be a crowded field \u2013 especially if heavy-hitters like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders jump in. Strong early appearances in Iowa, which holds the first contest of the Democratic primary in February 2020, will be essential to proving to voters here that \u201cshe has the chops to be a serious candidate for the Democratic nomination\u201d, Joe Shanahan, a veteran Democratic strategist in Des Moines, told the Guardian in an email. Gillibrand\u2019s Iowa schedule also included visits to Sioux City, Boone and Des Moines, where she spoke at the Women\u2019s March on Saturday afternoon. Many in the crowd in Ames who spoke to the Guardian said they went into the event not knowing a huge amount about the New York Democrat, but liked what they heard. \u201cI really like her style,\u201d said Tom Emmerson, a resident of Ames. \u201cIt looks like she\u2019s speaking from the heart.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with her,\u201d said his wife, Linda Emmerson. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good start.\u201d",

But the fact of the matter is it appears this group of players are extremely difficult to motivate. When you see this kind of game, when one team is quite obviously more determined than the other, you can\u2019t really talk about tactics.

      "bodyText": "Maurizio Sarri launched a stinging attack on his Chelsea players\u2019 mentality after a meek defeat to Arsenal, accusing them of being \u201cextremely difficult to motivate\u201d and lacking \u201cferocity\u201d in their game. For the first time since taking over at Stamford Bridge six months ago, Sarri felt compelled to revert to his native Italian and lean on an interpreter to express his exasperation at a defeat which means Chelsea\u2019s lead over Arsenal and Manchester United has been cut to only three points. The head coach suggested he wanted to make his \u201cmessage very clear, without mistakes with my English\u201d before ripping into his team\u2019s shot-shy display. Chelsea\u2019s first shot on target did not come until the 82nd minute, from Marcos Alonso. \u201cI have to say that I\u2019m extremely angry, very angry indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis defeat was due to our mentality more than anything else, our mental approach. We played against a team which, mentally, was far more determined than we were. And this is something I can\u2019t accept. We had a similar issue in the league game at Tottenham [a 3-1 defeat in November]. We spoke a great deal about that loss and our approach at the time, and I spoke to the players, and I thought we\u2019d overcome this issue. \u201cBut it appears we still seem to lack sufficient motivation, being mentally solid and determination. So I\u2019m not happy, I\u2019m really not happy. I\u2019d prefer to be in the changing room, speaking to the players, to talk about why we lost from a tactical point of view. But the fact of the matter is it appears this group of players are extremely difficult to motivate. When you see this kind of game, when one team is quite obviously more determined than the other, you can\u2019t really talk about tactics. From a technical point of view both teams are pretty much on the same level, but Arsenal were more determined. Tactics don\u2019t come into it. \u201cTheir high level of determination was obvious throughout, particularly in both penalty areas. If you think about their determination and how clinical they were when they scored the goals, in defence we stood off a lot and we were not determined and not strong enough. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we could have lost that game anyway, but we could have lost it for tactical reasons. We lost it because of our determination. I couldn\u2019t possibly say I am not responsible as well, in part at least, for the mental approach. That\u2019s something we have to share.\u201d Sarri, who hopes to add the Juventus striker Gonzalo Higua\u00edn to his options before the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Spurs on Thursday, has been critical of his players\u2019 attitude at times this season, suggesting they can be guilty of complacency when ahead in matches. But the Italian remains uncertain how to instil more motivation into the group. \u201cIt seems to me that, as a group of players, they\u2019re not particularly aggressive from a mental point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that ferocity in their mentality. That\u2019s down to the type of players they are, their characteristics. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is difficult to change. You have to try and influence their mentality and it could take quite a long time, or, by the same token, it could be changed with a new player coming in or one of the old heads in the team assuming more responsibility and driving the rest of the team forward.\u201d Asked if he remains the right man to oversee Chelsea\u2019s progression, he added: \u201cYes, absolutely.

But what we need to become is a team capable of adapting, a team that can perhaps suffer for 10-15 minutes during the game but then play our own football. \u201cToday we didn\u2019t play our own football.

Friends of the Speaker who have been in touch with him in the last 48 hours told the Observer that Bercow is now \u201cseriously reflecting\u201d on whether to stay on \u2013 possibly until 2022. Government sources briefed last week that someone who had \u201ccheated centuries of procedure\u201d should not expect to be elevated to the House of Lords. One source who knows Bercow\u2019s thinking said that if the Conservative government was seeking to \u201cpunish\u201d the Speaker for how he conducted parliamentary business \u2013 and themselves defy centuries of convention under which Speakers are granted peerages on retirement \u2013 he could well exercise his right to remain in the Commons chair until the end of this parliament, rather than leave soon after Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Ministers are facing calls to shelve Margaret Thatcher\u2019s totemic right-to-buy scheme after a devastating analysis revealed that more than 40% of council houses sold under its terms in London are now privately rented. The damning findings of an analysis of Freedom of Information data also show that: \u2022 Tens of millions of pounds are being paid by local authorities to rent former council homes in order to house growing numbers of homeless families; \u2022 Some councils have bought back their former homes at more than six times the amount they sold them for; \u2022 Hundreds of private landlords now own five or more right-to-buy properties. There are several London boroughs where more than half the houses sold through the policy are now in the hands of private landlords. Private renters have to pay more than people living in council-owned properties. Labour London assembly member Tom Copley, who released the report containing the new data, said the findings provided fresh evidence for why right-to-buy should be scrapped in the capital. \u201cSomething has gone very wrong when tens of thousands of homes built to be let at social rents for the public good are now being rented out at market rates for private profit, sometimes back to the very councils that were forced to sell them,\u201d he said. Right-to-buy, which offers discounts to council tenants who buy their home, has been in place since 1980 and was boosted in 2012 under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. The latest analysis found that 42% of homes sold under the scheme in London are now rented out by private landlords, up from 36% in 2014. Around 466 individuals or companies have the leasehold for at least five former council homes each, while there are 2,333 right-to-buy properties where the local authority pays private landlords to house homeless families across London. Councils have spent \u00a322m a year on renting back properties they once owned to use as temporary accommodation. In Ealing, the council has spent \u00a3107m buying back 516 former council properties that it had originally sold for \u00a316m. Peter Mason, Ealing\u2019s cabinet member for housing, said the report highlighted \u201cexactly some of the more unforgivable impacts of Thatcher\u2019s right-to-buy scheme, which she launched with great fanfare in Northolt [a town in the borough of Ealing]\u201d. \u201cEaling council passionately believes in council house building, which is why we have launched the biggest programme in London,\u201d he said. \u201cBetween increased land prices, a long-term cap on borrowing and being forced to give up much of the receipts from the sale of council homes, the system as it stands is entirely rigged against local authorities who wish to build new council homes.\u201d According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, local authorities and housing associations in England have built one home for every two sold under the right-to-buy scheme. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, said: \u201cSocial housing is more affordable and more secure than private renting, and provides much-needed stability for those at risk of homelessness. It is unacceptable to see what little social housing options are available are being removed. \u201cWhat we need to see from the government going forward is suspension of the right-to-buy while it invests to build the 90,000 social homes needed in England each year to keep up with demand.\u201d Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s likely to be too late for a ban on right-to-buy having a significant impact on London, as the remaining social housing stock is largely concentrated among low-income households. But what these figures do show is the acute need to build more homes in the capital across a range of tenures, including social housing.\u201d Polly Neate, chief executive at Shelter, called for 3.1 million new social homes to address the housing crisis. \u201cWhile right-to-buy has helped many families get on to the housing ladder, just three years after it was introduced in 1980, the supply of properties available for social rent had halved \u2013 pulling up the ladder for future generations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in the ridiculous position of seeing local authorities across the country, not just in London, renting former council properties back from private landlords, at great expense, in order to house growing numbers of homeless families.\u201d Government officials said right-to-buy purchasers must repay a portion of their discount to their council if they sell within the first five years. And those who sell within 10 years of purchase must offer their local authority first refusal to buy it back. Kit Malthouse, the housing minister, said: \u201cUnder our right-to-buy scheme, over 100,000 social housing tenants have now got a foot on the property ladder since 2010, including more than 17,000 in London.

The offer to examine a possible timetable for a second vote drawn up by the Lib Dems was made during discussions between senior Liberal Democrats and two cabinet ministers involved in the talks, Michael Gove and David Lidington, in the Cabinet Office on Thursday morning. While Theresa May\u2019s government remains strongly opposed to the idea of returning the issue of Brexit to the electorate, the revelation by Cable shows that ministers are determined to look at a wide range of ideas being put forward by opposition parties. The government insists that any referendum that could reverse the 2016 decision to leave the EU would be a betrayal of the will of the people. It has also suggested that a second vote would take up to a year to prepare and conduct. But the Liberal Democrats have produced draft legislation which they say would allow one to be held far sooner: before the next European elections in May. Cable spoke in the Commons to the prime minister on Wednesday evening, after Labour\u2019s no-confidence motion was defeated and soon after May had said she was ready to open talks on a way forward with opposition MPs, including party leaders. Cable stressed in those talks with May, which were described as \u201cpolite and cordial\u201d, that his party\u2019s central demand was for a second referendum.

But that\u2019s a debate for another day. Arsenal were marvellous this evening, and after a rocky period will be considering the possibility of Champions League football next season, something that seemed well beyond them not so long ago. It\u2019ll be a hell of a battle, though, when you factor Manchester United\u2019s absurd momentum into the equation.

      "bodyText": "No word from Maurizio Sarri. So that\u2019s your lot! A big win for Arsenal; a big worry for Maurizio Sarri, whose Chelsea continue to stutter. It\u2019s going to be some battle for the Champions League places now. Thanks for reading! Unai Emery speaks! He praises the atmosphere, wanting to win the derby for the fans. This victory will give the team optimism, he says, and Arsenal can be happy. His team need to find a balance home and away, because they are very strong at home. They are going to continue working to find that balance. Dominic Fifield was our man at the Emirates tonight. Here\u2019s his match report! That\u2019s only Bernd Leno\u2019s second clean sheet in the Premier League. No coincidence that captain Laurent Koscielny, today\u2019s man of the match, is back in the team after that lengthy injury lay-off. No coincidence that the midfield consists of that hard-working Torreira-Xhaka-Guendouzi axis. You have to wonder how much longer Mesut Ozil will be at the club. But that\u2019s a debate for another day. Arsenal were marvellous this evening, and after a rocky period will be considering the possibility of Champions League football next season, something that seemed well beyond them not so long ago. It\u2019ll be a hell of a battle, though, when you factor Manchester United\u2019s absurd momentum into the equation. Misfiring Chelsea might be worried that they\u2019re heading in the opposite direction. Sarri has a few things to think about. And that\u2019s that! Arsenal deservedly win this big London derby! They regain fifth spot, above Manchester United on goal difference, having got back on the horse after last week\u2019s defeat at West Ham. Chelsea\u2019s stuttering form continues, though, and now they\u2019re just three points ahead of the Gunners in fourth. A huge win for Unai Emery; a worrying performance for Maurizio Sarri. 90 min +5: Barkley is booked for an Eighties-style lunge on Guendouzi. \u201cKoscielny has been tremendous today,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cHe seems like a really nice guy, so I\u2019m pleased for him that he\u2019s back from injury. As an Arsenal fan I\u2019m also happy, because a fully fit Koscielny is, to borrow a phrase, like a new signing.\u201d 90 min +4: Chelsea stroke it about. But Arsenal hold their shape. Giroud crosses from the left to nobody. Leno gathers. 90 min +2: Kante is this close to sending Hazard away down the middle. But Maitland-Niles gets a toenail to the pass, diverting it away from danger. What a last-ditch intervention! 90 min +1: That\u2019s given Chelsea a little boost, and Hazard goes scampering down the left. He shuttles the ball further forward for Barkley, who reaches the byline and rolls a ball across the face of goal. Whereupon Giroud fresh-air swipes. It\u2019s not Chelsea\u2019s day. 90 min: There will be six additional minutes. 89 min: It\u2019s all very scrappy, and that suits Arsenal just fine. 87 min: Alonso goes dancing down the inside-left channel. he beats a couple of challenges before eventually clattering into Koscielny and conceding a foul. An opportunity for Arsenal to manage the clock, as the defender takes his own sweet time to get back up, in the professional style. 85 min: Iwobi tears down the left. He drives at Azpilicueta before rolling a pass inside for Elneny, who hoicks a shot miles over the bar from distance. 84 min: Torreira has put in some shift today, and unsurprisingly goes down with cramp. He gets back up and will be fine to continue, but expect plenty of added time at the end of the 90. 83 min: Space for Alonso down the left. He loops towards the far post, where Hudson-Odoi lurks. But Kolasinac rises highest, and guides the calmest of headers back towards Leno. 81 min: Elneny dinks a pass down the inside-left channel. Kolasinac opts for the spectacular, looking to volley across Kepa and into the top right. Full marks for ambition, and it\u2019s a decent enough effort, too. He catches it well, and it deflects off Rudiger. The resulting corner comes to nothing. 80 min: Hudson-Odoi comes on for Pedro. 79 min: Pedro and Alonso combine well down the left, and the latter earns a corner off Maitland-Niles. Hazard whips it long. Alonso wafts his hand in Maitland-Niles\u2019 face as they compete for the ball. No foul. Instead, it\u2019s another wasted corner. 77 min: Pedro does enough to win a corner off Sokratis down the left, but he\u2019s not getting the decision. He has the good grace to laugh at his own misfortune. Then Hazard dribbles with purpose down the right, before cutting inside and sending a screamer over the bar in an attempt to find the top left. 76 min: Chelsea are beginning to push Arsenal back again. The home side are struggling to get hold of the ball. But they hold their shape, and the clock ticks on. 74 min: Barkley fizzes a ball across the face of the Arsenal goal from left to right, but there\u2019s nobody in blue to take advantage. 73 min: Hazard strokes a diagonal pass towards Pedro, just inside the Arsenal box on the right. Pedro takes a fresh-air swipe at the ball. The home support manage a quiet \u201cyay\u201d, but their heart\u2019s not in it. The Emirates is a wee bit deflated in the wake of Bellerin\u2019s injury. 72 min: Pedro comes across to wish Bellerin the best as he\u2019s carted off. The poor lad\u2019s got his leg in a splint, and his arm over his eyes. He gets a warm, sympathetic ovation as he departs down the tunnel. Elneny comes on in his stead. 70 min: Bellerin is down, and sadly it looks serious. There didn\u2019t seem to be any contact as he went down independently, and he immediately grabbed his left leg. He\u2019s currently being loaded onto a stretcher. 68 min: Changes all round. Arsenal replace Ramsey and Lacazette with Maitland-Niles and Iwobi, while Chelsea swap Willian for Giroud. A strange one that from Sarri; Willian\u2019s looked one of Chelsea\u2019s big dangers this evening. 66 min: Barkley has a dig that catches poor Koscielny in the fruit bowl. Ooyah, oof. 65 min: Chelsea are seriously rocking all of a sudden. Aubameyang sends Bellerin clear down the right. He\u2019s got Lacazette free in the middle, waiting to tap in. But allows Rudiger to deflect the cross out for a corner, which leads to nowt. How is this still 2-0? 64 min: And now Kolasinac bombs down the inside-left channel and into the Chelsea box! He\u2019s only got Kepa to beat, but the angle\u2019s tight so he looks to find Torreira in the middle. However Alonso\u2019s on hand to make a last-ditch clearance! 63 min: First up, Barkley comes on in place of Kovacic. Then Torreira takes the free kick, and floats it to the far post, where Aubameyang only just fails to connect. 62 min: A lovely sweeping move by Arsenal, right to left, featuring Xhaka, Guendouzi and Kolasinac. Eventually Lacazette jigs down the inside left and is clattered by Jorginho. A free kick in a very dangerous position. 61 min: Chelsea are beginning to press Arsenal back. The hosts are struggling to get out of their final third. Willian is seeing an awful lot of the ball on the left; he drops a shoulder to mooch inside before seeing his shot from the edge of the box blocked, and bounce softly towards Leno. 59 min: Hazard plays the cutest reverse pass down the inside-left channel, releasing Kovacic into the area. Kovacic pulls one back, but Koscielny stoops to cushion the cross down with his chest, and Bellerin belts the dropping ball clear. 57 min: Willian dribbles down the left again. Upon reaching the byline, he\u2019s stopped by Sokratis\u2019 slide. The ball clanks off the Chelsea winger, and the Arsenal defender, fist clenched, celebrates the tackle like another might a goal. 56 min: His mood\u2019s nearly improved as Willian sashays down the left and pulls back for Pedro, who has romped clear of Guendouzi. But Pedro slashes wildly over the bar from the edge of the box. 55 min: Azpilicueta, out right, slips a diagonal pass into the Arsenal area. But everyone in blue is back on their heels, and it\u2019s an easy interception for Torreira. On the touchline, Sarri continues to fume, waving his arms about and screaming at his players. 53 min: Willian finds a little time and space down the left. His cross is deflected out ... but for a goal kick, slapping into the back of Alonso, who was in the process of undertaking him. Chelsea are beginning to look a little frustrated. \u201cEmery justifies the tactical decision to leave out Ozil when the team hassle, press, tackle and play with high levels of energy like this,\u201d observes William Hargreaves. \u201cCf. Aubameyang chasing back.\u201d 51 min: And the luck\u2019s been on their side too, of course. There\u2019s Koscielny\u2019s goal, and now Torreira slices horribly on the edge of his own area, only for the ball to evade all nearby blue shirts and drop into the grateful arms of Leno. 50 min: An almighty scramble in the Arsenal box, Willian, Hazard and Jorginho making their presence felt. But they can\u2019t carve out a shooting opportunity, and the ball eventually balloons up into the arms of Leno. Chelsea have had the majority of the possession this evening, but Arsenal continue to look comfortable. 48 min: Hazard probes down the left but there aren\u2019t many options for him. He eventually lays off to Willian, who flicks a pass down the channel, expecting Hazard to be there as well. But even the Belgian maestro can\u2019t be in two places at once. 47 min: Kolasinac goes barrelling down the left wing a couple of times. The first occasion sees him nearly find Ramsey with a cutback, the second has him flagged offside. Both times, he was in acres. Chelsea need to get wise to this. Here we go again! Chelsea get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes. The visitors were sent out early by Maurizio Sarri, who may or may not have given his team some trenchant advice during the break. Half-time reading. As things stand, Arsenal will be back in fifth place, three points behind Chelsea and ahead of Manchester United on goal difference. Whatever happens in the second half, the race for Europe is hotting up. A most satisfactory first half for the Gunners, who have been by far the better team. Chelsea have had their moments, but have never quite got themselves going. They\u2019ll need a big improvement in the second half if they\u2019re to stage a grand comeback. 45 min +1: In the first of two added minutes, Hazard clips the free kick to the near post, where it\u2019s easily dealt with by Koscielny. Within seconds, the ball is all the way back with Kepa. 45 min: Willian takes. Alonso rises on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box, and sends a header across Leno and off the bottom of the left-hand post! Arsenal hack clear, only to concede a free kick to the left of the area. 44 min: Hazard dribbles hard down the left, reaches the byline, and whips a low cross through the six-yard box. Pedro can\u2019t get near it at the far post. But the ball\u2019s recycled and Koscielny is forced to bundle it out for a corner. That set piece, out on the right, leads to another. From which ... 43 min: Chelsea give up possession easily yet again. This time it allows Lacazette to zip with purpose into enemy territory. Chelsea are light at the back, and the striker has options either side. But he\u2019s caught between passing and shooting, and eventually does neither. On the touchline, Maurizio Sarri looks quite some distance beyond irritated. 41 min: Chelsea look collectively shaken at their plight. They\u2019re struggling to string more than a couple of passes together. The Emirates meanwhile is bouncing. Luiz is booked for sliding in on Ramsey, wide on the right. The resulting free kick is sent to the other flank, where Sokratis crosses with the outside of his boot. The ball dips towards Koscielny, six yards out. Koscielny misses his header, but the ball loops off his right shoulder and into the top right, having taken an absurd arc. A huge stroke of luck, but Arsenal had been pressing and probing again. 37 min: Kolasinac reaches the byline down the left and hooks back for Aubameyang, who attempts to whip an overhead into the top right from 12 yards. The ball drifts inches wide of the post. What an effort! 36 min: A brief brouhaha in the Arsenal box, and the ball nearly breaks to Kovacic. But not quite. Arsenal don\u2019t look solid at the back at all, like that\u2019s breaking news. 34 min: Luiz fires a long pass down the middle. Pedro briefly threatens to get in ahead of Kolasinac, but Leno comes to the edge of his box to claim. Route one can be beautiful, as Neves and Jota proved at Molineux earlier today. That pass from Luiz was nearly as pretty ... but not as devastating. 33 min: Lacazette is furious as he takes a quick free kick to send Xhaka into space down the right, only for the ref to blow up because he wants to talk to the transgressor Kovacic. When the game eventually restarts, Arsenal win another free kick out on the left. Kepa easily deals with Xhaka\u2019s set piece, but this is a little better from Arsenal, who have faded somewhat after their blistering start. 31 min: Alonso dribbles down the left and wins a corner. Willian to take. Leno punches clear with great feeling, sending the ball almost to the halfway line. There was a good shot of the Arsenal corner flag there, by the way; the embroidery of the crest is of the highest quality. Not a stitch dropped. 29 min: Ramsey nicks the ball off Kovacic, who was faffing around 25 yards from goal. Ramsey creams an effort towards the top left, but Kepa\u2019s behind it all the way. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about that door in the Juventus dressing room,\u201d writes Justin Kavanagh. \u201cThe only person allowed in there was Gigi Buffon, whose personal Hair Product Storage Area it was. That was before PSG offered him a bigger HPSA, of course, staffed with several of Paree\u2019s best coiffures.\u201d 27 min: To further illustrate Chelsea gaining a foothold in this match, they\u2019ve enjoyed 80 percent of possession in the last five minutes. 25 min: Many apologies for the break in communication. The Commodore VIC-2o I write these things on just threw the mother and father of all hissy fits. I\u2019ve given it a batter with a hammer and here we are again. Happily we\u2019ve not missed a great deal: Lacazette and Jorginho have both flashed speculative shots over the bar, and Chelsea are much more in the game now. 18 min: Luiz scoops a lovely pass down the inside-left channel to release Pedro into the Arsenal area. Pedro was played onside by Kolasinac, who was miles behind his team-mates. Penny for the thoughts of Tony Adams and Steve Bould. Pedro\u2019s lob sails wide right of the empty net. Lucky Arsenal. 17 min: Azpilicueta is robbed out on the Chelsea left. That allows Aubameyang to tear towards the Chelsea area with great intent. He twists this way and that, and eventually pokes a shot straight at Kepa, who smothers. 16 min: That was a belter, and no less than Arsenal deserve for their fast start. Chelsea have looked uncharacteristically uncertain. The corner from the left leads to another on the right. From that, Bellerin crosses to Lacazette, level with the near post, ten yards out with his back to goal. Lacazette takes touch and spins outside Alonso, then lashes an unstoppable riser into the top right from a tight angle! Kepa was beaten at his near post, but such was the venom behind that strike he had little chance of stopping it! 13 min: Torreira takes, and curls a stunning in-swinging free kick towards Koscielny. He\u2019s six yards out, and has to score, but his header, sent towards the top left, is too close to Kepa. Kepa still does extremely well to tip the ball over the bar, mind, a fine reflex save. And from the corner ... 12 min: Lacazette is bowled over by Pedro, out on the Arsenal left. Another free kick for Arsenal in a dangerous position. 10 min: The first period of Chelsea possession in Arsenal territory. Alonso probes down the left. Then the visitors switch it. Azpilicueta whips in a low ball from the right, and Hazard - nipping in ahead of Sokratis, who was playing him onside by sitting yards deep - slams a first-time sidefoot wide right. That\u2019s a great chance, too. Both Aubameyang and Hazard will think they should be on the scoresheet already. 8 min: To prove the point, Arsenal swing this next one into the mixer in the basic style, and Sokratis rises above Kovacic at the far post. He can\u2019t get his header on target, the ball flashing wide right. But it\u2019s an awful lot better than the nonsense that preceded it. 7 min: Persistent work by Ramsey down the left, and that\u2019s a corner. It\u2019s played short, and nearly wasted, but Arsenal get away with their over-elaboration when Xhaka\u2019s eventual attempt at a cross is deflected out for another go. 6 min: A bright start by the hosts. Chelsea are second to everything right now. The home fans are giving it plenty as a result. 4 min: Xhaka should be booked for a cynical tug on Kante, but the ref is lenient. Then there\u2019s space for Lacazette down the right. He\u2019s only got Aubameyang in the middle, but finds him with a lovely rolled cross. Aubameyang should score, but flicks weakly across the face of goal from six yards, and out for a goal kick. What a chance that was! 3 min: Xhaka\u2019s delivery is a nonsense, easily cleared by Kepa. Speaking of Chelsea keepers, their old boy Petr Cech, now at Arsenal, announced this week that he\u2019ll be hanging up his gloves at the end of the season. A banner in the away section gave thanks to the big Czech. 2 min: Luiz is in the thick of it early doors. Now he comes across the front of Torreira, who was making good down the right. An obvious block, a free kick, and a chance for the hosts to load the box. And we\u2019re off! Arsenal get the party started. We\u2019ve already had two seven-goal thrillers in the Premier League today, 4-3 wins for Wolves and Liverpool against Leicester and Crystal Palace respectively. And within the first 50 seconds, Ramsey has two half-chances to shoot at goal, Luiz then Jorginho taking turns to give up possession cheaply. Don\u2019t bet against a third! The teams are out! Arsenal are in their iconic red shirts with white sleeves. Chelsea could be running out in a blue version of that, but their old boss from the 1930s, David Calderhead, didn\u2019t like the sound of the idea, which had been mooted by Tom Webster, a cartoonist for the London Evening Standard. So Webster took it to Herbert Chapman instead. Probably all for the best. Chelsea are in plain blue, and their fans now wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. We\u2019ll be off in a second! BT Sport asks Maurizio Sarri whether he\u2019s happy with the way his goal-shy team is playing, Eden Hazard as a false nine, all that. \u201cI think our system is working. I hope so. This is a difficult game, I prefer to start with this solution, because with this solution we are more solid.\u201d Then Granit Xhaka is asked whether Arsenal are feeling the pressure, because a loss tonight would seriously harm their hopes of a top-four finish. \u201cWe can be out of it, but we play at home. It\u2019s a hard game and Chelsea have good quality. But we play at home with our fans, and it\u2019s important to make a good game today.\u201d And finally Unai Emery says it\u2019s important that Mesut Ozil is back in the squad. But he doesn\u2019t embellish the point any further. Here\u2019s Aaron Ramsey in the Arsenal changing room before today\u2019s match. Some high-quality wood panelling at the Emirates, he\u2019ll do well to note. It\u2019s like a five-star spa. By comparison, this is what will await him at the Juventus Stadium, if he ends up in a marriage with the Old Lady. Just saying. It\u2019s a bit cold, and anyone could burst through that door at any moment, with everything dancing in the breeze. This picture was taken in 2017, to be fair, they might have given it a lick of paint since then, or bought a couple of colourful cushions, maybe even a throw. But all we\u2019re saying is, the grass is always greener. Arsenal make three changes to the side named at the London Stadium last Saturday. Aaron Ramsey, Hector Bellerin and Lucas Torreira take the places of Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Alex Iwobi and Shkodran Mustafi. There\u2019s also a spot for Mesut Ozil on the bench. Chelsea meanwhile have selected the exact same first 11 picked against Newcastle last week. Arsenal: Leno, Bellerin, Papastathopoulos, Koscielny, Kolasinac, Torreira, Xhaka, Guendouzi, Ramsey, Lacazette, Aubameyang. Subs: Cech, Elneny, Ozil, Maitland-Niles, Iwobi, Monreal, Mustafi. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Rudiger, Luiz, Alonso, Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic, Pedro, Hazard, Willian. Subs: Barkley, Caballero, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Christensen, Emerson Palmieri, Ampadu. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Has one of the biggest fixtures of the season come at the wrong time for these two clubs? Or exactly the right moment? You could spin it either way, given neither are at the top of their game right now. Hosts Arsenal are coming off the back of defeat in another London derby, at West Ham last weekend. They were dismal in that one, their fourth defeat in their last eight matches in all competitions. That long winning run during September and October feels an awfully long time ago. Visitors Chelsea won last Saturday, but not in particularly impressive fashion against struggling Newcastle. Goals have been an issue: just eight in the last eight matches, a run that\u2019s seen them drop points at home to Leicester and Southampton, and lose the first leg of the League Cup semi-final against Spurs. No, neither side are at the top of their game right now. But there\u2019s always hope! Arsenal nearly always score - the blank they drew last weekend was their first in the League since the opening day of the season - while Chelsea can take succour from their 3-2 win over the Gunners at Stamford Bridge in August. Both of these sides can scale the heights on a good day, and circumstances may fuel them, because they\u2019ll need to perform this evening: fourth place is up for grabs and that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer chappie is breathing down their necks. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Saracens will again be the only English club in the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup after Exeter lost narrowly in a gruelling match at Thomond Park. The Chiefs did not just have to win to top the group and progress but deny Munster a bonus point. It was mission improbable but 14 minutes from time they got their chance.</p> <p>Three times in the first half they had turned down the opportunity to kick for goal to secure a lineout in Munster\u2019s 22, their habit in the Premiership. They scored a try on the first occasion, 11 minutes in, when their driving maul was held up just short of the line and Don Armand forced his way over.</p> <p>The other two were repelled but when Nic White\u2019s long, rolling kick into Munster\u2019s 22 in the final quarter gave the Chiefs a foothold, they looked to seize the moment. Within a minute they were awarded a penalty, which they used to secure a lineout five metres out. There is no better team in Europe at turning that position into a try.</p> <p>Exeter were leading 7-6. A converted try would have stripped Munster of their bonus point and the home side went into the set piece without one of their jumpers when Tadhg Beirne, whose immovable presence at the breakdown had been a major reason why the Chiefs were not further ahead, admitted defeat to a knee injury and went off.</p> <p>On came Billy Holland, a Munster stalwart with 12 years of service. He and his fellow forwards knew that Luke Cowan-Dickie, who nine minutes earlier had replaced Jack Yeandle at hooker, was unlikely to throw short because it would have made the maul easier to defend.</p> <p>The ball duly went to the middle and up soared Holland, taking the ball in two hands. Exeter in their desperation conceded a penalty and they slowly deflated. Four minutes later, Joey Carbery kicked his third penalty of the evening to leave the Chiefs needing to score 10 points in a fixture that this season had yielded 36 in two matches.

      "bodyText": "Saracens will again be the only English club in the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup after Exeter lost narrowly in a gruelling match at Thomond Park. The Chiefs did not just have to win to top the group and progress but deny Munster a bonus point. It was mission improbable but 14 minutes from time they got their chance. Three times in the first half they had turned down the opportunity to kick for goal to secure a lineout in Munster\u2019s 22, their habit in the Premiership. They scored a try on the first occasion, 11 minutes in, when their driving maul was held up just short of the line and Don Armand forced his way over. The other two were repelled but when Nic White\u2019s long, rolling kick into Munster\u2019s 22 in the final quarter gave the Chiefs a foothold, they looked to seize the moment. Within a minute they were awarded a penalty, which they used to secure a lineout five metres out. There is no better team in Europe at turning that position into a try. Exeter were leading 7-6. A converted try would have stripped Munster of their bonus point and the home side went into the set piece without one of their jumpers when Tadhg Beirne, whose immovable presence at the breakdown had been a major reason why the Chiefs were not further ahead, admitted defeat to a knee injury and went off. On came Billy Holland, a Munster stalwart with 12 years of service. He and his fellow forwards knew that Luke Cowan-Dickie, who nine minutes earlier had replaced Jack Yeandle at hooker, was unlikely to throw short because it would have made the maul easier to defend. The ball duly went to the middle and up soared Holland, taking the ball in two hands. Exeter in their desperation conceded a penalty and they slowly deflated. Four minutes later, Joey Carbery kicked his third penalty of the evening to leave the Chiefs needing to score 10 points in a fixture that this season had yielded 36 in two matches. It may as well have been 100. They had given it everything and barely allowed Munster an opening but it was an evening when European experience prevailed. It was the home side\u2019s 177th match in the Champions Cup and Exeter\u2019s 37th.

      "body": "<p>It comes to something when the perfect way to demonstrate wealth and status is by \u201cslumming it\u201d with junk food.</p> <p>First up, President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/14/donald-trump-orders-fast-food-white-house-clemson-football\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a>. Finding himself without catering staff (oh, you know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/18/friday-us-briefing-trump-escalates-feud-with-pelosi-amid-shutdown\" title=\"\">the shutdown</a> unpleasantness) for a visit from the Clemson University football team, Trump piled tables with his beloved takeaway burgers (various brands). Or, as he initially tweeted, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/4c329150-3d83-4191-bb90-a3beda9f1fbd\" title=\"\">\u201chamberders\u201d</a>, stinking and steaming away in polystyrene cartons, presumably, after so many hours, giving off the kind of whiff you\u2019d associate with an unregulated abattoir in a heatwave.</p> <p>Other delights included fries, \u201csalad\u201d, chicken nuggets and individual packets of dips. The Gatsbyesque splendour was, one hopes, accompanied by scissors so that guests could cut out the money-off coupons and make a night of it.</p> <p>Trump looked in his element as the self-styled Willy Wonka of junk food. All that was missing was mayo-induced belching, to stop him floating rapturously up to the White House ceiling, perchance accompanied by a burst of that heartwarming song: \u201cCome with me and you\u2019ll be in a world of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.\u201d</p> <p>In the same week, Microsoft multibillionaire <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6603399/Bill-Gates-63-photographed-waiting-line-local-Seattle-burger-shop.html\" title=\"\">Bill Gates</a> was snapped queueing for a drive-in burger in Seattle, inspiring a cloying social media frenzy along the lines of: \u201cHark, he walks among us, eating the same crap.\u201d Then again, why shouldn\u2019t Gates (or even Trump) enjoy a burger? No reason at all. The problems lie in the hypocritical and cynical self-promotion of the first scene and the misplaced mass-fawning over the second.</p> <p>Product placement isn\u2019t always about selling the product \u2013 it can be about selling the man. As much as Trump genuinely enjoys burgers, this born-and-bred member of the elite knows this kind of absurd \u201cman of the people\u201d posturing endears him to a certain US demographic. The same demographic most likely to be afflicted by the out-of-control global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/03/using-data-visualisations-to-help-explain-the-global-obesity-explosion\" title=\"\">obesity epidemic</a>, leading to potentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/12/living-near-food-outlets-linked-to-higher-rates-of-type-2-diabetes\" title=\"\">life-threatening conditions,</a> most of which won\u2019t be covered by their healthcare plans and which the likes of Trump would condemn as self-inflicted. Suddenly, it doesn\u2019t seem quite so charming that Trump served junk food at the White House.</p> <p>As for Gates (in fairness, just quietly queueing), is it really that interesting that he buys a burger \u2013 surely a badly off person eating a Michelin-star meal would be more unusual? There\u2019s a skewed system of food perception, where wealthy, powerful people eating junk because they want to are perceived as down to earth and relatable. Meanwhile, poor, powerless people eating the exact same food because they have little choice (it\u2019s the cheapest, most available option) are somehow disgusting, stupid and shameful.</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why less well-off people don\u2019t brandish their food choices or lack of them, nor do you tend to see people showing off about, say, using food banks. In food as in life, \u201cslumming it\u201d is only acceptable from rich people who could afford better.</p> <h2>Is it any wonder we\u2019re taking comfort in Don\u2019t Know?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e2804d87308c8ffdb39e3bcddc65a46e81176ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e2804d87308c8ffdb39e3bcddc65a46e81176ac/0_129_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Put Don\u2019t Know on the ballot paper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Put Don\u2019t Know on the ballot paper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wouldn\u2019t be the first to ponder on the identity of this mysterious \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d figure who keeps doing so well in political opinion polls.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/01/17/voting-intention-conservatives-39-labour-34-13-14-?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=website_article&amp;utm_campaign=vi_14_jan_2019\" title=\"\">recent YouGov poll</a> on the best choice for prime minister, \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d beat both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, with 41%.

      "bodyText": "It comes to something when the perfect way to demonstrate wealth and status is by \u201cslumming it\u201d with junk food. First up, President Donald Trump. Finding himself without catering staff (oh, you know, the shutdown unpleasantness) for a visit from the Clemson University football team, Trump piled tables with his beloved takeaway burgers (various brands). Or, as he initially tweeted, \u201chamberders\u201d, stinking and steaming away in polystyrene cartons, presumably, after so many hours, giving off the kind of whiff you\u2019d associate with an unregulated abattoir in a heatwave. Other delights included fries, \u201csalad\u201d, chicken nuggets and individual packets of dips. The Gatsbyesque splendour was, one hopes, accompanied by scissors so that guests could cut out the money-off coupons and make a night of it. Trump looked in his element as the self-styled Willy Wonka of junk food. All that was missing was mayo-induced belching, to stop him floating rapturously up to the White House ceiling, perchance accompanied by a burst of that heartwarming song: \u201cCome with me and you\u2019ll be in a world of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.\u201d In the same week, Microsoft multibillionaire Bill Gates was snapped queueing for a drive-in burger in Seattle, inspiring a cloying social media frenzy along the lines of: \u201cHark, he walks among us, eating the same crap.\u201d Then again, why shouldn\u2019t Gates (or even Trump) enjoy a burger? No reason at all. The problems lie in the hypocritical and cynical self-promotion of the first scene and the misplaced mass-fawning over the second. Product placement isn\u2019t always about selling the product \u2013 it can be about selling the man. As much as Trump genuinely enjoys burgers, this born-and-bred member of the elite knows this kind of absurd \u201cman of the people\u201d posturing endears him to a certain US demographic. The same demographic most likely to be afflicted by the out-of-control global obesity epidemic, leading to potentially life-threatening conditions, most of which won\u2019t be covered by their healthcare plans and which the likes of Trump would condemn as self-inflicted. Suddenly, it doesn\u2019t seem quite so charming that Trump served junk food at the White House. As for Gates (in fairness, just quietly queueing), is it really that interesting that he buys a burger \u2013 surely a badly off person eating a Michelin-star meal would be more unusual? There\u2019s a skewed system of food perception, where wealthy, powerful people eating junk because they want to are perceived as down to earth and relatable. Meanwhile, poor, powerless people eating the exact same food because they have little choice (it\u2019s the cheapest, most available option) are somehow disgusting, stupid and shameful. Perhaps that\u2019s why less well-off people don\u2019t brandish their food choices or lack of them, nor do you tend to see people showing off about, say, using food banks. In food as in life, \u201cslumming it\u201d is only acceptable from rich people who could afford better. Is it any wonder we\u2019re taking comfort in Don\u2019t Know? I wouldn\u2019t be the first to ponder on the identity of this mysterious \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d figure who keeps doing so well in political opinion polls. In a recent YouGov poll on the best choice for prime minister, \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d beat both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, with 41%. Or was that \u201cNot Sure\u201d? I suppose \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d and \u201cNot Sure\u201d are effectively the same, in that they both represent the ground-down, stomach-churning horror of the average Briton, as it becomes increasingly apparent that the combined cross-party power of the wisdom of Westminster wouldn\u2019t even be enough to get a Duracell bunny to lift its ears off the floor. As someone who spent part of her misguided youth working the phones in a market research call centre, I can confirm that \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d, \u201cNot Sure\u201d and \u201cPlease stop asking me hard stuff\u201d are the frustrating staples of a pollster\u2019s life. However, what if this were taken further? I have never been a fan of refusing to vote. (People fought and died for the right to vote, not for dim-witted hipsters to spoil ballot papers with felt-tipped anarchy signs.) Still, it might make the next general election (referendum\u2026 wotevs!) more interesting if \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d made it on to the ballot paper. You think that you\u2019re suffering for your art\u2026 think again An audience member is reported to have fainted during a preview of the National Theatre play, When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other, written by Martin Crimp, directed by Katie Mitchell.

Given the economic ructions accruing, the easy way is to play safe and seek caution, but that will achieve nothing except someone in a decade\u2019s time noting once again we\u2019re in an election year during a time of drought and a country without a decent climate change policy. Only by then it will be far too late.",

Sone Aluko got one back but Derby, tired after their midweek FA Cup win over Southampton, saw out the win. Middlesbrough fans were peeling for the exit when their team were awarded a penalty in injury-time for a foul on Daniel Ayala. Millwall had been leading through a 22nd-minute Jed Wallace goal, but Jordan Hugill stepped up to convert from the spot. Goals from Jarrod Bowen and Evandro put Hull into a two-goal lead at Aston Villa before James Chester equalised just before half-time, and then Tammy Abraham\u2019s 64th-minute goal made it 2-2 to end the Tigers\u2019 seven-game winning streak. Ipswich manager Paul Lambert paid out of his own pocket for away fans to travel to Blackburn but his team did not offer him value for money as they lost 2-0 to goals from Danny Graham, from the spot, and Joe Nuttall. QPR are waiting for a league win in 2019 after losing 4-1 at home to Preston, for whom Jayden Stockley, Jordan Storey, Alan Browne and Brad Potts scored the goals to lift North End 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Matt Smith\u2019s 84th-minute goal served as cold comfort for Rangers\u2019 sixth successive defeat to their Lancastrian visitors. Rotherham and Brentford scored goals aplenty at the New York Stadium, with the visitors eventually holding on for a 4-2 win. Kamohelo Mokotjo converted twice as Brentford extended their unbeaten run to seven matches. Sa\u00efd Benrahma and Neal Maupay also scored for the Bees, twice pegged back before Mokotjo\u2019s 75th-minute second was followed 10 minutes later by Maupay\u2019s decisive strike. Steven Fletcher scored the only goal as Sheffield Wednesday beat Wigan 1-0, the Scottish veteran notching from outside the box. League One Portsmouth suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at relegation contenders Oxford, the leaders\u2019 second loss in succession. Cameron Brannagan\u2019s 25-yard effort put Oxford ahead before James Henry scored a second just before half-time. Brett Pitman\u2019s header was all Pompey could find. Luton cruised to within a point of Portsmouth with a thumping 4-0 defeat of Peterborough. James Collins scored a hat-trick and Luke Berry the fourth. Having Ryan Tafazolli red-carded in the 25th minute did not help Posh\u2019s cause. Josh Maja scored his 16th goal of the season as third-placed Sunderland drew 1-1 at Scunthorpe. The striker, still to sign a new contract, nodded in a Reece James cross from close range in the 59th minute but Adam Hammill\u2019s curling 87th-minute strike from distance meant a second successive draw for Jack Ross\u2019s team. Charlton climbed level on points with Sunderland, with a 1-0 defeat of Accrington only secured by a 93rd-minute penalty scored by Karlan Grant. Fleetwood had Lewie Coyle sent off to continue Joey Barton\u2019s team\u2019s poor disciplinary record. They were leading at Rochdale thanks to Paddy Madden\u2019s early goal, only for Ian Henderson to equalise in the 75th minute. Bradford\u2019s hopes of climbing out of the relegation positions were crushed by a 4-0 home loss to Southend. On his league debut, Tyler Smith scored two goals for Doncaster, but a 90th-minute equaliser from John Brayford, his second of the game, levelled it at 2-2. League Two Leaders Lincoln kept clear at the top when winning their lunchtime derby with Grimsby 1-0. Harry Toffolo\u2019s goal after 12 minutes was enough for victory as James McKeown was sent off late on for the visitors. Bury remain Lincoln\u2019s closest chasers after a 2-1 comeback win at Forest Green, with Nicky Maynard scooping an improvised 83rd-minute winner. New Oldham signing Urko Vera, after joining the club on Friday, scored in the first minute of his debut when slotting in a penalty against Macclesfield, but ended up finishing on the losing side when Harry Smith and Scott Wilson scored for Sol Campbell\u2019s team. Resurgent Macc remained in the bottom two as Yeovil continued their own revival with a 2-0 defeat of Notts County, now six points adrift at the bottom.",

      "body": "<p><strong>It\u2019s a mystery to me </strong>why Nigerian food is not better known. It can only be the prejudice of poor exposure. I once took Antonio Carluccio to my favourite Nigerian restaurant in London and he raved at the revelation. But it was too late in his career to champion what might become the next great discovery in international cuisine. The moment now feels right.</p> <p><strong>I was born in </strong><strong>Minna</strong> [in Nigeria] where my earliest memory is panicking my mother for a whole day, when I was only about a year and a half old, because I headed off across the market and got lost in town. Minna is a groundnut town and I remember seeing these piles \u2013 pyramids \u2013 of groundnuts.</p> <p><strong>We came to London when I was two </strong>for my dad to study law. In the 60s there were three ways of looking at English food: what we got in school, which was quite indifferent and I didn\u2019t like; what was eaten at friends\u2019 houses, like shepherd\u2019s pie and peas; and then another kind, such as the immortal English fish and chips, my favourite. In Peckham they did the best in the world. I almost hate to say this, but fish and chips was one of my fondest memories when I returned to Nigeria in 1966.</p> <p>There was a time when there was a kind of disagreement between Mum and Dad. Mum left, for a bit. That day Dad said, and I remember it very clearly: \u201cYour mother thinks that without her we can\u2019t eat in this house, so let\u2019s do some cooking.\u201d Then he\u2019d make rice and a stew. When he cooks it\u2019s like theatre. Mum was by far the better cook \u2013 there\u2019s no comparison. She\u2019s an extraordinary cook, making every type of food in Nigeria. And later she studied baking. I talk about my parents in the present tense, because that\u2019s what your parents remain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hell is a place where your favourite foods drift past, uneaten. That is a very special kind of torture</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>I was stuck in a </strong><strong>boarding school </strong>in Nigeria when civil war was declared [in 1967]. It was one of the most horrendous wars in history and the first sign of the collapse of the African dream. Parents came and collected their children and the principals and teachers had left, so I was there alone. My mother, from the enemy tribe, came to get me, through Urhobo roadblocks, because Dad was tied down in all sorts of stuff. She was risking her neck; it was pretty much certain death. But we roasted and ate root vegetables we found outside. </p> <p><strong>It was a period of shortages</strong> and real starvation in places where the war was taking place. You learned how to make a little go a long way. We used to take food down to Mum in the cellar \u2013 there was no other place for her to go where she wouldn\u2019t be denounced. She was still cooking down there. She\u2019d make cassava root into garri and watery stews out of tomatoes. She\u2019d say: \u201cBen, I can make a feast out of anything.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I lived on the streets</strong> after I\u2019d returned to London. I\u2019d been at Essex University. There had been great canteens and people inviting you into their flats for dinners. Politicians back home stopped paying for my scholarship, so I was told: \u201cYou have to leave, old boy.\u201d</p> <p><strong>When you are hungry </strong>it seems all the books you\u2019re reading are full of feasts. Food shines when you\u2019re deprived of it.</p> <p><strong>One night I was wandering around</strong> in London, starving, with manuscripts under my arm. You have to understand \u2013 I was in my early 20s, so in my mind, the writing, living on the streets, the starvation were all bound up together. It wasn\u2019t hell to me \u2013 it was half-romantic. I stopped outside a restaurant with a glass front in Notting Hill and watched for a long time all these folks eating gorgeous steaks, chicken and pasta. That image has really stayed with me. So when I\u2019m the one having a nice dinner and I catch a glimpse of the window and someone\u2019s looking in, it flips me out a bit.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s an acute relationship</strong> between the taste of food and the state of mind of the person cooking it. I asked Mum once<strong> </strong>why her omelettes taste so good and she said: \u201cI always make them when I\u2019m in a special state of mind.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Salman Rushdie </strong><strong>took me out</strong> to an Indian place in Islington. He\u2019d won the Booker prize when I was working on <em>The Famished Road</em>, which I then won my Booker with. He was very kind, talking about liking the lean dry writing in my <em>Stars of the New Curfew</em>. He\u2019s a big foodie. At the time he was fascinated by bread cultures. He kept eating rice with his hands. That was very sweet.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a mystery to me why Nigerian food is not better known. It can only be the prejudice of poor exposure. I once took Antonio Carluccio to my favourite Nigerian restaurant in London and he raved at the revelation. But it was too late in his career to champion what might become the next great discovery in international cuisine. The moment now feels right. I was born in Minna [in Nigeria] where my earliest memory is panicking my mother for a whole day, when I was only about a year and a half old, because I headed off across the market and got lost in town. Minna is a groundnut town and I remember seeing these piles \u2013 pyramids \u2013 of groundnuts. We came to London when I was two for my dad to study law. In the 60s there were three ways of looking at English food: what we got in school, which was quite indifferent and I didn\u2019t like; what was eaten at friends\u2019 houses, like shepherd\u2019s pie and peas; and then another kind, such as the immortal English fish and chips, my favourite. In Peckham they did the best in the world. I almost hate to say this, but fish and chips was one of my fondest memories when I returned to Nigeria in 1966. There was a time when there was a kind of disagreement between Mum and Dad. Mum left, for a bit. That day Dad said, and I remember it very clearly: \u201cYour mother thinks that without her we can\u2019t eat in this house, so let\u2019s do some cooking.\u201d Then he\u2019d make rice and a stew. When he cooks it\u2019s like theatre. Mum was by far the better cook \u2013 there\u2019s no comparison. She\u2019s an extraordinary cook, making every type of food in Nigeria. And later she studied baking. I talk about my parents in the present tense, because that\u2019s what your parents remain. I was stuck in a boarding school in Nigeria when civil war was declared [in 1967]. It was one of the most horrendous wars in history and the first sign of the collapse of the African dream. Parents came and collected their children and the principals and teachers had left, so I was there alone. My mother, from the enemy tribe, came to get me, through Urhobo roadblocks, because Dad was tied down in all sorts of stuff. She was risking her neck; it was pretty much certain death. But we roasted and ate root vegetables we found outside. It was a period of shortages and real starvation in places where the war was taking place. You learned how to make a little go a long way. We used to take food down to Mum in the cellar \u2013 there was no other place for her to go where she wouldn\u2019t be denounced. She was still cooking down there. She\u2019d make cassava root into garri and watery stews out of tomatoes. She\u2019d say: \u201cBen, I can make a feast out of anything.\u201d I lived on the streets after I\u2019d returned to London. I\u2019d been at Essex University. There had been great canteens and people inviting you into their flats for dinners. Politicians back home stopped paying for my scholarship, so I was told: \u201cYou have to leave, old boy.\u201d When you are hungry it seems all the books you\u2019re reading are full of feasts. Food shines when you\u2019re deprived of it. One night I was wandering around in London, starving, with manuscripts under my arm. You have to understand \u2013 I was in my early 20s, so in my mind, the writing, living on the streets, the starvation were all bound up together. It wasn\u2019t hell to me \u2013 it was half-romantic. I stopped outside a restaurant with a glass front in Notting Hill and watched for a long time all these folks eating gorgeous steaks, chicken and pasta. That image has really stayed with me. So when I\u2019m the one having a nice dinner and I catch a glimpse of the window and someone\u2019s looking in, it flips me out a bit. There\u2019s an acute relationship between the taste of food and the state of mind of the person cooking it. I asked Mum once why her omelettes taste so good and she said: \u201cI always make them when I\u2019m in a special state of mind.\u201d Salman Rushdie took me out to an Indian place in Islington. He\u2019d won the Booker prize when I was working on The Famished Road, which I then won my Booker with. He was very kind, talking about liking the lean dry writing in my Stars of the New Curfew. He\u2019s a big foodie. At the time he was fascinated by bread cultures. He kept eating rice with his hands. That was very sweet. It touched me. There are some foods that make you carnal, some aggressive, some that calm you down, some conducive to thought or to argument. It\u2019s not for nothing that when people start on a spiritual journey their diet changes. Food and personal spiritual development is very interesting \u2013 not least in fasting. It\u2019s not much talked about, but fasting can cleanse the appetite and return one\u2019s senses to zero. Astonishing The Gods was written while fasting. All meals in Nigerian restaurants should be prefixed with pepper soup. Otherwise it\u2019s like setting off on a journey without a suitcase, or on seduction without foreplay. It awakens all the taste buds, pores and senses. You inhale differently and feel differently. So, you are ready for your main meal. Then finish off with slices of pineapple or mango.

Also, a food hell would be a place, a culture, where, for nationalist reasons or whatever, there was only one kind of food \u2013 morning, afternoon, evening, day in, day out. Food I am going through a phase of simple eating. Maybe also I\u2019m returning to the kinds of food I liked as a kid in Nigeria \u2013 fried plantain, stewed black-eyed beans, yam potage and omelettes. Drink The best palm wine can only be hot in Nigeria, and it\u2019s best fresh. But I love a good wine. White in the early evening, red for dinner.

      "body": "<p>Jo Swinson MP is deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats. The former government minister\u2019s achievements include introducing shared parental leave and legislating to require companies to report their gender pay gaps. She wrote <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/equal-power-9781786491893.html\" title=\"\"><em>Equal Power: Gender Equality and How to Achieve It</em></a> while out of parliament, before regaining her seat in 2017. The book is published in paperback in February.</p> <p><strong>Your aim for the book, you write, is to help people \u201cfeel encouraged, empowered and emboldened to take action that will challenge gender inequality\u201d. What kinds of action?</strong><br>I wrote the book out of a continued desire to change the world \u2013 we need to radically change things and have much more equality. I wanted to give some practical steps because people often feel powerless and underestimate their own power to make change \u2013 I\u2019ve felt like that and I\u2019m a politician. In everyday life, there are things you can do differently. If you cycle to work, that\u2019s you breaking stereotypes of how a woman should be. If you volunteer with a domestic violence charity you\u2019re helping victims of these power structures. If you\u2019re invited to speak at a conference, ask if there\u2019s a balance of genders in the line-up. If you\u2019re in a book group, cover as many books by women as male authors. There\u2019s an example I give of an American author who found that when she submitted the same novel under a male name, this male name was better at writing the same book as the female name. Charlotte Bront\u00eb had to be Currer Bell, but even today this happens.</p> <p><strong>When did you </strong><strong>realise that you wanted to make a change in the world?</strong><br>When I was a little girl, about eight, I remember going into the Body Shop \u2013 that was my first introduction to campaigning. There would always be a petition at the till about fair-trade or stop testing on animals, and the message was: get involved and make change. I signed those petitions, I got involved with my school council, I first wrote to my MP when I was about 10. I always wanted to make a difference.</p> <p><strong>You write about the harassment and abuse experienced by </strong><strong>female MPs. This month MPs have demanded better security outside parliament after </strong><strong>MP Anna Soubry</strong><strong> was called a Nazi by protest</strong><strong>ers. What are your thoughts about that?</strong><br>I\u2019ve seen the footage and it\u2019s shocking. Jo Cox was murdered for doing her job; she was going to her constituency and a far-right neo-Nazi murdered her. The security issue is real, and no one should feel that they can\u2019t say what they think because of abuse and intimidation. It\u2019s very important in our democracy that we see that, yes, emotions run high with the Brexit debate on both sides, but we need to be able to have that debate. I think in this country we have lost the art of disagreeing well. I wish we could rediscover that skill, otherwise we have a very polarised and divided society. I wholeheartedly disagree with Brexiters on what vision they have and what they want to see for the country and I think Brexit is going to be incredibly damaging, but it doesn\u2019t make them evil people. I think social media has fanned the flames of people seeking to divide rather than bring together. We need more humanity.</p> <p><strong>You made a step forward in modernising the workforce by becoming the first MP to take your baby into a Commons debate \u2013 what do you hope that will achieve? </strong><br>I think it\u2019s important that we challenge the idea that women who have babies are not fit for work and don\u2019t have value. There is massive pregnancy discrimination, in parliament and right across society.</p> <p><strong>You read an influential book aged 16. Tell us about that\u2026</strong><br>I won a school prize and was given a bookshop voucher and chose <em>Why Good Girls Don\u2019t Get Ahead But Gutsy Girls Do</em><em> </em>by Kate White and it really spoke to me because it\u2019s saying we\u2019re brought up to be good girls, afraid to break the rules. I knew when I took my son Gabriel into the chamber in September that I was kind of breaking the rules. I had this heart beating loudly but also thought that I needed to do it as a way to make progress. I still have a good girl deep inside, but also recognise that it\u2019s worth saying things people will disagree with or get annoyed. That book made me grapple with the good-girl mindset and recognise that being a good girl is not always the best strategy. I was putting it into practice pretty soon thereafter.</p> <p><strong>You went on to become the youngest member of parliament aged 25\u2026</strong><br>Yes, I joined the Lib Dems the following year when I was 17 at university, and first stood for parliament when I was 21. There was quite a bit of ageism, though being in my 30s I still get patronised sometimes. It was an environment in which most others were nearly 30 years older than me and mostly men. I was fortunate that among the Lib Dems there were other young women. We had some camaraderie. I think that support networks are crucial for women.</p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?</strong><br>I loved reading. I was one of those kids who was supposed to go to bed but had a torch under the duvet. That love of reading stayed with me. When I was 10 I wanted to be an author, so it\u2019s nice to have fulfilled that.

      "bodyText": "Jo Swinson MP is deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats. The former government minister\u2019s achievements include introducing shared parental leave and legislating to require companies to report their gender pay gaps. She wrote Equal Power: Gender Equality and How to Achieve It while out of parliament, before regaining her seat in 2017. The book is published in paperback in February. Your aim for the book, you write, is to help people \u201cfeel encouraged, empowered and emboldened to take action that will challenge gender inequality\u201d. What kinds of action? I wrote the book out of a continued desire to change the world \u2013 we need to radically change things and have much more equality. I wanted to give some practical steps because people often feel powerless and underestimate their own power to make change \u2013 I\u2019ve felt like that and I\u2019m a politician. In everyday life, there are things you can do differently. If you cycle to work, that\u2019s you breaking stereotypes of how a woman should be. If you volunteer with a domestic violence charity you\u2019re helping victims of these power structures. If you\u2019re invited to speak at a conference, ask if there\u2019s a balance of genders in the line-up. If you\u2019re in a book group, cover as many books by women as male authors. There\u2019s an example I give of an American author who found that when she submitted the same novel under a male name, this male name was better at writing the same book as the female name. Charlotte Bront\u00eb had to be Currer Bell, but even today this happens. When did you realise that you wanted to make a change in the world? When I was a little girl, about eight, I remember going into the Body Shop \u2013 that was my first introduction to campaigning. There would always be a petition at the till about fair-trade or stop testing on animals, and the message was: get involved and make change. I signed those petitions, I got involved with my school council, I first wrote to my MP when I was about 10. I always wanted to make a difference. You write about the harassment and abuse experienced by female MPs. This month MPs have demanded better security outside parliament after MP Anna Soubry was called a Nazi by protesters. What are your thoughts about that? I\u2019ve seen the footage and it\u2019s shocking. Jo Cox was murdered for doing her job; she was going to her constituency and a far-right neo-Nazi murdered her. The security issue is real, and no one should feel that they can\u2019t say what they think because of abuse and intimidation. It\u2019s very important in our democracy that we see that, yes, emotions run high with the Brexit debate on both sides, but we need to be able to have that debate. I think in this country we have lost the art of disagreeing well. I wish we could rediscover that skill, otherwise we have a very polarised and divided society. I wholeheartedly disagree with Brexiters on what vision they have and what they want to see for the country and I think Brexit is going to be incredibly damaging, but it doesn\u2019t make them evil people. I think social media has fanned the flames of people seeking to divide rather than bring together. We need more humanity. You made a step forward in modernising the workforce by becoming the first MP to take your baby into a Commons debate \u2013 what do you hope that will achieve? I think it\u2019s important that we challenge the idea that women who have babies are not fit for work and don\u2019t have value. There is massive pregnancy discrimination, in parliament and right across society. You read an influential book aged 16. Tell us about that\u2026 I won a school prize and was given a bookshop voucher and chose Why Good Girls Don\u2019t Get Ahead But Gutsy Girls Do by Kate White and it really spoke to me because it\u2019s saying we\u2019re brought up to be good girls, afraid to break the rules. I knew when I took my son Gabriel into the chamber in September that I was kind of breaking the rules. I had this heart beating loudly but also thought that I needed to do it as a way to make progress. I still have a good girl deep inside, but also recognise that it\u2019s worth saying things people will disagree with or get annoyed. That book made me grapple with the good-girl mindset and recognise that being a good girl is not always the best strategy. I was putting it into practice pretty soon thereafter. You went on to become the youngest member of parliament aged 25\u2026 Yes, I joined the Lib Dems the following year when I was 17 at university, and first stood for parliament when I was 21. There was quite a bit of ageism, though being in my 30s I still get patronised sometimes. It was an environment in which most others were nearly 30 years older than me and mostly men. I was fortunate that among the Lib Dems there were other young women. We had some camaraderie. I think that support networks are crucial for women. What kind of reader were you as a child? I loved reading. I was one of those kids who was supposed to go to bed but had a torch under the duvet. That love of reading stayed with me. When I was 10 I wanted to be an author, so it\u2019s nice to have fulfilled that. I\u2019m glad my oldest son, who is five, seems to love books \u2013 it\u2019s great to see that joy, as reading is a gateway to whole worlds. Which recent books have influenced you? Listening to and understanding other people\u2019s experiences is incredibly important \u2013 I know what it\u2019s like to be a white, middle-class, mum of two who\u2019s Scottish, a humanist, liberal, and an MP. I read Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2019s book [Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race] and now understand inequality in this country much better. And Poverty Safari [by Darren McGarvey] \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely excellent and fascinating for me because I grew up in Glasgow too, in a more affluent area, but reading that in-depth, first-person account of poverty is incredibly powerful. Which books are on your bedside table? I\u2019ve just finished Vox by Christina Dalcher. I got it for Christmas and read it in two days.

Either call would see England bat all the way down to No 9, but it is the top, not the bottom, that will be under the microscope this series.</p> <p>Despite looking to divert talk away from the Ashes this summer, Root admitted he had been keeping a close eye on Australia\u2019s recent defeat by India and he will be keen that Keaton Jennings and Rory Burns cement their opening partnership before those particular hostilities resume.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/16/stuart-law-west-indies-trouble-england-test-series\">Former West Indies coach Stuart Law says old charges can trouble England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all the negativity that can surround West Indies at times the Caribbean remains verdant by way of cricketing talent. The challenge is still how this gets channelled through the sport\u2019s three different formats given a global economic landscape that can often feel heavily stacked against the region.</p> <p>Richard Pybus, an Englishman with a relatively low profile at home after forging his career overseas, was in charge of this as the West Indies director of cricket until 2016, but he has now returned as the national team\u2019s interim head coach to a touch of disquiet following the suggestion he was unilaterally hired by the board president, Dave Cameron.</p> <p>On Friday night, as the early travelling supporters were heading to Oistins Fish Fry for a evening of fresh food and rum punch, Cricket West Indies felt moved to issue a statement reaffirming that the appointment met standards of good governance. Enoch Lewis, the Leeward Islands Cricket Board president who has been most vocal in the criticism, was also to be referred to its ethics committee.</p> <p>While this all sounded a bit 1984 \u2013 the book, sadly, not the year of the 5-0 whitewash of England under Clive Lloyd \u2013 the team itself, though fresh from a recent 2-0 defeat in Bangladesh after crumbling against spin, are not to be underestimated at home. England, after all, have won only a single Caribbean Test series (2004) in the last 51 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/18/jack-leach-adil-rashid-england-cricket-west-indies-preview\">Jack Leach and Adil Rashid may become victims of England\u2019s strength in depth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPride and Industry\u201d is the national motto of Barbados and they are words that run through Jason Holder, the West Indies captain who hails from the island, like those in a stick of rock. It helps that the 6ft 7in right-armer is in the form of his life too, having spent 2018 taking 33 Test wickets at 12 runs apiece.</p> <p>With the brawny Shannon Gabriel set to hit splices hard and Kemar Roach having successfully converted himself into a bowler of high skill after losing the pace that once sent Ricky Ponting to the hospital with a broken elbow, England\u2019s batsmen face a significantly different challenge from Sri Lanka provided the pitches are not dull.</p> <p>The question will be whether the home side\u2019s batting, recently refurbished with a recall for Darren Bravo and two uncapped players in John Campbell and Shamar Brooks, stands up to scrutiny. Shai Hope, the Bajan right-hander who made his debut at the Kensington Oval four years ago \u2013 but his name with twin hundreds at Headingley in 2017, \u2013 will be the most prized wicket and Shimron Hetmyer, the destructive Guyanese, is another to watch.</p> <p>If England keep that pair quiet, and play judiciously with the bat themselves, then the hordes of supporters who stroll off the planes and giant cruise ships and into the region\u2019s so-called mecca of cricket should have plenty to sing about.</p>",

But after the 3-0 win in Sri Lanka last November, four days spent dismantling a West Indies Board President\u2019s XI during the week and with a heavily-lacquered Dukes ball they fancy should swing a good while, optimism seemingly abounds. Having whittled the squad down to a 12, Root and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, will examine the pitch at training this week and make their final selection. It appears to be between the left-arm swing of Sam Curran or Adil Rashid\u2019s leg-breaks, with Broad and Anderson back in tandem here following bit-part roles on the last tour. Either call would see England bat all the way down to No 9, but it is the top, not the bottom, that will be under the microscope this series. Despite looking to divert talk away from the Ashes this summer, Root admitted he had been keeping a close eye on Australia\u2019s recent defeat by India and he will be keen that Keaton Jennings and Rory Burns cement their opening partnership before those particular hostilities resume. For all the negativity that can surround West Indies at times the Caribbean remains verdant by way of cricketing talent. The challenge is still how this gets channelled through the sport\u2019s three different formats given a global economic landscape that can often feel heavily stacked against the region. Richard Pybus, an Englishman with a relatively low profile at home after forging his career overseas, was in charge of this as the West Indies director of cricket until 2016, but he has now returned as the national team\u2019s interim head coach to a touch of disquiet following the suggestion he was unilaterally hired by the board president, Dave Cameron. On Friday night, as the early travelling supporters were heading to Oistins Fish Fry for a evening of fresh food and rum punch, Cricket West Indies felt moved to issue a statement reaffirming that the appointment met standards of good governance. Enoch Lewis, the Leeward Islands Cricket Board president who has been most vocal in the criticism, was also to be referred to its ethics committee. While this all sounded a bit 1984 \u2013 the book, sadly, not the year of the 5-0 whitewash of England under Clive Lloyd \u2013 the team itself, though fresh from a recent 2-0 defeat in Bangladesh after crumbling against spin, are not to be underestimated at home. England, after all, have won only a single Caribbean Test series (2004) in the last 51 years. \u201cPride and Industry\u201d is the national motto of Barbados and they are words that run through Jason Holder, the West Indies captain who hails from the island, like those in a stick of rock. It helps that the 6ft 7in right-armer is in the form of his life too, having spent 2018 taking 33 Test wickets at 12 runs apiece. With the brawny Shannon Gabriel set to hit splices hard and Kemar Roach having successfully converted himself into a bowler of high skill after losing the pace that once sent Ricky Ponting to the hospital with a broken elbow, England\u2019s batsmen face a significantly different challenge from Sri Lanka provided the pitches are not dull. The question will be whether the home side\u2019s batting, recently refurbished with a recall for Darren Bravo and two uncapped players in John Campbell and Shamar Brooks, stands up to scrutiny. Shai Hope, the Bajan right-hander who made his debut at the Kensington Oval four years ago \u2013 but his name with twin hundreds at Headingley in 2017, \u2013 will be the most prized wicket and Shimron Hetmyer, the destructive Guyanese, is another to watch. If England keep that pair quiet, and play judiciously with the bat themselves, then the hordes of supporters who stroll off the planes and giant cruise ships and into the region\u2019s so-called mecca of cricket should have plenty to sing about.",

the Egyptian repeatedly in the head and then wiped his feet on his chest. </p> <p>Anyway, all is well in the world of Liverpool fans again, as Salah has recovered sufficiently from this brutal assault

Wolves 3-2 Leicester City</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ruben Neves and Diego Jota have combined to restore Wolves\u2019 lead over Leicester City at Molineux. Jota, it was, who picked up a pass over the top from Neves, before leaving Wes Morgan in his dust and rifling home a shot that took a big deflection off Kasper Schmeichel, who was unable to keep it out.

Scott Murray has the latest ... Championship: An eventful week for the league leaders ended in defeat against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Championship: Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s return to the City Ground as manager was not the stuff of fairytales many had been hoping for. Premier League: James Ward-Prowse scored a beauty as Southampton consigned Everton to another defeat. Comedian and Crystal Palace fan Kevin Hunter-Day tweets And I think he probably speaks for all but the most flint-hearted Palace fans when he addresses Julian Speroni\u2019s mistake for the Mo Salah goal that put Liverpool 3-2 up. Premier League: The league leaders were forced to work extremely hard for all three points, by an obdurate Crystal Palace side. Premier League: Callum Wilson and Josh King were on target, while West Ham without Marko Arnautovic looked toothless. Premier League: A string of fine saves from Tom Heaton helped earn Burnley a point. Premier League: \u201cFabian Sch\u00e4r reminded everyone that football should be more about beauty and joy than grudges and grimness,\u201d writes Louise Taylor from St James\u2019 Park. Premier League: Manchester United made it seven wins on the trot under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r with victory by the odd goal of three. Premier League: Diogo Jota scored a hat-trick as Wolves stole all three points with a late, late winner. Arsenal v Chelsea: It\u2019s 15 minutes to kick-off time at the Emirates, where Arsenal are entertaining Chelsea. Scott Murray has the team news and build-up.

Premier League: Watford and Burnley failed to muster up a goal between them in the afternoon\u2019s only top flight draw. Premier League: Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford got the goals as Manchester United continued their remarkable winning run. Premier League: Southampton were forced to survive a late Everton onslaught before taking all three points. Premier League: Liverpool won by the odd goal of seven against plucky Palace to extend their lead at the top of the table. Premier League: Fabian Schar scored twice as Newcastle put three without reply past their fellow relegation strugglers. Premier League: Crikey! Max Meyer scores what is almost certain to be a late consolation for Palace at Anfield. It\u2019s been a game high on drama and excitement. Premier League: Ayoze Perez completes Newcastle\u2019s rout of Cardiff, converting after good work down the flank by Salomon Rondon. Premier League: The points were hard-earned, but Liverpool are home and hosed. Sadio Mane hares down the pitch and scores to put the game beyond Palace. Premier League: Gylfi gives Everton a chance with his 10th goal of the season. Premier League: Josh King wraps up the points for Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium, slotting home a tap-in from six yards. Premier League: Liverpool are down to 10 men after James Milner is sent off for two bookable offences on Wilf Zaha. League One: Adam Hammill scores on 87th minutes for Scunthorpe to level proceedings against sunderland who look likely to throw away another two points. Championship: Brentford extend their lead over Rotherham, with Neal Maupay making it 4-2 to the Bees after 85 minutes. Elsewhere, QPR had gone 3-0 down against Preston at Loftus Road, but Matt Smith has just bagged a consolation for the home side. It\u2019s QPR 1-3 Preston. More bad news for Leeds: Already trailing 1-0 at Stoke City, the Championship leaders are now a man down. Pontus Jansson has been sent off after picking up his second yellow card of the game. Premier League: A howler of epic proportions from Julian Speroni gifts Liverpool the lead again. The Palace goalkeeper is playing his first match in two years and has had a shocker, there - not that you\u2019d know it from following the club\u2019s Twitter feed. The veteran flapped a harmless looking volleyed cross from James Milner, sending it looping backwards towards his own goal. Mo Salah buried the ball from an inch or so out at the far post, but the ball would have gone in anyway. It may actually have crossed the line before Salah intervened. Championship: Blackburn double their lead against Ipswich Town at Ewood Park, while Preston do the same thing at QPR. It\u2019s 2-0 in both games. Meanwhile at the New York Stadium, it\u2019s now Rotherham 2-3 Brentford. Premier League: Pascal Gross scores into the top corner after getting on the end of a deft cross from Davy Propper. Championship: Martin O\u2019Neill is overseeing his first match in charge of Nottingham Forest today and it\u2019s not going as well as he might have liked. They trail 1-0 against Bristol City, for whom Famara Diedhiou has scored. Elsewhere, Preston have just doubled their lead at QPR.

It\u2019s 2-1 at the New York Stadium, where Bess fans are buzzing again. Premier League: Whatever Jurgen Klopp said to his Liverpool troops at half-time seems to have done the trick. They\u2019ve staged a quick turnaround and lead Crystal Palace by the odd goal of three. Bobby Firmino with their second goal at Anfield. Premier League: Having returned from injury today, Callum Wilson does what he does best. Premier League: A stunning strike from James Ward-Prowse puts Southampton 1-0 up against Everton. Championship: Stoke have gone a goal up against Leeds United, where Sam Clucas has given Nathan Jones\u2019s side the lead. Premier League: My inbox is filling up with angry emails from Liverpool fans who have taken a very dim view of the very notion that Mo Salah might have dived to try to win a penalty in the first half. I was under the mistaken impression Mamadou Sakho didn\u2019t actually touch him, but according to some of the correspondence I\u2019ve been receiving, he actually grappled Salah to the ground, kicked the Egyptian repeatedly in the head and then wiped his feet on his chest. Anyway, all is well in the world of Liverpool fans again, as Salah has recovered sufficiently from this brutal assault to equalise for the Premier League leaders very early in the second half.

Championship: Harry Wilson makes it 2-0 for Derby County against Reading, who clearly weren\u2019t paying attention to Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s PowerPoint presentation on how best to beat Frank Lampard\u2019s team./ Premier League: Marcus Rashford curls one into the top corner to double Manchester United\u2019s lead. Liverpool 0-1 Crystal Palace: Mo Salah takes what looks to be a blatant dive in the Crystal Palace penalty area, but avoids a booking for reasons best known to referee Jonathan Moss. Championship: Hull City double their lead against Aston Villa as they look for their seventh consecutive win. An unmarked Evandro converts at the far post, getting on the end of a cross.

Wilfried Zaha skins James Milner and pulls the ball back into the penalty area for Andros Townsend to score. Liverpool are behind!!! Liverpool 0-0 Crystal Palace: The Anfield scoreboard operator has yet to be called into action today, but it seems like it may only be a matter of time. Virgil van Dijk has just headed over in a match that is being completely dominated by Liverpool.

Premier League: Paul Pogba scores from the spot to give Manchester United the lead over Brighton at Old Trafford. He\u2019d brought down by Gaeten Bong to win the penalty and duly converted. Premier League: Fabian Schar scores his first goal for Newcastle to give them the advantage over Cardiff City. It\u2019s a fine solo effort, with Schar ambling past several defenders as he cut in from the right and fired past Neil Etheridge. Championship: Millwall lead Middlesbrough 1-0 at the Riverside, courtesy of a goal from Jed Wallace. Elsewhere, Jon Taylor has equalised for Rotherham against Brentford at the New York Stadium. It\u2019s 1-1 there.

Championship: Brentford lead Rotherham by a goal scored by Kamohelo Mokotjo after two minutes, which I appeared to miss during all the ... um, excitement. League One: Southend have taken an early lead against Bradford City. Elsewhere it\u2019s Doncaster Rovers 0-1 Burton, Gillingham 0-1 Walsall and Luton Town 1-0 Peterborough United. League Two: Oldham lead at Macclesfield through a penalty from Urko Mateos Vera, formerly of Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, on his debut. Elsewhere it\u2019s Yeovil 1-0 Notts County. A goal in the Championship: Derby County are off the mark after just three minutes, with Duane Holmes lifting the ball over Reading goalkeeper Anssi Jaakkola to give his side an early lead. League Two result: Lincoln City have extended their lead at the top of League Two with a 1-0 win over Grimsby Town at Sincil Bank. Harry Toffolo scored the winner after 12 minutes, while James McKeown was sent off for the visitors. Not long now ... The last of the pre-match niceties are being conducted and our three o\u2019clock (other time zones are available) kick-offs are about to get under way in grounds the length of the country. Stay tuned for updates ... Luke Shaw has been struck down with illness of some kind and is replaced in the Manchester United line-up by Diogo Dalot, with Matteo Darmian now on the bench. Ben Fisher was at Molineux to see Wolves prevail in a thriller with a late, late winner from hat-trick hero Diogo Jota. Here are his thoughts on the final whistle. Manchester United: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fields an unchanged side against Brighton. Brighton: Chris Hughton also fields an unchanged side. Liverpool: James Milner looks likely to fill in for Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back. Naby Keita and centre-back Joel Matip also come in for the injured Georginio Wijnaldum and Xherdan Shaqiri. Fabinho moves back into midfield after deputising in central defence last weekend. Crystal Palace: Goalkeeper Julian Speroni - currently the Premier League\u2019s oldest player, who turns 40 in May - makes his first appearance since December 2017 because of injuries to Vicente Guaita and Wayne Hennessey. Bournemouth: Top scorer Callum Wilson returns from a hamstring injury in place of Junior Stanislas, while Artur Boruc replaces Asmir Begovic in goal. West Ham: Marko Arnautovic is left out of West Ham\u2019s squad for the game at Bournemouth amid reports of a move to China and is replaced by Andy Carroll. Wolves hang on at the death to take all three points against Leicester in an absolutely terrific game at Molineux. Leicester fans have been complaining that watching their team is boring; this might prompt them to change their tune. Diogo Jota with a hat-trick as Wolves beat Leicester. Wow! Claude Puel has his head in his heads after some slapstick defending from his side allow Wolves to nick what looks certain to be a late winner through Diogo Jota. Puel\u2019s opposite number, Nuno Espirito Santo has been sent off for his part in his team\u2019s celebrations. Wes Morgan has just nodded a terrific James Maddison free-kick home to equalise for Leicester City against Wolves at Molineux in the 87th minute. Follow the knocking of that one with Scott Murray.

Subs: Saltor, Kayal, Andone, Knockaert, Balogun, Steele, Gyokeres. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire) Ruben Neves and Diego Jota have combined to restore Wolves\u2019 lead over Leicester City at Molineux. Jota, it was, who picked up a pass over the top from Neves, before leaving Wes Morgan in his dust and rifling home a shot that took a big deflection off Kasper Schmeichel, who was unable to keep it out. There are 24 minutes left and Scott Murray has the latest. Mild-mannered he may be, but Claude Puel appears to given his Leicester players a rocket up the collective backside at half-time. Goals from Demarai Gray and Harvey Barnes in a four-minute spell in the 47th and 51st minutes mean it\u2019s now Wolves 2-2 Leicester City with a little over 30 minutes to play. You can follow the action with Scott Murray. And finally, League Two Lincoln City are sitting pretty at the top of League Two, three points clear of Bury despite having played two games fewer. Danny Cowley\u2019s side entertain Grimsby town in today\u2019s 1pm kick-off and currently lead at Sincil Bank by the only goal of the game, scored by Harry Toffolo after 12 minutes. Today in League One League leaders Portsmouth travel to Oxford United, hoping to maintain their four point lead over Luton Town, who entertain Peterborough United. In third place, a point behind Luton but with a game in hand, Sunderland travel to mid-table Scunthorpe. Faye Carruthers was in the hot-seat in place of the holidaying Max Rushden for Thursday\u2019s thrilling instalment of Football Weekly, in which we discussed the travails of Arsenal, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s PowerPoint presentation and a whole lot more besides. Today in the Championship Norwich City beat Birmingham 3-1 in last night\u2019s match at Carrow Road, a game of two halves \u2026 only the first of which was any good. The Canaries kept the pressure on leaders Leeds United, who have had an eventful week which they end with a trip to Stoke City. Today in the Premier League Wolves are hosting Leicester City in the day\u2019s lunchtime kick-off and it\u2019s currently 2-0 to the home side at half-time, where Diogo Jota and Ryan Bennett have scored the goals. Later on, Roy Hodgson takes Crystal Palace to Anfield, where the former Liverpool manager is not remembered with any great fondness by the locals who were less than impressed with his spell in charge. They\u2019ll be even less impressed if Palace can do a number on the league leaders, ahead of Manchester City\u2019s trip to Huddersfield tomorrow Nearer the bottom of the table, Newcastle entertain Cardiff City in what is arguably the pick of the other three o\u2019clock kick-offs. Unless you\u2019re a fan of Norwich City or Birmingham City, in which case it began last night. Semantics aside, on a busy afternoon of football featuring no end of intriguing fixtures, we\u2019ll bring you team news, build-up, score updates and all the other major talking points as assorted dramas are played out the length and breadth of the UK.",

That Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel bribed politicians and senior military officers is presumed by most Mexicans; that he bribed presidents would surprise few \u2013 what we had not heard is that he allegedly haggled down a presidential demand for $250m protection money to $100m. But this is what emerges as Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s prosecutors home in on the closing stages of their case at the US federal court in Brooklyn. When Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s former mistress Lucero Guadalupe S\u00e1nchez L\u00f3pez took the stand on Thursday, El Chapo knew it was coming: journalists had been tipped off by defence counsel last week that she might testify. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s wife Emma Coronel \u2013 loyally present almost every day of the trial \u2013 probably braced herself too; the couple had been married for seven years \u2013 since 2007 \u2013 when the bathroom incident occurred, and their twin daughters were two years old. S\u00e1nchez told the court she was Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lover and \u201chousewife\u201d for three years from 2011. And rather more: she was a scout for, and dispatcher of, marijuana from the Mexican states of Durango and Sinaloa. Guzm\u00e1n \u201cwould ask me for the three Bs\u201d, she explained, \u201cBuena, bonita y barata\u201d \u2013 good, pretty and cheap. The relationship was complex, with suggestions of intimidation: \u201cI had my reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst of all, so he didn\u2019t think I would rat him out. I didn\u2019t want him to mistrust me so he wouldn\u2019t hurt me. Second, I didn\u2019t want to have my siblings involved\u201d \u2013 as Guzm\u00e1n had apparently urged. She sent Guzm\u00e1n a text about her business role, saying: \u201cI like it. At least I feel useful.\u201d That night in early 2014, the couple were in bed when a squad of marines and US DEA agents surrounded the Miramar Hotel in Mazatl\u00e1n.

She served two years before being arrested in 2017 while entering the US, for drug trafficking and money laundering. Awaiting sentence, she joined the now long line of trusted confidants who have turned state\u2019s witness against the cartel chief. But as well as unveiling such personal betrayals, the trial has also exposed shocking allegations of relations between narco-trafficking and political power in Mexico and beyond. For years journalists have charted the entwinement between cartels, police, military and politics \u2013 and many Mexican reporters have paid with their lives for doing so. Yet even so, the detail of testimony in the trial is astonishing. This week the major Colombian narco Alex Cifuentes Villa took the stand for a second time to implicate the apex of power in Mexico. Under cross-examination, Cifuentes said that Enrique Pe\u00f1o Nieto, president from 2012 until last year, approached Guzm\u00e1n (rather than the other way round) to propose that a payment of $250m would call off the manhunt against him. Cifuentes said the two men eventually compromised on the sum of $100m, duly paid. Cifuentes said his PA, Andrea V\u00e9lez Fern\u00e1ndez, had once sent him photographs of suitcases full of cash.

Mexican reporters have for years investigated the convergence of interests between Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel and the Mexican army, often in pursuit of hegemony over other, rival cartels. But never before has an insider described the army acting as a hit squad for the cartel. This week, however, Cifuentes said that Guzm\u00e1n authorized payments of between $10m and $12m to military units to \u201ceither kill or capture\u201d operatives of the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva cartel, founded by brothers initially loyal to Guzm\u00e1n, but who broke away \u2013 incurring his special wrath.

With Xherdan Shaqiri on the bench they seemed to lack ideas and penetration, constantly shuttling the ball across the pitch without coming close to breaking through Palace\u2019s two banks of defenders. Juli\u00e1n Speroni made an early save from Jo\u00ebl Matip and Virgil van Dijk headed narrowly over the bar from a free-kick but that those two half-chances represented the closest Liverpool came to a goal in the first period told its own story.</p> \n<p>That was just the first half, though. With the sort of luck that will worry City supporters, Liverpool were back on level terms almost immediately after the interval with a goal that was more of Palace\u2019s making than their own. First Van Aanholt and Mamadou Sakho dithered over a loose ball in the penalty area, eventually clearing unconvincingly. Jordan Henderson fed Van Dijk, whose shot from 30 yards out was hopeful in the extreme, yet the ball struck James McArthur on the way through and ended up hanging tantalisingly in front of Speroni. The goalkeeper might have been more decisive and his hesitancy was punished by Salah, who stuck out his left leg to collect one of the simplest goals of his career.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e5920ac588440a28dd0f844dcc442d5ecf9efc6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e5920ac588440a28dd0f844dcc442d5ecf9efc6/34_0_3109_1866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohamed Salah equalises with his first goal of the day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohamed Salah equalises with his first goal of the day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Palace were unnerved after that and the defence that had stood so firm in the first half gave way again six minutes later. James Tomkins unwisely stood off Roberto Firmino in the area, allowing him to take Naby Ke\u00efta\u2019s pass and turn almost at leisure to beat Speroni with a shot into the bottom corner. At least Tomkins was quickly able to atone for his error when he levelled the scores from a Luka Milivojevic corner, rising unchallenged at the far post to head past Alisson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/manchester-united-brighton-premier-league-premier-league-match-report\">Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford strike as Manchester United beat Brighton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That could and perhaps should have been a decisive moment in the title race but another defensive mistake steered Liverpool towards the three points. Milner did well to reach Fabinho\u2019s diagonal pass and turn a first-time cross back into the danger area but there was no one to accept the invitation until Speroni tried to intercept and succeeded only in wafting the ball backwards towards goal. Once again Salah was on hand to profit \u2013 his knack of being in the right place is uncanny \u2013 but the ball was crossing the line anyway.</p> \n<p>There was still time for two more goals and a dismissal as the day\u2019s second 4-3 face-off did its best to match the excitement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/wolverhampton-wanderers-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">seen earlier at Molineux</a>, and there was more riding on the result of this match.</p> \n<p>Judging by the roar from the Kop that greeted J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s fist-pumping salute at the end, Liverpool might just feel they have dodged a bullet.</p>",

The goal was against the run of play but the run of play and a wealth of possession had not been doing Liverpool any favours. With Xherdan Shaqiri on the bench they seemed to lack ideas and penetration, constantly shuttling the ball across the pitch without coming close to breaking through Palace\u2019s two banks of defenders. Juli\u00e1n Speroni made an early save from Jo\u00ebl Matip and Virgil van Dijk headed narrowly over the bar from a free-kick but that those two half-chances represented the closest Liverpool came to a goal in the first period told its own story. That was just the first half, though. With the sort of luck that will worry City supporters, Liverpool were back on level terms almost immediately after the interval with a goal that was more of Palace\u2019s making than their own. First Van Aanholt and Mamadou Sakho dithered over a loose ball in the penalty area, eventually clearing unconvincingly. Jordan Henderson fed Van Dijk, whose shot from 30 yards out was hopeful in the extreme, yet the ball struck James McArthur on the way through and ended up hanging tantalisingly in front of Speroni. The goalkeeper might have been more decisive and his hesitancy was punished by Salah, who stuck out his left leg to collect one of the simplest goals of his career. Palace were unnerved after that and the defence that had stood so firm in the first half gave way again six minutes later. James Tomkins unwisely stood off Roberto Firmino in the area, allowing him to take Naby Ke\u00efta\u2019s pass and turn almost at leisure to beat Speroni with a shot into the bottom corner. At least Tomkins was quickly able to atone for his error when he levelled the scores from a Luka Milivojevic corner, rising unchallenged at the far post to head past Alisson. That could and perhaps should have been a decisive moment in the title race but another defensive mistake steered Liverpool towards the three points. Milner did well to reach Fabinho\u2019s diagonal pass and turn a first-time cross back into the danger area but there was no one to accept the invitation until Speroni tried to intercept and succeeded only in wafting the ball backwards towards goal. Once again Salah was on hand to profit \u2013 his knack of being in the right place is uncanny \u2013 but the ball was crossing the line anyway. There was still time for two more goals and a dismissal as the day\u2019s second 4-3 face-off did its best to match the excitement seen earlier at Molineux, and there was more riding on the result of this match. Judging by the roar from the Kop that greeted J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s fist-pumping salute at the end, Liverpool might just feel they have dodged a bullet.",

Not that the owner seemed overly bothered as he sat, smirking, in the directors box listening to chants of \u201cWe want Ashley out\u201d and \u201cStand up if you hate Ashley.\u201d Given that he is said to be contemplating ending protracted takeover talks with assorted potential purchasers of the club after reportedly losing patience with those negotiating to buy him out, such messages could well prove forlorn. Instead Ashley and the Gallowgate Enders may be stuck with each other for some time to come. Even though Cardiff\u2019s most dangerous cameo involved a speculative long-range shot from Victor Camarasa which dipped tantalisingly over the bar, Newcastle\u2019s understandable edginess was manifested in a tendency to defend a little deep at times. Considering Martin Dubravka, their goalkeeper, was not required to make a single serious save, such initial timidity was probably unnecessary. Home nerves were finally assuaged when Sch\u00e4r doubled his side\u2019s advantage. After Matt Ritchie\u2019s corner was headed on by Jamaal Lascelles, the hero of the hour flicked out a thigh to divert the dropping ball beyond the Cardiff goalkeeper, Neil Etheridge. When Ayoze P\u00e9rez added a stoppage-time third the relief was palpable but the overall mood remained more shade than light. As P\u00e9rez tapped home a cross from the influential Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, resounding choruses of \u201cWe want Ashley out,\u201d continued to echo around St James\u2019. It took the sight of Ben\u00edtez striding towards the centre circle and saluting his public to lighten the atmosphere as, finally, smiles replaced snarls.",

It was Wilson\u2019s final involvement, Howe saying a knee problem curtailed his game, but further punishment would arrive at the death. David Brooks, who missed a free header in the first half but otherwise played elegantly, broke clear down the right and laid on a simple finish for Josh King. Bournemouth had come close on other occasions, Fabianski saving breathtakingly from Steve Cook moments before Carroll\u2019s moment of ignominy, and their margin of victory was deserved. \u201cI thought it was a real reward for the players\u2019 efforts and mindset during this difficult run,\u201d Howe said, while a curt Manuel Pellegrini offered little about the rationale of leaving Arnautovic behind. \u201cAs a manager you must make decisions on the players that work better in the week,\u201d the West Ham coach said. \u201cMarko has another issue so I thought it was not a good idea for him to play. We don\u2019t need to talk about a player that was not in the squad; I never complain about players that are not here.\u201d When might Arnautovic be ready to play again? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Pellegrini shot back. West Ham do not have long in the transfer window to find some certainty.",

      "body": "<p>Eddie Marsan, 50, is a prolific British character actor who has played roles as diverse as Shimon Peres, Heinrich Himmler and Bob Dylan. Born and raised in east London, he left school at 15 and apprenticed as a printer before becoming an actor. It took a decade before he started getting regular work, helped by Mike Leigh casting him in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/jan/09/features.review7\" title=\"\">Vera Drake</a></em> (2004) and as a volatile driving instructor in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/20/culture.mikeleigh\" title=\"\">Happy-Go-Lucky</a></em> (2008). In the US, where he now mostly works (though he lives in Chiswick), he is best known for his role as Terry, an ex-boxer with Parkinson\u2019s, in the Showtime series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/03/watching-ray-donovan-drama-tv\" title=\"\">Ray Donovan</a></em>. For his latest film <em>Vice</em>, exploring Dick Cheney\u2019s insidious role in the last Bush administration, Marsan plays deputy secretary of defence, Paul Wolfowitz.</p> <p><strong>When did you realise that you resembled </strong><strong>Wolfowitz enough to play him in </strong><em><strong>Vice</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>I got a call saying that [director] Adam McKay would like me to play this part. I knew who Paul Wolfowitz was \u2013 I\u2019m a bit of a politics geek \u2013 and I saw the physical similarity. It still needed a lot of time in makeup, but I\u2019m used to that \u2013 I\u2019m married to a makeup artist.</p> <p><strong>Did you come away thinking that Wolfowitz was a bad guy?</strong><br>No. I understood him as a man who believed in promoting democracy in other countries, and I played him as somebody who thought he was doing the right thing. I don\u2019t think anybody wakes up in the morning and says: \u201cI\u2019m going to be evil today.\u201d I played Himmler a couple of years ago [in <em>The Exception</em>] and even Himmler didn\u2019t think he was being evil.</p> <p><strong>But didn\u2019t you get a whiff of sulphur as you took a closer look at the Bush administration?</strong><br>No, I don\u2019t work like that. I don\u2019t demonise. If I did, I\u2019d be a terrible actor, because I play absolute motherfuckers all the time.</p> <p><strong>Have you heard any Republican reactions to the film?</strong><br>I heard that Jared Kushner and Ivanka [Trump] walked out of a screening \u2013 that was quite funny. I work with [vocal Republican supporter] Jon Voight on <em>Ray Donovan</em>, and he hasn\u2019t said anything. Me and him do sometimes talk about politics, but we\u2019re always very graceful with each other. I\u2019ve got a lot of affection for him, I just don\u2019t agree with him politically, which is fine. There\u2019s lots of people who I agree with politically who I can\u2019t fucking stand.</p> <p><strong>What did you make of Christian Bale\u2019s turn as Dick Cheney?</strong><br>I was blown away by it. As an actor I could see how much work he put into it \u2013 the discipline, the hours in makeup, the weight he put on. He\u2019s a very unshowy actor who just quietly gets on with his job and I admire that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZWxKRQhTw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aHZWxKRQhTw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZWxKRQhTw\">Watch a trailer for Vice</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>You\u2019re a</strong><strong> busy actor. Do you ever panic if you see a gap in your schedule?</strong><br>No, not really. I need more breaks actually, because I work too hard. I think it comes out of that fear when you\u2019re young and there\u2019s gaps and you never know when the next job is going to turn up. I\u2019m still working at that level. But it\u2019s not only to do with work: since my late teens, I\u2019ve needed to be in control of my own life.</p> <p><strong>You would have been badly suited to a full-time job</strong><strong>\u2026</strong><br>Yeah, I would have hated it. I love the challenge of not knowing what\u2019s coming next and having to adapt.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever felt typecast?</strong><br>No. I think the reason I avoided that, to be honest with you, is that I was never successful enough for anyone to have a fixed idea of me. So when people began to take notice of me, my career already had that diversity. Suddenly people started going, \u201cWho\u2019s this bloke? He\u2019s all over the place.\u201d</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve never had a defining role.</strong><br>The closest I\u2019ve had is on <em>Ray Donovan</em>. I\u2019ve played Terry for seven or eight years now and people have a lot of affection for him.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Marsan, 50, is a prolific British character actor who has played roles as diverse as Shimon Peres, Heinrich Himmler and Bob Dylan. Born and raised in east London, he left school at 15 and apprenticed as a printer before becoming an actor. It took a decade before he started getting regular work, helped by Mike Leigh casting him in Vera Drake (2004) and as a volatile driving instructor in Happy-Go-Lucky (2008). In the US, where he now mostly works (though he lives in Chiswick), he is best known for his role as Terry, an ex-boxer with Parkinson\u2019s, in the Showtime series Ray Donovan. For his latest film Vice, exploring Dick Cheney\u2019s insidious role in the last Bush administration, Marsan plays deputy secretary of defence, Paul Wolfowitz. When did you realise that you resembled Wolfowitz enough to play him in Vice? I got a call saying that [director] Adam McKay would like me to play this part. I knew who Paul Wolfowitz was \u2013 I\u2019m a bit of a politics geek \u2013 and I saw the physical similarity. It still needed a lot of time in makeup, but I\u2019m used to that \u2013 I\u2019m married to a makeup artist. Did you come away thinking that Wolfowitz was a bad guy? No. I understood him as a man who believed in promoting democracy in other countries, and I played him as somebody who thought he was doing the right thing. I don\u2019t think anybody wakes up in the morning and says: \u201cI\u2019m going to be evil today.\u201d I played Himmler a couple of years ago [in The Exception] and even Himmler didn\u2019t think he was being evil. But didn\u2019t you get a whiff of sulphur as you took a closer look at the Bush administration? No, I don\u2019t work like that. I don\u2019t demonise. If I did, I\u2019d be a terrible actor, because I play absolute motherfuckers all the time. Have you heard any Republican reactions to the film? I heard that Jared Kushner and Ivanka [Trump] walked out of a screening \u2013 that was quite funny. I work with [vocal Republican supporter] Jon Voight on Ray Donovan, and he hasn\u2019t said anything. Me and him do sometimes talk about politics, but we\u2019re always very graceful with each other. I\u2019ve got a lot of affection for him, I just don\u2019t agree with him politically, which is fine. There\u2019s lots of people who I agree with politically who I can\u2019t fucking stand. What did you make of Christian Bale\u2019s turn as Dick Cheney? I was blown away by it. As an actor I could see how much work he put into it \u2013 the discipline, the hours in makeup, the weight he put on. He\u2019s a very unshowy actor who just quietly gets on with his job and I admire that. You\u2019re a busy actor. Do you ever panic if you see a gap in your schedule? No, not really. I need more breaks actually, because I work too hard. I think it comes out of that fear when you\u2019re young and there\u2019s gaps and you never know when the next job is going to turn up. I\u2019m still working at that level. But it\u2019s not only to do with work: since my late teens, I\u2019ve needed to be in control of my own life. You would have been badly suited to a full-time job\u2026 Yeah, I would have hated it. I love the challenge of not knowing what\u2019s coming next and having to adapt. Have you ever felt typecast? No. I think the reason I avoided that, to be honest with you, is that I was never successful enough for anyone to have a fixed idea of me. So when people began to take notice of me, my career already had that diversity. Suddenly people started going, \u201cWho\u2019s this bloke? He\u2019s all over the place.\u201d You\u2019ve never had a defining role. The closest I\u2019ve had is on Ray Donovan. I\u2019ve played Terry for seven or eight years now and people have a lot of affection for him. They\u2019re always disappointed if they spend five minutes in my company and discover I\u2019m not as charismatic as Terry. Most actors prefer to keep their political views to themselves, but you\u2019re very outspoken. Why is that? I was outspoken before I became an actor, so the idea that I should be quiet now, I don\u2019t agree with. Also the things that I\u2019m saying are very close to my heart. I have a great personal investment in a country that believes in diversity, and I find Brexit is the opposite of that. You spend a lot of time arguing about Brexit on Twitter, often with Corbyn supporters. If you look at the far left, they know that people were manipulated and lied to over Brexit but they don\u2019t support a people\u2019s vote. Rather than giving people the information and letting them make up their own mind, they would rather lie to them more because they take comfort in their ideology \u2013 it\u2019s more important to them than the people their ideology is supposed to help. You get a lot of flak on Twitter. Does it bother you? I don\u2019t mind it really. My wife says Twitter is my midlife crisis. \u201cYou never went to university so this is your debating society.\u201d And I do find it interesting, I love debating with people, listening to different views. Usually when they say something personal, it\u2019s very inaccurate and says more about them than me. When you\u2019re not working, what do you get up to? Taking my kids to school, helping them with their homework. I read a lot, mostly politics and economics. I keep fit as much as possible. Terry Donovan is quite a physical part so I have to keep in pretty good shape. It\u2019s well documented that I don\u2019t really like pubs, but I have lots of friends around for dinner. What have you got coming up? A film called Feedback where I\u2019m playing a radio talkshow host in London who\u2019s obsessed by Brexit and his studio gets hijacked by terrorists.

      "bodyText": "Marcus Rashford graced his 150th Manchester United appearance with a strike he \u2013 and those inside Old Trafford \u2013 will always remember. Goal No 41 of his career came just before the interval and ensured a seventh win from Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s opening seven matches in charge. The Norwegian believes Rashford may currently be the Premier League\u2019s finest No 9. \u201cHe\u2019s playing the best football of his career,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHarry Kane is injured so maybe that gives him the chance to be the best at the moment.\u201d Rashford\u2019s winner came after Diogo Dalot moved along the left, drawing two defenders, before playing a clever ball to the 21-year-old. From there Rashford turned on the style: despite a tight angle he made a mug of Pascal Gross, then beat David Button with a sweet curled effort. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cWhat a finish. It is great working with him. That was his 150th game \u2013 I think he has scored more than a couple of the legends we have so he has a great future ahead of him. The first thing when I met him \u2013 he had missed some chances \u2013 I said: \u2018No problem, you\u2019ll be all right, just settle down a little bit\u2019.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r initially named his preferred XI, meaning no changes from the win at Tottenham, but Luke Shaw\u2019s withdrawal due to illness led to Dalot\u2019s inclusion, the Portuguese player slotting in at left-back. Chris Hughton retained the same team that lost to Liverpool last Saturday. United\u2019s speed of passing and thought dominated a quiet start, with the visitors claiming a corner and not much else. Ashley Young lifted a free-kick straight into the Stretford End, but the captain came close to creating the opener with his next contribution. A scuffed cross came to Rashford via Ga\u00ebtan Bong and his shot was beaten away by Button, the danger eventually ending when Paul Pogba\u2019s subsequent effort was blocked. This flurry jump-started United. Pogba narrowly missed with an overhead kick, and soon after a Rashford chip came close to beating the visiting goalkeeper. United stepped on the throttle, Nemanja Matic firing a 30-yard diagonal to Pogba. The midfielder\u2019s first touch swept the ball inside the area and Bong took him down. After a pause the referee, Paul Tierney, pointed to the spot. Up stepped Pogba, with his trademark slow-motion shuffle run-up, to beat Button to the right. Brighton\u2019s response was to pepper United\u2019s area aerially and the home side just about dealt with it.

One of the most memorable slogans in advertising was projected onto soft-focus vignettes of male American life: strong men playing sport, brave men hurtling into space, dashing men kissing beautiful women.

In 1989, Gillette launched its Best a Man Can Get campaign during the Superbowl. One of the most memorable slogans in advertising was projected onto soft-focus vignettes of male American life: strong men playing sport, brave men hurtling into space, dashing men kissing beautiful women. All set to a rousing 1980s power ballad. It did what advertising has been built to do: prop up a fantasy vision of manhood \u2013 one that relies on smooth abs and smouldering eyes to sell products. This week Gillette made a dramatic pivot to air a new campaign in response to #MeToo that challenges men to be better, less macho and to stop excusing bad behaviour with \u201cboys will be boys\u201d. The ad shows a father intervening in a fight, a friend stopping the street harassment of a woman, and a woman being mansplained to in a meeting. A company spokesperson denied the ad was set to air at next month\u2019s Superbowl. Led by a male creative team in the US and directed by female A-list commercial director Kim Gehrig \u2013 who has inevitably shouldered a volley of abuse \u2013 a shaving brand has co-opted a social movement; Gillette became \u201cwoke\u201d.

According to Sprout Social, a media analytics firm, 63% of tweets to @Gillette have been positive. Gillette is not alone in commercialising a social, political movement for profit; parent company Procter and Gamble saw huge success with its #LikeAGirl campaign, which debuted during the 2014 Superbowl. Commodifying feminism has been a feature for the advertising industry for at least five years \u2013 brands have insisted that women feel \u201cempowered\u201d by everything from their shampoo (Pantene), their maxi pads (Always) and their moisturisers (Dove) to their energy bills (EDF). In 2015, Lynx took gender equality on board and swerved away from using semi-naked women to sell deodorant to men.

She was the first woman to win the race, which, like the gripping new series of <em>SAS: Who Dares Wins</em>, pits male and female competitors against each other equally. She broke the course record by more than 12 hours. She did two-thirds of it in the dark. Towards the end, having slept for only three hours out of 82, she said she began to hallucinate, seeing trees doing a morning workout in the woods. At four of the five checkpoints, she stopped to express milk, because she is still breastfeeding her daughter.</p> <p>And she achieved all these astonishing things while on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-46906365\" title=\"\">a week-long break</a> from writing her PhD thesis.

On the same day that I read about her, agog with admiration, Ironman UK announced a brand new race: <a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/news/a25932752/ironman-uk-add-iron-girl-event/\" title=\"\">Iron Girl</a>, a 5k fun run, which would be open to women aged 16 and over (a liberal use of the word \u201cgirl\u201d, to my fragile, fun-sponge snowflake sensibilities).</p> <p>The backlash was inevitable, swift and largely very funny: female Ironman competitors wrote that perhaps they\u2019d like to change the name of the main competition to Ironboy, that a quick 5k would leave them just enough time to pop back and get the dinner on for their breadwinning husbands.</p> <p>To Ironman\u2019s credit, they listened and, recognising that perhaps offering \u201cgirls\u201d a fun run might be a bit on the patronising side, last week, of all weeks, they changed the event: \u201c[It] was in no way intended to diminish the achievements and capabilities of women,\u201d they wrote. It will now be a 5k night run, open to everyone.</p> <p>Jasmin Paris is probably exhausted, but I imagine that she could do it in her sleep.</p> <h2>Sharon Van Etten is still giving me teenage kicks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a1168d5083cee53730b8dd27df6635de8a7b8fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a1168d5083cee53730b8dd27df6635de8a7b8fe/0_492_4904_2942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Van Etten: at a creative highpoint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Van Etten: at a creative highpoint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has been a long time since I\u2019ve felt the pure adolescent thrill of desperately waiting for an album to come out, but over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/06/sharon-van-etten-interview-remind-me-tomorrow\" title=\"\">Sharon Van Etten</a>\u2019s new singles on repeat and on Friday she finally released her brilliant new record, <em>Remind Me Tomorrow</em>. Bus journeys I could have skipped have become urgent and necessary, just so I can listen to it on headphones, on repeat, staring out of the window, picking over the lyrics.</p> <p>It is shaping up to be so good that once I would have almost certainly written out the words on my pencil case in permanent marker.</p> <p>Performing its best song, the anthemic, Springsteen-esque <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sharon-van-etten-seventeen-kimmel-780343/\" title=\"\">Seventeen</a> \u2013 a conversation between her younger self and the woman she is today \u2013 on a US chatshow, she looked like a cross between Mick Jagger and PJ Harvey.</p> <p>It is her fifth album in 10 years and it seems set to be a creative highpoint.

Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/16/artist-bridget-riley-unveils-huge-messengers-wall-painting\" title=\"\">Bridget Riley unveiled <em>Messengers</em></a>, a new permanent work at London\u2019s National Gallery, which consists of purple, orange and green discs painted directly on to the walls.</p> <p>She explained what she hoped it might inspire in people: \u201cI want to make the viewer feel alive, to have a kind of joy in feeling alive. I just hope that they give you pleasure.\u201d In despairing times, or times in which falling into despair might seem all too easy, I felt grateful for the rousing simplicity of the sentiment. Perhaps the additional context of what felt like a grim and unprincipled week in politics made it resonate all the more.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Pulitzer prize-winning poet <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46908975\" title=\"\">Mary Oliver died</a>, at the age of 83. Across my Instagram feed, people shared her work. Over and over again, I read lines that implored people to live eagerly, hungrily and to embrace what we have before it\u2019s gone. I have too often heard people sneering at the mass tributes we take part in when someone public and admired dies, but I was moved by people sharing Oliver\u2019s poems, usually implying that they had a story to tell, but chose not to, instead letting her words act as a cipher. Those beautiful closing lines to <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/poetry/180/133.html\" title=\"\">The Summer Day</a> appeared most often: \u201cTell me, what is it you plan to do/ with your one wild and precious life?\u201d</p> <p>This has become one of those inspirational quotes, painted prettily on to scenic backdrops, but its ubiquity has not dimmed its power. It provided, as Riley had called for, another kind of joy in feeling alive.</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist</p>",

She broke the course record by more than 12 hours. She did two-thirds of it in the dark. Towards the end, having slept for only three hours out of 82, she said she began to hallucinate, seeing trees doing a morning workout in the woods. At four of the five checkpoints, she stopped to express milk, because she is still breastfeeding her daughter. And she achieved all these astonishing things while on a week-long break from writing her PhD thesis. And I thought I\u2019d had a good few days by completing week three of Couch to 5K. Paris\u2019s story is remarkable. On the same day that I read about her, agog with admiration, Ironman UK announced a brand new race: Iron Girl, a 5k fun run, which would be open to women aged 16 and over (a liberal use of the word \u201cgirl\u201d, to my fragile, fun-sponge snowflake sensibilities). The backlash was inevitable, swift and largely very funny: female Ironman competitors wrote that perhaps they\u2019d like to change the name of the main competition to Ironboy, that a quick 5k would leave them just enough time to pop back and get the dinner on for their breadwinning husbands. To Ironman\u2019s credit, they listened and, recognising that perhaps offering \u201cgirls\u201d a fun run might be a bit on the patronising side, last week, of all weeks, they changed the event: \u201c[It] was in no way intended to diminish the achievements and capabilities of women,\u201d they wrote. It will now be a 5k night run, open to everyone. Jasmin Paris is probably exhausted, but I imagine that she could do it in her sleep. Sharon Van Etten is still giving me teenage kicks It has been a long time since I\u2019ve felt the pure adolescent thrill of desperately waiting for an album to come out, but over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been playing Sharon Van Etten\u2019s new singles on repeat and on Friday she finally released her brilliant new record, Remind Me Tomorrow. Bus journeys I could have skipped have become urgent and necessary, just so I can listen to it on headphones, on repeat, staring out of the window, picking over the lyrics. It is shaping up to be so good that once I would have almost certainly written out the words on my pencil case in permanent marker. Performing its best song, the anthemic, Springsteen-esque Seventeen \u2013 a conversation between her younger self and the woman she is today \u2013 on a US chatshow, she looked like a cross between Mick Jagger and PJ Harvey. It is her fifth album in 10 years and it seems set to be a creative highpoint. Van Etten has long been a songwriter who conveys a sense of intimacy and pain and while self-reflection exists here, it is also confident and strong, full of the joy of feeling alive. Mary Oliver, a reassuring voice for our troubled times Asking artists to talk about their work can be a futile game; the most sensible ones, frustratingly and often correctly, will tell you the work should speak for itself. Last week, Bridget Riley unveiled Messengers, a new permanent work at London\u2019s National Gallery, which consists of purple, orange and green discs painted directly on to the walls. She explained what she hoped it might inspire in people: \u201cI want to make the viewer feel alive, to have a kind of joy in feeling alive. I just hope that they give you pleasure.\u201d In despairing times, or times in which falling into despair might seem all too easy, I felt grateful for the rousing simplicity of the sentiment. Perhaps the additional context of what felt like a grim and unprincipled week in politics made it resonate all the more. On Thursday, the Pulitzer prize-winning poet Mary Oliver died, at the age of 83. Across my Instagram feed, people shared her work. Over and over again, I read lines that implored people to live eagerly, hungrily and to embrace what we have before it\u2019s gone. I have too often heard people sneering at the mass tributes we take part in when someone public and admired dies, but I was moved by people sharing Oliver\u2019s poems, usually implying that they had a story to tell, but chose not to, instead letting her words act as a cipher. Those beautiful closing lines to The Summer Day appeared most often: \u201cTell me, what is it you plan to do/ with your one wild and precious life?\u201d This has become one of those inspirational quotes, painted prettily on to scenic backdrops, but its ubiquity has not dimmed its power. It provided, as Riley had called for, another kind of joy in feeling alive. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "The first Women\u2019s March, held the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as president in 2017, was the largest single-day protest in US history, drawing millions to the streets to reject Trump in a colourful riot of placards, fury and pink \u201cpussy hats\u201d. The third iteration, however, is a diminished and beleaguered event that has struggled to shake off accusations of antisemitism. Tens of thousands, rather than millions, were expected to take part in the Women\u2019s March on Saturday, with the controversial statements of organisers blamed for pushing down numbers. Rallies were taking place in cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta, with the main event in Washington featuring a march from near the White House to the Trump International Hotel. An agenda published by march organisers called for action to address violence against women, racial injustice and immigrant rights. But the marches were set to be a shadow of 2017, when about 500,000 people gathered in Washington and millions more across the country. The march has stirred controversy due to links between some organisers and Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who has compared Jewish people to termites and called them \u201cthe mother and father of apartheid\u201d. Tamika Mallory, a Women\u2019s March co-chair, was criticized after she posted a photo on Instagram of herself and Farrakhan, calling him \u201cthe GOAT\u201d which stands for \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d. Mallory has since said she does not agree with all of Farrakhan\u2019s statements but refused to condemn him. \u201cI didn\u2019t call him the greatest of all time because of his rhetoric,\u201d Mallory told ABC\u2019s The View. \u201cI called him the greatest of all time because of what he\u2019s done in black communities.\u201d Critics point to what they see as a pattern of discriminatory behaviour. In December, Vanessa Wruble, an original Women\u2019s March organiser, claimed Mallory and Carmen Perez, a co-president, made antisemitic comments in a meeting. Wruble told the New York Times Mallory and Perez said there was a \u201cdark side\u201d to Jewish history and that Jews were primary instigators of the oppression of African Americans. Teresa Shook, who founded the march, has called for the co-chairs to resign because they have \u201callowed antisemitism, anti-LBGTQIA sentiment and hateful, racist rhetoric to become a part of the platform by their refusal to separate themselves from groups that espouse these racist, hateful beliefs\u201d. The controversy has seen prominent supporters peel away, threatening to blunt what was intended to be a forceful rebuke of Trump. The president is presiding over a government shutdown that is now the longest in history while under increasing pressure from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat representative in Congress, wrote in scathing terms about the Women\u2019s March in a USA Today op-ed on Friday. \u201cWhile I still firmly believe in its values and mission, I cannot associate with the national march\u2019s leaders and principles, which refuse to completely repudiate antisemitism and all forms of bigotry,\u201d Wasserman Schultz wrote. \u201cI cannot walk shoulder to shoulder with leaders who lock arms with outspoken peddlers of hate.\u201d The Democratic National Committee has withdrawn its sponsorship of the marches, with many expected 2020 presidential contenders not taking part. An exception is Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, who spoke at the 2017 event and will attend a march in Iowa. Rival events are being held in New York and Philadelphia, due to rifts within the movement, with organizers deciding not to hold a march at all in Chicago. Plans to march in Eureka, California, were reported cancelled after supporters decided the protest would be \u201coverwhelmingly white\u201d. On Saturday a spokeswoman for the march told the Guardian by email it had been reinstated by new leadership and would begin at noon. A major march was expected in Los Angeles, with celebrities including the actor Jane Fonda set to attend. Elsewhere, the actors America Ferrera and Maggie Gyllenhaal, and bestselling author Asha Badele, were continuing to show their support. Organizers accept this year\u2019s march will be much smaller than 2017 \u2013 about 300 buses were arranged to bring protesters to Washington, compared with 3,000 \u2013 but are attempting to brush aside the antisemitic controversy. Bob Bland, another co-chair, said the march \u201cunequivocally condemns antisemitism\u201d and sought to keep the focus on the event\u2019s broader message. \u201cThese are the leaders we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d she said of women inspired by the movement to get into politics. \u201cWe always wanted to see these women become the face of our leadership and the face of the nation, and I think that\u2019s what we saw in the midterm elections, where we saw a historical outpouring of thousands of women running for office.\u201d",

News last week that fewer, and slower, trains than planned could eventually run on the new network to keep costs in check have underscored concerns about escalating budgets. Recently, a former HS2 director told the BBC\u2019s <em>Panorama</em> programme that the company had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/17/hs2-misled-mps-about-cost-of-high-speed-rail-project-whistleblower\" title=\"\">massively understated the price of property</a> and compensation along the route; while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/30/hs2-rail-chief-terry-morgan-faces-sack-over-spiralling-costs\" title=\"\">resignation in December of Sir Terry Morgan</a> as chair of HS2 Ltd came after the woes of Crossrail \u2013 also chaired by Morgan until late last year \u2013 dented faith in vows to deliver infrastructure projects on time and on budget.</p> <p>The first phase of HS2, from London to Birmingham, is scheduled to open in December 2026, with the second phase \u2013 from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds \u2013 due for 2033.</p> <p>Officially, HS2 maintains it is on target for 2033, despite a delay to phase two\u2019s parliamentary timetable. The former chairman Sir David Higgins warned in 2014 that the \u201ckey variable\u201d pushing up costs would be a legislative wait, hoping a bill to build the Manchester and Leeds forks could reach the Commons in 2017. Now, the aspiration is for 2020, with royal assent not expected until 2023. Meanwhile, an environmental consultation for the northern route has provoked more condemnation: in December the <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/hs2\" title=\"\">Wildlife Trust condemned </a>work to mitigate destruction of natural habitats as \u201cderisory\u201d.</p> <p>Little wonder the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, warned the rail industry that HS2\u2019s northern reaches still needed to be fought for. But at the end of this pain, the government believes, the high-speed network will deliver a massive economic boost and regeneration for the cities it connects \u2013 an argument most clearly endorsed in Manchester and Yorkshire.</p> <p>The experience of businesses and towns on Britain\u2019s only existing high-speed route would appear to bear this out. In Ashford, Kent, after a decade of domestic high-speed services, the council sees the fast rail connection as a clear competitive edge that has drawn in a host of new businesses and investment and seen the town\u2019s population grow rapidly. Trains to London used to take 82 minutes but now take just 38 \u2013 a fact celebrated in the name of the largest new office building in the region, Connect 38, situated moments from the station.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/archive-zip/giv-3902MjUQngNLdRZK/\" data-alt=\"euston 2019\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/archive-zip/giv-3902MjUQngNLdRZK/\">euston 2019</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/archive-zip/giv-3902IQX7ixiMyAKM/\" data-alt=\"Euston 2026\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/archive-zip/giv-3902IQX7ixiMyAKM/\">Euston 2026</a> </figure>  <p>Business leaders are clear about the impact of HS1 and Southeastern\u2019s fast trains. Chapel Down, the wine producer, is building its \u00a31.3m Curious Brewery in Ashford, directly adjacent to the high-speed rail station \u2013 as well as an eponymous bar near the London terminus to showcase its drinks, which now include gin and vodka. The chief executive, Frazer Thompson, says: \u201cWe could have been in Maidstone or Tunbridge Wells \u2013 they\u2019ve got good connectivity \u2013 but we chose Ashford for the rail link. It\u2019s a no-brainer. We\u2019re London-centric \u2013 we can do a couple of meetings in the morning and be back here for the afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson says the proximity has helped attract staff from the capital. Rob Reynolds, managing partner of accountancy firm Wilkins Kennedy, which has an office in Ashford, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s always been a good place to do business \u2013 but now people want to stick here.\u201d</p> <p>According to Visit Kent, the high-speed link is a crucial factor for one in five visitors, thus supporting more than 5,000 jobs in the county\u2019s tourist economy alone. A relocation agency helping businesses move to the area, Locate in Kent, says the half-hour journey to Stratford \u2013 which has a stop on the HS1 route \u2013 is even more critical for attracting tech firms that have been priced out of east London but want to stay close to the growing hub around the former Olympic park.</p> <p>For some critics, the regeneration opportunities are is a red herring. Lord Berkeley, a rail expert who has presented independent costings of the route from Euston that suggest HS2\u2019s budget will more than double to \u00a3100bn-plus, says: \u201cRegeneration is essential: but it can be achieved in a far wider spread of cities at far less cost than that required for HS2, and in a much shorter delivery period.\u201d</p> <p>If the Treasury\u2019s cost-benefit forecast for HS2 has always been unconvincing, supporters prefer to highlight the dramatic transformation wrought around the high-speed stations \u2013 in London too, where King\u2019s Cross St Pancras thrives with housing, shops and restaurants. Dyan Crowther, chief executive of HS1, was manager of King\u2019s Cross station before regeneration. She says: \u201cI used to walk around the back with a [signalling] lamp hoiking prostitutes out of the station. I used to send my cleaners out in pairs. You certainly wouldn\u2019t go to the cashpoint.</p> <p>\u201cYou can sit here all day and write business cases, but if you don\u2019t do something, nothing will happen. This is not about moving metal from A to B; it\u2019s about changing people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>Could Euston\u2019s painful reshaping end up a similarly positive story? Camden borough council hopes yes \u2013 but cautions that hurdles remain. Danny Beales, cabinet member for investing in communities at Camden council, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing hard to mitigate the effects of decades of HS2 construction disruption on Camden\u2019s communities and continue to do so \u2013 we\u2019ve recently finished building around 100 council homes to replace those being demolished \u2013 but more action is needed.\u201d</p> <p>He holds out hope for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/08/revised-hs2-plans-for-euston-extend-build-time-by-seven-years\" title=\"\">comprehensive redevelopment</a>: affordable housing and public spaces, and routes to connect neighbourhoods long separated by the station. Negotiations continue with HS2 and government, Beales says: \u201cWe\u2019re clear that not achieving this vision would be a huge opportunity lost, and a bad outcome for Camden residents.\u201d</p>",

Officially, HS2 maintains it is on target for 2033, despite a delay to phase two\u2019s parliamentary timetable. The former chairman Sir David Higgins warned in 2014 that the \u201ckey variable\u201d pushing up costs would be a legislative wait, hoping a bill to build the Manchester and Leeds forks could reach the Commons in 2017. Now, the aspiration is for 2020, with royal assent not expected until 2023. Meanwhile, an environmental consultation for the northern route has provoked more condemnation: in December the Wildlife Trust condemned work to mitigate destruction of natural habitats as \u201cderisory\u201d. Little wonder the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, warned the rail industry that HS2\u2019s northern reaches still needed to be fought for. But at the end of this pain, the government believes, the high-speed network will deliver a massive economic boost and regeneration for the cities it connects \u2013 an argument most clearly endorsed in Manchester and Yorkshire. The experience of businesses and towns on Britain\u2019s only existing high-speed route would appear to bear this out. In Ashford, Kent, after a decade of domestic high-speed services, the council sees the fast rail connection as a clear competitive edge that has drawn in a host of new businesses and investment and seen the town\u2019s population grow rapidly. Trains to London used to take 82 minutes but now take just 38 \u2013 a fact celebrated in the name of the largest new office building in the region, Connect 38, situated moments from the station. Business leaders are clear about the impact of HS1 and Southeastern\u2019s fast trains. Chapel Down, the wine producer, is building its \u00a31.3m Curious Brewery in Ashford, directly adjacent to the high-speed rail station \u2013 as well as an eponymous bar near the London terminus to showcase its drinks, which now include gin and vodka. The chief executive, Frazer Thompson, says: \u201cWe could have been in Maidstone or Tunbridge Wells \u2013 they\u2019ve got good connectivity \u2013 but we chose Ashford for the rail link. It\u2019s a no-brainer. We\u2019re London-centric \u2013 we can do a couple of meetings in the morning and be back here for the afternoon.\u201d Thompson says the proximity has helped attract staff from the capital. Rob Reynolds, managing partner of accountancy firm Wilkins Kennedy, which has an office in Ashford, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s always been a good place to do business \u2013 but now people want to stick here.\u201d According to Visit Kent, the high-speed link is a crucial factor for one in five visitors, thus supporting more than 5,000 jobs in the county\u2019s tourist economy alone. A relocation agency helping businesses move to the area, Locate in Kent, says the half-hour journey to Stratford \u2013 which has a stop on the HS1 route \u2013 is even more critical for attracting tech firms that have been priced out of east London but want to stay close to the growing hub around the former Olympic park. For some critics, the regeneration opportunities are is a red herring. Lord Berkeley, a rail expert who has presented independent costings of the route from Euston that suggest HS2\u2019s budget will more than double to \u00a3100bn-plus, says: \u201cRegeneration is essential: but it can be achieved in a far wider spread of cities at far less cost than that required for HS2, and in a much shorter delivery period.\u201d If the Treasury\u2019s cost-benefit forecast for HS2 has always been unconvincing, supporters prefer to highlight the dramatic transformation wrought around the high-speed stations \u2013 in London too, where King\u2019s Cross St Pancras thrives with housing, shops and restaurants. Dyan Crowther, chief executive of HS1, was manager of King\u2019s Cross station before regeneration. She says: \u201cI used to walk around the back with a [signalling] lamp hoiking prostitutes out of the station. I used to send my cleaners out in pairs. You certainly wouldn\u2019t go to the cashpoint. \u201cYou can sit here all day and write business cases, but if you don\u2019t do something, nothing will happen. This is not about moving metal from A to B; it\u2019s about changing people\u2019s lives.\u201d Could Euston\u2019s painful reshaping end up a similarly positive story? Camden borough council hopes yes \u2013 but cautions that hurdles remain. Danny Beales, cabinet member for investing in communities at Camden council, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing hard to mitigate the effects of decades of HS2 construction disruption on Camden\u2019s communities and continue to do so \u2013 we\u2019ve recently finished building around 100 council homes to replace those being demolished \u2013 but more action is needed.\u201d He holds out hope for a comprehensive redevelopment: affordable housing and public spaces, and routes to connect neighbourhoods long separated by the station. Negotiations continue with HS2 and government, Beales says: \u201cWe\u2019re clear that not achieving this vision would be a huge opportunity lost, and a bad outcome for Camden residents.\u201d",

This, coupled with a growing appreciation for all things handmade and an increasing awareness of the environmental impact of the textile industry, has resulted in a wave of weavers who operate at the intersection of art, craft and design. Maria Sigma Maria Sigma\u2019s zero-waste textiles draw on her Greek heritage: \u201cAriadne\u201d is a throw that takes its name from the heroine in Homer\u2019s Odyssey who used a thread to help her lover, while \u201cTheseus\u201d, who escaped the Minotaur\u2019s labyrinth, is made on a floor loom with wool in muted shades. The edge has been hand-crocheted in Aegean blue. Sigma\u2019s cushions, rugs, upholstered stools and handwoven garments are made from undyed, natural British wool, alpaca, linen and recycled cotton. \u201cAt every stage of design, I\u2019m thinking about the environmental impact.\u201d She studied textile conservation in Greece and textile design at Chelsea College of Art. Her loom in her east London studio is connected to a computer control unit where she loads her patterns, which include textured distorted diamonds and classic twills. \u201cWith a computer you can make much more complicated designs,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the loom still puts you through a lot of limitations.\u201d mariasigma.com Hannah Robson Woven into Hannah Robson\u2019s sculptural artworks are the tail hairs of Sparkle, her friend\u2019s pony. \u201cI pick up materials where I can find them,\u201d Robson says. \u201cFor me, anything is ripe for weaving.\u201d Robson, a lecturer in woven textile design at Bradford College, creates pieces that explore the idea of connection. Inspired by the wire sculptures of Ruth Asawa and Gego, her work is equally informed by time spent at a technical textile company that made looms to create carbon fibre and carbon glass for cars and trains. \u201cThe techniques I observed there filtered into my practice.\u201d From her studio in Oxford, Robson uses a floor loom to \u201ccreate opportunities for threads to break away from the surface\u201d.

Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/10/greta-thunberg-davos-tycoons-fossil-fuels-dismantle-climate-crisis\">put pressure on world leaders over that last theme</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As the WEF\u2019s founder, Klaus Schwab, puts it: \u201cGlobalisation produces winners and losers and there are many more winners in the last 24, 25, 30 years \u2013 but now we have to look after the losers, those who have been left behind.\u201d</p> \n<p>Schwab will be pushing politicians and business chiefs towards a new \u201cinclusive\u201d globalisation to fix the gap between the \u201cprecariat\u201d many and the privileged few.

      "bodyText": "Political and economic problems loom heavily over the global elite as they gather at Davos for the World Economic Forum. But is there any political will to fix them? Globalisation on the rocks? The World Economic Forum sees its role as \u201cimproving the state of the world\u201d. But the political analyst and author Anand Giridharadas speaks for many critics when he dubs Davos \u201ca family reunion for the people who broke the world\u201d. After decades championing globalisation, the WEF now fears that rising inequality, protectionism and nationalist politics could send the world economy \u201csleepwalking\u201d into another crisis. As the WEF\u2019s founder, Klaus Schwab, puts it: \u201cGlobalisation produces winners and losers and there are many more winners in the last 24, 25, 30 years \u2013 but now we have to look after the losers, those who have been left behind.\u201d Schwab will be pushing politicians and business chiefs towards a new \u201cinclusive\u201d globalisation to fix the gap between the \u201cprecariat\u201d many and the privileged few. But will this address the concerns of the many millions who feel the system is rigged against them, and who will never make the trek to Davos? Realistically, the WEF will be wrestling with the same problems in 2020 \u2026 and 2021 ... and beyond. Climate change crisis After years of warnings, most business leaders, politicians and economists seem to have got the message. Climate change and extreme weather events have rocketed to the top of the list of dangers facing the world economy, according to the WEF\u2019s annual survey of global risks. Unfortunately, worsening international relations and rising nationalism means it\u2019s even harder to get global agreement to address the problem, even though California\u2019s wildfires and Europe\u2019s recent floods have shown the human and economic cost of inaction. Fortunately, the WEF can turn to Sir David Attenborough to drive the message home. The broadcaster and naturalist (at 92, the oldest delegate risking Davos\u2019s treacherously icy pavements) will address delegates \u2013 and warn that \u201cnever has an understanding of the natural world been so important to ensure a safe future for our planet\u201d. Mental health The WEF has made mental health a key theme at Davos this year. The forum will address fears that depression, anxiety and other mental health problems are rising, and being neither measured correctly nor properly addressed. Prince William will challenge business leaders to improve emotional and mental wellbeing in their workplaces. He\u2019s appearing on a \u201cmental health matters\u201d panel alongside the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. Kensington Palace says the Duke of Cambridge will \u201cuse the opportunity to highlight his belief that the world\u2019s major employers have a vital role to play in promoting mentally healthy societies and workplaces\u201d. The China slowdown Hopes that Davos might deliver a breakthrough in the US-China trade war were dashed when Donald Trump benched the entire White House delegation on Friday. In their absence, Wang Qishan, China\u2019s vice-president, will give a special address. Behind the scenes, Wang will be pressed about how much damage the US trade war is causing, and whether China\u2019s economy is slowing as quickly as some economists fear. It\u2019s just a shame that the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin; the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; the secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross; and the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, will not be there. The rise of populism The new wave of populist leaders will be rubbing padded snow jackets with more mainstream politicians. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s new right-wing president, will fill Trump\u2019s snow boots by giving a special address on Tuesday, allowing him to set the agenda for the opening day. Bolsonaro said he would be presenting \u201ca different Brazil, free of ideological ties and widespread corruption\u201d. His tax cuts and privatisations are popular with investors, so Davos will probably give him a rousing reception. Human rights groups, though, would like to challenge Bolsonaro on his autocratic policies and recent loosening of gun laws. George Soros, scourge of the populists, will probably take a few potshots at the absent Trump. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, won\u2019t catch them in person, though \u2013 he\u2019s remaining in Paris to hold a national debate in response to the gilets jaunes crisis. Brexit Theresa May is another Davos no-show, choosing to stay with the Brexit crisis in Westminster. Philip Hammond is expected to attend, and will get his ear bent by increasingly anxious UK business leaders worried about no deal. The WEF will hold a session on Brexit; wisely, they\u2019ve held it back until the end of the week. As of Friday, no speakers had been named either ... The PM might not mind missing out, given her distaste for the \u201ccitizens of the world\u201d who flock to Davos each year.",

We come back in the second half with fantastic desire, we put Wolves under pressure, it was a fantastic feeling. But it was difficult to maintain our pressing. We had the happiness to score the third goal, but we didn\u2019t keep our structure. We wanted to score another goal in extra time, and that is our fault. It is sad.

Last year\u2019s Championship winners are in no danger of going back down. Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s team can beat the best of them on their day: they\u2019ve taken a point off the champions Manchester City, won at Spurs, and knocked league leaders Liverpool out of the cup. The 1954, 1958 and 1959 champions of England are back, baby!</p> <p><strong>Even so, their recent form hasn\u2019t been so hot. </strong>Beating Tottenham just after Christmas was some result, but it\u2019s their only win in their last five Premier League outings. That sequence has seen them well beaten at home by Liverpool and Crystal Palace, scrape a draw at Fulham, and lose heavily at Manchester City. They could do with a big result here to get themselves back into the top half of the table.</p> <p><strong>Midlands rivals Leicester City may well oblige. </strong>The 2016 Premier League winners been dismal of late, losing at home in the league to Cardiff and Southampton, and getting themselves knocked out of the FA Cup by Newport, the biggest shock of the third round. Claude Puel isn\u2019t popular with the punters and the pressure is rising. He\u2019ll take heart from the way his unpredictable side occasionally hit a rich seam of form - they saw off Manchester City on Boxing Day, then won at Chelsea. Also the Foxes have only lost two of their last 13 matches against Wolves, a run that includes a 2-0 win at the start of this campaign and victory on penalties in the League Cup to boot.</p> <p><strong>Not so easy to predict this one, then. </strong>That\u2019s 11th versus eighth for you. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-19T11:26:43.163Z\">at 11.26am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s your lot. Congratulations to Wolves, who won a Premier League classic; commiserations to Claude Puel, who will be under even greater pressure now. If we see a better game all season, we\u2019ll be doing pretty well. Thanks for reading! And now a grim-faced Claude Puel. \u201cWe have had a lot of emotion in this game, different feelings. We started with poor play, a poor performance at the beginning. This we had to correct. After the second goal we came back with good intention, pressing, quality, chances to come back. We come back in the second half with fantastic desire, we put Wolves under pressure, it was a fantastic feeling. But it was difficult to maintain our pressing. We had the happiness to score the third goal, but we didn\u2019t keep our structure. We wanted to score another goal in extra time, and that is our fault. It is sad. To concede the last goal is difficult, very disappointing. My concern is to keep my focus. Other things are not my focus.\u201d A beaming Nuno speaks! \u201cA very good game. A game we have to look at, but it\u2019s a game everyone enjoys. Fantastic game of football, two teams that really wanted to win and play the game. Of course I think that when we were in the advantage, we should manage it better. We thought we had the game, but in football you cannot, it is never finished. We are speaking with happiness and relief. I was sent off, but rightly so, you cannot go on the pitch. I went outside it, but then just on. Someone saw me!\u201d Ben Fisher hit the jackpot this week. He was in situ at Molineux to witness some top-drawer entertainment, and here\u2019s his report of a thriller! The hat-trick hero Diogo Jota speaks some righteous truth. \u201cThis is the Premier League! Every team believes until the end. In a game you win like this, you feel great. We know Ruben Neves\u2019s ability to put long passes in, we practice in training, we believe that the ball is going to be there, and we just have to be there and do the final touch. I thought I had missed the last opportunity, but thankfully there was another one and I could score.\u201d He saunters off with the match ball under one arm, the man-of-the-match award in the other hand. A good day at the office! What a game, though. Both teams had an absurd number of chances! Leicester took 16 pots at goal to Wolves\u2019 12. Not sure what Leicester\u2019s defence was up to right at the end. Piling forward and leaving two at the back, with the manager\u2019s job on the line, was just asking for trouble. And trouble came at them with extreme prejudice. After you, Claude. It almost seems irrelevant at the moment, with the Molineux masses bouncing in joy to celebrate that sensational victory. But the win\u2019s taken Wolves above Leicester in the Premier League table. They\u2019re in eighth spot now, at least for a wee while. Anyway, you\u2019ll do well to see a better match than that for a while. Both teams put on wonderful attacking displays, even if the defending sometimes left a little to be desired. But Wolves were thoroughly deserved winners, because they looked just that little bit more dangerous going forward, just that little bit more solid at the back. It\u2019s a thin line between success and failure sometimes, and the reactions of both managers illustrated that all right: Nuno\u2019s smile sparkled brighter than gold, while Puel buried his face in both hands. Wow. Wow! The best game of this Premier League season so far, and it\u2019s been won in dramatic circumstances by Jota\u2019s hat-trick! Claude Puel held his head in disbelief; that late blow could have serious repercussions for the under-fire Leicester manager. But what a win for Wolves, who were magnificent today, Molineux celebrating accordingly! The Wolves boss came racing onto the pitch, Klopp style, to celebrate with his players. And he\u2019s been sent packing as a result! A long rake down the right for Jimenez, another fine Neves pass. Jimenez curls a first-time ball into the middle, and Jota opens his body to slip a shot into the bottom left! What drama here! 90 min +2: Jota chases an up-and-under down the middle. He very nearly gets in between Evans and Pereira, but can\u2019t poke the ball past Schmeichel. But then ... 90 min +1: The first extra minute is spent dealing with Iheanacho, who took a whack from Doherty there. On the touchline, Claude Puel tells his charges to take it easy. He\u2019ll settle for this point; it might just have kept him in a job. 90 min: The corner\u2019s hit long. Doherty rises at the far post, but is crowded out and can only send a poor header wide left from close range. There will be three added minutes of this marvellous match; if only there could be 33. 89 min: But this one\u2019s cleared easily, and Jota goes racing down the left on the counter. He crosses. Evans can only eyebrow a clearance to Jimenez, in space on the right. Jimenez can\u2019t get the ball down to shoot, but earns a corner. This is relentless! Can anyone find a dramatic winner? 88 min: Evans passes long down the left and Vardy earns a corner off Bennett. The magician Maddison to take. What a free kick from Maddison! From the right wing, he curls it towards the far post, the ball dropping to Morgan on the edge of the six-yard box. Morgan rises highest and guides a header into the top right! Leicester\u2019s captain races off to the dugout, pointing at Puel, dedicating his goal to his manager! 86 min: Jonny is booked for another foul on Mendy. A kick on the knee, more clumsy than intentional. A free kick out on the right, and Maddison is over this one too. 85 min: Leicester try to move Wolves about. Jota tugs Mendy\u2019s shoulder, and this is a free kick 35 yards out. Maddison is over it. He lays off to Chilwell, who chips weakly into the mixer. Wolves clear easily. That\u2019s extremely poor. 83 min: Iheanacho comes on for Simpson. 82 min: Chilwell crosses deep from the left. Wolves don\u2019t clear, and Pereira is able to hook the ball back from the byline to the right of goal. He finds Maddison, on the edge of the six-yard box. Maddison appears surprised, and scuffs a first-time effort wide right. A real chance there. 81 min: Gibbs-White comes on for Moutinho. 79 min: Gray wedges a pass down the left and nearly releases Vardy into the box, but the ball clacks off the striker\u2019s heel. A cute effort. Both players hold their head in their hands; that wasn\u2019t far from opening Wolves up. 78 min: Leicester stroke it around in Wolves territory awhile, but don\u2019t really go anywhere, the hosts holding their shape. Admirable patience by Leicester, though, who could be forgiven for getting a bit desperate, given their manager\u2019s plight. 76 min: Jonny drives down the Wolves left; Mendy dribbles down the Leicester right. There\u2019s a pleasing basketball rhythm to this match now. 74 min: Gray sends a daisycutter goalwards. It\u2019s deflected into the path of Vardy, and nearly pinballs in the direction of Maddison, who would have been clear in the area with a little luck. But the ball rolls Wolverhampton\u2019s way, and the home side clear. Nearly an immediate impact from the Leicester sub. 73 min: Apologies to Barnes for the previous entry, because he\u2019s now hooked for Maddison. Pulitzer, please! Meanwhile Doherty comes on for Wolves, replacing Vinagre. 72 min: Barnes bowls down the left and nearly sends Gray clear with a little dink forward. Not quite. That very early loose pass apart, Barnes has impressed today. He can take heart from his first Premier League start, whatever the result. 70 min: Jimenez grafts down the left to earn Wolves a corner. Moutinho takes. Chilwell half clears. Neves attempts an ambitious volley from 30 yards and nearly hits the corner flag on the left. He\u2019s earned the right to take such an ambitious dig; that pass for Jota\u2019s second was sensational. 68 min: So that Barnes equaliser ... turns out the shot was curling just wide of the right-hand post, and took a flick off Coady. So that\u2019s an own goal. It never rains but it pours, eh Leicester fans. 66 min: Jimenez does extremely well to keep a Jonny pass in play down the right. He sprays a crossfield pass towards Vinagre on the left. Vinagre dinks into the centre. Schmeichel gets proactive and races from his line, tapping the ball out of a thicket, then hacking clear from the edge of his box. Jota goes over Schmeichel\u2019s leg, but the keeper got there first and it wasn\u2019t a foul. No penalty. The momentum shifts in this game have been absurd. Wolves have steadied the ship all right! And how! Simpson crosses into the Wolves box from the right. Bennett heads clear. Neves picks up possession from deep, and quarterbacks a stunning pass down the inside-left channel for Jota, who takes down, strides into the box past Morgan, and then blasts a shot through Schmeichel and into the net! Route one can be beautiful too. 63 min: Signs that Wolves have steadied the ship a little, if nothing else. Leicester were pouring forward with great regularity during the opening exchanges of the second half; now the game\u2019s settled a bit. 61 min: So having said that, Wolves show in attack for the first time since the break. Neves scoops a pass down the inside-left channel for Jota, who enters the area looking dangerous. Jota looks to bring the ball down, but only succeeds in playing it back into Morgan\u2019s chest. Morgan clears, though Jota goes down in the process. There\u2019s not enough in that for a penalty, though Wolves want one. 60 min: Wolves are struggling to retain possession. Credit to Claude Puel for a thoroughly effective half-time bollocking. 58 min: Ndidi is booked for a rash slide on Moutinho. A few players now one poor challenge away from an early bath. This has been such an entertaining game, it\u2019d be a real shame if it was decided by a red card for either side. 57 min: Gray drives down the inside-left channel and is stopped by a brave tackle from Bennett just inside the area. That was perfectly timed; it had to be. Wolves are seriously rocking here. 56 min: Leicester\u2019s corners haven\u2019t been much cop today, and that trend continues here. 55 min: Molineux has fallen quiet. It\u2019s all Leicester. Chilwell battles down the left and wins a corner off Jonny. 53 min: Well that\u2019s quite the turnaround. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be totally surprised, given only Arsenal have won as many points from a losing position in the Premier League this season as Leicester (12). Wolves are stunned, and now it\u2019s the away end making all the noise. Chilwell turns on the jets and runs at Wolves down the inside-left channel. That\u2019s one of the most determined runs you\u2019ll see! He enters the area at great speed, threatening to break clear, but Jonny blocks. But the defender\u2019s falling backwards, and can only flick the ball a couple of yards back up the pitch. It\u2019s bouncing free just inside the area, and Barnes nips in to smash a low shot across Rui Patricio and into the bottom right! The power took that through the keeper and into the net, there was no stopping it! 49 min: And suddenly it\u2019s all Leicester. Vinagre plays a poor pass inside from the Wolves left. That allows Vardy to zip towards the Leicester box, and slide a pass to Barnes, bombing in from the Leicester left. Barnes shoots hard from a tight angle, forcing Rui Patricio to tip to the ball over the bar. The resulting corner comes to nothing, but good luck guessing how this game\u2019s going to end up. 48 min: But it\u2019s not all good news for Leicester, because Maguire has taken a whack to the nose, and he\u2019s replaced by Evans. Wolves are immediately on the front foot, Simpson gifting the ball to Jota on the left. Jota feeds Vinagre, whose cross isn\u2019t too great. Leicester clear, and Vardy outmuscles Bennett in the centre circle to turn into space. He slips a pass wide to Gray, who immediately tears off down the inside-right channel, enters the area, and threads a shot across Rui Patricio and into the bottom left! Game immediately back on! Leicester get the second half underway! No changes at the break. And some half-time reading ... Half-time viewing from ATV Land. Leicester have been half-decent in attack. But wholly dreadful at the back. As a result, Wolves could easily be out of sight. A big half-time teamtalk coming up for Claude Puel. 45 min +1: The first of two added minutes sees Wolves load the Leicester box. But the free kick\u2019s no good. Coady goes long for Jota, who is shoved in the back by Simpson. No penalty, though you\u2019ve seen them given. Then the same players come together in the centre circle, and Jota is booked for not very much at all. He\u2019s incensed, and no wonder, because Simpson kicked him on the thigh when completing a boot upfield. That\u2019s preposterous. 45 min: Leicester\u2019s free kick is a non event, and Jota is allowed to charge back upfield on the counter. Pereira unceremoniously hacks him down from behind, and that\u2019s a no-brainer of a booking. 44 min: But they deal with the corner well enough. They race up the other end, in the hope of reducing the arrears just before half-time. Vardy knocks the ball past Bennett down the left wing, and clatters into the defender, knowing full well he\u2019ll earn a free kick. And Bennett goes in the book too. 43 min: Jonny bustles his way down the right and earns a corner off Chilwell. That\u2019s wonderful harrying, though Chilwell should never have allowed that. Leicester have been pitiful at the back. 41 min: Wolves are after the third goal that would put this game to bed. Jota tries a spectacular bicycle kick from the edge of the box. It\u2019s blocked. Then Moutinho has a shot that\u2019s sliced miles wide right. And then Jota dribbles in from the right and runs slap into Morgan. The crowd scream for a penalty but they\u2019re never getting that. 40 min: Vinagre glides in from the left and feeds Jimenez, who turns Maguire inside out down the channel. He makes enough space for a shot, just inside the box, but Schmeichel saves well with his feet. 38 min: Jota is this close to releasing Vinagre down the left with a crossfield rake, but Maguire does well to intercept and put a stop to Wolves\u2019 gallop. 36 min: Vardy slides Simpson into space down the right. Simpson earns a corner, but the set piece is easily cleared, Rui Patricio and Moutinho combining to end the danger. 35 min: The game enters its first lull. It couldn\u2019t keep going like that forever. 33 min: Vardy is slightly fortunate to get away with clumping Neves upside the head as he contests a high ball a bit too vigorously. He wanders off effing and jeffing, clearly frustrated at Leicester\u2019s current plight. 31 min: Ndidi opens up down the left, and nearly hits the right-hand corner flag with something that could have been a cross, could have been a shot. Not really sure. No Ndidi. 29 min: Jonny should send Jimenez clear down the inside-left channel, with Wolves three on two. But the pass is no good, and Leicester, who are an utter shambles at the back, escape again. 28 min: Leicester have enjoyed 57 percent of possession, and taken eight pops at goal. They\u2019ve attacked in numbers, entertainingly so. And yet they could easily be four goals down before the half-hour mark. Nothing\u2019s going right for Claude Puel right now. 26 min: Leicester Could Be Three Down Now pt.II. Jimenez makes good ground down the right and, from a tight spot, whips a cross in from the byline for Jota. Morgan is sleeping, and Schmeichel does extremely well to gather Jota\u2019s downward header on the line. 25 min: And yet they could be three down now! Jimenez slips a ball down the left for Dendoncker, who whips a magnificent low cross through the six-yard box. Schmeichel\u2019s position isn\u2019t great, and if Jonny had read Dendoncker\u2019s intention, he\u2019d have had a tap-in at the near post. But he was hanging back a bit. That was a fine, incisive move by Wolves, and a great run by Dendoncker. 24 min: Wolves have drawn a little of Leicester\u2019s sting in the last couple of minutes, but the majority of the play is still in their half. Leicester haven\u2019t played badly at all. 22 min: Wolves knock the ball around for a bit in the sterile style. They really need this breather. This has been a very strange, but very entertaining, opening period. 20 min: Barnes, receiving pelters from the home support on account of his sojourn at West Brom, wheels down the left and sets up Ndidi, who in turn tees up Gray; his shot sails wide. Then Simpson sends Pereira off down the right; he tees up Gray again, but once more no luck. Leicester have now had eight attempts on goal, while Wolves have made just the three. That\u2019s the joy of football, right there. 18 min: Pereira drives down the middle and slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Gray, who fires a shot towards the bottom right. Rui Patricio fingertips it round the post for a corner that, you guessed it, isn\u2019t up to much. But the visitors are in this game all right, despite the scoreline. 16 min: That corner isn\u2019t up to much either. But Leicester, despite being two goals adrift already, are looking dangerous in attack. They come back at Wolves yet again, Chilwell winning a third corner in short order down the left. It comes to nothing, but that completes a passage of play that will give Leicester a little hope of getting out of this mess. 15 min: Leicester\u2019s corner isn\u2019t all that, but Rui Patricio makes another mistake with the ball at his feet, sending a clearance straight to Barnes. Leicester come straight back at Wolves, the ball slipped right for Gray, who shoots diagonally for the bottom left. That\u2019s deflected out for another corner. 14 min: On the touchline, Claude Puel is beyond anger, throwing semaphore shapes and screaming abuse at his players. \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning,\u201d trill the Wolves fans. Barnes responds with a shot from distance. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner. Coady rakes a glorious long pass down the inside-left channel to send Jota into an awful lot of space. Jota wins a corner, which Moutinho takes long. Bennett rises above a flat-footed Maguire, and plants a header into the top right! Once again, Schmeichel had no chance, and this is a superb start by Wolves! Star soccer! 10 min: Maguire\u2019s back up and about. 9 min: Jota threatens to break clear down the inside-right channel, but he\u2019s stopped in his tracks by Maguire. The ball squirts through to Schmeichel and the danger is gone, though Maguire\u2019s hurt himself there and is down receiving treatment. Meanwhile here\u2019s Gary Naylor, coming straight at you from the 1970s: \u201cA drizzly day in ATV Land? I literally (and involuntarily) heard Hugh Johns\u2019 voice in my mind when I read that. Thank you for that Proustian rush.\u201d Wait until I start banging on about Hartley Hare. 7 min: Both of these teams are all over the shop! Gray breaks out of a brouhaha and reaches the byline down the left. His cross is blocked by Moutinho for a corner. From the set piece, Maguire rises highest in the six-yard box, but the ball slaps off his grid and over the bar. A fine chance spurned. 5 min: Rui Patricio nearly gifts Leicester and immediate equaliser! He faffs around with the ball at his feet, taking way too long to weigh up his options. Vardy nips in and nearly rounds him on the right, but can\u2019t slot home from a tight angle and the keeper does just enough to recover. This is a wonderfully entertaining start! Leicester clear the corner easily enough. But Gray loses the ball in the midfield, and Moutinho\u2019s racing down the right as a result. He crosses into the centre. Jota nips in ahead of a snoozing Simpson, and sidefoots powerfully into the right-hand side of goal! Schmeichel had no chance! 3 min: Vinagre makes ground down the right and pulls the ball back from the byline. Neves, racing in from deep, meets the pass 25 yards from goal, and sends a first-time power curler towards the top right. It\u2019s a sensational effort, and one tipped round the post in similar style by Schmeichel. Corner, from which ... Here we go, then! The home heroes get the party started. A drizzly day in ATV Land. And it\u2019s not long before a loose Barnes pass allows Jimenez to tear down the right. Mendy comes in to clatter, and that\u2019s the earliest of early yellow cards. Not an ideal first touch for the Premier League debut starter. The teams are out! Wolves are in their storied old gold, while Leicester sport their famous blue. Hi ho, Wolverhampton, we\u2019ll be off in a minute. In the meantime, and speaking of shirts, here\u2019s our old pal Mac Millings. \u201cMy real concern about that dressing room pic isn\u2019t the horror of the folding job that\u2019s been done on the kit (although I can, in truth, barely bring myself even to look at it). Instead, I\u2019m wondering why Harvey Barnes has been given an entire roll of toilet paper. Perhaps of more concern is the fact that his neighbour to our right doesn\u2019t have one. Has he used the whole thing up already?\u201d And now it\u2019s the turn of Claude Puel. \u201cIt will be fascinating to see how Harvey Barnes starts the game. He has good qualities. I hope he can give his best, with the character and personality he showed at West Bromwich. We have shown a lot of quality in other games and now we have to find a good consistency. We can go seventh and that is our only focus today.\u201d Nuno speaks to Sky Sports, and is asked why Matt Doherty isn\u2019t in the starting XI. \u201cCos Jonny\u2019s gonna play. Options, options, I\u2019m always trying to better the team. We are totally confident that the decisions we make are the right ones. We have a small squad but a versatile enough one to know that when a player is missing we have other options, and we can maintain our performance. Today is a tough challenge, Leicester is a good team and we look forward to playing them.\u201d Harvey Barnes makes his first start in the Premier League for Leicester City today. This is what the 21-year-old midfielder will find in the Molineux away dressing room. Hopefully superstition isn\u2019t an issue for the young man, because the way his shirt\u2019s been folded, the bottom of the numbers aren\u2019t in view. And those socks have been paired to different lengths. It\u2019s chaos. Who could concentrate in the face of such disorder? I\u2019d be spinning like a top. A free bottle of calming isotonic pop, though, so it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. Two changes for Wolves off the back of their 3-0 defeat at the Etihad. Romain Saiss and Ruben Vinagre take the place of the suspended Willy Boly and the benched Matt Doherty, neither of whom particularly covered themselves in glory on Monday night. Leicester make three changes to the team that lost 2-1 at home to Southampton last Saturday. Danny Simpson, Demarai Gray and Harvey Barnes replace James Maddison, Marc Albrighton and Hamza Choudhary, who all drop to the bench. Barnes, who impressed on his recent loan spell at West Brom, makes his first Premier League start for the club. Wolverhampton Wanderers: Rui Patricio, Bennett, Coady, Dendoncker, Jonny, Saiss, Neves, Ruben Vinagre, Joao Moutinho, Jimenez, Jota. Subs: Doherty, Ivan Cavaleiro, Helder Costa, Gibbs-White, John Ruddy, Giles, Traore. Leicester City: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan, Maguire, Chilwell, Mendy, Ndidi, Ricardo Pereira, Gray, Barnes, Vardy. Subs: Evans, Iheanacho, Maddison, Albrighton, Ward, Fuchs, Choudhury. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). Wolverhampton Wanderers are one of the success stories of the season. No doubt about that. Last year\u2019s Championship winners are in no danger of going back down. Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s team can beat the best of them on their day: they\u2019ve taken a point off the champions Manchester City, won at Spurs, and knocked league leaders Liverpool out of the cup. The 1954, 1958 and 1959 champions of England are back, baby! Even so, their recent form hasn\u2019t been so hot. Beating Tottenham just after Christmas was some result, but it\u2019s their only win in their last five Premier League outings. That sequence has seen them well beaten at home by Liverpool and Crystal Palace, scrape a draw at Fulham, and lose heavily at Manchester City. They could do with a big result here to get themselves back into the top half of the table. Midlands rivals Leicester City may well oblige. The 2016 Premier League winners been dismal of late, losing at home in the league to Cardiff and Southampton, and getting themselves knocked out of the FA Cup by Newport, the biggest shock of the third round. Claude Puel isn\u2019t popular with the punters and the pressure is rising. He\u2019ll take heart from the way his unpredictable side occasionally hit a rich seam of form - they saw off Manchester City on Boxing Day, then won at Chelsea. Also the Foxes have only lost two of their last 13 matches against Wolves, a run that includes a 2-0 win at the start of this campaign and victory on penalties in the League Cup to boot. Not so easy to predict this one, then. That\u2019s 11th versus eighth for you. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

This is the level of subtlety present in Felix van Groeningen\u2019s awards-y drama, based on the memoirs of the real-life father-son duo. Mimicking the relapse-recovery cycle of addiction, the film\u2019s timeline moves in unsatisfying narrative circles that stall the already shallow stakes.</p> <p>\u201cA few weeks ago you told me you\u2019d only done crystal meth once. The story has to be bigger than that, right?\u201d Dave asks his son (because he\u2019s a journalist). Except it\u2019s not: the reasons for the clever, handsome, well-looked-after Nic\u2019s slide into addiction remain opaque. Character detail is replaced by screamingly cliched pop-culture signifiers (Nic reads a Bukowski poem in earnest, claiming the writer saved his life \u201cmore than a few times\u201d); the exposition is numbingly blunt (Dave discovers Nic\u2019s sketchbook, filled with creepy doodles that read \u201cI can never give them up\u201d).</p> <p>Carell plays the concerned father, but his angry outbursts never quite land; it\u2019s unfortunate that when he shouts, the actor\u2019s serious register becomes indistinguishable from that of <a href=\"https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Scott\" title=\"\">Michael Scott, his character in The Office.</a> Still, it\u2019s not entirely unmoving. A diner scene that sees Dave sad-eyed and aware of his own powerlessness is devastating; what I\u2019ll call the Chalamet giggle is deployed to great effect, the actor\u2019s cocked head and crinkly grin telegraphing the kind of sweetness that demands a second chance (Neil Young\u2019s Heart of Gold plays as a clean Nic announces that he wants his parents to be proud of him, in case it was unclear). Yet Chalamet\u2019s likability is almost a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s as close to a miracle Nic survived,\u201d says a doctor after an overdose, but in this universe, rich, white men get infinite chances to start again. If <em>Beautiful Boy</em> is meant to be a critique of artsy, moneyed liberals\u2019 complicity regarding their privileged, addled offspring, it kneecaps itself with an onscreen message that ends the film. \u201cHelp is out there,\u201d it insists, but only if your parents can afford it \u2013 and only if you\u2019re a beautiful boy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y23HyopQxEg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y23HyopQxEg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y23HyopQxEg\">Beautiful Boy official trailer \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Mimicking the relapse-recovery cycle of addiction, the film\u2019s timeline moves in unsatisfying narrative circles that stall the already shallow stakes. \u201cA few weeks ago you told me you\u2019d only done crystal meth once. The story has to be bigger than that, right?\u201d Dave asks his son (because he\u2019s a journalist). Except it\u2019s not: the reasons for the clever, handsome, well-looked-after Nic\u2019s slide into addiction remain opaque. Character detail is replaced by screamingly cliched pop-culture signifiers (Nic reads a Bukowski poem in earnest, claiming the writer saved his life \u201cmore than a few times\u201d); the exposition is numbingly blunt (Dave discovers Nic\u2019s sketchbook, filled with creepy doodles that read \u201cI can never give them up\u201d). Carell plays the concerned father, but his angry outbursts never quite land; it\u2019s unfortunate that when he shouts, the actor\u2019s serious register becomes indistinguishable from that of Michael Scott, his character in The Office. Still, it\u2019s not entirely unmoving. A diner scene that sees Dave sad-eyed and aware of his own powerlessness is devastating; what I\u2019ll call the Chalamet giggle is deployed to great effect, the actor\u2019s cocked head and crinkly grin telegraphing the kind of sweetness that demands a second chance (Neil Young\u2019s Heart of Gold plays as a clean Nic announces that he wants his parents to be proud of him, in case it was unclear). Yet Chalamet\u2019s likability is almost a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s as close to a miracle Nic survived,\u201d says a doctor after an overdose, but in this universe, rich, white men get infinite chances to start again. If Beautiful Boy is meant to be a critique of artsy, moneyed liberals\u2019 complicity regarding their privileged, addled offspring, it kneecaps itself with an onscreen message that ends the film. \u201cHelp is out there,\u201d it insists, but only if your parents can afford it \u2013 and only if you\u2019re a beautiful boy.",

But instead of answering the question, she confounds the idea of a unified \u201cus\u201d through the range of subject matter and voices in the collection, and shows Muslim women\u2019s identities to be \u2013 of course \u2013 joyously multiple, complex and contradictory: \u201cIt was really important for me to say that, whatever group you\u2019re doing the anthology for and with, that they are not only asked to talk about their experiences as that identity group. If they are already writers, they should be able to write whatever they want, in whatever form they want.\u201d</p> <p>Mahfouz has produced a dizzying body of work in the past decade and in an array of forms: she has written 18 plays since 2010, as well as a poetry collection and contributions to more than 10 anthologies, including Nikesh Shukla\u2019s bestselling <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/good-immigrant-493676.html\" title=\"\">The Good Immigrant</a></em>.</p> <p>Her latest projects are a stage adaptation of Malorie Blackman\u2019s YA novel, <em>Noughts and Crosses</em>, which will be touring the UK from February and at Theatre Royal Stratford East in April, an anthology she has edited called <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Smashing-Working-Artists-Making-Happen/dp/1908906405\" title=\"\">Smashing It: Working Class Artists on Life, Arts and Making It Happen</a></em>, to be published in the autumn. But there is much else happening as well: a novel (<em>Lost Clubs of London</em>), a libretto (<em>Woman at Point Zero</em> with the Royal Opera House), a screenplay (a biopic about east London rapper Wiley, due to start shooting later this year) and a dance production (with the James Cousins dance company and Zaha Hadid Design).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dad402c0e120e11aaf0eceb1cdb8143902862222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dad402c0e120e11aaf0eceb1cdb8143902862222/216_678_4673_5841/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sabrina Mahfouz: \u2018A lot of my high levels of production have been down to financial necessity.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sabrina Mahfouz: \u2018A lot of my high levels of production have been down to financial necessity.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ana Cuba</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How does Mahfouz fit it all in? And how does she know when a poem is a poem, a play a play? Kate Tempest has spoken of feeling the itch to write a poem in her stomach, a song in her mouth. Is it the same for Mahfouz? \u201cI\u2019d love to say things happened in different parts of my body and that\u2019s how I got the inspiration, but unfortunately a lot of my high levels of production have been due to financial necessity.\u201d</p> <p>She has a three-year-old son with her partner, Anthony Anaxagorou, and there is no hiding behind Cyril Connolly\u2019s \u201cpram in the hallway\u201d or ruminating on how it has affected her creativity. She simply has to work and manage motherhood around it. Anaxagorou is a poet, and while it helps to live with a fellow artist who \u201cunderstands the processes\u201d there is no financial stability in the household. \u201cFor me, [writing] is about strategy, timing and scheduling. There\u2019s not any space for spontaneity. Everything has to be planned. It\u2019s difficult when you\u2019re trying to get inspired by something. You can\u2019t, because it has to happen at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Mahfouz was born in south London, the eldest of three children in a family of limited means. Her mother was a secretary, her father a manager of restaurants, but the family had previously held a very different social standing. Her paternal great-grandfather was a poet in Egypt and friends with the Nobel prize-winning writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/30/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Najguib Mahfouz</a>. Her maternal grandfather, meanwhile, came from Guyana in the 1950s, and settled in Middlesbrough, marrying her British grandmother and setting up a jazz club. He would carry his bongo drums around the streets to make his difference more visible, not less, says Mahfouz.</p> <p>\u201cIn other countries, my family was part of a middle class, but once they got to this country they were most definitely working class because they didn\u2019t come with money.\u201d</p> <p>She lived in Cairo for parts of her childhood but returned to London at 11 to attend Nonsuch high school, a girls\u2019 grammar in Sutton that had high aspirations for its students. It instilled a confidence in her that helped her navigate the naysayers in later years.</p> <p>The limits of social background were implicitly pointed out in her college years: \u201cI [performed] a Shakespeare monologue and one of my teachers said: \u2018It\u2019s good but you should read a monologue by an <em>EastEnders </em>character.\u2019 I began to realise that the way I speak put me in a certain bracket.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to be a spy \u2013 or anything else that was exciting and took me to different places</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her parents never tried to direct her passions, so she was able to dabble and experiment as she wished. She began a classical archaeology degree at King\u2019s College London, but changed to English literature and classics because the original course was too scientific for her liking. By her 20s, she had changed direction and signed up to the civil service\u2019s fast-stream programme with the Ministry of Defence. \u201cI wanted to be a spy \u2013 or anything that was exciting and took me to different places,\u201d she says. That career was stymied by her not receiving top secret security clearance, for reasons she sees as being linked to class and ethnicity.</p> <p>So she became a writer and channelled some of those former experiences into her creative work. A theme that crops up repeatedly in her plays and poetry is sex work, which can be traced back to her cash-strapped student days when she worked as a waitress in strip club.</p> <p>\u201cIt began when I was 18 and my dad helped me get a job doing admin in the office of Stringfellows, which in those days was a nightclub, not a strip club. He managed restaurants and everyone knew everyone in that world. So nepotism got me the job! While I was in the office, I had to do the accounts and I saw how much money the waitresses were making as opposed to the strippers. In those days, in that particular club, for every two strippers who made a few grand in a night, 98 would be in debt to the club because they had to pay fees to work, fees for make-up and hair\u2026 But the waitresses didn\u2019t have to pay to be there. They got a basic pay plus a percentage of spend on the table.\u201d</p> <p>Mahfouz left the job to go to university, but when she realised she couldn\u2019t afford to live on hardship grants and student loans, she thought \u201clet\u2019s go and check that waitressing thing out\u201d. It led her into better-paid jobs in upmarket Mayfair nightclubs and what she calls \u201ca world of night-time money\u201d. Years later, she wrote a play about stripping called <em>Dry Ice </em>(2011), which was directed by David Schwimmer, and then <em>One Hour Only </em>(2012) about upmarket brothels. <em>Layla\u2019s </em><em>Room</em> (2016) was about sex and abuse at school, and her acclaimed poetry collection, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-you-might-know-me.html\" title=\"\">How You Might Know Me </a></em>(2016) was an exploration of four sex workers\u2019 lives.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t encounter feminism until she was in her early 20s, she says, but since then she has taken it very seriously. The main area where she finds herself in disagreement with some feminist thought is around sex work. When she first left the strip clubs, she worked alongside feminists who sought to eliminate sex work, but increasingly, she thinks that the priority should be to deal with the things that lead women to it in the first place, such as poverty, the threat of financial instability, and abuse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9fb63ff0c8a102a1ab5a0ce34256542f5901e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9fb63ff0c8a102a1ab5a0ce34256542f5901e46/0_0_5573_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doreene Blackstock, left, and Heather Agyepong rehearsing Noughts and Crosses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doreene Blackstock, left, and Heather Agyepong rehearsing Noughts and Crosses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The aborted career as a spy has also given her material to work with in a play she is developing at the Royal Court, called <em>A History of Water in the Middle East</em>, about the British presence in the region past and present. For it, she has found herself reflecting on her failed security clearance; more generally it is about how Britishness may still be stuck in the narrow strictures of the upper echelons of the civil service, its terms uncontested and untouched by more up-to-date definitions of what it means to be British.</p> <p>While Mahfouz has clearly excelled in the performing arts industry, she sees it still overwhelmingly tipped in favour of the privileged, with the odd exceptions who are loudly praised. Where racial and gender biases are often recognised, prejudice around class is more rarely addressed, although it\u2019s the principal problem she has faced.</p> <p>The inception of her forthcoming anthology, <em>Smashing It</em>, came out of a tweet she posted saying something along these lines \u2013 that she is only ever asked about her gender and ethnicity. It had such impact that Mahfouz knew she had to take it further. The book will showcase working-class artists in Britain, from grime musicians to playwrights and visual artists, but maybe more importantly for those seeking to enter into the industry, it will offer guidance and advice on how to overcome obstacles, from the financial to the ideological.</p> <p>Mahfouz is also suspicious of the current feelgood narrative on diversity and inclusion in the arts, and wonders if the correction of imbalances is mainly just happening in the lower tiers. What about the new generation of high-level women in theatre, I ask her, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/04/vicky-featherstone-named-most-influential-person-in-british-theatre\" title=\"\">Vicky Featherstone</a> at the Royal Court to the appointments of female artistic directors at the Kiln and Bush theatres? Yes, she says, it feels like that moment for women in theatre \u201cbut we hear of these appointments and they get all the attention, but there are other appointments happening that aren\u2019t women-led, which get less attention and so seem less prevalent. We celebrate [the positive appointments] when they happen, which is great, but it makes the other stuff happening a little bit invisible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to focus on these two characters and how oppressive systems can destroy and determine people's lives from a young age</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd because we live in a world where one person at one organisation can make a speech about representation, which can then be repeated on all social media platforms and quoted in all other outlets, and it starts to really feel like something huge is happening from that speech which says \u2018look at our offering of representation\u2019. It is amazing to see some [diverse] works being given space and time and money towards marketing, but how much does that change actual numbers? I think people would be surprised at how little it has changed.\u201d</p> <p>What she found so honest, and refreshing, about Blackman\u2019s dystopia <em>Noughts and Crosses</em><em> </em>is its reminder that the myth of free choice is just that \u2013 a myth. \u201cPeople act as if that\u2019s not true, that you just need to make the right choice and you\u2019ll be fine. But the myth of free choice leads to the myth of meritocracy.\u201d The story revolves around two teenagers, Sephy and Callum, played by Heather Agyepong and Billy Harris, who live in a racially and socially segregated world (in which Europeans have been enslaved by Africans) but who are determined to love each other across the divide. \u201cI really wanted to focus in on these two characters and how oppressive systems can destroy and determine people\u2019s lives from a young age. In some cases they\u2019re powerless, in others they\u2019re able to take back the power and make some change, but it\u2019s not without a huge amount of sacrifice and pain.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ebf74264ed2e8b16ad3a286c635518e55a4732f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ebf74264ed2e8b16ad3a286c635518e55a4732f/0_0_4560_3660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jade Anouka in Sabrina Mahfouz\u2019s Chef, Edinburgh, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"803\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jade Anouka in Sabrina Mahfouz\u2019s Chef, Edinburgh, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mahfouz does not consider herself to be an activist, but she is co-founder of the <a href=\"https://criticsofcolour.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Critics of Colour Collective,</a> which fights for fairer representation in arts criticism; and also the founder of the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Great Wash Workshops</a>, which help working-class writers apply for funding. But this is distinct from her writing, she says. \u201cI do a lot of my work with activists and want to give it to them as a tool for their activism. But I also want to give people the space to enjoy language and consider how they use it. Provoking some change is part of it but not necessarily the ultimate goal.\u201d</p> <p>She works with young people in workshops too and balks at the idea that they are in any way apathetic about politics. What she sees is a generation that has no choice but to be activists. \u201cThere might be a few in a workshop who act like they don\u2019t care but when they get into it, they\u2019ll happily write an activist poem. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s also annoying because the older generation can just say: \u2018It\u2019s OK, these guys are going to sort it out.\u2019 How much pressure are you putting on young people? That\u2019s not cool. We like to blame mental-health issues among the young on iPhones and Instagram and I\u2019m sure they play a part, but maybe it\u2019s also because the weight of what\u2019s wrong with the world is on them to sort out, from climate change to Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit has made her own older circle of artists and writers feel more politically responsible, not less, for finding a way out of the crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sense of solidarity among people in the arts world and the feeling that politicians are not listening. So it\u2019s almost up to the storytellers to start telling the real stories rather than the stories the politicians are giving us.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.derbytheatre.co.uk/noughts-and-crosses\" title=\"\">Noughts and Crosses</a> runs</em><em> at Derby theatre from 1-16 Feb and then tours until 11 May</em></p>",

He would carry his bongo drums around the streets to make his difference more visible, not less, says Mahfouz. \u201cIn other countries, my family was part of a middle class, but once they got to this country they were most definitely working class because they didn\u2019t come with money.\u201d She lived in Cairo for parts of her childhood but returned to London at 11 to attend Nonsuch high school, a girls\u2019 grammar in Sutton that had high aspirations for its students. It instilled a confidence in her that helped her navigate the naysayers in later years. The limits of social background were implicitly pointed out in her college years: \u201cI [performed] a Shakespeare monologue and one of my teachers said: \u2018It\u2019s good but you should read a monologue by an EastEnders character.\u2019 I began to realise that the way I speak put me in a certain bracket.\u201d Her parents never tried to direct her passions, so she was able to dabble and experiment as she wished. She began a classical archaeology degree at King\u2019s College London, but changed to English literature and classics because the original course was too scientific for her liking. By her 20s, she had changed direction and signed up to the civil service\u2019s fast-stream programme with the Ministry of Defence. \u201cI wanted to be a spy \u2013 or anything that was exciting and took me to different places,\u201d she says. That career was stymied by her not receiving top secret security clearance, for reasons she sees as being linked to class and ethnicity. So she became a writer and channelled some of those former experiences into her creative work. A theme that crops up repeatedly in her plays and poetry is sex work, which can be traced back to her cash-strapped student days when she worked as a waitress in strip club. \u201cIt began when I was 18 and my dad helped me get a job doing admin in the office of Stringfellows, which in those days was a nightclub, not a strip club. He managed restaurants and everyone knew everyone in that world. So nepotism got me the job! While I was in the office, I had to do the accounts and I saw how much money the waitresses were making as opposed to the strippers. In those days, in that particular club, for every two strippers who made a few grand in a night, 98 would be in debt to the club because they had to pay fees to work, fees for make-up and hair\u2026 But the waitresses didn\u2019t have to pay to be there. They got a basic pay plus a percentage of spend on the table.\u201d Mahfouz left the job to go to university, but when she realised she couldn\u2019t afford to live on hardship grants and student loans, she thought \u201clet\u2019s go and check that waitressing thing out\u201d. It led her into better-paid jobs in upmarket Mayfair nightclubs and what she calls \u201ca world of night-time money\u201d. Years later, she wrote a play about stripping called Dry Ice (2011), which was directed by David Schwimmer, and then One Hour Only (2012) about upmarket brothels. Layla\u2019s Room (2016) was about sex and abuse at school, and her acclaimed poetry collection, How You Might Know Me (2016) was an exploration of four sex workers\u2019 lives. She didn\u2019t encounter feminism until she was in her early 20s, she says, but since then she has taken it very seriously. The main area where she finds herself in disagreement with some feminist thought is around sex work. When she first left the strip clubs, she worked alongside feminists who sought to eliminate sex work, but increasingly, she thinks that the priority should be to deal with the things that lead women to it in the first place, such as poverty, the threat of financial instability, and abuse. The aborted career as a spy has also given her material to work with in a play she is developing at the Royal Court, called A History of Water in the Middle East, about the British presence in the region past and present. For it, she has found herself reflecting on her failed security clearance; more generally it is about how Britishness may still be stuck in the narrow strictures of the upper echelons of the civil service, its terms uncontested and untouched by more up-to-date definitions of what it means to be British. While Mahfouz has clearly excelled in the performing arts industry, she sees it still overwhelmingly tipped in favour of the privileged, with the odd exceptions who are loudly praised. Where racial and gender biases are often recognised, prejudice around class is more rarely addressed, although it\u2019s the principal problem she has faced. The inception of her forthcoming anthology, Smashing It, came out of a tweet she posted saying something along these lines \u2013 that she is only ever asked about her gender and ethnicity. It had such impact that Mahfouz knew she had to take it further. The book will showcase working-class artists in Britain, from grime musicians to playwrights and visual artists, but maybe more importantly for those seeking to enter into the industry, it will offer guidance and advice on how to overcome obstacles, from the financial to the ideological. Mahfouz is also suspicious of the current feelgood narrative on diversity and inclusion in the arts, and wonders if the correction of imbalances is mainly just happening in the lower tiers. What about the new generation of high-level women in theatre, I ask her, from Vicky Featherstone at the Royal Court to the appointments of female artistic directors at the Kiln and Bush theatres? Yes, she says, it feels like that moment for women in theatre \u201cbut we hear of these appointments and they get all the attention, but there are other appointments happening that aren\u2019t women-led, which get less attention and so seem less prevalent. We celebrate [the positive appointments] when they happen, which is great, but it makes the other stuff happening a little bit invisible. \u201cAnd because we live in a world where one person at one organisation can make a speech about representation, which can then be repeated on all social media platforms and quoted in all other outlets, and it starts to really feel like something huge is happening from that speech which says \u2018look at our offering of representation\u2019. It is amazing to see some [diverse] works being given space and time and money towards marketing, but how much does that change actual numbers? I think people would be surprised at how little it has changed.\u201d What she found so honest, and refreshing, about Blackman\u2019s dystopia Noughts and Crosses is its reminder that the myth of free choice is just that \u2013 a myth. \u201cPeople act as if that\u2019s not true, that you just need to make the right choice and you\u2019ll be fine. But the myth of free choice leads to the myth of meritocracy.\u201d The story revolves around two teenagers, Sephy and Callum, played by Heather Agyepong and Billy Harris, who live in a racially and socially segregated world (in which Europeans have been enslaved by Africans) but who are determined to love each other across the divide. \u201cI really wanted to focus in on these two characters and how oppressive systems can destroy and determine people\u2019s lives from a young age. In some cases they\u2019re powerless, in others they\u2019re able to take back the power and make some change, but it\u2019s not without a huge amount of sacrifice and pain.\u201d Mahfouz does not consider herself to be an activist, but she is co-founder of the Critics of Colour Collective, which fights for fairer representation in arts criticism; and also the founder of the Great Wash Workshops, which help working-class writers apply for funding. But this is distinct from her writing, she says. \u201cI do a lot of my work with activists and want to give it to them as a tool for their activism. But I also want to give people the space to enjoy language and consider how they use it. Provoking some change is part of it but not necessarily the ultimate goal.\u201d She works with young people in workshops too and balks at the idea that they are in any way apathetic about politics. What she sees is a generation that has no choice but to be activists. \u201cThere might be a few in a workshop who act like they don\u2019t care but when they get into it, they\u2019ll happily write an activist poem. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s also annoying because the older generation can just say: \u2018It\u2019s OK, these guys are going to sort it out.\u2019 How much pressure are you putting on young people? That\u2019s not cool. We like to blame mental-health issues among the young on iPhones and Instagram and I\u2019m sure they play a part, but maybe it\u2019s also because the weight of what\u2019s wrong with the world is on them to sort out, from climate change to Brexit.\u201d Brexit has made her own older circle of artists and writers feel more politically responsible, not less, for finding a way out of the crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sense of solidarity among people in the arts world and the feeling that politicians are not listening. So it\u2019s almost up to the storytellers to start telling the real stories rather than the stories the politicians are giving us.\u201d Noughts and Crosses runs at Derby theatre from 1-16 Feb and then tours until 11 May",

Michelle Coles, the owner of the local cinema, took off her shoes at night to test the concrete before letting the dogs out. \u201cPeople tend to stay at home,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t walk around when it\u2019s like this.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see why: in the middle of the day it takes seconds to blister a dog\u2019s paw or child\u2019s foot. In Mildura, in northern Victoria, last week gardeners burned their hands when they picked up their tools, which had been left in the sun at 46C. Fish were dying in the rivers. Almost every day last week a new heat record was broken in Australia. They spread out, unrelenting, across the country, with records broken for all kinds of reasons \u2013 as if the statistics were finding an infinite series of ways to say that it was hot. The community of Noona \u2013 population 14 \u2013 reached the highest minimum ever recorded overnight in Australia \u2013 35.9C was the coldest it got, at 7am on Friday. It was 45C by noon. A record fell on Tuesday in Meekatharra in Western Australia \u2013 the highest minimum there ever recorded (33C). Another fell on Wednesday, 2,000 miles away, in Albury, New South Wales \u2013 their hottest day (45.6C). It was 45C or higher for four consecutive days in Broken Hill \u2013 another record \u2013 and more than 40C for the same time period in Canberra, the nation\u2019s capital. Nine records fell across NSW on Wednesday alone. Back in Port Augusta, Tuesday was the highest temperature since records began in 1962. In the Niagara Cafe in Gundagai, whose claim to fame is that the former Australian prime minister John Curtin once popped in during the second world war, Tina Loukissas turned off the deep fryer, then the grill. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019ve walked into a sauna,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s getting up to 43C or 44C, because you have all these machines going, the air conditioning isn\u2019t coping very well. \u201cWe\u2019ve got tables outside that nobody has sat at for the last couple of days \u2026 You\u2019d be crazy to sit outside on a day like today.\u201d In Mildura, Tolga Ozkuzucu, owner of Top Notch Gardens, had the misfortune to be working outdoors. \u201cIt\u2019s been like hell,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to try to leave your tools in the shade.

People here are very understanding of that because they know how hot it is \u2026 nobody wants to be outside when it\u2019s 46C.\u201d In South Australia, they declared a \u201ccode red\u201d across Adelaide, the state capital. Homelessness services were working overtime and the Red Cross started calling round a list of 750 people who were deemed especially vulnerable. At the Australian Open in Melbourne, only the sea breeze kept the temperature below 40C. At Adelaide\u2019s Tour Down Under, a bike race, it was 41C.

The character Jamil plays on NBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a25670818/the-good-place-deserves-to-win-golden-globes-2019/\" title=\"\"><em>The Good Place</em></a> gets called things like \u201csexy skyscraper\u201d (and \u201csexy giraffe\u201d, and \u201ca hot rich fraud with legs for days\u201d).</p> <p>Jamil\u2019s penthouse suite is well furnished too. The British radio DJ turned screenwriter turned actor recently made a documentary for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bgpst1\" title=\"\">Radio 4 about sexual consent</a>. Her Instagram campaign <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/iweigh/\" title=\"\">#iweigh</a> encourages women to consider their true substance: their strengths and achievements, rather than their vital statistics. Last year she called the Kardashians \u201c<a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a23289305/jameela-jamil-the-good-place/\" title=\"\">unwitting double-agents for the patriarchy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Jamil is very much in a relationship, though \u2013 with Blake, the British dubstep producer turned singer-songwriter. Two sensitive Brits who made it big on their own terms in Los Angeles, the pair have been dating since 2015 but gradually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameelajamil/status/981562813826048000?lang=en\" title=\"\">made their relationship status more public</a> last year.</p> <p>If one were to pitch Blake\u2019s latest album in a Hollywood elevator, it would be that <em>Assume Form</em> is a soundtrack to that slow reveal: a loved-up paean to finding oneself in another. In that respect, it\u2019s like Father John Misty\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khk77JHALmU\" title=\"\"><em>I Love You, Honeybear</em></a>, stripped of its cynicism and soft porn. (\u201cI\u2019ll use both hands,\u201d is about as far as Blake goes here.) It\u2019s Nick Cave\u2019s <em>The Boatman\u2019s Call</em> \u2013 the Bad Seeds\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnHoqHscTKE\" title=\"\">thinly disguised suite of love songs</a> to PJ Harvey \u2013 with way more guest rappers.</p> <p>One song, Can\u2019t Believe the Way We Flow, gives a flavour of exactly how cock-a-hoop Blake is.

New York? Sure. \u201cThe brink\u201d? Yes again. Blake\u2019s production is still uneasily abstract \u2013 the track\u2019s rolling-marble beat still bears a token resemblance to trap hip-hop. But swelling Disney strings and Blake\u2019s blithe melody pack a vintage swoon.</p> <p>It barely needs saying that Blake is not a natural candidate to tiptoe through tulips. Known for his austere late-night digitals, parched angst and extensive collaborations with A-list superstars such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/james-blake-beyonce-kanye-west-colour-in-anything\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>, Kanye West, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwAnsAUYnw4\" title=\"\">Kendrick Lamar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2016/05/05/james-blake-working-with-kanye-west-frank-ocean-beyonce\" title=\"\">Frank Ocean</a>, the 30-year-old north Londoner first came to renown by combining vulnerable male vocals with cutting-edge production.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdnD09M5uj0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sdnD09M5uj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdnD09M5uj0\">Listen to Don\u2019t Miss It from Assume Form</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>With his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1PYy3fELpY\" title=\"\">2011 self-titled debut</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p6PcFFUm5I\" title=\"\">Mercury prize-winning sequel</a>, 2013\u2019s <em>Overgrown</em>, Blake kicked off an entire subgenre of popular music. Some rain-curdled British wags labelled it \u201c<a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/06842-bon-iver-james-blake-fall-creek-boys-choir\" title=\"\">blubstep</a>\u201d. Wisconsin\u2019s Bon Iver was of a similar falsetto-and-digital mind on 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISCEilPMNak\" title=\"\"><em>22, </em><em>a Million</em></a>, however.</p> <p>More recently, artists like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPeji3NS4uE\" title=\"\">Moses Sumney</a> have brought this racked hyper-modern sound full circle back to its point of origin in the ache of African American soul, refracted through a 21st-century filter. Blake acknowledges his synchronicity with Sumney: the two have toured together, and Sumney guests on one track here, Tell Them. Deliciously, Sumney\u2019s witchy falsetto weaves in and out of Blake\u2019s own in a game of spot-the-difference.</p> <p>This album does get a bit crowded, however. Because Blake is thick with hip-hop artists and producers, his work leads naturally to a kind of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqvCptqhHfs\" title=\"\">quid pro quo</a>. So just as the listener is falling hard for <em>Assume Form</em>\u2019s title track \u2013 elegiac piano, percussive skitter, heartfelt sentiments such as \u201cThis is the first time I connect motion to feeling\u201d \u2013 up pops Kylie Jenner\u2019s baby-daddy, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ONRf7h3Mdk\" title=\"\">Travis Scott</a>, on the next track. Hip-hop super-producer <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/06/29/super-producer-metro-boomin-might-be-the-next-big-star-in-hip-hop/#799ed8817628\" title=\"\">Metro Boomin</a> is another superfluous third wheel who drops in twice.</p> <p>We are definitely not in north London any more, Toto: this deeply personal, intimate album by a formerly stiff-upper-lipped British introvert is sited firmly on the west coast and deep in the belly of the music industry. Is that the hottest new artist of 2019, the forward-flamenco singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/11/one-to-watch-rosalia-flamenco-randb-pienso-en-tu-mira\" title=\"\">Rosal\u00eda</a>, on another tune? So it is.</p> <p>Her collaboration with Blake \u2013 Barefoot in the Park \u2013 is, however, far more pleasing to the ear than the hook-ups with hip-hop\u2019s flushest. The two conjoin on a humid and haunted thermal whose only downside is how Blake\u2019s more front-and-centre singing voice has started resembling that of Chris Martin from Coldplay.</p> <p>An older rapper, Outkast\u2019s Andr\u00e9 3000, weighs in on Where\u2019s the Catch \u2013 the one moment on this deeply committed album where Blake expresses a little trepidation about this newfound bliss.</p> <p>Lest we forget, Andr\u00e9 3000 is a man so evolved he penned a letter of apology to his ex-mother-in-law: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxAiK6VnXw\" title=\"\">Ms Jackson</a>. He proves a sage, wry presence. \u201cAll my pessimistic keeps me in my cage,\u201d he testifies \u2013 a line that points to a deeper reading of <em>Assume Form</em>.</p> <p>This album is, without a doubt, a big, glitchy, swooning, hyper-modern declaration of love. \u201cWe delayed the show we kissed so long,\u201d Blake sighs. \u201cLet\u2019s go home and talk shit about everyone,\u201d he flirts. Blake and Jamil are not married, but Blake says \u201cI do\u201d so often on Can\u2019t Believe the Way We Flow as to make the ceremony superfluous.</p> <p><em>Assume Form</em> is not without its problems \u2013 the incipient echo of Martin (another nice boy from England who now hangs with Beyonc\u00e9) and an inveterate itchiness to the production that ill suits the considered joy on show.</p> <p>Its true resonance, though, might be as a document of recovery: from the depression, lifelong isolation and \u201ccyclical thoughts\u201d (Don\u2019t Miss It) of making music, often alone. It\u2019s not just Blake: as bands increasingly gave way to solo bedroom artists more than a decade ago, the tortured singer-songwriter at the front of traditional bass-drums-guitar set-ups became the tortured solo-operating DIY troubadour. Although Blake, neck-deep in the underground, played well with others \u2013 running club nights at university, <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2012/06/22/james-blake-announces-new-release-on-rs-under-harmonimix-alias/\" title=\"\">remixing</a>, collaborating \u2013 the success of his intimate music inevitably propelled him into being a kind of poster boy for the night-steeped solipsism of the age.</p> <p>Blake is now \u201cout of his head\u201d, as the title track has it \u2013 not off his face but \u201ctouchable, reachable\u201d. The more attentive listener will spot that Blake\u2019s last album, 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTglDb7qjvQ\" title=\"\"><em>The Colour </em><em>in Anything</em></a>, also dates from a period when Jamil was in the picture. But that record remained almost as cloistered and spartan as Blake\u2019s previous works \u2013 like a clench before a release, it feels now.</p> <p>With sustained love has come liberation. If the pitch-shifted interpolation from performance poet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJyZW2IMr0w\" title=\"\">Rage Almighty</a> on the title track were not enough to nail Blake\u2019s subplot to the mast (depression, it goes, \u201cfeels like a thousand pound weight holding your body down in a pool of water barely reaching your chin\u201d), Power On states things pretty baldly: \u201cI thought I might be better dead/ But I was wrong,\u201d Blake drawls.</p> <p>The sparse, but comforting Don\u2019t Miss It finds Blake\u2019s heavily digitised vocal itemising how far has he come. Love happens, Blake avers on <em>Assume Form</em>. But more than that: change is possible.</p>",

Some rain-curdled British wags labelled it \u201cblubstep\u201d. Wisconsin\u2019s Bon Iver was of a similar falsetto-and-digital mind on 2016\u2019s 22, a Million, however. More recently, artists like Moses Sumney have brought this racked hyper-modern sound full circle back to its point of origin in the ache of African American soul, refracted through a 21st-century filter. Blake acknowledges his synchronicity with Sumney: the two have toured together, and Sumney guests on one track here, Tell Them. Deliciously, Sumney\u2019s witchy falsetto weaves in and out of Blake\u2019s own in a game of spot-the-difference. This album does get a bit crowded, however. Because Blake is thick with hip-hop artists and producers, his work leads naturally to a kind of quid pro quo. So just as the listener is falling hard for Assume Form\u2019s title track \u2013 elegiac piano, percussive skitter, heartfelt sentiments such as \u201cThis is the first time I connect motion to feeling\u201d \u2013 up pops Kylie Jenner\u2019s baby-daddy, Travis Scott, on the next track. Hip-hop super-producer Metro Boomin is another superfluous third wheel who drops in twice. We are definitely not in north London any more, Toto: this deeply personal, intimate album by a formerly stiff-upper-lipped British introvert is sited firmly on the west coast and deep in the belly of the music industry. Is that the hottest new artist of 2019, the forward-flamenco singer Rosal\u00eda, on another tune? So it is. Her collaboration with Blake \u2013 Barefoot in the Park \u2013 is, however, far more pleasing to the ear than the hook-ups with hip-hop\u2019s flushest. The two conjoin on a humid and haunted thermal whose only downside is how Blake\u2019s more front-and-centre singing voice has started resembling that of Chris Martin from Coldplay. An older rapper, Outkast\u2019s Andr\u00e9 3000, weighs in on Where\u2019s the Catch \u2013 the one moment on this deeply committed album where Blake expresses a little trepidation about this newfound bliss. Lest we forget, Andr\u00e9 3000 is a man so evolved he penned a letter of apology to his ex-mother-in-law: Ms Jackson. He proves a sage, wry presence. \u201cAll my pessimistic keeps me in my cage,\u201d he testifies \u2013 a line that points to a deeper reading of Assume Form. This album is, without a doubt, a big, glitchy, swooning, hyper-modern declaration of love. \u201cWe delayed the show we kissed so long,\u201d Blake sighs. \u201cLet\u2019s go home and talk shit about everyone,\u201d he flirts. Blake and Jamil are not married, but Blake says \u201cI do\u201d so often on Can\u2019t Believe the Way We Flow as to make the ceremony superfluous. Assume Form is not without its problems \u2013 the incipient echo of Martin (another nice boy from England who now hangs with Beyonc\u00e9) and an inveterate itchiness to the production that ill suits the considered joy on show. Its true resonance, though, might be as a document of recovery: from the depression, lifelong isolation and \u201ccyclical thoughts\u201d (Don\u2019t Miss It) of making music, often alone. It\u2019s not just Blake: as bands increasingly gave way to solo bedroom artists more than a decade ago, the tortured singer-songwriter at the front of traditional bass-drums-guitar set-ups became the tortured solo-operating DIY troubadour. Although Blake, neck-deep in the underground, played well with others \u2013 running club nights at university, remixing, collaborating \u2013 the success of his intimate music inevitably propelled him into being a kind of poster boy for the night-steeped solipsism of the age. Blake is now \u201cout of his head\u201d, as the title track has it \u2013 not off his face but \u201ctouchable, reachable\u201d. The more attentive listener will spot that Blake\u2019s last album, 2016\u2019s The Colour in Anything, also dates from a period when Jamil was in the picture. But that record remained almost as cloistered and spartan as Blake\u2019s previous works \u2013 like a clench before a release, it feels now. With sustained love has come liberation. If the pitch-shifted interpolation from performance poet Rage Almighty on the title track were not enough to nail Blake\u2019s subplot to the mast (depression, it goes, \u201cfeels like a thousand pound weight holding your body down in a pool of water barely reaching your chin\u201d), Power On states things pretty baldly: \u201cI thought I might be better dead/ But I was wrong,\u201d Blake drawls. The sparse, but comforting Don\u2019t Miss It finds Blake\u2019s heavily digitised vocal itemising how far has he come. Love happens, Blake avers on Assume Form. But more than that: change is possible.",

A US study last year from<a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/disguised-native-ads-dont-fool-us-anymore\" title=\"\"> Stanford University </a>found native advertising is no better at getting us to buy than standard online ads.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers are very good at filtering out messages,\u201d explains Lisa Du-Lieu, a senior lecturer in marketing at Huddersfield University. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get their attention within the first couple of seconds, it just bounces off them.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason, brands are shifting their attention to platforms and formats that they know we are engaged with. \u201cAdvertising goes where the eyeballs go,\u201d says James Whatley, an independent advertising expert, formerly of global advertising agency Ogilvy.</p> <p>However, a large part of the user appeal of some of these platforms, such as WhatsApp or Alexa, is that they are currently ad-free. So ads encroaching on hitherto virgin territory could raise some hackles. Nevertheless, you can expect ads in places you might not have expected before.

But 2019 will see it take off, according to experts.</p> <p>It also enables brands to advertise directly to a hard-to-reach and pernickety demographic. \u201cMillennials like things that are quirky,\u201d says Du-Lieu. \u201cSnapchat filters are just a way of pushing out the message and creating what\u2019s called PBA: positive brand associations.\u201d It\u2019s also (comparatively) cheap: placing a custom branded lens available for anyone using Snapchat in London\u2019s Hyde Park over the course of a day costs just under \u00a3850. If you\u2019re Wall\u2019s wanting to drive Calippo envy on a particularly hot day, such a small, localised outlay might make fiscal sense.</p> <p>Such methods of advertising take advantage of the social element of social networks.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve weaned ourselves off banner advertisements, with a fifth of us using ad blockers in our internet browsers, according to research firm eMarketer. So-called \u201cnative advertising\u201d online, where advertising is presented in a similar way to editorial, has failed to take off. A US study last year from Stanford University found native advertising is no better at getting us to buy than standard online ads. \u201cConsumers are very good at filtering out messages,\u201d explains Lisa Du-Lieu, a senior lecturer in marketing at Huddersfield University. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get their attention within the first couple of seconds, it just bounces off them.\u201d For that reason, brands are shifting their attention to platforms and formats that they know we are engaged with. \u201cAdvertising goes where the eyeballs go,\u201d says James Whatley, an independent advertising expert, formerly of global advertising agency Ogilvy. However, a large part of the user appeal of some of these platforms, such as WhatsApp or Alexa, is that they are currently ad-free. So ads encroaching on hitherto virgin territory could raise some hackles. Nevertheless, you can expect ads in places you might not have expected before. Batten down the hatches and prepare yourself for the advertising onslaught. 1 Alexa, serve me an ad? Ogilvy\u2019s 2019 trends report revealed how smart speakers will soon be the latest platform for their dark arts. While such smart speakers have all kinds of bells and whistles, many of us use them as little more than glorified digital radios. \u201cLocalised advertising can be sent to that,\u201d explains Whatley. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an exciting thing, but for an advertiser it becomes attractive because you can do personalised, locally relevant advertising through what is a forgotten channel.\u201d By cross-checking your IP address, search history made through the device and its location, advertisers could soon send you hyper-localised advertisements interspersed in your ordinary digital radio content. Has your local Tesco ordered too many boxes of biscuits? Enjoy flash sales that will save you money as you listen along to the latest chart music. Irritation factor: Huge! Cheesy local radio-style ads served up by Amazon. 2 Sponsored photo filters This method of advertising is already encroaching on our screen time, with brands partnering with Snapchat to create custom branded lenses (augmented reality widgets that can transform you into a dog with a giant, unfurling lapping tongue, for instance) for the best part of a year. But 2019 will see it take off, according to experts. It also enables brands to advertise directly to a hard-to-reach and pernickety demographic. \u201cMillennials like things that are quirky,\u201d says Du-Lieu. \u201cSnapchat filters are just a way of pushing out the message and creating what\u2019s called PBA: positive brand associations.\u201d It\u2019s also (comparatively) cheap: placing a custom branded lens available for anyone using Snapchat in London\u2019s Hyde Park over the course of a day costs just under \u00a3850. If you\u2019re Wall\u2019s wanting to drive Calippo envy on a particularly hot day, such a small, localised outlay might make fiscal sense. Such methods of advertising take advantage of the social element of social networks. By sharing our augmented ad with your friends, you\u2019re unwittingly doing the work for the brand. \u201cWhen users connect with a product on a cognitive and affective level, by thinking and feeling,\u201d says Du-Lieu, \u201cthey push it out to their networks.\u201d In other words: if you want something to go viral, make it fun. Irritation factor: Minor, especially if we get to look like a cool dinosaur. 3 Stealth ads Nudging users to pick their product over another, often in a subconscious way, is becoming the predominant way of an advertiser getting its message out there. Jay Owens of Pulsar, an \u201caudience intelligence and social listening platform\u201d, describes this as \u201cshaping the decision architectures and choice offered to people\u201d. Amazon, as one of the major conduits through which we spend vast amounts of money, is leading the way in this semi-stealthy sponsored advertising. Analysts Piper Jaffray estimate that Amazon\u2019s advertising business could surpass its mammoth web-hosting business by 2021 \u2013 in part thanks to what the advertising industry would call \u201csponsored skills\u201d and \u201cbranded solutions\u201d but users might describe as \u201csneaky\u201d. It could be as simple as suggesting a branded product when you ask Alexa how to get rid of that stain on your shirt, or slipping a particular brand into your Amazon shopping basket when you ask Alexa to order you new washing-up liquid. Sounds like a dystopian future? It\u2019s already here. Amazon has been rapped on the knuckles for stealthily plugging products by putting sponsored listings in among actual curated listings and making the text so tiny that you don\u2019t notice. Irritation factor: Massive. Like your toddler sneaking stuff into the shopping trolley. 4 In-Story ads While you\u2019re swiping through the blurry snapshots and video your friends took of their late-night party and posted to their Instagram or Snapchat Story, gird yourself to see some advertising. The Story (a short video, customised with type, emojis and filter effects) has become one of the main methods of communication for many of us on social media, with almost every platform from Instagram to Snapchat and even YouTube adopting the format. In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg said 40% of Instagram users\u2019 time was spent in Stories, and that on current usage patterns people would spend more time in Stories than on the main feed in Instagram during the first quarter of 2019. \u201cAs a result, Facebook is saying: \u2018Let\u2019s make sure we have lots of ad units to give advertisers to get the eyeballs that have moved,\u201d says Whatley. While users tend to put more rough-and-ready content in their Stories, brands are thinking carefully about their Stories content, taking advantage of the full-screen takeover. Such ads allow marketers to avoid a downside of publicly posting content on a Facebook wall or Instagram feed: any negative comments go straight to the brand\u2019s direct messaging inbox rather than being seen by everyone. That openness to slipping advertising into Stories was considered one reason why Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger handed in their P45s to Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook board in September 2018. Irritation factor: Potentially large, especially if you\u2019re quietly catching up on friends\u2019 stories in bed and are suddenly confronted by a bright, blaring ad for car insurance. 5 Sponsored WhatsApp status updates While the Story has become the popular broadcast method that social networks seem to be backing, the reality is that there\u2019s an even bigger juggernaut that most users probably don\u2019t expect to be so popular. WhatsApp claim their status update is used by 450 million users daily \u2013 more than Instagram Stories, and about as many people as use Facebook and Facebook Messenger Stories and Snapchat\u2019s entire app combined. WhatsApp\u2019s co-founder Jan Koum left the company, which is owned by Facebook, in April last year partly over arguments around advertising on the platform. Such a decision to integrate WhatsApp \u2013 which attracted users because of its strong encryption and detachment from the Facebook brand \u2013 more closely into the Zuckerberg-run family of products while adding on ads, could backfire. Users could follow in Koum\u2019s footsteps. All these social networks sitting under the single umbrella of Facebook open up potential opportunities for advertisers that Whatley believes will shortly be unlocked. \u201cI fully expect advertisers will be able to hit a button and the same ad will appear on Facebook Stories, Instagram Stories, Messenger Stories and WhatsApp status in the blink of an eye,\u201d says Whatley. Whether users will also be excited by this innovation is moot. Irritation factor: Expect a chat group about joining rival ad-free service Signal. 6 Ads that talk back to you Google\u2019s latest product for advertisers, called AdLingo, combines a chatbot with a standard clickable ad \u2013 or what the firm calls \u201creal-time connections with your conversational assistant\u201d.

      "bodyText": "From Alesha Dixon, Nick Cave and Tom Waits, to Paul McCartney, Pharrell Williams and McFly\u2019s Tom Fletcher, a growing and varied band of music stars are producing hits of a different sort and climbing their way up children\u2019s literature charts. Together they appear determined to prove to a younger generation that reading a book, far from homework, is actually rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. After the huge success of comedians-turned-authors David Walliams, David Baddiel and Julian Clary, who all have a string of bestselling, irreverent children\u2019s titles, publishers are now recruiting pop stars to sell books to parents with young children. \u201cPublishing is a great industry, but it can also be a lazy, copycat industry. If you can sell a book because of the image of the author, whether a comedian or a pop star, and also get some rare publicity for it, then that ticks at least some boxes,\u201d said Scott Pack, editor-at-large with Eye Books. \u201cIn the end a book will only ever sell in bigger numbers if it is also a really good story.\u201d Among the most successful musicians to make the move are British singer Dixon, who publishes the third instalment of her Lightning Girl series, featuring 10-year-old superhero Aurora Beam, in March, while in America Kimberly Wyatt, formerly of Pussycat Dolls, brought out the second of her World Elite Dance Academy titles, Tilly\u2019s Time to Shine, last summer. And Williams, aside from narrating the recent animated version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, is to bring out three more picture books based on his ubiquitous hit song Happy. But the biggest star in this literary terrain is undoubtedly McCartney. His book, Hey Grandude!, due out in September, follows the adventures of \u201can elderly, magical gentleman\u201d and his four grandchildren. McCartney, grandfather to eight, has explained: \u201cI wanted to write it for grandparents everywhere \u2013 and the kids. It gives you something to read at bed time.\u201d Other music industry giants, including Keith Richards, Madonna, Bob Dylan and David Bowie, have all brought out children\u2019s titles in the last couple of decades \u2013 and even McCartney has tried it before. In 2004 he co-wrote High in the Clouds, a book about a squirrel. But publishers are now clearly sensing an increased appetite for stories about the world of music festivals and travel, rather than the more conventional rocking horses, teddy bears and nursery teas. It is a publishing trend that relies on parents, if not the children, recognising and relating to the names on the spine of the book. In November the doom-laden singers Nick Cave and Tom Waits, neither of them bedtime-story naturals, brought out a compilation of short stories for children called Stories for Ways and Means with the street artist Anthony Lister. An expensive, 350-page limited edition, its profits go to support education charities. Perhaps the most productive pop star on the block is Fletcher, McFly\u2019s singer-songwriter, who has spent his nine-year gap away from the band writing humorous children\u2019s books, many of them based on a \u201cpooping\u201d dinosaur. Last spring he launched the first book in a dystopian trilogy, Eve of Man, written with his wife Giovanna, a CBeebies presenter. Their darker joint project, which was aimed this time at the young adult market, tells of a life in a devastated swampy and polluted landscape into which only boy babies are being born. Fletcher has explained the grim idea sprung from \u201cone of those, \u2018What if?\u2019, conversations\u201d. The couple met at drama school in their teens and now have three young sons, Buzz, Buddy and Max. The appeal of stories penned by pop celebrities extends to radio presenters, with Fearne Cotton\u2019s books, Yoga Babies and Hungry Babies, doing well and Dermot O\u2019Leary also bringing out a story last year, Toto the Ninja Cat and the Great Snake Escape, inspired by his own rescue cats. Danny Baker\u2019s Lucie Goose came out in 2017, And Lauren Laverne\u2019s story about a misunderstood, wannabe rock chick called Candy and the Broken Biscuits was published in 2010. Radio presenter Simon Mayo is also well established in the field, bringing out the Itch series in 2012 and then his first young adult novel three years later, a grittier tale called Blame. Last spring he launched his first book for adults, Mad Blood Stirring. This article was updated on 21 January 2019 to correct the release date of Simon Mayo\u2019s most recent book.",

The American seems to have been tailing off for a number of years but her quality remains you can be sure the world number one would have been dreading potentially having to play the seven-time Grand Slam champion so early as she seeks a second major title herself.</p> <p>Injury at the tail end of last season saw Halep arrive in Melbourne a little under the radar considering her stature. The Romanian\u2019s progress so far has been serene and her recent record against Williams should prove encouragement but this is no gimme.</p> <p>Perhaps the only question will be over Halep\u2019s fitness. She appeared to be struggling in her second round match with a leg injury and how well Halep is able to move around the court will be a major factor out on the Margaret Court Arena.</p> <p>For Williams, a return to form after a down 2018 will be the target. A rematch with her sister Serena is also on the cards. It should make for a fascinating watch.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Well that went on rather longer than expected, what a match! That\u2019s it for our live Australian Open coverage for the day but we\u2019ll back tomorrow with Roger Federer, Sloane Stephens and Rafael Nadal all in action. Fifth set: Pouille* 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 6-3 Popyrin (*denotes server): The home fans are cheering everything, including a every fault in serve from Pouille. Two double-faults hand Popyrin a break point but this time Pouille hits the line with his serve. A mistake on forehand gives Pouille his second match point and this time he takes advantage, powering a soft return from Popyrin into the open court and ending the Australian\u2019s challenge. No doubt the 19-year-old has won some new fans with that performance though! Fifth set: Pouille 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 5-3 *Popyrin (*denotes server): Pouille will have to earn this, no dramas on serve for Popyrin this time. Fifth set: Pouille* 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 5-2 Popyrin (*denotes server): Pouille seems to have remembered what got him two sets up in the first place as he squeezes out a hold to love. Fifth set: Pouille 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 4-2 *Popyrin (*denotes server): Pouille opens the door, going up 0-15 before Popyrin quickly shuts it again. A good challenge from Pouille stalls Popyrin and then an errant forehand earns a break point, the Australian goes long and we have a break. Fifth set: Pouille* 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 3-2 Popyrin (*denotes server): No sight of a break in serve yet, barely a point to the receiving player in this set so far. Fifth set: Pouille 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 2-2 *Popyrin (*denotes server): Popyrin takes a more orthodox approach but gets the same result. Right now one of these players looks like a wildcard entry and the other is Alexei Popyrin. Fifth set: Pouille* 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 2-1 Popyrin (*denotes server): That is one way to do it, a through-the-legs shot deep into Popyrin\u2019s side of the court on game point and the Aussie is flummoxed. It stays on serve. Fifth set: Pouille 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 1-1 *Popyrin (*denotes server): Popyrin could not be less bothered by his opponent\u2019s anxiety. A hold to love and it is right back at you, Lucas. Fifth set: Pouille* 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-6, 1-0 Popyrin (*denotes server): Pouille has to come out fighting now. He\u2019s been on the back foot since the third set tie-break and needs to change the narrative. That service game will help, a routine hold. The youngster gets himself into a hole at 15-30 but a big winner and two Pouille backhand errors later we are heading for a fifth set. Fourth set: Pouille 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 4-5 *Popyrin (*denotes server): Popyrin will have to serve for this. Fourth set: Pouille* 7-5 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 3-5 Popyrin (*denotes server): And so it proves! Pouille is a little tentative and Popyrin punishes him. The Frenchman dumps into the net to concede the game and Popyrin has his break back. A little disappointingly we are now back on serve between Pouille and Popyrin. It is 3-3 in the fourth but you feel this is not done yet. After a fourth match point Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 takes it. Giorgi\u2019s serve collapsed in the final set and the Cezch takes advantage with a second break to seal it. She now faces Muguruza in the next round. Giorgi is now serving to stay in the tournament. This match is a bit scrappy but not lacking in drama. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 seems to be keeping her cool a little better than the Italian and that has been the difference in the third, the Czech leads 5-2. Well, well, well - now it is getting interesting. Popyrin has a broken Pouille in the first game of the fourth and looks to have held his own with an outrageous overhead winner! I\u2019ll try and find you a clip of that shot from Popyrin, he took a smash from Pouille and returned it with interest to clip the baseline, quite something. The Aussie is 2-0 up and Pouille looks a little rattled. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 has a break in third. Holding seems to be a real struggle for these two at the moment and at the end of a Giorgi service game that went well beyond 10 minutes she finally succumbed. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 leads has less problem and now has a commanding 4-1 lead in the final set. What fight from Popyrin! This tie-break turned into an epic with the Aussie showing some nerve and no little skill to take it into double figures. Pouille gets tight and his opponent finally takes his fourth set point chance to seal the third set. The shot of the tie-break though had to be a delicious forehand from Popyrin which arced back inside the tramline to earn a third et point and send the Margaret Court Arena into raptures. Popyrin did not take that chance but he made sure he got the next one. Great stuff, we have a fourth set. It\u2019s a tie-breaker in the men\u2019s match. Popyrin refused to be broken but could not find an inch on Pouille\u2019s serve. The Frenchman ran away in first set decider, can Popyrin do any better here? Giorgi finally takes her third set point after breaking Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 for a third time. We\u2019ll have a deciding set. It now seems a question of who will hold serve rather than break it. Pouille is serving to stay in the set. Nothing so far to suggest that he will be particularly bothered about that but you never know, a bit of pressure and some home crowd encouragement... I guess not, it\u2019s a hold to love and we\u2019re all square again. No one seems to want to win it on Rod Laver. We have had three breaks in a row and we are now back on serve between Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 and Giorgi. It is also all square between Pouille and Popyrin, they are locked at 4-4 in the third. Popyrin is not backing down in the third. A tight call on fearsome cross-court forehand goes the plucky Australian\u2019s way to seal a service hold to love. The celebrations tell you he\u2019s not given up just yet. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 seemed to have quelled the Giorgi fightback, breaking to make it 3-2 but the Italian has just broken straight back again. Giorgie leads 4-2 in the second. After Simona Halep\u2019s win over Venus Williams earlier, Kevin Mitchell sets the scene for the world number one\u2019s meeting with Serena at Melbourne Park: The Frenchman haw capitalised on his break and a missed lob from Popyrin ends the second set with Pouille the victor 6-3. We\u2019re now just one set away from losing the final home player in the men\u2019s draw. Elsewhere, Giorgi has fought back against Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 and has a 3-1 lead in the second. Alexander Zverev looked strong en route to his straight sets win over Alex Bolt and revealed he\u2019d put on 15kg since working with Andy Murray\u2019s former fitness trainer Jez Green. Zvererv, 21, is a little disappointed that no one had noticed his newfound bulk. \u201cI\u2019m still the skinny dude on tour, even though I put on about 15kg,\u201d Zverev told Jim Courier during their on-court post-match interview. \u201cWhen he (Green) started working with Andy, you can actually see he became one of the strongest dudes on tour, whereas I\u2019m still looking like ... I have been called asparagus or something a few times.\u201d A rogue Giorgi forehand sees Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 take the first set in 37 minutes. The seventh seed dominated throughout and had just eight unforced errors, half that of her Italian opponent. On the Margaret Court Arena, Pouille has just broken the Popyrin serve to lead 4-2 in the second. Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 has a break in the first. The Czech leads Giorgi 4-3 and is serving to extend her advantage back to two games. We\u2019re on serve between Pouille and Popyrin in the second. Kevin Mitchell is at Melbourne Park and he saw Novak Djokovic beat the the young Canadian, Denis Shapovalov, 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0 but not without some struggles. An early double-fault puts the 28th seed in control of the breaker and he never relinquishes it. Elsewhere, Camila Giorgi (27) is taking on Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (7), it\u2019s currently 2-2 in the first with the former serving. Popyrin has forced a tie breaker in the first set. Neither man came close to being broken as the young Aussie and Pouille split the first 12 games. \u201cYou did amazing, don\u2019t cry.\u201d Serena Williams had to console her defeated 18-year-old opponent Dayana Yastremska after winning their third round match 6-2, 6-1. The title favourite admitted it \u201cbroke her heart\u201d to see the young Ukrainian is such distress as they embraced at the net. Roger Federer might occasionally play tennis on a different level to the rest of the human race but apparently when it comes to door security he\u2019s just like the rest of us: First set: Pouille 3-4 *Popyrin (*denotes server): Roars from the player and crowd as the Aussie powers through his service game. Back on Margaret Court Arena, Frenchman Lucas Pouille and Alexei Popyrin, another Australian wildcard, are locked at 3-3 in the first set. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on that but also providing updates on the latest news coming out of Melbourne Park. Muguruza has also moved into the fourth round. She\u2019s finished a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victor against Bacsinszky. Bolt can\u2019t handle a backhand return, firing wide and allows Zverev to close out to love. Bolt was spirited but his opponent just had too much for him when it mattered. Third set: Zverev 6-3, 6-3, 5-2 *Bolt (*denotes server): Bolt is more decisive on his serve and forces Zverev to serve at least one more time. Muguruza appears to be having an easier time of things. The Spaniard is serving for the match, up 7-6 (7-5), 5-2 in the second. Third set: Zverev* 6-3, 6-3, 5-1 Bolt (*denotes server): Bolt gets two shots at break point, the first is dismissed as Zverev closes in on his opponent at the net to follow up a huge serve down the middle. Facing second serve, Bolt misfires as he seeks a winner and it\u2019s deuce. Zverev tries to close out but the Aussie won\u2019t give in and following a remarkable 26-shot rally again it\u2019s advantage Bolt but he can\u2019t finish it off. Zverev shows some nerve to finally get the game over the line. Third set: Zverev 6-3, 6-3, 4-1 *Bolt (*denotes server): The left-handed Australian briefly loses concentration when ahead and Zverev pounces to break again with a smooth point to close it out on the advantage court. Third set: Zverev* 6-3, 6-3, 3-1 Bolt (*denotes server): As if to prove a point, Bolt rallies from 40-0 down to 40-30 and forces a tough volley from Zverev to close out the game. For all the fight, Zverev has the answers. Third set: Zverev 6-3, 6-3, 2-1 Bolt* (*denotes server): Zverev gets the break, flirting with the lines to do so. The number four seed should complete a routine, straight sets win now but the Aussie will not go down quietly in front of his home fans. We\u2019ll now turn our attention to Zverev v Bolt on Rod Laver. The German leads the Australian challenger 6-3, 6-3, 1-1 with Bolt serving. Muguruza won her first set tie-break 7-6 (7-5) against Bacsinszky and its on the serve in the second. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the way I played. It\u2019s always a challenge to play the Williams sisters,\u201d she says. Asked how she feels about now having to face Serena in the fourth round, Halep laughs at her misfortune before adding: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bigger challenge.\u201d That was routine in the end and summed up by the double fault that opened the door for Halep. Williams just could not live with the world number one in the end. Second set: Halep* 6-2, 5-3 Williams (*denotes server): Williams is just not able to consistently play at Halep\u2019s level, there is still fight left in the veteran but the forehand is just letting her down too often. No more is this evident here as twice Williams gets into long rallies only to be outlasted by her opponent. Now Williams will serve to stay in the match. Elsewhere, \u0106ori\u0107 has finished off Krajinovi\u0107. The young Croatian winning: 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Second set: Halep 6-2, 4-3 Williams* (*denotes server): Halep has the ability, seemingly, to turn the screw whenever she chooses. With barely a flicker the Romanian gets up 0-30 and Williams has to keep finding big shots just to stay in it - it\u2019s not a formula for success and once again it\u2019s advantage Halep. Second set: Halep* 6-2, 3-3 Williams (*denotes server): Only a double-fault up 40-0 prevents a second consecutive unbeaten service game for Halep. Second set: Halep 6-2, 2-3 Williams* (*denotes server): No mistake this time from Williams who has an easier time of it on serve. The first time in the whole match where the American hasn\u2019t faced a break point, that\u2019s remarkable. Around the courts at Melbourne Park: Zverev (4) 6-3, 32 Bolt; Borna \u0106ori\u0107 (11) 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 5-3 Filip Krajinovi\u0107; Timea Bacsinszky 6-6 Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza (18). Second set: Halep* 6-2, 2-2 Williams (*denotes server): Halep wastes no time ruing those missed chances, flying through her service game to hold to love. Second set: Halep 6-2, 1-2 Williams* (*denotes server): Can Williams back it up with a hold? The answer, after a fashion, is yes but not after a couple of hairy break point moments. Second set: Halep* 6-2, 1-1 Williams (*denotes server): Here we go! A bit of fight from Williams and she breaks straight back. One angled backhand return in particular to make it 0-30 was a thing of beauty, with Williams eventually ending Halep\u2019s run as the Romanian misfires to her opponent\u2019s backhand. Second set: Halep 6-2, 1-0 Williams* (*denotes server): This is tough to watch from Williams, she\u2019s collapsing here. After getting 30-0 up Halep roars back the American doesn\u2019t have the answer. The world number one has won six games on the spin now. Halep appears to be cruising at 30-0 but a successful challenge on an ace changes the game\u2019s momentum. Although whenever Williams has the chance to punish her opponent an error creeps in - a long forehand here or a skewed backhand there handing back the advantage that Halep hardly needs. After seeing off a break, an ace and another booming serve close out Halep\u2019s fifth game in a row to win the set. Elsewhere, Zverev is on the march. He has broken Bolt again and has a chance to secure the first set against serve, which he does to take the opening salvo 6-3. First set: Halep 5-2 Williams* (*denotes server): A loss in this and suddenly a first that Wiliams was well in appears to have slipped her grasp. A small victory after a lengthy rally down 15-30 should halt the slide but a loose forehand and Halep has another break point. Once again the forehand lets down Williams and now all Halep to do is hold to take the first set. First set: Halep *4-2 Williams (*denotes server): Williams answers the break by forcing four chances against the serve of her own. Again its that delightful down the line backhand that brings Williams joy, twice wrong-footing Halep but every time the Romanian faces a break she manages to dig in and scoot around the court to put out fires. Eventually holding after an ace to set up the game. Over on Rad Laver, there is plenty of noise. Home favourite Alex Bolt is playing Alexander Zverev. The fourth seed had an early break but Bolt pegged him back in the sixth to tie it up with a break of his own. Wild cheers for the wild card. First set: Halep 3-2 Williams* (*denotes server): Halep gets a chance on her opponent\u2019s serve, taking Williams into the trenches twice in two rallies to finally get the break with a cross-court backhand that Williams can\u2019t get a racket on. First set: Halep *2-2 Williams (*denotes server): After getting 40-0 up Halep allows Williams a crack in the door but at 40-30 the world number one fires down an unreturnable serve and trots off to wipe herself down before receiving. First set: Halep 1-2 Williams* (*denotes server): Again Williams faces break point, twice this time, and again she survives. The American definitely thinks she can take on the Halep forehand and up against the wall its there Williams goes. A beautiful backhand down the line the pick of the shots as Williams holds. First set: Halep *1-1 Williams (*denotes server): The first service game is rather more routine for Halep, Williams never really get a foothold. First set: Halep 0-1 Williams* (*denotes server): Halep appears to be moving fine as she forces a break point in the very first game of the match but Williams is unfazed and is able to hold by closing our with some strong serving. Whilst this a match of this calibre might be a treat for those watching you can be sure that Simona Halep would rather not be facing Venus Williams for a place in the Australian Open fourth round. The American seems to have been tailing off for a number of years but her quality remains you can be sure the world number one would have been dreading potentially having to play the seven-time Grand Slam champion so early as she seeks a second major title herself. Injury at the tail end of last season saw Halep arrive in Melbourne a little under the radar considering her stature. The Romanian\u2019s progress so far has been serene and her recent record against Williams should prove encouragement but this is no gimme. Perhaps the only question will be over Halep\u2019s fitness. She appeared to be struggling in her second round match with a leg injury and how well Halep is able to move around the court will be a major factor out on the Margaret Court Arena. For Williams, a return to form after a down 2018 will be the target. A rematch with her sister Serena is also on the cards. It should make for a fascinating watch.",

      "body": "<p>Things have changed since 2005, when I became the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s dance critic. I\u2019d been a dancer myself, back in the day, and this was an irresistible invitation to re-enter a world that part of me still missed.</p> <p>Thirteen years ago it was still possible to say that we needed classical arts such as ballet to connect us to the ineffable, to higher things. <em>Swan Lake</em>, people said, was about the human search for the transcendent. <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> was about the disruption and reimposition of divine order. Today, very few people talk like that. We don\u2019t want art that is arctically remote, we want art that connects us to each other. Whose intention is horizontal, not vertical.</p> <p>The works that have most powerfully affected me divide into two kinds. There are those in which idea and execution are thrilling and indivisible (where, in Pina Bausch\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/feb/17/dance.modernism\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcller</a></em>, do you draw the line between your icy incredulity at what she is making you feel and understand about growing up in traumatised, postwar Germany, and your astonishment at the almost threadbare simplicity of the means by which she achieves this?), and there are those in which extraordinary individual performances illuminate familiar and even hokey material. I recall Alina Cojocaru as the Sylph in <em>La Sylphide</em>, flitting across the Covent Garden stage with her tiny gauze wings on her back.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jan/21/dance\" title=\"\"> This was no benign Tinkerbell.</a> Cojocaru looked lethal, utterly and blankly inhuman, and as James (Steven McRae) longingly reached for her, she gave a tiny, anticipatory frisson. She was going to torture him, and she was going to make it last.</p> <p>These were mesmerising, if very different, performances, and part of their pleasurability was the knowledge that they were shared events. That all around me, people were feeling the same thing. The same recognition, the same cold hand on the neck, the same sense that yes, this echoes something that, at some subconscious level, I have always known to be true. What\u2019s new is audience members\u2019 investment in the meta-life of the event. It has become a three-part process. There\u2019s the niche media buzz, the immediacy of the performance, and the reactive afterlife. We zoom in, hold focus, and zoom out, hurtling from the digital to the analogue and back again.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfs-SEx1nCU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xfs-SEx1nCU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfs-SEx1nCU\">Watch a trailer for Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young\u2019s \u2018life-changing\u2019 Betroffenheit, 2015.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When the work is good, this journey can be profound and enlightening. And once in a while, it can be life-changing. I\u2019m talking about pieces such as Kidd Pivot\u2019s <em>Betroffenheit</em>, in which choreographer Crystal Pite and playwright Jonathon Young responded to a hellishly traumatic real-life event \u2013 the death in a house fire of Young\u2019s daughter, nephew and niece \u2013 with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/05/betroffenheit-review-sadlers-wells-crystal-pite-from-trauma-savage-beauty\" title=\"\">dance work of excoriating insight</a>. Or William Forsythe\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/27/dont-believe-in-outer-space-review\" title=\"\">I Don\u2019t Believe in Outer Space</a></em>, in which Forsythe tried to imagine the \u201cabsolute absence\u201d that will replace him when he dies. These were dark-shaded works, which demanded fierce and absolute concentration but which left me riding a wave of feeling so intense that I could hardly breathe. Looking around me as we left the auditorium (Sadler\u2019s Wells, on both occasions) I could see that others felt the same. No one said much, but we exchanged a certain kind of conspiratorial glance.</p> <p>Part of the excitement of being a critic was that I never knew when a work was going to undo me in this fashion: to leave me so intoxicated that, when writing about it hours or days later, it was still racing through my bloodstream. Sometimes I\u2019d hold on to the whole piece; sometimes, especially with ballet, just to the moment that seemed to hold the essence of it all.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jan/16/giselle-royal-ballet-review-jennings\" title=\"\"> Tamara Rojo as Giselle</a>, making her entrance at the beginning of the ballet and standing there, small and square-shouldered, heart-rending in her vulnerability. In Rojo\u2019s bearing at that moment, in the interplay of her neck and her back, you could see the entire tragedy prefigured. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jun/15/dance.reviews\" title=\"\">Marianela Nu\u00f1ez as Juliet</a>, racing towards her Romeo (Thiago Soares) in the balcony scene, whipping off a skittish multiple pirouette, and then, as her body suddenly flooded with desire, changing register completely, so that her dancing assumed a charged, visceral lyricism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10e207ec21f828b2cb47b2bbc647ac96ea025af6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10e207ec21f828b2cb47b2bbc647ac96ea025af6/0_0_3600_2838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamara Rojo and Carlos Acosta in Giselle at the Royal Opera House, 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"788\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Acosta and Tamara Rojo in Giselle at the Royal Opera House, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Cooper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If ballet was illuminated by individual performances, contemporary dance felt more collaborative. It was the great productions I remember, rather than the performances embedded in them (although many of these were also great). Works such as New Movement Collective\u2019s <em>Casting Traces</em>, which turned Paul Auster\u2019s metafictional detective series into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/07/casting-traces-review-new-movement-collective-brighton\" title=\"\">thrillingly imaginative physical theatre</a>; Michael Keegan-Dolan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/04/swan-lake-loch-na-heala-sadlers-wells-review\" title=\"\">wild, nightmarish </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/04/swan-lake-loch-na-heala-sadlers-wells-review\" title=\"\">Swan Lake/Loch na hEala</a></em>, which shifted the 19th-century supernatural tale to the modern-day Irish Midlands; and Kenrick Sandy and Michael Asante\u2019s mesmerising and melancholy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/15/blak-whyte-gray-review-blue-boy-entertainment-barbican\" title=\"\">hip-hop odyssey </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/15/blak-whyte-gray-review-blue-boy-entertainment-barbican\" title=\"\">Blak Whyte Gray</a>.</em> All of these choices are of course subjective, critics being as idiosyncratic as anyone else. My epiphany might be your bullshit, and vice versa. But what the best contemporary dance works had in common is that they addressed and proposed new perspectives on the times in which we live, and the people that we are now. As choreographers like Matthew Bourne and Kate Prince have proved, dance theatre doesn\u2019t have to be doomy to address the human condition. Productions such as Bourne\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/dec/14/edwards-scissorhands-sadlers-wells\" title=\"\">Edward Scissorhands</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/15/play-without-words-dance-gb-review\" title=\"\">Play Without Words</a></em>, or Prince\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/20/dance\" title=\"\">Into the Hoods</a></em>, were brilliantly entertaining even as they told us hard truths.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/78699592\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/78699592?app_id=122963&dnt=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/78699592\">Watch a video of NMC\u2019s Casting Traces.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A fair amount of new work looked like dross. To me, anyway. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/01/nederlands-dans-theater-sadlers-wells-crystal-pite-the-statement\" title=\"\">Nederlands Dans Theater</a>, for all the technical brilliance of its dancers, appears lost in a wasteland of pretension. I won\u2019t miss J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel\u2019s sanctimonious and shallow \u201cnon-dance\u201d events; his <em><a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcnuy3\" title=\"\">3Abschied</a></em>, a collaboration with choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, who should have known better, was an excruciating indulgence (basically, she sang Mahler\u2019s Der Abschied, or tried to), and as a dud evening out was right up there with Alexander Ekman\u2019s fatuous <em>A</em> <em>Swan Lake</em> (think classically trained dancers<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysQi7J8k23w\" title=\"\"> splashing around in two inches of water</a>, for hours). And then there\u2019s the whole turgid undertow of the Belgian nouvelle vague, with which I will not detain you.</p> <p>Did I get things wrong? Almost certainly, and many will point to the above paragraph as proof of this. But over the years, I\u2019ve come to recognise the cloying taste when, as an audience member, I\u2019m asked to swallow pseudo-academic theory along with choreography. This still happens on the British dance stage, but less often than it used to. Britain is fortunate in the diversity and talent of its contemporary dance-makers, and I have watched the flowering of lustrous careers such as those of Bourne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/03/richard-alston-an-italian-in-madrid-review-liam-riddick-vidya-patel-sadlers-wells\" title=\"\">Richard Alston</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/03/akram-khan-xenos-review-a-work-of-defining-greatness\" title=\"\">Akram Khan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/08/company-wayne-mcgregor-autobiography-sadlers-wells-review\" title=\"\">Wayne McGregor</a>. Frustratingly, it remains the case that female choreographers are under-represented when it comes to large-scale UK dance commissions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bad2c20b1e037870ae92fec9c52a9f41435c2ea0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bad2c20b1e037870ae92fec9c52a9f41435c2ea0/0_0_3084_2838/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pop-Up Duets (Fragments of Love) by the late Janis Claxton at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"920\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pop-Up Duets (Fragments of Love) by the late Janis Claxton at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roy Campbell-Moore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year, the Edinburgh-based choreographer <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-janis-claxton-visionary-edinburgh-based-australian-dancer-choreographer-and-activist-1-4800275\" title=\"\">Janis Claxton</a> died of cancer. She was one of the first dance-makers I ever reviewed, I had long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/28/blushed-terra-incognita-pop-up-duets-trinity-sacrifice-roaring-review\" title=\"\">admired her work</a>, and I knew that her professional life had been one of thankless and largely unrewarded struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare for those of us who watch as men get given chances they are simply not ready for, while we graft away at our craft and take smaller-scale opportunities,\u201d she told me. \u201cWomen quit because they don\u2019t get the support that their male colleagues get.\u201d In 2018, Claxton\u2019s company was invited to the prestigious Jacob\u2019s Pillow dance festival in Massachusetts. It was the recognition that she had sought for so long, but by then she was too ill to go. <a href=\"https://danceinteractive.jacobspillow.org/janis-claxton-dance/pop-duets-fragments-love/\" title=\"\">Her dancers went</a>, and did her proud.</p> <p>The dance world needs combative spirits like Claxton, and it needs to stop relegating them to obscurity. Ballet, in particular, needs women in creative power roles; their absence is the art form\u2019s most significant deficiency. As former Royal Ballet dancer Susie Crow put it to me: \u201cHave decades of work from a male perspective internalised particular choreographic conventions, and conditioned tastes to a certain type of physicality?\u201d And where are the women of colour in British ballet? We are fortunate to have inspiring role models such as <a href=\"https://www.brb.org.uk/profile/c%C3%A9line-gittens\" title=\"\">C\u00e9line Gittens</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/people/precious-adams/\" title=\"\">Precious Adams</a> and <a href=\"https://balletblack.co.uk/the-company/people/#cira-robinson\" title=\"\">Cira Robinson </a>dancing in our companies, but all were trained abroad. If British ballet is to be for everyone, then everyone must be represented.</p> <p>It\u2019s been an amazing 13 years. People ask me what has been the best thing that I\u2019ve seen, and of course there is no \u201cbest\u201d. But if you were to ask me which experience I\u2019d most like to repeat, I think I know. It was a weekday matinee in 2007, and English National Ballet were dancing their traditional version of <em>Giselle</em>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jan/14/dance\" title=\"\">Elena Glurdjidze</a> in the title role. Then 32, Glurdjidze had studied at the Vaganova Academy in St Petersburg, and had learned <em>Giselle</em> from her teacher, the great <a href=\"https://www.mariinsky.ru/en/company/repetiteurs/kunakova\" title=\"\">Lyubov Kunakova</a>. Her performance reminded me of why I first fell in love with ballet. Nothing she did was technically extraordinary, nothing was showy, her legs hardly ever rose above the horizontal. But such was her transparency, so profound was her identification with the role, that you couldn\u2019t really see the dancing. All was character, all was emotion, all was story. Glurdjidze stopped time, and that is what great dancing can do. Writing about such transformative experiences has been, to say the least, a challenge. But also, as my successor will discover, a joy.</p> <h2>Luke\u2019s five favourite debuts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"914002d74bed4f3836aef2f5ef981710e89721ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914002d74bed4f3836aef2f5ef981710e89721ee/0_0_4256_2819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teneisha Bonner, right, with Roger Davies in Into the Hoods at the Novello, 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teneisha Bonner, right, with Roger Davies in Into the Hoods at the Novello, 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Teneisha Bonner in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/20/dance\" title=\"\">Into the Hoods</a>, Novello theatre, April 2008<br></strong>This was the first hip-hop show to open in the West End and Bonner was its breakout star.

      "bodyText": "Things have changed since 2005, when I became the Observer\u2019s dance critic. I\u2019d been a dancer myself, back in the day, and this was an irresistible invitation to re-enter a world that part of me still missed. Thirteen years ago it was still possible to say that we needed classical arts such as ballet to connect us to the ineffable, to higher things. Swan Lake, people said, was about the human search for the transcendent. Sleeping Beauty was about the disruption and reimposition of divine order. Today, very few people talk like that. We don\u2019t want art that is arctically remote, we want art that connects us to each other. Whose intention is horizontal, not vertical. The works that have most powerfully affected me divide into two kinds. There are those in which idea and execution are thrilling and indivisible (where, in Pina Bausch\u2019s Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcller, do you draw the line between your icy incredulity at what she is making you feel and understand about growing up in traumatised, postwar Germany, and your astonishment at the almost threadbare simplicity of the means by which she achieves this?), and there are those in which extraordinary individual performances illuminate familiar and even hokey material. I recall Alina Cojocaru as the Sylph in La Sylphide, flitting across the Covent Garden stage with her tiny gauze wings on her back. This was no benign Tinkerbell. Cojocaru looked lethal, utterly and blankly inhuman, and as James (Steven McRae) longingly reached for her, she gave a tiny, anticipatory frisson. She was going to torture him, and she was going to make it last. These were mesmerising, if very different, performances, and part of their pleasurability was the knowledge that they were shared events. That all around me, people were feeling the same thing. The same recognition, the same cold hand on the neck, the same sense that yes, this echoes something that, at some subconscious level, I have always known to be true. What\u2019s new is audience members\u2019 investment in the meta-life of the event. It has become a three-part process. There\u2019s the niche media buzz, the immediacy of the performance, and the reactive afterlife. We zoom in, hold focus, and zoom out, hurtling from the digital to the analogue and back again. When the work is good, this journey can be profound and enlightening. And once in a while, it can be life-changing. I\u2019m talking about pieces such as Kidd Pivot\u2019s Betroffenheit, in which choreographer Crystal Pite and playwright Jonathon Young responded to a hellishly traumatic real-life event \u2013 the death in a house fire of Young\u2019s daughter, nephew and niece \u2013 with a dance work of excoriating insight. Or William Forsythe\u2019s I Don\u2019t Believe in Outer Space, in which Forsythe tried to imagine the \u201cabsolute absence\u201d that will replace him when he dies. These were dark-shaded works, which demanded fierce and absolute concentration but which left me riding a wave of feeling so intense that I could hardly breathe. Looking around me as we left the auditorium (Sadler\u2019s Wells, on both occasions) I could see that others felt the same. No one said much, but we exchanged a certain kind of conspiratorial glance. Part of the excitement of being a critic was that I never knew when a work was going to undo me in this fashion: to leave me so intoxicated that, when writing about it hours or days later, it was still racing through my bloodstream. Sometimes I\u2019d hold on to the whole piece; sometimes, especially with ballet, just to the moment that seemed to hold the essence of it all. Tamara Rojo as Giselle, making her entrance at the beginning of the ballet and standing there, small and square-shouldered, heart-rending in her vulnerability. In Rojo\u2019s bearing at that moment, in the interplay of her neck and her back, you could see the entire tragedy prefigured. Marianela Nu\u00f1ez as Juliet, racing towards her Romeo (Thiago Soares) in the balcony scene, whipping off a skittish multiple pirouette, and then, as her body suddenly flooded with desire, changing register completely, so that her dancing assumed a charged, visceral lyricism. If ballet was illuminated by individual performances, contemporary dance felt more collaborative. It was the great productions I remember, rather than the performances embedded in them (although many of these were also great). Works such as New Movement Collective\u2019s Casting Traces, which turned Paul Auster\u2019s metafictional detective series into thrillingly imaginative physical theatre; Michael Keegan-Dolan\u2019s wild, nightmarish Swan Lake/Loch na hEala, which shifted the 19th-century supernatural tale to the modern-day Irish Midlands; and Kenrick Sandy and Michael Asante\u2019s mesmerising and melancholy hip-hop odyssey Blak Whyte Gray. All of these choices are of course subjective, critics being as idiosyncratic as anyone else. My epiphany might be your bullshit, and vice versa. But what the best contemporary dance works had in common is that they addressed and proposed new perspectives on the times in which we live, and the people that we are now. As choreographers like Matthew Bourne and Kate Prince have proved, dance theatre doesn\u2019t have to be doomy to address the human condition. Productions such as Bourne\u2019s Edward Scissorhands and Play Without Words, or Prince\u2019s Into the Hoods, were brilliantly entertaining even as they told us hard truths. A fair amount of new work looked like dross. To me, anyway. Nederlands Dans Theater, for all the technical brilliance of its dancers, appears lost in a wasteland of pretension. I won\u2019t miss J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel\u2019s sanctimonious and shallow \u201cnon-dance\u201d events; his 3Abschied, a collaboration with choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, who should have known better, was an excruciating indulgence (basically, she sang Mahler\u2019s Der Abschied, or tried to), and as a dud evening out was right up there with Alexander Ekman\u2019s fatuous A Swan Lake (think classically trained dancers splashing around in two inches of water, for hours). And then there\u2019s the whole turgid undertow of the Belgian nouvelle vague, with which I will not detain you. Did I get things wrong? Almost certainly, and many will point to the above paragraph as proof of this. But over the years, I\u2019ve come to recognise the cloying taste when, as an audience member, I\u2019m asked to swallow pseudo-academic theory along with choreography. This still happens on the British dance stage, but less often than it used to. Britain is fortunate in the diversity and talent of its contemporary dance-makers, and I have watched the flowering of lustrous careers such as those of Bourne, Richard Alston, Akram Khan and Wayne McGregor. Frustratingly, it remains the case that female choreographers are under-represented when it comes to large-scale UK dance commissions. Last year, the Edinburgh-based choreographer Janis Claxton died of cancer. She was one of the first dance-makers I ever reviewed, I had long admired her work, and I knew that her professional life had been one of thankless and largely unrewarded struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare for those of us who watch as men get given chances they are simply not ready for, while we graft away at our craft and take smaller-scale opportunities,\u201d she told me. \u201cWomen quit because they don\u2019t get the support that their male colleagues get.\u201d In 2018, Claxton\u2019s company was invited to the prestigious Jacob\u2019s Pillow dance festival in Massachusetts. It was the recognition that she had sought for so long, but by then she was too ill to go. Her dancers went, and did her proud. The dance world needs combative spirits like Claxton, and it needs to stop relegating them to obscurity. Ballet, in particular, needs women in creative power roles; their absence is the art form\u2019s most significant deficiency. As former Royal Ballet dancer Susie Crow put it to me: \u201cHave decades of work from a male perspective internalised particular choreographic conventions, and conditioned tastes to a certain type of physicality?\u201d And where are the women of colour in British ballet? We are fortunate to have inspiring role models such as C\u00e9line Gittens, Precious Adams and Cira Robinson dancing in our companies, but all were trained abroad. If British ballet is to be for everyone, then everyone must be represented. It\u2019s been an amazing 13 years. People ask me what has been the best thing that I\u2019ve seen, and of course there is no \u201cbest\u201d. But if you were to ask me which experience I\u2019d most like to repeat, I think I know. It was a weekday matinee in 2007, and English National Ballet were dancing their traditional version of Giselle, with Elena Glurdjidze in the title role. Then 32, Glurdjidze had studied at the Vaganova Academy in St Petersburg, and had learned Giselle from her teacher, the great Lyubov Kunakova. Her performance reminded me of why I first fell in love with ballet. Nothing she did was technically extraordinary, nothing was showy, her legs hardly ever rose above the horizontal. But such was her transparency, so profound was her identification with the role, that you couldn\u2019t really see the dancing. All was character, all was emotion, all was story. Glurdjidze stopped time, and that is what great dancing can do. Writing about such transformative experiences has been, to say the least, a challenge. But also, as my successor will discover, a joy. Luke\u2019s five favourite debuts Teneisha Bonner in Into the Hoods, Novello theatre, April 2008 This was the first hip-hop show to open in the West End and Bonner was its breakout star. A dancer of power, beauty and goofball wit, she would win a National Dance award for her performances during the show\u2019s record-breaking run. Sergei Polunin in La Bayad\u00e8re, Royal Opera House, February 2009 Polunin was 19, this was his first principal role, and from the moment he entered, the stage was his. Polunin\u2019s career would go into a sad decline, but the blaze of that night will stay with me forever. Crystal Pite\u2019s Lost Action at Sadler\u2019s Wells, September 2009 In her London debut as a choreographer, Pite and her company presented a profound and precisely crafted meditation on war, loss and memory. Pite\u2019s work was a revelation; for me, there\u2019s no finer dance-maker working today. Edward Watson in Metamorphosis, Linbury Studio, September 2011 As the protagonist of Kafka\u2019s novella about a man who turns into a giant insect (skilfully translated into physical theatre by Arthur Pita), Watson gave a performance of magnificent strangeness and poignancy, redrawing his limits as a dancer in the process. Francesca Hayward in Rhapsody, Royal Opera House, January 2016 To see Hayward\u2019s cascading brilliance in this late work by Frederick Ashton was to be reminded that great dancing is a love affair, a passionate dissolving of movement into music, at once inexplicable and radiantly simple.",

Loss of autonomy becomes inevitable when you reach such a ripe vintage, but it is never easy to hand over \u2013 in both a metaphorical and literal sense \u2013 the keys you have held for so long in your grip.</p> <p>My grandfather lived until he was 94. Neither he nor his wife, my grandmother (still alive at 99), looked, or acted, their age. The necessity to give up certain activities only ever came at them rudely, and they could never be told they were too old for anything; they had to learn it for themselves, the hard way.</p> <p>One warm spring day in Milan, where they lived, I suggested that my wife and I might travel with them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jul/12/how-to-do-italian-lakes-on-budget\" title=\"\">Lake Como</a> for lunch. It took several days of careful negotiation before my grandfather, then in his late 80s, would even consider the proposition \u2013 lunch in a restaurant was preposterous when the fridge contained food \u2013 but eventually he agreed. I offered to drive, but he scotched the idea. In England, we drove on the left, in Italy, the right. I couldn\u2019t possibly, he insisted, cope with the reversal.</p> <p>The road map suggested a journey of 45 minutes. After an hour and a half of barrelling down a newly built motorway in excess of the speed limit, it was safe to assume we had overshot it; there were now roadsigns ahead for Switzerland. If we didn\u2019t turn off soon, we would be honeycombing the Alps. Repeatedly pleading with him to slow down, to turn right, had proved curiously ineffective. He just kept on going, his knuckles white. From the back seat, I could see a small rectangle of his face reflected in the rearview mirror. He looked unbearably tense.</p> <p>It was only when my grandmother, sitting beside him, placed a hand on his arm as if to physically pull him into the next turn, that he acceded \u2013 but still he didn\u2019t slow down, didn\u2019t indicate. Behind us were horns, angry beeps. The car cried out in distress. We cried out, too. And still he drove on, still far too fast.</p> <p>Eventually, he pulled up in a thoroughly nondescript town half an hour from home on the banks of a river, the front wheel mounting a kerb. The restaurants were closed, a single caf\u00e9 open. It sold ice cream. We bought four. As he stalked up ahead, muttering to himself, his long-suffering wife explained that the roads had confused him, frightened him. She looked gaunt and distraught, but desperate that we empathise. \u201cHe\u2019s old,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An hour later, drenched in sweat, we made it home. I wanted to shout at him, to remonstrate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Almost every day on Italian TV there are news reports about motorway pileups and reckless driving. By now, my grandfather seemed on his own collision course with his destiny \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t understand it, couldn\u2019t fathom why he would so carelessly risk our lives, and quite what had broken down in him so fundamentally.</p> <p>On the way back, his silence remained thunderous, his anger expressed in the weight of his foot on the accelerator. He wanted this to be over as soon as possible, one way or the other. He wasn\u2019t in his right mind, and wherever he was, we couldn\u2019t reach him.</p> <p>An hour later, drenched in sweat, we made it home. I wanted to shout at him, to remonstrate, but I knew that his own disappointment was greater than my anger could ever be. In the familiarity of their tiny flat, his universe righted itself, and at last he relaxed, and came back to us. I looked at him, this elderly and frail old man, as eminently fallible as the rest of us, but now more easily confused by the world outside; I held such affection for him then.</p> <p>When we left for London a few days later, he didn\u2019t offer to drive us the 15 minutes to the station, as he normally did. We\u2019d walk. In fact, he rarely used the car after that, a valuable lesson belatedly learned. Prince Philip, with good reason, might be considering likewise.</p> <p><em>The Smallest Things: On The Enduring Power of Family by Nick Duerden is published by Elliott &amp; Thompson on 14 February</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the wake of his car crash on Thursday afternoon, in which the Duke of Edinburgh rather miraculously walked away unhurt, there has been much speculation over the man\u2019s great age, and whether, at 97, he is now simply too old to operate so independently. Loss of autonomy becomes inevitable when you reach such a ripe vintage, but it is never easy to hand over \u2013 in both a metaphorical and literal sense \u2013 the keys you have held for so long in your grip. My grandfather lived until he was 94. Neither he nor his wife, my grandmother (still alive at 99), looked, or acted, their age. The necessity to give up certain activities only ever came at them rudely, and they could never be told they were too old for anything; they had to learn it for themselves, the hard way. One warm spring day in Milan, where they lived, I suggested that my wife and I might travel with them to Lake Como for lunch. It took several days of careful negotiation before my grandfather, then in his late 80s, would even consider the proposition \u2013 lunch in a restaurant was preposterous when the fridge contained food \u2013 but eventually he agreed. I offered to drive, but he scotched the idea. In England, we drove on the left, in Italy, the right. I couldn\u2019t possibly, he insisted, cope with the reversal. The road map suggested a journey of 45 minutes. After an hour and a half of barrelling down a newly built motorway in excess of the speed limit, it was safe to assume we had overshot it; there were now roadsigns ahead for Switzerland. If we didn\u2019t turn off soon, we would be honeycombing the Alps. Repeatedly pleading with him to slow down, to turn right, had proved curiously ineffective. He just kept on going, his knuckles white. From the back seat, I could see a small rectangle of his face reflected in the rearview mirror. He looked unbearably tense. It was only when my grandmother, sitting beside him, placed a hand on his arm as if to physically pull him into the next turn, that he acceded \u2013 but still he didn\u2019t slow down, didn\u2019t indicate. Behind us were horns, angry beeps. The car cried out in distress. We cried out, too. And still he drove on, still far too fast. Eventually, he pulled up in a thoroughly nondescript town half an hour from home on the banks of a river, the front wheel mounting a kerb. The restaurants were closed, a single caf\u00e9 open. It sold ice cream. We bought four. As he stalked up ahead, muttering to himself, his long-suffering wife explained that the roads had confused him, frightened him. She looked gaunt and distraught, but desperate that we empathise. \u201cHe\u2019s old,\u201d she said. Almost every day on Italian TV there are news reports about motorway pileups and reckless driving. By now, my grandfather seemed on his own collision course with his destiny \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t understand it, couldn\u2019t fathom why he would so carelessly risk our lives, and quite what had broken down in him so fundamentally. On the way back, his silence remained thunderous, his anger expressed in the weight of his foot on the accelerator. He wanted this to be over as soon as possible, one way or the other. He wasn\u2019t in his right mind, and wherever he was, we couldn\u2019t reach him. An hour later, drenched in sweat, we made it home. I wanted to shout at him, to remonstrate, but I knew that his own disappointment was greater than my anger could ever be. In the familiarity of their tiny flat, his universe righted itself, and at last he relaxed, and came back to us. I looked at him, this elderly and frail old man, as eminently fallible as the rest of us, but now more easily confused by the world outside; I held such affection for him then. When we left for London a few days later, he didn\u2019t offer to drive us the 15 minutes to the station, as he normally did. We\u2019d walk. In fact, he rarely used the car after that, a valuable lesson belatedly learned. Prince Philip, with good reason, might be considering likewise.

Following guides Anthea and Wally, their energetic collie and a bunch of other waterproof-encased walkers along this Black Mountains route, I\u2019d ticked off 11 miles, three hills and one legend-laced lake (home, they say, to the Afanc, the Loch Ness Monster of Wales). Had I been alone, I\u2019d have been lost \u2013 or, more likely, wouldn\u2019t have ventured out at all in such inclement weather. But spurred on by walking with others, I\u2019d had a mini-adventure. At the end, I bade goodbye to a new walking mate. As he was peeling off his sopping gloves and over-trousers, he smiled: \u201cThis is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2019-01-17T13:22:30.html\" data-alt=\"Wales map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2019-01-17T13:22:30.html\">Wales map</a> </figure>  <p>At a rough count, there are 150-odd walking festivals planned in the UK in 2019. Most wait until May or later to take advantage of better weather, but they\u2019re tough in south Wales, and the Crickhowell Walking Festival in March is one of the first of the year. You might experience some Welsh weather. Or you could get lucky. And you\u2019ll definitely find excellent trekking on emptier trails, plus blooming daffodils, new lambs, stories, legends and bonhomie.</p> <p>\u201cThe weather doesn\u2019t stop us,\u201d said Roger, one of many volunteers who help lead Crickhowell\u2019s programme of almost 80 walks, which range from easy canal ambles to tougher treks in the Brecon Beacons, and include history-focused hikes, Nordic walk tasters and more.</p> <p>A key element of the festival \u2013 indeed, all such festivals \u2013 is encouraging people who wouldn\u2019t ordinarily hike to join a structured event that promotes the physical and mental benefits of walking, as well as giving ideas for routes people could do by themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ade3b7f92592a703615b274edcc3cb7c011a7487\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ade3b7f92592a703615b274edcc3cb7c011a7487/0_84_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"walkers on a steep hillside in snow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The weather doesn\u2019t stop us,\u2019 say the organisers of Crickhowell Walking Festival</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Crickhowell Resource &amp; Information Centre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>True to Roger\u2019s word, the weather never entirely stopped play. For instance, when we gathered at dusk for a planned torchlight procession up Crug Hywel (the Welsh for both Crickhowell and Table Mountain) the skies looked so grim it was cancelled. But a lower-level alternative still went ahead, and the assembled crowd, a mix of ages, tramped off in good spirits. We walked through an old farmyard, wound uphill, crossed springy fields and looked down on the wintry drama of the Usk valley. At one point, a shard of late sunlight cut through the gunmetal sky, combining brightness and foreboding simultaneously.</p> <p>All the way, there was chatter as the group mingled happily. Occasionally we stopped for local tales: returning via Everest Drive, we were told that it was named for George Everest, surveyor-general of India, who was born in Crickhowell in 1790.</p> <p>I fell into step with an older man, who\u2019d come alone. \u201cI do a lot of group walks,\u201d he told me, as we came along the town\u2019s independent-lined main street. \u201cI like walks with experts; you find out more.\u201d</p> <p>There were people from as far afield as Shropshire, Oxfordshire and London on the walk, as well as from nearby. I asked one local woman why she\u2019d signed up. \u201cI haven\u2019t walked much in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m trying to lose a little weight.\u201d</p> <p>An admirable goal, though one not necessarily easy to accomplish in Crickhowell. Our twilight walk ended in Clarence Hall, where homemade soup and chocolate brownies were being dished up. Likewise, a short town history walk the following day finished in St Edmund\u2019s Church, which was warm as a womb and busy with volunteers serving free tea in china cups and chunks of lemon drizzle cake. We sat and ate while rain evaporated off our waterproofs and a harpist played by the pulpit. A Walking Festival brochure lay on the table.

      "bodyText": "We started in drizzle, progressed into blow-you-off-your-feet wind, moved into milk-chocolatey mud and finished in stair-rod rain. But it was great to be outside. Following guides Anthea and Wally, their energetic collie and a bunch of other waterproof-encased walkers along this Black Mountains route, I\u2019d ticked off 11 miles, three hills and one legend-laced lake (home, they say, to the Afanc, the Loch Ness Monster of Wales). Had I been alone, I\u2019d have been lost \u2013 or, more likely, wouldn\u2019t have ventured out at all in such inclement weather. But spurred on by walking with others, I\u2019d had a mini-adventure. At the end, I bade goodbye to a new walking mate. As he was peeling off his sopping gloves and over-trousers, he smiled: \u201cThis is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d At a rough count, there are 150-odd walking festivals planned in the UK in 2019. Most wait until May or later to take advantage of better weather, but they\u2019re tough in south Wales, and the Crickhowell Walking Festival in March is one of the first of the year. You might experience some Welsh weather. Or you could get lucky. And you\u2019ll definitely find excellent trekking on emptier trails, plus blooming daffodils, new lambs, stories, legends and bonhomie. \u201cThe weather doesn\u2019t stop us,\u201d said Roger, one of many volunteers who help lead Crickhowell\u2019s programme of almost 80 walks, which range from easy canal ambles to tougher treks in the Brecon Beacons, and include history-focused hikes, Nordic walk tasters and more. A key element of the festival \u2013 indeed, all such festivals \u2013 is encouraging people who wouldn\u2019t ordinarily hike to join a structured event that promotes the physical and mental benefits of walking, as well as giving ideas for routes people could do by themselves. True to Roger\u2019s word, the weather never entirely stopped play. For instance, when we gathered at dusk for a planned torchlight procession up Crug Hywel (the Welsh for both Crickhowell and Table Mountain) the skies looked so grim it was cancelled. But a lower-level alternative still went ahead, and the assembled crowd, a mix of ages, tramped off in good spirits. We walked through an old farmyard, wound uphill, crossed springy fields and looked down on the wintry drama of the Usk valley. At one point, a shard of late sunlight cut through the gunmetal sky, combining brightness and foreboding simultaneously. All the way, there was chatter as the group mingled happily. Occasionally we stopped for local tales: returning via Everest Drive, we were told that it was named for George Everest, surveyor-general of India, who was born in Crickhowell in 1790. I fell into step with an older man, who\u2019d come alone. \u201cI do a lot of group walks,\u201d he told me, as we came along the town\u2019s independent-lined main street. \u201cI like walks with experts; you find out more.\u201d There were people from as far afield as Shropshire, Oxfordshire and London on the walk, as well as from nearby. I asked one local woman why she\u2019d signed up. \u201cI haven\u2019t walked much in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m trying to lose a little weight.\u201d An admirable goal, though one not necessarily easy to accomplish in Crickhowell. Our twilight walk ended in Clarence Hall, where homemade soup and chocolate brownies were being dished up. Likewise, a short town history walk the following day finished in St Edmund\u2019s Church, which was warm as a womb and busy with volunteers serving free tea in china cups and chunks of lemon drizzle cake. We sat and ate while rain evaporated off our waterproofs and a harpist played by the pulpit. A Walking Festival brochure lay on the table. Cake, company and pages of possibilities \u2013 what more could you want? \u2022 The festival runs 9-17 March, walk prices vary from free to \u00a312.50, booking essential, crickhowellfestival.com FIVE MORE WALKING FESTIVALS 1. Redcar &amp; Cleveland walking festival, 28 January-3 February This region of North Yorkshire is so suited to hikers it has two festivals, one in winter and one in summer (15-23 June). This year there will be events celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Cleveland Way national trail, such as a coastal nine-miler from Staithes to Saltburn, along the route. Other walks focus on history and wildlife, including a winter tree identification walk and a short stroll around Gisborough Priory. \u2022 Walks \u00a32, redcar-cleveland.gov.uk/walkingfestival 2. Braemar mountain festival, 28 February-3 March Not strictly a walking festival, but a great way to get into the Highlands in winter. This event features low-level walks, including a Braemar history stroll and a winter wildlife walk in Ballochbuie Forest. There are also more technical options: the full-day winter skills courses teaches you how to stay safe in the mountains, or there\u2019s an introduction to snowshoeing, which covers everything from kit fitting to judging conditions and avalanche awareness. Days finish with talks, film screenings and ceilidhs. \u2022 Prices vary, braemarmountainfestival.com 3. Boscastle walking week, 30 March-5 April Blow away the cobwebs on a week of Cornish walks around this picturesque harbour village, before retiring to The Cobweb (Boscastle\u2019s lively pub) for post-hike refuelling. The final programme has yet to be confirmed, but in past years has included 12 or so events, from easy walks along the Valency valley to loops via the cliff-top castle ruins of Tintagel and wilder strides across Bodmin Moor. \u2022 visitboscastle.com 4. Walk Scilly, 3-12 April The Isles of Scilly can afford to hold a walking festival earlier in the season, this being the warmest place in the UK. This well-established event runs a diverse programme of guided walks across the archipelago. Expect family-friendly outings, cross-island hikes, foraging walks, history trails and even sunrise strolls with guided meditation and night hikes for stargazing. \u2022 Details and tickets will be released in late January, visitislesofscilly.com 5. Kington walks spring weekend, 12-14 April 2019 The Herefordshire market town of Kington, close to the Welsh border, is a real walkers\u2019 hub: more long-distance trails converge in Kington than virtually anywhere else in the country. To mark 50 years of the Offa\u2019s Dyke Association, founded in 1969, several of the mini-festival\u2019s walks will follow the eighth-century landmark \u2013 for instance, there\u2019s a six-miler from Huntington to Kington or a tougher 15-miler from Hay-on-Wye to Kington. There are also walks along the River Wye and ancient trackways, and a strenuous Eight Peaks Challenge, on which hikers have to self-navigate between the highest surrounding summits. \u2022 Half-day walks \u00a35.50, longer walks \u00a37.50, kingtonwalks.org \u2022 This article was amended on 22 January 2019.

The shooting happened near a golf club in a middle-class area of the small town, which is close to the border with Ireland. DCI Geoff Boyce said: \u201cWayne was enjoying an evening with friends at his friend\u2019s home in Lower Dromore Road when two cold-blooded killers burst into the house at around 7.30pm. \u201cThe pair, who were masked, fired at Wayne with what police believe to be a shotgun, striking him in the head and fatally injuring him. He died at the scene. Pellets from the blasts also struck Wayne\u2019s friend, a 21-year-old female, in the face and neck. She has undergone emergency surgery in hospital and remains critically ill in intensive care. \u201cAt this time no clear motive for the attack on Wayne has been identified, and today I am appealing directly to those who may have information about his murder. Do you know the people involved? Please tell us what you know.\u201d South Down assembly member Sin\u00e9ad Ennis also appealed for information. \u201cThe community of Warrenpoint are shocked and stunned by this news,\u201d the Sinn F\u00e9in representative said. \u201cOur first thoughts are with the family of the victim. The PSNI [Police Service of Northern Ireland] have the area sealed off and I would appeal to anyone with information to bring it forward to assist the investigation.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In his office in Oxford\u2019s John Radcliffe hospital, Prof Robert MacLaren sits upright, his back as straight as a soldier\u2019s, and tells me about the lowest point in his 20-year<strong> </strong>career. It was the rejection, many years ago, of his grant application for a project investigating how gene therapy might treat conditions causing blindness. \u201cIt was completely panned by the reviewers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were told \u2018There\u2019s no way it\u2019s ever going to happen \u2013 it\u2019s a complete waste of time funding such a ridiculously stupid project\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In October last year, MacLaren successfully completed the <a href=\"https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/gene-therapy-breakthrough-in-treating-a-rare-form-of-blindness/9306\" title=\"\">world\u2019s first gene therapy trial</a> for one such condition, called choroideremia, as part of the largest late-stage trial ever for any genetic disease. It marks an extraordinary breakthrough in the quest of scientists and clinicians to understand why and how our own genes can make us ill, and the apparently miraculous possibility of rewriting our genetic code. But MacLaren is understated about this victory: \u201cIt\u2019s really satisfying, when you\u2019re given such a rebuttal, to then prove the reviewers wrong. I\u2019d love to go back to them and say: Look what\u2019s going on now.\u201d</p> <p>MacLaren might like to introduce them to Matthew Bishop, one of the patients from that trial. He is a gardener and a world authority on snowdrops; a softly-spoken, witty man, living in \u201cdarkest Devon, where it rains 70 inches a year, with my partner John and no kids, thank God.\u201d Bishop, now 49, was working as a head gardener when his world suddenly caved in. He was driving slowly when he turned his car into the path of another vehicle. \u201cBecause my vision had become tunnelled, I didn\u2019t see the other car coming from the left,\u201d he says. \u201cThankfully we were going at the right speed, so my rear bumper only clipped their front. John was sat next to me and suddenly had his life flashing before him.\u201d</p> <p>A trip to the optician revealed that Bishop had very little peripheral vision, and he was diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/retinitis-pigmentosa\" title=\"\">retinitis pigmentosa</a>, a group of degenerative genetic disorders that affect the retina at the back of the eye. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 and the optician said, \u2018Well, you\u2019ll go blind.\u2019 It was as blunt as that. I don\u2019t cry much, but John found me outside the optician\u2019s, sobbing away, a wreck.\u201d</p> <p> He left his job, and he and John started to redesign their house, for a time when Bishop would need a live-in carer. \u201cThere was this massive void, the scary part, the not knowing. What will I do? How will this change my relationship with my partner, my family, my friends? How will I cope with being dependent?\u201d he says.</p> <p>About two years later, Bishop was referred to MacLaren, who confirmed the optician\u2019s diagnosis and identified the particular condition affecting Bishop as <a href=\"https://www.curechm.org/what-is-choroideremia/\" title=\"\">choroideremia</a>, caused by a mutation in a gene called CHM. Suffering from that particular condition, which affects an estimated one in 50,000, he was eligible to take part in MacLaren\u2019s groundbreaking clinical trial \u2013 and that meant hope. \u201cSuddenly there was a possibility of no longer going blind. That\u2019s pretty life-changing,\u201d Bishop says.</p> <p>Robert MacLaren pinpoints the origin of his fascination with the science of sight to his early experiences growing up in Angmering-on-Sea, a small seaside town in West Sussex, where his father was a photographer and his mother a nursing assistant in a care home for the blind. After his PhD, he served in the British army before training in ophthalmology. He now combines NHS clinical work with academia, researching the causes of blindness as a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford.</p> <p>What makes gene therapy so revolutionary is that it transforms how we think about medicine, MacLaren explains. \u201cThe concept is to treat a disease not with proteins or drugs \u2013 things that have a general effect on cells \u2013 but by modifying the genetics of the cell itself.\u201d When a patient has a gene mutation \u2013 meaning a part of the DNA is missing or not functioning, as with Bishop and his CHM gene \u2013 gene therapy offers the possibility of correcting that by delivering healthy DNA-like material to replace what is missing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A virus is a biological system that has evolved to be very efficient at getting into cells and delivering its DNA</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gene therapy is the mutation of medicine we need as we hurtle into a hyper-evolved age, MacLaren says: \u201cThe human race has spent the last 200,000 years evolving using Darwinian selection: our strong genes have been sustained, the weak genes have died out. These genetic changes, what we call the genetic drift, are still ongoing.\u201d These changes sometimes are an advantage, as weak genes are lost; sometimes they are disadvantageous, causing devastating diseases, he explains \u2013 \u201cI have three children. In each of those kids there will be at least 50 to 70 new mutations that my wife and I do not carry, because that\u2019s how DNA evolves. And if those mutations happen to be in a specific, important gene, there will be a genetic disease, and so on for the next generation.\u201d This has huge implications when it comes to the propagation of new genetic diseases \u2013 and for how we think about preventive treatment. \u201cGenerations from now are going to have to try to treat human disease <em>before</em> the disease takes place. Gene therapy is a very powerful tool to do that.\u201d</p> <p>His vision of the future is mind-boggling. \u201cWe are going to take over Darwinian evolution ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will be able to correct defective genes in people, not by letting them die but by using medicine.\u201d The majority of diseases we suffer from in the developed world involve genetics, he explains, and we could be talking about the eradication of most of these. It sounds like science fiction; how long until it becomes reality? \u201cWithin 100 years. We\u2019re going at a massively fast rate, from the discovery of DNA by Watson and Crick in the 50s to the first approved treatment in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most difficult questions scientists have faced is how to deliver the replacement genetic material to the cells that need it. They found an ingenious solution: a virus. \u201cA virus is a biological system that has evolved over billions of years to be very efficient at getting into cells and delivering its DNA. If we tried to create a similar organism to deliver DNA in the lab, it would take years \u2013 a lifetime. But if we can use an organism that does that already, well, it\u2019s just a case of harnessing the power of that virus,\u201d MacLaren says. Viruses are, in this sense, the Deliveroo drivers of gene therapy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebac247efc048ce1bbc8ecd968aa932f682a3b57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebac247efc048ce1bbc8ecd968aa932f682a3b57/0_920_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron Harding, who has SMA type 1, with his sister Emerson and older half-brother Ryan.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cameron Harding, who has life-limiting SMA type 1, with his sister Emerson and older half-brother Ryan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Thornton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has to be a very special kind of virus: one that will not cause any inflammation nor any other side effects. This particular one that MacLaren uses is called adeno-associated virus, or AAV, just 20 nanometres across; MacLaren describes it as \u201ca little stealth virus that has evolved to be completely silent and not do anything\u201d.</p> <p>Scientists strip the virus of its own DNA, replacing it with the therapeutic gene that is missing from the patient\u2019s DNA \u2013 in Bishop\u2019s case, the missing CHM gene. This is then injected into the cells behind the retina, where it behaves like a Trojan horse, releasing the gene hidden inside. The cells adopt this DNA-like material as their own, and \u201cthat DNA is expressed, as far as we know, pretty much for the lifetime of the cell,\u201d MacLaren says.</p> <p>To deliver the virus-turned-Trojan horse to Bishop\u2019s retina cells, MacLaren had to detach the retina from the back of his eye. He shows me a magnified film of an eye during this operation: I see the tip of the syringe, the blob of liquid emerging to sit in a microscopic bubble underneath the retina, the syringe withdrawing, the retina replaced.</p> <p>Bishop describes it vividly. \u201cAfter the operation I can remember waking up, and it felt like someone had stuffed all my eyelashes inside my eyeball. It watered like hell, and it was really red.\u201d Only one eye of each of the 14 patients in the trial was operated on: one reason MacLaren chose to focus on the condition of choroideremia is that it is a symmetrical disease, meaning he could measure the efficacy of the treatment by comparing the treated eye with the one that was not treated. The untreated eye deteriorated in three-quarters of patients; but every single one of those who received the treatment successfully, either maintained or improved their vision for up to five years after the operation.</p> <p>In December 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a form of the treatment <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm589467.htm\" title=\"\">for a different kind of inherited blindness</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from being purely theoretical to a real, approved treatment with a label on the box,\u201d MacLaren says. Bishop now describes himself as partially sighted; he has no peripheral vision, and will never get back what he has lost. If someone offers him a handshake while he is looking them in the eye, he has no idea, \u201cand they think I\u2019m a rude bastard for not shaking their hand,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit bizarre, but it could be a lot worse. Just the simple knowledge that they can prevent any further deterioration has removed the spectre of future blindness. It\u2019s amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel incredibly lucky to happen to have the gene mutation for which they can actually do something.\u201d</p> <p>There is something particularly poignant about considering yourself lucky to have the right genetic disease. MacLaren uses the same word to describe the timing of his research programme, since so many previous discoveries were necessary to make his treatment possible: the development of the <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/11006943/human-genome-project-completion-frequently-asked-questions/\" title=\"\">human genome project\u2019s</a> database over the last decade (which aims to sequence and map every human gene), the evolution of virology (the study of viruses); plus the advances in retinal surgery over the last 30 years.</p> <p>Lucky is a word that also comes up when I speak to Rob and Alison Harding. They live in South Carolina in America, with their son Cameron, five, and daughter Emerson, three; Rob\u2019s son from a previous relationship, Ryan, is 17.</p> <p>Cameron tells me over Skype that his favourite thing to do is play at the water park with his sister, and his favourite book is about space. It is hard to make out exactly what Cameron is saying, because he has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle wasting, with no treatment \u2013 at least, not until recently. There is a spectrum of severity of SMA, and Cameron has the most severe form: <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spinal-muscular-atrophy-sma/types/\" title=\"\">type 1</a>. Without breathing support, babies born with SMA type 1 are not expected to survive beyond age two. Before speaking to him, I had watched a video on his Facebook page of Cameron dancing and spinning in his wheelchair on holiday in Disneyland, delighting the families watching him. He is a bright and charming child; after a short chat, I thank him for speaking to me and he says, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, have a good day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5cfebed939486e4da7a03c9118d5166d3bcffe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5cfebed939486e4da7a03c9118d5166d3bcffe4/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aliya Anjarwalla and her son Ayden, who has life-limiting SMA type 2.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aliya Anjarwalla and her son Ayden, who has SMA type 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jensen Larson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cameron\u2019s health is very fragile. He uses a manual wheelchair and has a machine to help him breathe at night, as well as one to help him cough and another to help clear secretions because he has a very weak swallow; he is fed through a tube in his stomach. But his spirit, Rob says, is robust. \u201cI love his work ethic. He won\u2019t just sit there and whine for someone to help him. He will find a way, he will figure out how to get what he wants. If he has to scoot on his butt, roll across the floor, grab something with his toes, he buckles down and does what he has to do. That\u2019s my favourite thing about him, because that\u2019s the part you can\u2019t teach.\u201d When I ask him to describe everyday life in their home, Rob says, \u201cImagine three fire drills going on at the same time, inside a house full of clowns.\u201d </p> <p>When Cameron was about four weeks old, Alison felt a niggling worry that he didn\u2019t move his arms. She called the doctor and was told to bring Cameron in immediately. They were sent straight to hospital, where a couple of days later, they were told, \u201cWe think he has spinal muscular atrophy. There are no treatments, the clinical trials out there today don\u2019t work, go home and just love your child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was pretty much the worst possible thing you could hear,\u201d Rob says. \u201cHere is this beautiful boy, we\u2019re holding him, he\u2019s alive, he\u2019s in our arms, and they\u2019re telling us he\u2019s going to die, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing that they can do.\u201d Broken by grief, the family of three did as they were told, at first. But Rob could not sit still, he says: \u201cWe were sitting at home, mourning him, and I just had to do something. It was the middle of the night, and I got up and started researching, and I came across a clinical trial, led by Dr Finkel.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Finkel is a gently-spoken paediatric neurologist at Nemours children\u2019s hospital in Orlando, Florida. He has spent the last 40 years working with children who have diseases affecting their nerves and muscles, and over that time, he has seen a breakthrough in the treatment of children with SMA. He tells me over Skype, \u201cSMA is among the most common fatal genetic diseases of infancy and childhood, and it\u2019s a condition that most people have never heard of.\u201d It affects one in every 11,000 children born: they are \u201ctypically born totally normal and healthy, they go home, and the parents and paediatrician have no inkling that, lurking beneath the surface, is this deadly disease called SMA,\u201d Finkel says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Spinraza has shown remarkable results. But one year of treatment costs \u00a3585,000</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A genetic flaw in the SMN1 gene causes certain motoneurons to deteriorate prematurely; these are cells that live in the spinal cord and the brain stem that tell the muscles to contract and relax. When the muscles stop receiving those nerve signals, they atrophy, and the child becomes progressively weaker. \u201cIt is a very cruel and hard disease to watch evolve,\u201d Finkel says, \u201cbecause these babies go from weakness to full paralysis over the course of months or years.\u201d</p> <p>Until recently, there has been no good news at all for children with SMA and their families. In the early 1980s, fewer than 30% of type 1 babies like Cameron would make it to their second birthday. In the last 20 years, advances in supportive care meant 80% of these babies could survive until two years old and even beyond, but their function continued to decline. There were no breakthroughs.</p> <p>The first of those came in 1995, when the French geneticist Judith Melki and her colleagues found the genetic cause of SMA, discovering the SMN1 gene, and what Finkel calls the \u201cback-up copy\u201d \u2013 the SMN2 gene \u2013 both of which produce the protein that is deficient in babies with SMA. Although SMA does not exist naturally in any other species besides humans, researchers could now give animals the disease artificially, and they studied how it developed in mice, pigs, fruit flies and zebra fish. \u201cNone of these totally replicates the human condition, but they each give us a clue as to what the disease does to the body, particularly to these motoneurons,\u201d Finkel says. And that meant they could start developing treatments.</p> <p>The first drug to be developed, known as Spinraza, is what Finkel calls \u201cgene modulation therapy\u201d \u2013 instead of targeting the faulty SM1 gene, it targets the SMN2 \u201cback-up\u201d gene, which naturally produces only about 10% of that crucial protein, attaching a strand of DNA-like material to give it a boost and make up for the deficiency. When given to mice with artificially-induced SMA, researchers found that they grew stronger, and instead of dying at 15 days of age were living to over 100 days. But would it have the same impact on humans? It would take a clinical trial to find out \u2013 one in which children would receive repeat injections into their spinal fluid via lumbar puncture.</p> <p>At the time Cameron received his first injection of this drug from Finkel, two weeks after his diagnosis,<strong> </strong>he had become totally paralysed. The treatment was a huge risk for the Hardings; they did not want to prolong their son\u2019s suffering if there was no hope for a meaningful improvement; and, as it was so new, there were few other parents they could speak to. Ultimately, Rob says, \u201cIt also came down to helping to give meaning to his life if he did die, because he would be helping the next child and the next parents who have to go through this.\u201d Taking that decision was a breakthrough in itself for Cameron and his parents. \u201cWe were no longer mourning any more, we were no longer planning a funeral \u2013 we were focused on the trial, seeing the effects, and contributing to the research,\u201d Alison says.</p> <p>Even Finkel was amazed by what happened next: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat remarkable. The improvement in the mouse really did predict how these children responded. That\u2019s not usually the case.\u201d Some children did die of the disease. The overall survival rate, however, was vastly improved, and many of those children learned to roll over, hold their head steady, and in some cases even sit. Cameron is not Finkel\u2019s strongest patient \u2013 but he\u2019s not the weakest either. To his parents, his improvements are miraculous.</p> <p>In babies who are treated pre-symptomatically, where SMA has been identified through genetic testing, Finkel says there is an even more rapid and robust response to the drug; many of these babies seem to develop normally, walking and speaking as other babies do, never needing breathing support. In December 2016, Spinraza was approved by the FDA in the US, followed by the EMA in Europe, and it has now been approved in the UK for children with the most severe form of SMA. But in August, <a href=\"https://www.musculardystrophyuk.org/news/news/breaking-news-nice-not-recommending-sma-treatment-spinraza-on-the-nhs/\" title=\"\">Nice decided not to recommend it for use in the NHS</a>, for, among other reasons, cost: the injections for the first year alone cost $750,000 (\u00a3585,000). There is no treatment for SMA available in England and Wales - while Spinraza is available in Scotland, this is only for symptomatic patients with SMA type 1.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f0cc35910e799f8a495cc8d83c0bb419ea253c44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0cc35910e799f8a495cc8d83c0bb419ea253c44/0_2121_4740_3520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Robert MacLaren with Matthew Bishop, who took part in his groundbreaking gene therapy trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"743\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After the operation,\u2019 Bishop says, \u2018it felt like someone had stuffed all my eyelashes inside my eyeball.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Redman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is why Aliya Anjarwalla, when I visit her at her house in London, has started packing up her family\u2019s belongings. The first thing she asks me, very politely, is if I would mind washing my hands. It is not just me, she says: every time anyone walks through that door, including her husband Khalil and their two-year-old son Danny, they must wash their hands. Ayden, their chatty, bright, sociable four-year-old, has SMA type 2 \u2013 the less severe but nevertheless life-limiting form of the disease \u2013 and is at constant risk of catching a bug. That he stays well now is vital, Aliya says, because she and her family are on the brink of a breakthrough of their own.</p> <p>They have waited long enough. When they were living in Kenya, just before the end of Ayden\u2019s one-year health checkup, she mentioned that her son did not seem able to stand as he could before; whenever he tried to pull himself up holding on to the coffee table, his legs would buckle. After tests for rickets came back negative, the doctor told her: \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is, but you need to do further tests. If you have access to the UK, you should go now.\u201d She was terrified.</p> <p>The next day, the Anjarwallas hosted Ayden\u2019s first birthday party, welcoming 50 guests into their home. \u201cWe felt quite shellshocked. We kept a face on for the party, but we left the next day, flying to London to stay with my parents. That week, Ayden was diagnosed with SMA type 2, on 26 March 2015.\u201d Like the Hardings, they were told there was no treatment.</p> <p>Over the following six months Ayden stopped being able to pull himself across the floor with his arms. He stopped being able to roll. He stopped being able to lift his arms.</p> <p>While Aliya was buried by a kind of grief, her husband buried himself in Google. He found out about the Spinraza clinical trial in the US, and the couple told Ayden\u2019s doctor they would move anywhere if it meant that their son could get treatment. They were told they could not participate in trials in another country. They later found out that others had done so. They have not forgiven themselves for not pushing harder. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve almost obsessively been researching clinical trials, and trying to fight our way on to them,\u201d Aliya says. Disappointment followed disappointment, until August 2017, when they managed to meet Finkel.</p> <p>Aliya speaks of him, as the Hardings do, in a voice reverberating with gratitude. \u201cIt was really nice of him to meet us. He spent a lot of time speaking directly to Ayden, explaining what he was doing while he was looking at his joints, immediately putting him at ease.\u201d And he told them about a new gene therapy clinical trial he was leading for children with SMA type 2, like Ayden. This form of gene therapy, produced by the pharmaceutical company AveXis, works like MacLaren\u2019s treatment, using the same viral vector to deliver replacement DNA to the faulty SMN1 gene, by injection into the spinal canal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At first my hope was that he could one day twitch a finger. Now he\u2019s zipping around in a wheelchair \u2013 he\u2019s blown us away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Anjarwallas spent the next year emailing and chasing, arranging meetings and tests for Ayden, and the day we meet, Aliya tells me, \u201cWe\u2019re 95% there.\u201d A week or so later, they will fly to Orlando for one last blood test, to check that Ayden has not caught any bugs. If he gets on to the trial, they will stay out there for at least a year; if he does not, they will be back a week later, back to square one. Although they are sad to leave their family and friends in London, they feel they have no choice.</p> <p>In many ways, Ayden is a typical child. \u201cHe\u2019s really into planes, rockets, any kind of vehicle \u2013 and he loves construction sites,\u201d Aliya says. But he needs a powered wheelchair, help with cutting up his food and a machine to clear his chest every day. He is also completely adorable \u2013 I ask what cartoon he is watching and he shouts, \u201cIt\u2019s called Robin Hood!\u201d at the top of his voice. When I ask what he likes drawing, he tells me, \u201cI like to draw pictures.\u201d He plays with my Dictaphone, charming me with a big wide grin.</p> <p>Since Matthew Bishop had his operation in November 2016, he has regularly returned to Oxford to have his vision measured by MacLaren. The treated eye has remained stable: so far, it is working. Bishop says he was told at the beginning of the trial that he could withdraw any time he wanted. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, why the hell would I do that? This is about helping other people as well \u2013 some other poor sod with my condition. If you can do anything that means someone somewhere down the line doesn\u2019t have to go blind, you\u2019re going to do it, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cameron has grown stronger, as the weeks, months and years of regular injections have passed. His parents watched in astonished delight as he began hitting new milestones, moving his hands, then his arms, then rolling across the floor, even walking, with assistance. Rob says, \u201cAt first, my hope was that he could one day twitch a finger to be able to communicate in binary fashion. Now he\u2019s zipping around in a manual wheelchair \u2013 he\u2019s blown us away.\u201d \u201cWe feel very, very lucky,\u201d Alison adds.</p> <p>When Ayden and I wave goodbye, I do not know whether he will make it on to the trial \u2013 nor, if he does, what difference it will make. \u201cDr Finkel and others have tried to manage our expectations, saying it might not have a dramatic effect on him, and we know that. We\u2019re under no illusion that it\u2019s going to be some sort of miracle cure,\u201d his mother says. \u201cA lot of damage has already been done. But honestly, even if this treatment just stops the disease in its tracks, that\u2019s huge for us.\u201d Without treatment, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what state Ayden will be in in 20 years. I don\u2019t want him to lose the ability to eat, breathe, move his hands, his head. If this treatment stops that, it will change his life, his future \u2013 it will change all our futures. There\u2019s a lot riding on this.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.</p> <ul> <li><p>This piece was amended 21 January 2019.

      "bodyText": "In his office in Oxford\u2019s John Radcliffe hospital, Prof Robert MacLaren sits upright, his back as straight as a soldier\u2019s, and tells me about the lowest point in his 20-year career. It was the rejection, many years ago, of his grant application for a project investigating how gene therapy might treat conditions causing blindness. \u201cIt was completely panned by the reviewers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were told \u2018There\u2019s no way it\u2019s ever going to happen \u2013 it\u2019s a complete waste of time funding such a ridiculously stupid project\u2019.\u201d In October last year, MacLaren successfully completed the world\u2019s first gene therapy trial for one such condition, called choroideremia, as part of the largest late-stage trial ever for any genetic disease. It marks an extraordinary breakthrough in the quest of scientists and clinicians to understand why and how our own genes can make us ill, and the apparently miraculous possibility of rewriting our genetic code. But MacLaren is understated about this victory: \u201cIt\u2019s really satisfying, when you\u2019re given such a rebuttal, to then prove the reviewers wrong. I\u2019d love to go back to them and say: Look what\u2019s going on now.\u201d MacLaren might like to introduce them to Matthew Bishop, one of the patients from that trial. He is a gardener and a world authority on snowdrops; a softly-spoken, witty man, living in \u201cdarkest Devon, where it rains 70 inches a year, with my partner John and no kids, thank God.\u201d Bishop, now 49, was working as a head gardener when his world suddenly caved in. He was driving slowly when he turned his car into the path of another vehicle. \u201cBecause my vision had become tunnelled, I didn\u2019t see the other car coming from the left,\u201d he says. \u201cThankfully we were going at the right speed, so my rear bumper only clipped their front. John was sat next to me and suddenly had his life flashing before him.\u201d A trip to the optician revealed that Bishop had very little peripheral vision, and he was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a group of degenerative genetic disorders that affect the retina at the back of the eye. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 and the optician said, \u2018Well, you\u2019ll go blind.\u2019 It was as blunt as that. I don\u2019t cry much, but John found me outside the optician\u2019s, sobbing away, a wreck.\u201d He left his job, and he and John started to redesign their house, for a time when Bishop would need a live-in carer. \u201cThere was this massive void, the scary part, the not knowing. What will I do? How will this change my relationship with my partner, my family, my friends? How will I cope with being dependent?\u201d he says. About two years later, Bishop was referred to MacLaren, who confirmed the optician\u2019s diagnosis and identified the particular condition affecting Bishop as choroideremia, caused by a mutation in a gene called CHM. Suffering from that particular condition, which affects an estimated one in 50,000, he was eligible to take part in MacLaren\u2019s groundbreaking clinical trial \u2013 and that meant hope. \u201cSuddenly there was a possibility of no longer going blind. That\u2019s pretty life-changing,\u201d Bishop says. Robert MacLaren pinpoints the origin of his fascination with the science of sight to his early experiences growing up in Angmering-on-Sea, a small seaside town in West Sussex, where his father was a photographer and his mother a nursing assistant in a care home for the blind. After his PhD, he served in the British army before training in ophthalmology. He now combines NHS clinical work with academia, researching the causes of blindness as a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford. What makes gene therapy so revolutionary is that it transforms how we think about medicine, MacLaren explains. \u201cThe concept is to treat a disease not with proteins or drugs \u2013 things that have a general effect on cells \u2013 but by modifying the genetics of the cell itself.\u201d When a patient has a gene mutation \u2013 meaning a part of the DNA is missing or not functioning, as with Bishop and his CHM gene \u2013 gene therapy offers the possibility of correcting that by delivering healthy DNA-like material to replace what is missing. Gene therapy is the mutation of medicine we need as we hurtle into a hyper-evolved age, MacLaren says: \u201cThe human race has spent the last 200,000 years evolving using Darwinian selection: our strong genes have been sustained, the weak genes have died out. These genetic changes, what we call the genetic drift, are still ongoing.\u201d These changes sometimes are an advantage, as weak genes are lost; sometimes they are disadvantageous, causing devastating diseases, he explains \u2013 \u201cI have three children. In each of those kids there will be at least 50 to 70 new mutations that my wife and I do not carry, because that\u2019s how DNA evolves. And if those mutations happen to be in a specific, important gene, there will be a genetic disease, and so on for the next generation.\u201d This has huge implications when it comes to the propagation of new genetic diseases \u2013 and for how we think about preventive treatment. \u201cGenerations from now are going to have to try to treat human disease before the disease takes place. Gene therapy is a very powerful tool to do that.\u201d His vision of the future is mind-boggling. \u201cWe are going to take over Darwinian evolution ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will be able to correct defective genes in people, not by letting them die but by using medicine.\u201d The majority of diseases we suffer from in the developed world involve genetics, he explains, and we could be talking about the eradication of most of these. It sounds like science fiction; how long until it becomes reality? \u201cWithin 100 years. We\u2019re going at a massively fast rate, from the discovery of DNA by Watson and Crick in the 50s to the first approved treatment in 2017.\u201d One of the most difficult questions scientists have faced is how to deliver the replacement genetic material to the cells that need it. They found an ingenious solution: a virus. \u201cA virus is a biological system that has evolved over billions of years to be very efficient at getting into cells and delivering its DNA. If we tried to create a similar organism to deliver DNA in the lab, it would take years \u2013 a lifetime. But if we can use an organism that does that already, well, it\u2019s just a case of harnessing the power of that virus,\u201d MacLaren says. Viruses are, in this sense, the Deliveroo drivers of gene therapy. It has to be a very special kind of virus: one that will not cause any inflammation nor any other side effects. This particular one that MacLaren uses is called adeno-associated virus, or AAV, just 20 nanometres across; MacLaren describes it as \u201ca little stealth virus that has evolved to be completely silent and not do anything\u201d. Scientists strip the virus of its own DNA, replacing it with the therapeutic gene that is missing from the patient\u2019s DNA \u2013 in Bishop\u2019s case, the missing CHM gene. This is then injected into the cells behind the retina, where it behaves like a Trojan horse, releasing the gene hidden inside. The cells adopt this DNA-like material as their own, and \u201cthat DNA is expressed, as far as we know, pretty much for the lifetime of the cell,\u201d MacLaren says. To deliver the virus-turned-Trojan horse to Bishop\u2019s retina cells, MacLaren had to detach the retina from the back of his eye. He shows me a magnified film of an eye during this operation: I see the tip of the syringe, the blob of liquid emerging to sit in a microscopic bubble underneath the retina, the syringe withdrawing, the retina replaced. Bishop describes it vividly. \u201cAfter the operation I can remember waking up, and it felt like someone had stuffed all my eyelashes inside my eyeball. It watered like hell, and it was really red.\u201d Only one eye of each of the 14 patients in the trial was operated on: one reason MacLaren chose to focus on the condition of choroideremia is that it is a symmetrical disease, meaning he could measure the efficacy of the treatment by comparing the treated eye with the one that was not treated. The untreated eye deteriorated in three-quarters of patients; but every single one of those who received the treatment successfully, either maintained or improved their vision for up to five years after the operation. In December 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a form of the treatment for a different kind of inherited blindness. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from being purely theoretical to a real, approved treatment with a label on the box,\u201d MacLaren says. Bishop now describes himself as partially sighted; he has no peripheral vision, and will never get back what he has lost. If someone offers him a handshake while he is looking them in the eye, he has no idea, \u201cand they think I\u2019m a rude bastard for not shaking their hand,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit bizarre, but it could be a lot worse. Just the simple knowledge that they can prevent any further deterioration has removed the spectre of future blindness. It\u2019s amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel incredibly lucky to happen to have the gene mutation for which they can actually do something.\u201d There is something particularly poignant about considering yourself lucky to have the right genetic disease. MacLaren uses the same word to describe the timing of his research programme, since so many previous discoveries were necessary to make his treatment possible: the development of the human genome project\u2019s database over the last decade (which aims to sequence and map every human gene), the evolution of virology (the study of viruses); plus the advances in retinal surgery over the last 30 years. Lucky is a word that also comes up when I speak to Rob and Alison Harding. They live in South Carolina in America, with their son Cameron, five, and daughter Emerson, three; Rob\u2019s son from a previous relationship, Ryan, is 17. Cameron tells me over Skype that his favourite thing to do is play at the water park with his sister, and his favourite book is about space. It is hard to make out exactly what Cameron is saying, because he has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle wasting, with no treatment \u2013 at least, not until recently. There is a spectrum of severity of SMA, and Cameron has the most severe form: type 1. Without breathing support, babies born with SMA type 1 are not expected to survive beyond age two. Before speaking to him, I had watched a video on his Facebook page of Cameron dancing and spinning in his wheelchair on holiday in Disneyland, delighting the families watching him. He is a bright and charming child; after a short chat, I thank him for speaking to me and he says, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, have a good day.\u201d Cameron\u2019s health is very fragile. He uses a manual wheelchair and has a machine to help him breathe at night, as well as one to help him cough and another to help clear secretions because he has a very weak swallow; he is fed through a tube in his stomach. But his spirit, Rob says, is robust. \u201cI love his work ethic. He won\u2019t just sit there and whine for someone to help him. He will find a way, he will figure out how to get what he wants. If he has to scoot on his butt, roll across the floor, grab something with his toes, he buckles down and does what he has to do. That\u2019s my favourite thing about him, because that\u2019s the part you can\u2019t teach.\u201d When I ask him to describe everyday life in their home, Rob says, \u201cImagine three fire drills going on at the same time, inside a house full of clowns.\u201d When Cameron was about four weeks old, Alison felt a niggling worry that he didn\u2019t move his arms. She called the doctor and was told to bring Cameron in immediately. They were sent straight to hospital, where a couple of days later, they were told, \u201cWe think he has spinal muscular atrophy. There are no treatments, the clinical trials out there today don\u2019t work, go home and just love your child.\u201d \u201cIt was pretty much the worst possible thing you could hear,\u201d Rob says. \u201cHere is this beautiful boy, we\u2019re holding him, he\u2019s alive, he\u2019s in our arms, and they\u2019re telling us he\u2019s going to die, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing that they can do.\u201d Broken by grief, the family of three did as they were told, at first. But Rob could not sit still, he says: \u201cWe were sitting at home, mourning him, and I just had to do something. It was the middle of the night, and I got up and started researching, and I came across a clinical trial, led by Dr Finkel.\u201d Richard Finkel is a gently-spoken paediatric neurologist at Nemours children\u2019s hospital in Orlando, Florida. He has spent the last 40 years working with children who have diseases affecting their nerves and muscles, and over that time, he has seen a breakthrough in the treatment of children with SMA. He tells me over Skype, \u201cSMA is among the most common fatal genetic diseases of infancy and childhood, and it\u2019s a condition that most people have never heard of.\u201d It affects one in every 11,000 children born: they are \u201ctypically born totally normal and healthy, they go home, and the parents and paediatrician have no inkling that, lurking beneath the surface, is this deadly disease called SMA,\u201d Finkel says. A genetic flaw in the SMN1 gene causes certain motoneurons to deteriorate prematurely; these are cells that live in the spinal cord and the brain stem that tell the muscles to contract and relax. When the muscles stop receiving those nerve signals, they atrophy, and the child becomes progressively weaker. \u201cIt is a very cruel and hard disease to watch evolve,\u201d Finkel says, \u201cbecause these babies go from weakness to full paralysis over the course of months or years.\u201d Until recently, there has been no good news at all for children with SMA and their families. In the early 1980s, fewer than 30% of type 1 babies like Cameron would make it to their second birthday. In the last 20 years, advances in supportive care meant 80% of these babies could survive until two years old and even beyond, but their function continued to decline. There were no breakthroughs. The first of those came in 1995, when the French geneticist Judith Melki and her colleagues found the genetic cause of SMA, discovering the SMN1 gene, and what Finkel calls the \u201cback-up copy\u201d \u2013 the SMN2 gene \u2013 both of which produce the protein that is deficient in babies with SMA. Although SMA does not exist naturally in any other species besides humans, researchers could now give animals the disease artificially, and they studied how it developed in mice, pigs, fruit flies and zebra fish. \u201cNone of these totally replicates the human condition, but they each give us a clue as to what the disease does to the body, particularly to these motoneurons,\u201d Finkel says. And that meant they could start developing treatments. The first drug to be developed, known as Spinraza, is what Finkel calls \u201cgene modulation therapy\u201d \u2013 instead of targeting the faulty SM1 gene, it targets the SMN2 \u201cback-up\u201d gene, which naturally produces only about 10% of that crucial protein, attaching a strand of DNA-like material to give it a boost and make up for the deficiency. When given to mice with artificially-induced SMA, researchers found that they grew stronger, and instead of dying at 15 days of age were living to over 100 days. But would it have the same impact on humans? It would take a clinical trial to find out \u2013 one in which children would receive repeat injections into their spinal fluid via lumbar puncture. At the time Cameron received his first injection of this drug from Finkel, two weeks after his diagnosis, he had become totally paralysed. The treatment was a huge risk for the Hardings; they did not want to prolong their son\u2019s suffering if there was no hope for a meaningful improvement; and, as it was so new, there were few other parents they could speak to. Ultimately, Rob says, \u201cIt also came down to helping to give meaning to his life if he did die, because he would be helping the next child and the next parents who have to go through this.\u201d Taking that decision was a breakthrough in itself for Cameron and his parents. \u201cWe were no longer mourning any more, we were no longer planning a funeral \u2013 we were focused on the trial, seeing the effects, and contributing to the research,\u201d Alison says. Even Finkel was amazed by what happened next: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat remarkable. The improvement in the mouse really did predict how these children responded. That\u2019s not usually the case.\u201d Some children did die of the disease. The overall survival rate, however, was vastly improved, and many of those children learned to roll over, hold their head steady, and in some cases even sit. Cameron is not Finkel\u2019s strongest patient \u2013 but he\u2019s not the weakest either. To his parents, his improvements are miraculous. In babies who are treated pre-symptomatically, where SMA has been identified through genetic testing, Finkel says there is an even more rapid and robust response to the drug; many of these babies seem to develop normally, walking and speaking as other babies do, never needing breathing support. In December 2016, Spinraza was approved by the FDA in the US, followed by the EMA in Europe, and it has now been approved in the UK for children with the most severe form of SMA. But in August, Nice decided not to recommend it for use in the NHS, for, among other reasons, cost: the injections for the first year alone cost $750,000 (\u00a3585,000). There is no treatment for SMA available in England and Wales - while Spinraza is available in Scotland, this is only for symptomatic patients with SMA type 1. This is why Aliya Anjarwalla, when I visit her at her house in London, has started packing up her family\u2019s belongings. The first thing she asks me, very politely, is if I would mind washing my hands. It is not just me, she says: every time anyone walks through that door, including her husband Khalil and their two-year-old son Danny, they must wash their hands. Ayden, their chatty, bright, sociable four-year-old, has SMA type 2 \u2013 the less severe but nevertheless life-limiting form of the disease \u2013 and is at constant risk of catching a bug. That he stays well now is vital, Aliya says, because she and her family are on the brink of a breakthrough of their own. They have waited long enough. When they were living in Kenya, just before the end of Ayden\u2019s one-year health checkup, she mentioned that her son did not seem able to stand as he could before; whenever he tried to pull himself up holding on to the coffee table, his legs would buckle. After tests for rickets came back negative, the doctor told her: \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is, but you need to do further tests. If you have access to the UK, you should go now.\u201d She was terrified. The next day, the Anjarwallas hosted Ayden\u2019s first birthday party, welcoming 50 guests into their home. \u201cWe felt quite shellshocked. We kept a face on for the party, but we left the next day, flying to London to stay with my parents. That week, Ayden was diagnosed with SMA type 2, on 26 March 2015.\u201d Like the Hardings, they were told there was no treatment. Over the following six months Ayden stopped being able to pull himself across the floor with his arms. He stopped being able to roll. He stopped being able to lift his arms. While Aliya was buried by a kind of grief, her husband buried himself in Google. He found out about the Spinraza clinical trial in the US, and the couple told Ayden\u2019s doctor they would move anywhere if it meant that their son could get treatment. They were told they could not participate in trials in another country. They later found out that others had done so. They have not forgiven themselves for not pushing harder. \u201cSince then we\u2019ve almost obsessively been researching clinical trials, and trying to fight our way on to them,\u201d Aliya says. Disappointment followed disappointment, until August 2017, when they managed to meet Finkel. Aliya speaks of him, as the Hardings do, in a voice reverberating with gratitude. \u201cIt was really nice of him to meet us. He spent a lot of time speaking directly to Ayden, explaining what he was doing while he was looking at his joints, immediately putting him at ease.\u201d And he told them about a new gene therapy clinical trial he was leading for children with SMA type 2, like Ayden. This form of gene therapy, produced by the pharmaceutical company AveXis, works like MacLaren\u2019s treatment, using the same viral vector to deliver replacement DNA to the faulty SMN1 gene, by injection into the spinal canal. The Anjarwallas spent the next year emailing and chasing, arranging meetings and tests for Ayden, and the day we meet, Aliya tells me, \u201cWe\u2019re 95% there.\u201d A week or so later, they will fly to Orlando for one last blood test, to check that Ayden has not caught any bugs. If he gets on to the trial, they will stay out there for at least a year; if he does not, they will be back a week later, back to square one. Although they are sad to leave their family and friends in London, they feel they have no choice. In many ways, Ayden is a typical child. \u201cHe\u2019s really into planes, rockets, any kind of vehicle \u2013 and he loves construction sites,\u201d Aliya says. But he needs a powered wheelchair, help with cutting up his food and a machine to clear his chest every day. He is also completely adorable \u2013 I ask what cartoon he is watching and he shouts, \u201cIt\u2019s called Robin Hood!\u201d at the top of his voice. When I ask what he likes drawing, he tells me, \u201cI like to draw pictures.\u201d He plays with my Dictaphone, charming me with a big wide grin. Since Matthew Bishop had his operation in November 2016, he has regularly returned to Oxford to have his vision measured by MacLaren. The treated eye has remained stable: so far, it is working. Bishop says he was told at the beginning of the trial that he could withdraw any time he wanted. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, why the hell would I do that? This is about helping other people as well \u2013 some other poor sod with my condition. If you can do anything that means someone somewhere down the line doesn\u2019t have to go blind, you\u2019re going to do it, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, Cameron has grown stronger, as the weeks, months and years of regular injections have passed. His parents watched in astonished delight as he began hitting new milestones, moving his hands, then his arms, then rolling across the floor, even walking, with assistance. Rob says, \u201cAt first, my hope was that he could one day twitch a finger to be able to communicate in binary fashion. Now he\u2019s zipping around in a manual wheelchair \u2013 he\u2019s blown us away.\u201d \u201cWe feel very, very lucky,\u201d Alison adds. When Ayden and I wave goodbye, I do not know whether he will make it on to the trial \u2013 nor, if he does, what difference it will make. \u201cDr Finkel and others have tried to manage our expectations, saying it might not have a dramatic effect on him, and we know that. We\u2019re under no illusion that it\u2019s going to be some sort of miracle cure,\u201d his mother says. \u201cA lot of damage has already been done. But honestly, even if this treatment just stops the disease in its tracks, that\u2019s huge for us.\u201d Without treatment, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what state Ayden will be in in 20 years. I don\u2019t want him to lose the ability to eat, breathe, move his hands, his head. If this treatment stops that, it will change his life, his future \u2013 it will change all our futures. There\u2019s a lot riding on this.\u201d \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article. This piece was amended 21 January 2019. An earlier version said that there is no treatment for SMA available in the UK. In fact, Spinraza treatment is available in Scotland for symptomatic patients with SMA type 1.",

      "bodyText": "Mae Martin Martin specialises in routines on weighty stuff such as gender and sexuality but it never feels heavy. Netflix series Comedians of the World features Martin\u2019s show about addictive behaviour, from an early crush on Bette Midler and seeing the same comedy show 160 times, to battling an actual, real-life coke problem. Next up is a semi-autobiographical sitcom pilot: expect neurotic, off-kilter premises that are both human and hysterical. For fans of\u2026 Simon Amstell, Maria Bamford Lucy Pearman We are living through some pretty strange times. But instead of fretting about the impending hellscape, perhaps we should take a more irreverent, eclectic look at the world around us? With shows called Maid of Cabbage and Fruit Loop, no one could ever accuse Lucy Pearman\u2019s comedy of being drab. And with moustached grapes, worms coming of age and Edwardian maids all making an appearance, it\u2019s best summed up as the sort of delightful, deadpan fever dream you might have after falling asleep watching CBeebies. She is due in Spencer Jones\u2019s upcoming BBC One sitcom Mister Winner, starring as the fiancee of Jones\u2019s accident-prone lead. For fans of\u2026 Harry Hill Tez Ilyas Blackburn-born Ilyas riffs on race without ever punching down. In his recent Channel 4 Comedy Blap, Bounty, he plays Terry, who is back with his family after working in London and feels like an outsider around his super-religious cousin and bossy mum. During a TEDx talk, Ilyas unpacked the gag quoted below from his Made in Britain tour. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke, but the reason it works is because audiences can recognise the truth in it,\u201d he said. At a time when bigotry feels increasingly mainstream, his inclusive comedy is just the thing. For fans of\u2026 Frankie Boyle, Chris Rock Catherine Cohen Musical comedy can be depressingly twee, but Cohen\u2019s brand is less banjo-rap fusion at an open mic in Reading, and more the type that comes draped over a piano in a New York lounge bar co-owned by Alan Cumming (she has a residency). Described by Fader as \u201ca vintage showbiz legend in training\u201d, her between-songs chat reveals several layers of humour: she is in equal measures deluded Hollywood darling, snarky valley girl and genuine oddball. Her sketches are also great: try the Portlandia-esque Brooklyn Boutique and McCary Caroline: The Intern (above). The kind of escapist glitz 2019 needs.

      "body": "<p>\u201cBeing British comes with a catalogue of sea-themed cliches,\u201d Charlotte Runcie muses early in her first book, \u201cfish and chips on the beach, or in the car while the rain pelts down, \u2018Rule, Britannia!\u2019 at the BBC Proms, the shipping forecast playing out over and over every night, a warning for sailors, a lullaby for those of us safe in our beds and never at sea.\u201d She doubts she would feel \u201cthis saline connection\u201d if she had grown up in a landlocked country.<em> Salt on Your Tongue </em>is the story of her deepening love and longing for the ocean while pregnant, aged 28, with her first child. By the end of the book, her generic, gently nationalist appreciation of the sea has transformed into a specific, strongly feminist position: \u201cThe call of the sea is the call to the absolute strength of women, telling their stories and making music of beauty and imagination, and eternal mothers and grandmothers making eternal daughters and rocking them in the night as they sing while the tide comes and goes.\u201d</p> <p>Runcie is not suggesting that the sea is unimportant to men. She recalls her love of John Masefield\u2019s poem \u201cSea Fever\u201d: \u201cI must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide / Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBeing British comes with a catalogue of sea-themed cliches,\u201d Charlotte Runcie muses early in her first book, \u201cfish and chips on the beach, or in the car while the rain pelts down, \u2018Rule, Britannia!\u2019 at the BBC Proms, the shipping forecast playing out over and over every night, a warning for sailors, a lullaby for those of us safe in our beds and never at sea.\u201d She doubts she would feel \u201cthis saline connection\u201d if she had grown up in a landlocked country. Salt on Your Tongue is the story of her deepening love and longing for the ocean while pregnant, aged 28, with her first child. By the end of the book, her generic, gently nationalist appreciation of the sea has transformed into a specific, strongly feminist position: \u201cThe call of the sea is the call to the absolute strength of women, telling their stories and making music of beauty and imagination, and eternal mothers and grandmothers making eternal daughters and rocking them in the night as they sing while the tide comes and goes.\u201d Runcie is not suggesting that the sea is unimportant to men. She recalls her love of John Masefield\u2019s poem \u201cSea Fever\u201d: \u201cI must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide / Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied\u201d. But the experience of pregnancy draws her focus away from sailors and those who have mastered the waves, toward the women who traditionally waited on the shore: \u201cThe voices of people whose lives are shaped by the sea without them ever walking across it. The people who are only ever interested in the possibility, the taste of maybe on their tongues, the scent of freedom and the beginnings of things.\u201d Each of the book\u2019s seven sections is fronted by a female figurehead and named after one of the stars of the Pleiades: Alkyone who drowns and becomes a kingfisher; Kelaino, loved by Poseidon and tied to the sea; Elektre who marries the sea god Thaumas and gives birth to the rainbow goddess, Iris. Following the progress of her pregnancy, Runcie ranges freely over references to the sea in folklore, painting and song.

As a prosecutor, she also created an intervention program to give job training to low-level drug offenders. Harris has also fought juvenile solitary confinement as a senator. </p> \n<h2><strong>Threatening to jail parents of kids who missed school</strong></h2> \n<p>Throughout her political rise, Harris has celebrated the success of one of her \u201csmart on crime\u201d strategies: prosecuting parents whose kids were frequently absent from school. Truancy was a criminal justice issue, she argued \u2013 94% of San Francisco\u2019s young homicide victims were high school dropouts.</p> \n<p>In 2008, Harris spent $20,000 on a campaign advertising a hotline San Francisco residents should call if they spotted any kids playing hooky during school hours, a local news station <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/archive/6393394/\">reported</a><strong>. </strong>The ad campaign targeted three historically black and Latinx neighborhoods.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t educate these kids in the classroom, they\u2019re going to be educated in the streets,\u201d she said in 2009, announcing an expansion of her anti-truancy strategy. She eventually championed a new statewide anti-truancy law that specified that parents of chronically truant students could face a maximum penalty of a year\u2019s imprisonment in county jail, a fine of up to $2,000, or both.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/23/-sp-school-truancy-fines-jail-parents-punishment-children\">Do US laws that punish parents for truancy keep their kids in school?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Harris has stressed that the goal of the strategy was to use the threat of prosecution to get parents of chronically truant students to meet with officials and make a plan for getting their students got to school. No parents have ever been arrested or jailed for truancy in San Francisco, during Harris\u2019s time or after, according to a prosecutor who still works on the issue in the current district attorney\u2019s office.</p> \n<p>By late 2010, as Harris was running for California attorney general, the total number of parents prosecuted in San Francisco was just 25, Harris said at the time. She credited the overall truancy strategy with a <a href=\"https://www.scpr.org/news/2010/10/08/19999/new-law-penalize-parents-truant-students/\">33% increase</a> in attendance at San Francisco schools.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs Senator Harris has said many times, she knows all parents love their children and many did not have the resources to get them to school, which is why her office worked with the school district and parents to get families the services they needed,\u201d Harris\u2019s spokeswoman, Lily Adams, said.</p> \n<p>But some advocates said that Harris\u2019s policy got the issue backwards: student truancy was not a problem of bad or neglectful parents, but a symptom of broader problems within the school systems, including <a href=\"https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/discourse/62-3.pdf\">chronic underfunding</a> of California public schools. A punitive approach to truancy threatened to <a href=\"https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/discourse/62-3.pdf\">fuel the school to prison pipeline</a> and make life harder for students missing school because they were homeless or their parents were already caught up in the criminal justice system.</p> \n<p>Jyoti Nanda, a law professor who runs a youth and justice clinic at the University of California Los Angeles, said she had been \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by Harris\u2019s \u201cfearmongering\u201d on truancy, which she said was \u201ccompletely the opposite of best practices\u201d to help students.</p> \n<p>The way Harris had framed truancy as the individual fault of poor parents, Nanda said, fed into old, ugly stereotypes about poor families and families of color.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo the extent that she can acknowledge that it was a mistake to have that rhetoric, I think that would go a long way,\u201d Nanda said.</p> \n<p>Bickers, the sex worker rights\u2019 activist, said she would like to see Harris reconcile with her prosecutorial record, admit her failings and demonstrate how she has changed: \u201cWe all learn and grow.\u201d</p> \n<p>But without that accountability, she added, \u201cShe\u2019s not the radical option.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Kamala Harris prepares to enter the competitive field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates as a frontrunner, the California senator is presenting herself as a criminal justice reformer, an ally of Black Lives Matter, and a defender of America\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. Clips of her sharp questioning of Trump administration officials have gone viral. The daughter of immigrants who took her in a stroller to civil rights protests, Harris has been a pathbreaker at almost every step of her political career. She was born in Oakland, where she later served on the frontlines of America\u2019s harsh criminal justice system as a local prosecutor in the 1990s. She went on to become the first African American and the first woman elected as San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and as California attorney general in 2010. She was the second black woman and first south Asian woman elected to the US Senate in 2016. Throughout her meteoric career, she has tried to transcend \u201ctough on crime\u201d or \u201csoft on crime\u201d stereotypes, and instead labeled herself as \u201csmart on crime\u201d \u2013 eager to put people in prison for violent offenses, but wary of wasting taxpayer dollars, a champion of some criminal justice reforms but still tough enough to remain electable in the most punitive country on earth. Her record as a prosecutor in California, however, complicates her progressive image. Among the many policies now drawing renewed scrutiny, Harris\u2019s approach to sex work, police reform, prisoners\u2019 rights and truancy reveal the tensions between her record in law enforcement and her current progressive rhetoric. For decades, Harris\u2019s law enforcement credentials were central to her appeal to voters. Now, as the Democratic party continues to reckon with its history of endorsing racist, ineffective criminal justice policies, her background has become, for some voters, a liability. As her critics on the left put it on Twitter: \u201cKamala Harris is a cop.\u201d On sex work, \u2018tough on crime\u2019 When Harris appeared on the feminist podcast Call Your Girlfriend last summer, the two hosts chatted with her warmly about what it was like being America\u2019s only black female senator \u2013 and what it was like to constantly have people mispronounce her name. But the hosts, Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow, questioned Harris on one position they said they did not understand: why had she worked to shut down Backpage.com, a website sex workers used for advertisements and that many argued had made their work more safe? Today, Harris presents herself as an advocate for victims of sexual exploitation, but her practices as prosecutor and the legislation she has supported have often conflated human \u201ctrafficking\u201d with consensual adult sex work. Harris\u2019s DA office participated in sting operations that used female police officers to pose as prostitutes and arrest men who interact with them. The \u201cloitering\u201d cases that followed disproportionally targeted Latino men. Harris was also a vocal opponent of a proposition to decriminalize prostitution. On Backpage, which Harris called the \u201cworld\u2019s top online brothel\u201d, she pursued pimping charges against the website operators, even after a judged tossed an initial case on free speech grounds. Harris continued her opposition to the website as a senator and supported legislation that further criminalized sex work across the internet. Backpage\u2019s closure has left many sex workers strapped for cash to pay for housing and medicines and forced some sex workers to turn to more precarious kinds of work to make up for lost income. \u201cIt put these girls out of the safety net the internet has provided and back on the streets,\u201d said Kiki Bryant, a 27-year-old writer and sex workers\u2019 rights activist. Matilda Bickers, a 34-year-old sex workers\u2019 organizer, said: \u201cIf you want to help marginalized and exploited people, you protect them, you don\u2019t further limit their options \u2026 It\u2019s been devastating.\u201d Phoenix Calida, another sex worker, said Harris was a leader in a bipartisan agenda that put sex workers and victims of trafficking behind bars, championing a policy position that Calida believes will be viewed as backwards and unethical years from now, similar to the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d: \u201cThis is absolutely tough on crime. It\u2019s about hurting people in the name of crime reduction.\u201d Inaction on police brutality \u201cWe must speak truth about police brutality, about racial bias, about the killing of unarmed black men,\u201d Harris writes in her new political memoir, The Truths We Hold. \u201cPolice brutality occurs in America and we have to root it out wherever we find it.\u201d Harris lists the names of some of the most high-profile victims of police killings: Walter Scott in South Carolina, Philando Castile in Minnesota, Eric Garner in New York. But there are other names she does not add to this list, including Alan Blueford, Mario Woods, and Amilcar Perez-Lopez \u2013 all victims who were killed in the San Francisco Bay Area, and whose cases Harris could have directly addressed. Before stepping down as attorney general to become a senator, Harris took a few steps to tackle the issue of police brutality. She opened civil rights investigations into two California police departments that ranked among the deadliest in the US. She also increased access to data about the use of force by police, spoke openly about \u201cracial disparities\u201d the statistics revealed, and introduced statewide law enforcement training on procedural justice and implicit bias. But earlier in her career, as California\u2019s top prosecutor, Harris frequently did not use her authority to investigate allegations of misconduct and abuse by police and prosecutors, even in the face of clear evidence of wrongdoing. She opposed legislation that would have required her office to investigate fatal shootings by police and repeatedly fought to keep people incarcerated when there was overwhelming evidence of wrongful convictions. Jeff Adachi, the public defender of San Francisco, twice urged Harris to open a civil rights investigation into the San Francisco police department, once after a police were caught sending racist and homophobic text messages and again a string of high-profile killings of young people of color by police. \u201cI never received a response,\u201d Adachi said in an email. In 2016, numerous male officers across the Bay Area became embroiled in a sexual exploitation scandal. The local district attorneys, which work closely with police departments, were slow to bring criminal cases, and when they did, the charges largely fell apart. A federal judge said the Oakland police department\u2019s investigation into its own officers was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d, but Harris did not launch her own investigation. The inaction was particularly shameful and hypocritical given her stated commitments on fighting trafficking and protecting exploited youth, activists said. \u201cWe pleaded with her and pressured her to at least investigate, if not prosecute, some of the local police departments who had killed African American men and Latino men,\u201d said Anne Butterfield Weills, a local civil rights lawyer. \u201cShe ignored us.\u201d Harris\u2019s current spokesperson said the Oakland police scandal was handled by a local district attorney. Defender of the prison system Last May, Roxana Hern\u00e1ndez, a 33-year-old transgender woman from Honduras who sought asylum in the United States, died while in custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Harris was one of the Democratic senators who has since spotlighted her case, demanding that Ice officials provide answers about how and why she died, and calling her case \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d. As a senator, Harris has introduced bipartisan legislation to reform the money bail system, which traps low-income Americans in jail on low-level charges, simply because they cannot pay the fee that would allow them to await trial at home. But as attorney general, Harris spent years defending malpractices in California\u2019s troubled and overcrowded prison system. Her positions at the time are at odds with some of her policy positions as a senator. In 2015, Harris\u2019s office fought to stop a Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, a trans woman in California\u2019s prison system prison, from getting reassignment surgery. She had the power to take a principled stand but chose not to, the same way she refused to defend the ban on gay marriage, said Jennifer Orthwein, an attorney who represented Norsworthy, noting that allowing Norsworthy\u2019s surgery would have put their client in a much better position to re-enter society. \u201cIf [Harris] would grapple publicly with what was going on when she was denying the rights of trans people in prison and admit that her mind has changed \u2026 I might not call her a hypocrite,\u201d said EmilyRose Johns, a civil rights lawyer who has fought for trans rights behind bars in California. As the top lawyer for the prison system, Harris also defended the use of lengthy solitary confinement, despite evidence the practice causes long-term and severe harm to prisoners. Though a settlement ultimately led to reforms, the years-long battle means Harris\u2019s legacy includes extreme suffering for thousands of prisoners who were stuck in isolation during the court battle, said Weills. \u201cThey are broken people \u2013 psychologically, physically damaged.\u201d Harris\u2019s current spokeswoman said she was obligated to defend the prison system in those cases and that she worked to change policies. As a prosecutor, she also created an intervention program to give job training to low-level drug offenders. Harris has also fought juvenile solitary confinement as a senator. Threatening to jail parents of kids who missed school Throughout her political rise, Harris has celebrated the success of one of her \u201csmart on crime\u201d strategies: prosecuting parents whose kids were frequently absent from school. Truancy was a criminal justice issue, she argued \u2013 94% of San Francisco\u2019s young homicide victims were high school dropouts. In 2008, Harris spent $20,000 on a campaign advertising a hotline San Francisco residents should call if they spotted any kids playing hooky during school hours, a local news station reported. The ad campaign targeted three historically black and Latinx neighborhoods. \u201cIf we don\u2019t educate these kids in the classroom, they\u2019re going to be educated in the streets,\u201d she said in 2009, announcing an expansion of her anti-truancy strategy. She eventually championed a new statewide anti-truancy law that specified that parents of chronically truant students could face a maximum penalty of a year\u2019s imprisonment in county jail, a fine of up to $2,000, or both. Harris has stressed that the goal of the strategy was to use the threat of prosecution to get parents of chronically truant students to meet with officials and make a plan for getting their students got to school. No parents have ever been arrested or jailed for truancy in San Francisco, during Harris\u2019s time or after, according to a prosecutor who still works on the issue in the current district attorney\u2019s office. By late 2010, as Harris was running for California attorney general, the total number of parents prosecuted in San Francisco was just 25, Harris said at the time. She credited the overall truancy strategy with a 33% increase in attendance at San Francisco schools. \u201cAs Senator Harris has said many times, she knows all parents love their children and many did not have the resources to get them to school, which is why her office worked with the school district and parents to get families the services they needed,\u201d Harris\u2019s spokeswoman, Lily Adams, said. But some advocates said that Harris\u2019s policy got the issue backwards: student truancy was not a problem of bad or neglectful parents, but a symptom of broader problems within the school systems, including chronic underfunding of California public schools. A punitive approach to truancy threatened to fuel the school to prison pipeline and make life harder for students missing school because they were homeless or their parents were already caught up in the criminal justice system. Jyoti Nanda, a law professor who runs a youth and justice clinic at the University of California Los Angeles, said she had been \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by Harris\u2019s \u201cfearmongering\u201d on truancy, which she said was \u201ccompletely the opposite of best practices\u201d to help students. The way Harris had framed truancy as the individual fault of poor parents, Nanda said, fed into old, ugly stereotypes about poor families and families of color. \u201cTo the extent that she can acknowledge that it was a mistake to have that rhetoric, I think that would go a long way,\u201d Nanda said. Bickers, the sex worker rights\u2019 activist, said she would like to see Harris reconcile with her prosecutorial record, admit her failings and demonstrate how she has changed: \u201cWe all learn and grow.\u201d But without that accountability, she added, \u201cShe\u2019s not the radical option.\u201d",

My first encounter with the city was via the birthday and Christmas cards my father\u2019s family would send to me in Glasgow from north Belfast in the 1970s. Few of my dad\u2019s family were educated, and they would write like they were guessing how language worked. It was an early inspiration as a writer, the idea that you could transcend the most difficult of environments by laying claim to your own words.</p> <p>Various books contributed to my experience of Belfast; <em>Show Me the Man</em>, the biography of ex-Provisional IRA member turned Sinn F\u00e9in politician Martin Meehan, who had grown up in the same street in the Ardoyne as my dad\u2019s family; <em>Nor Meekly Serve My Time</em>, an incredible oral history of the H-block struggle; <em>Borstal Boy</em> and <em>Confessions of an Irish Rebel</em> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/mar/23/observer-archive-sad-death-brendan-behan\" title=\"\">Brendan Behan</a>, who, like my grandfather, was a volunteer in the IRA. Although Behan was from Dublin, his books helped situate the experiences of my own family in some kind of literary tradition, and I\u2019m still in love with his ability to channel his exuberant energy into prose that feels completely alive.</p> <p>I always loved the Belfast murals, on both sides. Bill Rolston\u2019s series on them, <em>Drawing Support</em>, are essential documents of modern folk art. Architectural and photographic books about the city became a major obsession, too; works by Paul Larmour and Jonathan Bardon. With the city being perpetually razed and renewed it felt like the ultimate palimpsest; every building populated by ghosts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/06/for-the-good-times-david-keenan-review\">For the Good Times by David Keenan \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What attracts me to writing about certain places is the feeling of reality being up for grabs. In the 1990s my mum spotted a life-size model of <em>Doctor Who</em>\u2019s dog K9 in a comic shop in Belfast. She inquired about buying it, but the owner apologised and said he had to close up for the night because the IRA had kidnapped his wife and he had to go and pay their ransom. My mum just shrugged and asked if he would be open in the morning and he said, sure, he would. It was only once we were on the ferry with K-9 in the back of the car that we looked at each other like, \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d In Belfast it had seemed normal. But as soon as you are out of its reach it\u2019s like a different planet, where different rules apply.</p> <p>In the last birthday card my father sent me before he died, he wrote \u201calways, remember, you, are, an, very, special, person\u201d. It\u2019s so important to read, my father would tell me, my father who couldn\u2019t even read himself. How would he know? I thought about this a lot after his death and I knew that if he could have read, most books would have disappointed him. That\u2019s when I made the vow to write the kind of novels that would live up to an illiterate person\u2019s fantasy. That\u2019s how Belfast made me, and how in <em>For the Good Times</em>, I remade Belfast in return.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For the Good Times by David Keenan is published by Faber.

Various books contributed to my experience of Belfast; Show Me the Man, the biography of ex-Provisional IRA member turned Sinn F\u00e9in politician Martin Meehan, who had grown up in the same street in the Ardoyne as my dad\u2019s family; Nor Meekly Serve My Time, an incredible oral history of the H-block struggle; Borstal Boy and Confessions of an Irish Rebel by Brendan Behan, who, like my grandfather, was a volunteer in the IRA. Although Behan was from Dublin, his books helped situate the experiences of my own family in some kind of literary tradition, and I\u2019m still in love with his ability to channel his exuberant energy into prose that feels completely alive. I always loved the Belfast murals, on both sides. Bill Rolston\u2019s series on them, Drawing Support, are essential documents of modern folk art. Architectural and photographic books about the city became a major obsession, too; works by Paul Larmour and Jonathan Bardon. With the city being perpetually razed and renewed it felt like the ultimate palimpsest; every building populated by ghosts. What attracts me to writing about certain places is the feeling of reality being up for grabs. In the 1990s my mum spotted a life-size model of Doctor Who\u2019s dog K9 in a comic shop in Belfast. She inquired about buying it, but the owner apologised and said he had to close up for the night because the IRA had kidnapped his wife and he had to go and pay their ransom. My mum just shrugged and asked if he would be open in the morning and he said, sure, he would. It was only once we were on the ferry with K-9 in the back of the car that we looked at each other like, \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d In Belfast it had seemed normal. But as soon as you are out of its reach it\u2019s like a different planet, where different rules apply. In the last birthday card my father sent me before he died, he wrote \u201calways, remember, you, are, an, very, special, person\u201d. It\u2019s so important to read, my father would tell me, my father who couldn\u2019t even read himself. How would he know? I thought about this a lot after his death and I knew that if he could have read, most books would have disappointed him. That\u2019s when I made the vow to write the kind of novels that would live up to an illiterate person\u2019s fantasy. That\u2019s how Belfast made me, and how in For the Good Times, I remade Belfast in return. \u2022 For the Good Times by David Keenan is published by Faber.

People on Twitter decried what Gillibrand \u201cdid to\u201d Franken; they said that she had \u201cthrown him under the bus.\u201d There was a lot of anger by Franken supporters after he finally did resign, and most of that anger has been directed at Gillibrand; very little was directed at Franken himself.</p> <p>That\u2019s notable, because <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/al-franken-news-list-of-sexual-misconduct-allegations.html\">the allegations against Franken</a> were numerous, credible, consistent and gross.

      "bodyText": "Sir John Major has called for MPs to be allowed to have a free vote on a series of options to solve the unfolding Brexit crisis, saying he feared millions will be hurt if Britain leaves the EU with the wrong deal or none at all. The former prime minister called on Theresa May to stage a series of \u201cindicative\u201d votes in parliament to establish whether any proposals could command a majority. \u201cThe prime minister \u2026 fought for her deal, she got a deal, she argued valiantly for it, but the House of Commons killed it and killed it comprehensively,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cSo her deal is dead and I don\u2019t honestly think that tinkering with it is going to make very much difference, if any difference at all. \u201cAnd so the prime minister still needs a deal. If she can\u2019t deliver one that parliament accepts, then she needs to become a facilitator, a mediator, to find out what parliament will accept.\u201d Ideally the party would permit a free vote, he said, \u201cso that we can get an honest representation of parliament\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get an absolutely honest answer from members of parliament, and if it is a free vote, it removes the danger of resignations from government or the opposition front bench because they disagree with their leader\u2019s policy.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is such a unique issue, I think it would be an act of statesmanship by the party leaders to say: \u2018Because of the very strong opinions on either side, we are going to lift the party whips so parliament and the country can get a genuine view of what it is members of parliament most think would be best for our country or, perhaps, least bad for our country.\u2019 It is a unique way of doing it, but I think it is justified.\u201d In 1971, the then prime minister, Edward Heath, offered Tory MPs a free vote on whether to join the European Economic Community in order to help solve division. Major also said that if the cabinet or parliament could not find a solution, then the other option was to have a second referendum. Major\u2019s comments come after he wrote an article last week in which he said revoking article 50, which gave the country two years to leave the EU after it was triggered in 2017, had become the \u201conly sensible course\u201d. On Saturday, Major told BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI\u2019m no longer in politics; I have no axe to grind. I\u2019m not part of the remain campaign, and I\u2019m certainly not part of the leave campaign. I can look at it quite dispassionately \u2026 and I will tell you my fear.

      "body": "<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes\">Yotam Ottolenghi</a></h2> <p>Before I started working with Claudine, I tested all my recipes myself. It became too much in 2007; I had started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes\" title=\"\">my Guardian column</a> and was working on my first book. Claudine would come to my apartment every week and we\u2019d test together. That graduated to her testing from home in London, before she eventually moved to Wales.</p> <p>I have remained faithful to Claudine. She knows exactly what my expectations are \u2013 if something isn\u2019t exciting enough, she\u2019ll tell me it isn\u2019t very \u201cOttolenghi\u201d. We use that word a lot. In my test kitchen in London, we\u2019ll sometimes look to Claudine for final reassurance. </p> <p>She\u2019s very methodical, and never leaves a stone unturned, reminding us that we need to instruct people at home to do the things that I do on autopilot, like peeling a vegetable. These things need to be spelled out.</p> <p>Her move to rural Wales has been a strength: if she can get an ingredient there, it should be fine to include it. She lives near her Welsh in-laws, so the whole family plays a role in tasting. I get her three kids\u2019 feedback, her mother-in-law\u2019s, her neighbours\u2019.</p> <p>Our system is very thorough. First, my test kitchen team \u2013 Ixta and Noor \u2013 put a recipe through its paces, trying it on average three to four times. For things like bakes that involve more chemistry, it could be up to 10 times. Then it gets sent to Wales. If Claudine isn\u2019t happy, we reassess.</p> <p>The equipment you have at home can create such variation. We had an aubergine conundrum for years: while we were cooking it on the hob, Claudine used her grill, which caused way more evaporation, leaving her with half the weight of flesh that we had. I want to give readers all the information they need, as the last thing I want is for them to be disappointed.</p> <p>We now know what Claudine likes and doesn\u2019t. Anything with ricotta and broad beans is never very popular with her. Otherwise, she seems to like everything, which is why the stuff she\u2019s less keen on really stands out. When she says something is \u201cnice\u201d, it\u2019s not that great! When she says \u201cwow\u201d, \u201cextraordinary\u201d, or \u201cthe best I\u2019ve ever had\u201d, you know you\u2019ve got a winner.</p> <h2>Claudine Boulstridge</h2> <p>When I met Yotam in 2007, I was teaching at <a href=\"https://www.leiths.com/\" title=\"\">Leiths School of Food and Wine</a>, where he also taught very popular classes on Saturdays. I didn\u2019t really know who he was; his Guardian column had only recently started. I guess I was in the right place at the right time. Twelve years on and I have tested the recipes in all his books. I don\u2019t test for anyone else.</p> <p>I grew up in the Middle East, so things like cardamom, allspice and za\u2019atar have always been familiar to me. Yotam\u2019s food is obviously a lot more than \u201cMiddle Eastern\u201d, but I do love using the ingredients with which he\u2019s become so associated.</p> <p>I definitely have the easiest job of his team; I get sent the near-perfect recipe every time. It\u2019s rare that the recipes don\u2019t work, but sometimes I\u2019ll say, \u201cIt\u2019s nice, but not amazing.\u201d Often my feedback is about minor things: if, say, something says it needs to be in the oven for 20 minutes \u201cuntil golden on top\u201d, and it isn\u2019t. My job is to be zealous about clarity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The method is brilliant, the portion size is perfect \u2013 but it\u2019s disgusting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have more than 200 spices in my cupboard. I love that my children get to see such a variety of foodstuffs on the kitchen counter, from jerusalem artichokes to okra. I have never cooked separate food for them, and thanks to Yotam they are adventurous; my youngest loves sardines, chicken livers, sauerkraut and curry, and the other morning I found the three of them fighting over a block of tamarind. They like to chew it for its sweet-sour taste.</p> <p>We don\u2019t eat Ottolenghi seven days a week; often I\u2019ll try to blitz a batch of recipes in a day and have people over that night. Before I gave birth to each child, I had been testing a Yotam recipe a few hours earlier. With my eldest, I mixed a pea fritter batter but didn\u2019t have time to cook it before going into labour. I put it in the fridge and we fried it the next day, when I got home from hospital. We have great fun with the spoils of my work, although I must admit there are low points, like having to eat garlic prawns or boozy trifle at 8am.

Hannah\u2019s value is in her brutal honesty; she\u2019s no-bullshit, and won\u2019t mince her words.

As a mother who is cooking on a budget, she has huge empathy for my readers and ensures the recipes deliver. I want people in the Outer Hebrides to be able to cook from them, and I find Hannah, who is based in Bath, to be a very good gauge of what\u2019s available nationally \u2013 it\u2019s easy for me to assume that certain ingredients are ubiquitous.

I\u2019m much more careful about how long I keep them for now, too \u2013 never longer than six months \u2013 and buy them whole, then roast and grind them myself.

      "bodyText": "Yotam Ottolenghi Before I started working with Claudine, I tested all my recipes myself. It became too much in 2007; I had started my Guardian column and was working on my first book. Claudine would come to my apartment every week and we\u2019d test together. That graduated to her testing from home in London, before she eventually moved to Wales. I have remained faithful to Claudine. She knows exactly what my expectations are \u2013 if something isn\u2019t exciting enough, she\u2019ll tell me it isn\u2019t very \u201cOttolenghi\u201d. We use that word a lot. In my test kitchen in London, we\u2019ll sometimes look to Claudine for final reassurance. She\u2019s very methodical, and never leaves a stone unturned, reminding us that we need to instruct people at home to do the things that I do on autopilot, like peeling a vegetable. These things need to be spelled out. Her move to rural Wales has been a strength: if she can get an ingredient there, it should be fine to include it. She lives near her Welsh in-laws, so the whole family plays a role in tasting. I get her three kids\u2019 feedback, her mother-in-law\u2019s, her neighbours\u2019. Our system is very thorough. First, my test kitchen team \u2013 Ixta and Noor \u2013 put a recipe through its paces, trying it on average three to four times. For things like bakes that involve more chemistry, it could be up to 10 times. Then it gets sent to Wales. If Claudine isn\u2019t happy, we reassess. The equipment you have at home can create such variation. We had an aubergine conundrum for years: while we were cooking it on the hob, Claudine used her grill, which caused way more evaporation, leaving her with half the weight of flesh that we had. I want to give readers all the information they need, as the last thing I want is for them to be disappointed. We now know what Claudine likes and doesn\u2019t. Anything with ricotta and broad beans is never very popular with her. Otherwise, she seems to like everything, which is why the stuff she\u2019s less keen on really stands out. When she says something is \u201cnice\u201d, it\u2019s not that great! When she says \u201cwow\u201d, \u201cextraordinary\u201d, or \u201cthe best I\u2019ve ever had\u201d, you know you\u2019ve got a winner. Claudine Boulstridge When I met Yotam in 2007, I was teaching at Leiths School of Food and Wine, where he also taught very popular classes on Saturdays. I didn\u2019t really know who he was; his Guardian column had only recently started. I guess I was in the right place at the right time. Twelve years on and I have tested the recipes in all his books. I don\u2019t test for anyone else. I grew up in the Middle East, so things like cardamom, allspice and za\u2019atar have always been familiar to me. Yotam\u2019s food is obviously a lot more than \u201cMiddle Eastern\u201d, but I do love using the ingredients with which he\u2019s become so associated. I definitely have the easiest job of his team; I get sent the near-perfect recipe every time. It\u2019s rare that the recipes don\u2019t work, but sometimes I\u2019ll say, \u201cIt\u2019s nice, but not amazing.\u201d Often my feedback is about minor things: if, say, something says it needs to be in the oven for 20 minutes \u201cuntil golden on top\u201d, and it isn\u2019t. My job is to be zealous about clarity. I have more than 200 spices in my cupboard. I love that my children get to see such a variety of foodstuffs on the kitchen counter, from jerusalem artichokes to okra. I have never cooked separate food for them, and thanks to Yotam they are adventurous; my youngest loves sardines, chicken livers, sauerkraut and curry, and the other morning I found the three of them fighting over a block of tamarind. They like to chew it for its sweet-sour taste. We don\u2019t eat Ottolenghi seven days a week; often I\u2019ll try to blitz a batch of recipes in a day and have people over that night. Before I gave birth to each child, I had been testing a Yotam recipe a few hours earlier. With my eldest, I mixed a pea fritter batter but didn\u2019t have time to cook it before going into labour. I put it in the fridge and we fried it the next day, when I got home from hospital. We have great fun with the spoils of my work, although I must admit there are low points, like having to eat garlic prawns or boozy trifle at 8am. There\u2019s also a constant stream of washing-up. I think Yotam has kept me on for 12 years because he likes my frankness. If I don\u2019t like something, I\u2019ll just say no, worded gently, of course. That said, the recipes have continued to get better over the years. I thought he\u2019d have run out of ideas by now, but he seems to have more than ever. Claudine\u2019s favourite Yotam recipe Lamb and hibiscus koftas: they are healthy, cheap, so soft and tasty, and quick to make. Meera Sodha In a recipe tester, I look for someone who\u2019s going to call me out if something doesn\u2019t work \u2013 if a method is too complicated, if the ingredients are too expensive, or if the finished result doesn\u2019t look beautiful. Hannah\u2019s value is in her brutal honesty; she\u2019s no-bullshit, and won\u2019t mince her words. Her feedback on a first rendition of beetroot halwa for my book was: \u201cThe method is brilliant, the portion size is perfect\u2026 but it\u2019s just so disgusting that I couldn\u2019t eat it.\u201d Hannah was the first person I saw when I walked through the door on my first day at Innocent Drinks, where I worked in marketing and communications. She was the office angel. She\u2019s intensely \u201cfoodie\u201d; her passion for cooking is very pure and her credentials speak for themselves \u2013 she has worked at the Waterside Inn in Bray and Bath\u2019s Bertinet Bakery, among others. When we were in our early 20s at Innocent, she and her now-husband Connor would prepare David Thompson\u2019s Thai curries from scratch \u2013 with homemade coconut milk! \u2013 while the rest of us scoffed chicken-shop chips after the pub. In spite of this, she\u2019s always fighting the home cook\u2019s corner. As a mother who is cooking on a budget, she has huge empathy for my readers and ensures the recipes deliver. I want people in the Outer Hebrides to be able to cook from them, and I find Hannah, who is based in Bath, to be a very good gauge of what\u2019s available nationally \u2013 it\u2019s easy for me to assume that certain ingredients are ubiquitous. She uses her local supermarket, ethnic shops and the internet to form a realistic picture. Hannah isn\u2019t a silent tester; she acts as a kind of creative partner. She\u2019ll send me pictures on WhatsApp in real time, and there\u2019ll be lots of to-ing and fro-ing on prepped veg, finished dishes, notes and comments. I love Hannah\u2019s determination and the pride she takes in everything working. There\u2019s a cardamom bun in my book Fresh India that she must have tested six times before she was happy. Hannah Cameron McKenna When Meera\u2019s book Made In India came out, I wasn\u2019t very au fait with Indian food and found the likes of Madhur Jaffrey quite complicated. But Meera is good at making things simple by being precise with her methodology. For example, she\u2019s very specific about seasoning: how much to use (not just \u201cto taste\u201d) and when to use it. I\u2019ve learned a huge amount about which spices (or combinations of them) to use.

My husband and kids love Meera\u2019s food, but by the end of one of her book projects, they\u2019ll ask for spag bol \u2013 I hope she doesn\u2019t mind me saying that! Hannah\u2019s favourite Meera recipe Hard to choose just one, but the vegan sweet potato and aubergine massaman curry is a firm family favourite. Anna Jones We met more than 10 years ago, while I was working as a stylist at Jamie Oliver. Em came in to do some work experience \u2013 she was a chef and wanted to move into styling \u2013 and she ended up staying on to assist me. A few years later, I left to go freelance and Em joined me, becoming my regular assistant and tester. We did everything from TV shows to editorial projects and books, including three for Antonio Carluccio. We\u2019ve developed incredibly similar tastes. It may not sound groundbreaking, but we both want every plate of food to be really well balanced; it\u2019s vital that we hit all the flavour notes of salty, sweet, acid, verdant and herbal, umami or richness from miso or garlic. We both have a tendency to finish a dish with a squeeze of citrus \u2013 lemons, limes, clementines, bergamots \u2013 and always want something with crunch, too. You can make a fairly average tomato soup, but add some delicious olive oil parmesan croutons or crispy onions, a herb oil, char half a lime to squeeze over, and throw some herbs on top, and suddenly it\u2019s transformed. That being said, we have our differences. Em cooks meat and fish, I don\u2019t; Em has specialities (she wrote a book on Korean food, which I know very little about); Em worked in Michelin-starred kitchens for much longer than I did \u2013 and all of this shows. Early in our partnership, when we were working on shoots together, I remember being struck by her patience. I\u2019m more slapdash, perhaps more reliant on instinct. Sometimes writing on your own is isolating, and I need a sounding board, someone to ask, \u201cWas adding saffron to this completely ridiculous?\u201d Quite often when I\u2019m stuck for ideas, I\u2019ll ring Em.

      "body": "<p>One of the 20th century\u2019s most remarkable radio broadcasts was made from rural Surrey on an evening in May 1924. Beatrice Harrison was a renowned cellist. (The composers Frederick Delius and Edward Elgar chose her as the soloist for their works.) Harrison liked to practise in the garden of her home, a converted Tudor barn near Oxted in Surrey and one evening, while playing Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s \u201cChant Hindou\u201d, she heard a nightingale echoing her cello with its song.</p> <p>When she told the BBC about her duets with the nightingale, a team was dispatched, armed with a new, highly sensitive microphone. Sure enough, shortly after 10.45pm, just 20 minutes before closedown, as Harrison played, the nightingale began to sing. The BBC cut away from its scheduled concert to broadcast live from Oxted, the sound being carried via her telephone line: \u201cFor 15 minutes the nation was spellbound by the extraordinary sonic combination of cello and nightingale.\u201d The response was unprecedented with the BBC receiving 50,000 letters from across Europe. It was, Charlie Connelly writes, \u201cone of the great radio and cultural moments of the century\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A collector of old radios, Connelly laments the impending switch-off of analogue radio</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Connelly\u2019s first radio appearance was in 1984 aged just 13, when together with a friend he attempted to serenade listeners to BBC Radio Kent\u2019s Rod Lucas Show down a telephone line with their version of \u201cPretty Little Angel Eyes\u201d by Showaddywaddy. Sadly Rod cut them off before they had got into their stride, but this was \u201cthe moment radio stopped being a passive experience\u201d for Connelly.

      "bodyText": "One of the 20th century\u2019s most remarkable radio broadcasts was made from rural Surrey on an evening in May 1924. Beatrice Harrison was a renowned cellist. (The composers Frederick Delius and Edward Elgar chose her as the soloist for their works.) Harrison liked to practise in the garden of her home, a converted Tudor barn near Oxted in Surrey and one evening, while playing Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s \u201cChant Hindou\u201d, she heard a nightingale echoing her cello with its song. When she told the BBC about her duets with the nightingale, a team was dispatched, armed with a new, highly sensitive microphone. Sure enough, shortly after 10.45pm, just 20 minutes before closedown, as Harrison played, the nightingale began to sing. The BBC cut away from its scheduled concert to broadcast live from Oxted, the sound being carried via her telephone line: \u201cFor 15 minutes the nation was spellbound by the extraordinary sonic combination of cello and nightingale.\u201d The response was unprecedented with the BBC receiving 50,000 letters from across Europe. It was, Charlie Connelly writes, \u201cone of the great radio and cultural moments of the century\u201d. Connelly\u2019s first radio appearance was in 1984 aged just 13, when together with a friend he attempted to serenade listeners to BBC Radio Kent\u2019s Rod Lucas Show down a telephone line with their version of \u201cPretty Little Angel Eyes\u201d by Showaddywaddy. Sadly Rod cut them off before they had got into their stride, but this was \u201cthe moment radio stopped being a passive experience\u201d for Connelly. Now a broadcaster in his own right and the author of a previous book on the shipping forecast, he proves to be an enthusiastic and entertaining guide to radio\u2019s history, personalities and hallowed sites. His book is a heartfelt and funny celebration, from the earliest broadcasts of musical performances, such as Dame Nellie Melba\u2019s at Chelmsford in 1920, the origins of radio comedy (The Goon Show was \u201cthe first piece of radio to exploit a generation gap\u201d), those unmistakable voices of the network, the announcers, such as Radio 4\u2019s Corrie Corfield (a \u201cmix of lullaby empathy and no\u2011nonsense head girl\u201d).

      "body": "<p>I wouldn\u2019t say it was extremely comforting when, seconds before my first attempt at cold-water swimming at my local pond, as I hovered near the steps, my skin chill against the air, the jovial lifeguard started to tell me about sudden-immersion syndrome. \u201cPeople can die, because they go into shock,\u201d she explained, eyes focused on something in the distant trees. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be fine. Just don\u2019t panic.\u201d</p> <p>In the summer, I jump into the pond with the enthusiasm of a labrador \u2013 ears flying, paws spread skywards. (This was especially the case during last summer\u2019s heatwave, two months of feeling conflicted \u2013 the utter joy of that slightly grassy smell of warm forearms, tempered by the fact that the planet is, well, screwed.) Summer swimming is all about the refreshing feel of hair slicked back from the forehead after hours of enduring a sticky, matted mess. Or the tessellating, shimmering patterns of light at the bottom of a hotel pool.</p> <p>Cold-water swimming is like being plugged into the mains; there is the sensation of a sedentary life spent looking at screens cracking wide open.

      "bodyText": "I wouldn\u2019t say it was extremely comforting when, seconds before my first attempt at cold-water swimming at my local pond, as I hovered near the steps, my skin chill against the air, the jovial lifeguard started to tell me about sudden-immersion syndrome. \u201cPeople can die, because they go into shock,\u201d she explained, eyes focused on something in the distant trees. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be fine. Just don\u2019t panic.\u201d In the summer, I jump into the pond with the enthusiasm of a labrador \u2013 ears flying, paws spread skywards. (This was especially the case during last summer\u2019s heatwave, two months of feeling conflicted \u2013 the utter joy of that slightly grassy smell of warm forearms, tempered by the fact that the planet is, well, screwed.) Summer swimming is all about the refreshing feel of hair slicked back from the forehead after hours of enduring a sticky, matted mess. Or the tessellating, shimmering patterns of light at the bottom of a hotel pool. Cold-water swimming is like being plugged into the mains; there is the sensation of a sedentary life spent looking at screens cracking wide open. It\u2019s a body slam-dunking in every department: heart, lungs, brain. The first time, I thought of Jack and Rose in Titanic, as she considers jumping overboard and he tries to talk her out of it: the water will \u201chit you like a thousand knives stabbing you all over your body\u201d.

      "body": "<p>People react kindly when I tell them I look after my folks, but things are not as selfless as they seem. I care, but I am also captive. When I first came home, temporarily I imagined, to help them through a difficult patch, I had a house, a marriage and some semblance of a career. That was more than 12 months ago. Then the work project that had absorbed the previous two years and all my money came to nothing, my relationship collapsed, and there was a further decline in my parents\u2019 health. Which is more or less how I found myself back in a room and a town I left in the late 80s, caring for people in their late 80s. My siblings work and I am the best person for the job, in part since I have nowhere else to go.</p> <p>Except sometimes out for lunch.</p> <p>On one such day, Dad, 87, feels like leaving the house. This should be a cause for celebration. It\u2019s been weeks. Whether he should be behind the wheel remains a conversation for another day.</p> <p>My mother, 89, is fitter and more gregarious than my father and for her to be laid up is the exception. Shingles is keeping her inside. A visit from the cleaner means she won\u2019t be alone, but I nevertheless glance up at her window as we leave. Dad catches his breath in whatever is left of his lungs and swings the motor around. I think about learning to drive; I\u2019ve been meaning to do it for 30 years. I had been meaning to do a lot of things. Pushing 50 and moving back in with my parents wasn\u2019t among them.</p> <p>On the road, Dad is transformed. I\u2019m happy to see him doing something well and enjoying it. It can take him breathless minutes just to open a letter. As we leave town I alternate between memories of childhood drives and panic over what I should do if he were to fall ill at the wheel.</p> <p>Dad parks directly outside the front door of the pub. His disabled badge allows him this and, despite any number of available disabled spaces nearby, this is now what he does wherever he goes. The blue badge bandit: he\u2019s here and he\u2019s hungry and he\u2019s blocking your door.</p> <p>The owner seats us by a roaring fire. Dad seems pleased. Since midsummer, my parents have never quite been warm enough. This would probably still be the case if they moved to a smaller, more modern house at the heart of the sun. He devours a plate of scallops, tells me he doesn\u2019t feel so good, then, as though struck by a bullet, he collapses.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now everything spoken is yelled. 'Your parents fight,' a neighbour says, sadly. No, I explain, that\u2019s just them talking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I get behind him and support him in a way that feels therapeutic but more closely resembles a full nelson. I signal to the owner to call an ambulance, ignore the stares of our fellow diners and ask plaintively in the old man\u2019s ear if he\u2019s all right, if he can hear me. Nothing.</p> <p>I consider that if he has snuffed it, then this is not a bad way to go. Scallops, driving, pubs and fires. For what had threatened to be a long and perhaps undignified decline to have halted abruptly is no tragedy.</p> <p>A paramedic arrives and we place my father across three chairs, like an extra in a stage illusion in which the seats will be removed, and leave him suspended. Instead, an earthlier miracle: with his feet higher than his heart, my father revives.</p> <p>\u201cOld people by the fire,\u201d says the paramedic. \u201cBlood pressure plummets, they faint.\u201d</p> <p>Dad pukes so loudly the whole restaurant comes to a standstill.</p> <p>\u201cNot uncommon,\u201d assures the paramedic.</p> <p>\u201cWhat shall I do with your lunch?\u201d asks the pub landlord. I tell him I\u2019ll eat mine. Death is inevitable, yet it remains a sin to waste food.</p> <p>The paramedic asks how we\u2019ll be getting home. \u201cI guess he shouldn\u2019t be driving?\u201d The paramedic shakes his head. Cab then. Cabs from now on, maybe. If we ever go out again. </p> <p>***</p> <p>Back at home, our mostly demure and deferential household has been remixed by old age into a free-fire zone of profanity, fluids and flatulence. For years the most you would have heard here was a yawn. Now everything spoken is yelled, and the body\u2019s once repressed and managed language has become the rasping, retching lingua franca. I have witnessed symphonies of farts that have lasted longer than many of our conversations, and simple conversations conducted at operatic volume, then repeated until there can be no doubt that it is Monday, or Tuesday, that yes Mum has her hearing aids in, or whatever else has been misheard or mis-said.</p> <p>\u201cYour parents fight,\u201d one of the neighbours says to me, sadly. No, I explain, that\u2019s just them talking. Or maybe just one of them on the phone.</p> <p>The centre of this sonic confusion is the kitchen. Nutrition, medication, laundry \u2013 it all happens here. Adjoining it is a small bathroom, which adds to the fun. Although separated by double doors, my father is insistent on leaving these open (driven, according to my sister, by a fear of dying on the toilet like Elvis). This means that, to all intents and purposes, and certainly in terms of sound, the toilet is in the kitchen, too.</p> <p>I have a lot of time for that small downstairs bathroom. As a teenager, it was there that I first confronted my reflection having lost my virginity. And it was there, not long afterwards, that I watched the nascent stubble on my face appear to wave and ripple as I struggled with my first hit of LSD.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have found it useful to remember that one day, soon, there will be nothing to argue about and no one to argue with</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The tiny mirror that bore witness to these adolescent milestones is also a favourite of my father\u2019s. He likes to bring it with him when he goes to hospital, so he can inspect the latest indignities that time has inflicted on his scalp and face. \u201cWhy does he need it?\u201d Mum will hiss on finding it gone again. I have tried giving him a different mirror, but he pines for the original.</p> <p>The mirror business, like so many other seemingly innocuous things that, in a younger household might submit to logic, will run and run. I have found it useful, when considering if and how to intervene in the everyday contretemps that permeate my parents\u2019 60-year marriage, to remember that one day, soon, there will be nothing to argue about and no one to argue with.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the downstairs bathroom throws back vengeful echoes of my youthful escapades. On a good day, this means nothing more than Dad paying one of his catheter-emptying visits every hour or so. On less fortunate occasions, incontinence strikes and the scenes then are somewhere on the margins of agriculture, protest and performance art.</p> <p>It is a very small space in which to operate, particularly when one must work around the victim of the latest indignity. Over time we have discovered that best practice is for the sufferer to remain where they are until the first stages of clean up are done. As I snap on another pair of nitrile gloves (and if there is a single invention that makes all these things bearable, it is a box of nitrile gloves) I reflect that there is something to be said for a family that has entered a post-embarrassment culture. In the room of furtive reflections, we finally have nothing to hide.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Downtime becomes so scarce that sometimes, between errands, I just stand still. I am doing this in the hall, a liminal space between the possible future of the dining room (where I gaze at the internet) and the presenting past of my bedroom (where I sift through drawers of adolescent tat) when my father calls me into his lair, the living room (as hot as Saudi Arabia, but with stricter rules about what\u2019s on television).</p> <p>\u201cJeff Bezos,\u201d announces Dad admiringly, \u201crichest man in the world!\u201d He leans forward from the chair in which he will spend the rest of the day and perhaps his life and offers me the paper. I refuse it, saying \u201cI know\u201d and immediately dislike myself for doing so.</p> <p>Dad seems hurt that I don\u2019t want to read about Bezos and his money, but it\u2019s because I am beginning to get a sense of just how much of Bezos\u2019s money was once my father\u2019s.</p> <p>Though he loves an entrepreneur, my father hails from a vanished land of unionised labour and pensions. The same pension that keeps the house at the approximate temperature of the palm house at Kew all year round ensures a steady stream of Bezos\u2019 foot soldiers to our door.</p> <p>From the absurd: a single bottle of lemonade (Me: \u201cI go to the shops!\u201d Him: \u201cI was thirsty.\u201d); to the absurdly wrapped: a walking stick packaged like a running machine; to the poignant succession of balms, salves and medical ephemera, the deliveries form a steady, cardboard tide.</p> <p>Despite a flurry of Amazon-related gags \u2013 \u201cAll this comes from South America?\u201d \u2013 Mum has relapsed into mostly quiet annoyance as my father stirs the world to pointless action from his chair. Having shopped for us all, and then just him till she was no longer able, her awareness of the cause and effect chain behind bringing something to the table is keener than his will ever be. That he has in his dotage secured a mastery of technology that effectively cuts her out of the loop forms but another strand in the bonds and resentments that sustain them.</p> <p>Though I am my mother\u2019s natural ally, I get where the old man is coming from. As he stabs at his screen, I wonder how much he and men of a similar age and circumstance, the tail enders of 20th-century masculinity, have contributed to Bezos\u2019s billions? Shorn of your faculties, it must be something to have the power to summon protein and so much more.</p> <p>My father\u2019s gout worsens, swelling his already swollen feet until no slipper can fit. Amazon, naturally, is the preferred solution. And so, to the existing flow, there comes a rush of couriers, bringing slippers of increasing width to test against his feet. None of which fit, and so there is an ebbtide of returns, until the pantomime \u201cGouterella\u201d concludes with the arrival of a Velcro-flapped pair broad enough to set sail in.</p> <p>The joy is short-lived as, days later, an abscess on one of his toes explodes.</p> <p>You think you have conquered certain fears, but life has a way of finding us out. I felt I could clean up anything, but what emerges and keeps emerging from the burst and gouty \u201ctophus\u201d takes me to the limits of repulsion. Dad refuses to go to hospital. The abscess, mine to drain and dress in the meantime, refuses to respond to antibiotics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/12/i-met-the-man-who-murdered-my-identical-twin\">I met the man who murdered my identical twin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stalemate (and things are much more stale than matey at this point) is broken when a district nurse arrives and somehow whispers my father into hospital. As she does paperwork at the kitchen table, while ignoring calls from her supervisor to get on to the next job, she asks me how I am. The entire construct of my coping collapses and I find myself fighting back tears. She nods, as though my inner fiction was as obvious and unsustainable as the foul state of my father\u2019s toe.</p> <p>Dad, though, is resolutely of the \u201conce you go in, you\u2019ll never come out\u201d school of thought. I point out he has been in and made it home four times this year. He has had more comebacks than Elvis, even if he doesn\u2019t want to die like him.</p> <p>In his absence, the Amazon deliveries keep coming, fewer each day. Then one day, nothing. I balance them into a pile, a cairn of crap upon his chair. I prise open the window in the living room and breathe in the cold. For the respite of every hospital admission, there is (one hopes, mostly) a discharge. But then we must adapt and learn our world all over again. When it\u2019s hard just to keep things stable, even progress can feel like a kick in the teeth. Mum makes it downstairs and asks me what will happen next. It has been a long time since I could answer that question. All we can say is, something will.</p> <p>\u2022 The author blogs at <a href=\"https://reluctantcarer.com/\" title=\"\">reluctantcarer.com</a></p> <p>If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

As I snap on another pair of nitrile gloves (and if there is a single invention that makes all these things bearable, it is a box of nitrile gloves) I reflect that there is something to be said for a family that has entered a post-embarrassment culture. In the room of furtive reflections, we finally have nothing to hide. *** Downtime becomes so scarce that sometimes, between errands, I just stand still. I am doing this in the hall, a liminal space between the possible future of the dining room (where I gaze at the internet) and the presenting past of my bedroom (where I sift through drawers of adolescent tat) when my father calls me into his lair, the living room (as hot as Saudi Arabia, but with stricter rules about what\u2019s on television). \u201cJeff Bezos,\u201d announces Dad admiringly, \u201crichest man in the world!\u201d He leans forward from the chair in which he will spend the rest of the day and perhaps his life and offers me the paper. I refuse it, saying \u201cI know\u201d and immediately dislike myself for doing so. Dad seems hurt that I don\u2019t want to read about Bezos and his money, but it\u2019s because I am beginning to get a sense of just how much of Bezos\u2019s money was once my father\u2019s. Though he loves an entrepreneur, my father hails from a vanished land of unionised labour and pensions. The same pension that keeps the house at the approximate temperature of the palm house at Kew all year round ensures a steady stream of Bezos\u2019 foot soldiers to our door. From the absurd: a single bottle of lemonade (Me: \u201cI go to the shops!\u201d Him: \u201cI was thirsty.\u201d); to the absurdly wrapped: a walking stick packaged like a running machine; to the poignant succession of balms, salves and medical ephemera, the deliveries form a steady, cardboard tide. Despite a flurry of Amazon-related gags \u2013 \u201cAll this comes from South America?\u201d \u2013 Mum has relapsed into mostly quiet annoyance as my father stirs the world to pointless action from his chair. Having shopped for us all, and then just him till she was no longer able, her awareness of the cause and effect chain behind bringing something to the table is keener than his will ever be. That he has in his dotage secured a mastery of technology that effectively cuts her out of the loop forms but another strand in the bonds and resentments that sustain them. Though I am my mother\u2019s natural ally, I get where the old man is coming from. As he stabs at his screen, I wonder how much he and men of a similar age and circumstance, the tail enders of 20th-century masculinity, have contributed to Bezos\u2019s billions? Shorn of your faculties, it must be something to have the power to summon protein and so much more. My father\u2019s gout worsens, swelling his already swollen feet until no slipper can fit. Amazon, naturally, is the preferred solution. And so, to the existing flow, there comes a rush of couriers, bringing slippers of increasing width to test against his feet. None of which fit, and so there is an ebbtide of returns, until the pantomime \u201cGouterella\u201d concludes with the arrival of a Velcro-flapped pair broad enough to set sail in. The joy is short-lived as, days later, an abscess on one of his toes explodes. You think you have conquered certain fears, but life has a way of finding us out. I felt I could clean up anything, but what emerges and keeps emerging from the burst and gouty \u201ctophus\u201d takes me to the limits of repulsion. Dad refuses to go to hospital. The abscess, mine to drain and dress in the meantime, refuses to respond to antibiotics. The stalemate (and things are much more stale than matey at this point) is broken when a district nurse arrives and somehow whispers my father into hospital. As she does paperwork at the kitchen table, while ignoring calls from her supervisor to get on to the next job, she asks me how I am. The entire construct of my coping collapses and I find myself fighting back tears. She nods, as though my inner fiction was as obvious and unsustainable as the foul state of my father\u2019s toe. Dad, though, is resolutely of the \u201conce you go in, you\u2019ll never come out\u201d school of thought. I point out he has been in and made it home four times this year. He has had more comebacks than Elvis, even if he doesn\u2019t want to die like him. In his absence, the Amazon deliveries keep coming, fewer each day. Then one day, nothing. I balance them into a pile, a cairn of crap upon his chair. I prise open the window in the living room and breathe in the cold. For the respite of every hospital admission, there is (one hopes, mostly) a discharge. But then we must adapt and learn our world all over again. When it\u2019s hard just to keep things stable, even progress can feel like a kick in the teeth. Mum makes it downstairs and asks me what will happen next. It has been a long time since I could answer that question. All we can say is, something will. \u2022 The author blogs at reluctantcarer.com If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold on the Wall.\u201d What kind of story might be signalled by such an opening sentence? An adventure set in Roman Britain, perhaps \u2013 something by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2018/dec/25/neil-gaiman-on-rudyard-kiplings-the-gardener-books-podcast\" title=\"\">Rudyard Kipling </a>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/02/eagle-of-the-ninth-rosemary-sutcliff\" title=\"\">Rosemary Sutcliff</a>, complete with centurions and mists over northern crags. Or a fable of the sort that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/23/caspar-henderson-rereading-jorge-luis-borges\" title=\"\">Jorge Luis Borges</a> or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/13/short-story-survey-italo-calvino\" title=\"\"> Italo Calvino</a> might have written: a sombre meditation on the correlation between civilisation and frontier systems, composed in the voice of a Confucian scholar exiled to the steppes, plangent with echoes of Chinese poetry. Most obviously, in 2019 any mention of a chilly wall with a capital W is bound to conjure up images of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/06/twenty-years-of-game-of-thrones-how-well-do-you-know-the-book-quiz\" title=\"\">George RR Martin\u2019s Night\u2019s Watch</a>, standing guard amid the snows of northernmost Westeros. Historical fiction, fable, fantasy: the wall is an image potent enough to serve the needs of an entire range of genres.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-lanchester\" title=\"\">John Lanchester</a>, in the first pages of his new novel, makes knowing play with this. It is not immediately clear where his wall is, nor why it should be so cold. A mention of trains and lorries is soon a signpost that we are not on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/09/hadrians-wall-lost-secrets-roman-vindolanda-unearthed\" title=\"\">Hadrian\u2019s Wall</a>, but beyond that the setting remains opaque. There are Captains, there are Sergeants, there are Corporals. Our narrator, it gradually emerges, is a man called Kavanagh, sent to the Wall for an obligatory two-year term of service. As a Defender, his duty is to stare out to sea, and keep watch for people referred to only as Others. Much hangs on his ability to spot them: for every Other who makes it across the Wall, a Defender will be expelled from the country, put out to sea on a boat. The ominous sense of jeopardy that this establishes hangs like a shadow over the entire book.</p> <p>At this point in my review, however, I should issue a caveat. Even to write what I have written risks dissipating for readers the sense of dislocation that I \u2013 not having read any pre-publicity \u2013 felt as it gradually dawned on me what the setting for the novel actually was. Those who would like to share in the experience are strongly advised to look away now. Or perhaps, in the wake of a new year when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/03/britain-migrant-crisis-sajid-javid-hypocrisy\" title=\"\">home secretary proclaimed a state of crisis</a> after a few Iranians had tried to cross the Channel in dinghies, readers will already have guessed. Kavanagh, Lanchester lets slip, is serving on a stretch of the Wall called \u201cIlfracombe 4\u201d. Clearly, he has been posted to Devon. Later, he is transferred to Scotland. The Wall, it turns out, is a great mass of concrete that girds the entire coastline of Great Britain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c4d8f4274b258c06829eb33b06b6af0611d5a0b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4d8f4274b258c06829eb33b06b6af0611d5a0b0/1446_1612_2220_1902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Lanchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lanchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This, as the clock ticks busily down to Brexit, might seem a pointed and timely satire. Lanchester, however, is not writing as a satirist; his ambitions are altogether more dystopian. Like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/13/hg-wells-visions-of-the-future-remain-unsurpassed\" title=\"\">The Time Machine</a> </em>or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/18/nineteen-eighty-four-george-orwell-will-self-ludicrous-essential-truth\" title=\"\">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></em>, <em>The Wall</em> packs its punch by extrapolating a terrifying future from present trends. As HG Wells did in <em>The Time Machine</em>, Lanchester portrays a world divided into two classes of people: those who still enjoy a modicum of civilisation, and those who have been excluded from it. As George Orwell did in <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, he portrays a Britain in which rights and liberties have been sacrificed for reasons that seem all too chillingly plausible.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s cold on the Wall.\u201d What kind of story might be signalled by such an opening sentence? An adventure set in Roman Britain, perhaps \u2013 something by Rudyard Kipling or Rosemary Sutcliff, complete with centurions and mists over northern crags. Or a fable of the sort that Jorge Luis Borges or Italo Calvino might have written: a sombre meditation on the correlation between civilisation and frontier systems, composed in the voice of a Confucian scholar exiled to the steppes, plangent with echoes of Chinese poetry. Most obviously, in 2019 any mention of a chilly wall with a capital W is bound to conjure up images of George RR Martin\u2019s Night\u2019s Watch, standing guard amid the snows of northernmost Westeros. Historical fiction, fable, fantasy: the wall is an image potent enough to serve the needs of an entire range of genres. John Lanchester, in the first pages of his new novel, makes knowing play with this. It is not immediately clear where his wall is, nor why it should be so cold. A mention of trains and lorries is soon a signpost that we are not on Hadrian\u2019s Wall, but beyond that the setting remains opaque. There are Captains, there are Sergeants, there are Corporals. Our narrator, it gradually emerges, is a man called Kavanagh, sent to the Wall for an obligatory two-year term of service. As a Defender, his duty is to stare out to sea, and keep watch for people referred to only as Others. Much hangs on his ability to spot them: for every Other who makes it across the Wall, a Defender will be expelled from the country, put out to sea on a boat. The ominous sense of jeopardy that this establishes hangs like a shadow over the entire book. At this point in my review, however, I should issue a caveat. Even to write what I have written risks dissipating for readers the sense of dislocation that I \u2013 not having read any pre-publicity \u2013 felt as it gradually dawned on me what the setting for the novel actually was. Those who would like to share in the experience are strongly advised to look away now. Or perhaps, in the wake of a new year when the home secretary proclaimed a state of crisis after a few Iranians had tried to cross the Channel in dinghies, readers will already have guessed. Kavanagh, Lanchester lets slip, is serving on a stretch of the Wall called \u201cIlfracombe 4\u201d. Clearly, he has been posted to Devon. Later, he is transferred to Scotland. The Wall, it turns out, is a great mass of concrete that girds the entire coastline of Great Britain. This, as the clock ticks busily down to Brexit, might seem a pointed and timely satire. Lanchester, however, is not writing as a satirist; his ambitions are altogether more dystopian. Like The Time Machine or Nineteen Eighty-Four, The Wall packs its punch by extrapolating a terrifying future from present trends. As HG Wells did in The Time Machine, Lanchester portrays a world divided into two classes of people: those who still enjoy a modicum of civilisation, and those who have been excluded from it. As George Orwell did in Nineteen Eighty-Four, he portrays a Britain in which rights and liberties have been sacrificed for reasons that seem all too chillingly plausible. Lanchester\u2019s horizons, though, are not merely British. No country \u2013 not even one immured behind concrete \u2013 is an island entire of itself. If The Wall is only incidentally a satire on Britain\u2019s current political crisis, then that is because, viewed through the prism of Lanchester\u2019s dystopian vision, Brexit itself is bound to appear incidental. Kavanagh, gazing out to sea on the north Devon coast, knows perfectly well why he has to serve his time as a Defender. \u201cOccasionally there would be some big-picture news about crops failing or countries breaking down or coordination between rich countries, or some other emerging detail of the new world we were occupying since the Change.\u201d What has happened is evident from the besetting cold and the fact that Britain appears to have lost 2,000 miles of its coastline. The ice caps have melted; the Gulf Stream has switched; sitting on sandy beaches has become a thing of the past. While in Britain much has been preserved from the ruin \u2013 there is still public transport, pubs are still open, people still go on holiday to the Lake District \u2013 elsewhere the effects of the \u201cChange\u201d have been more devastating. The whole world is on the move. \u201cThe Others are coming\u201d: so a government official, visiting a training camp, warns Kavanagh and his fellow Defenders. \u201cWe have had years of relative peace and calm, but that time is now over. You will be busy.\u201d The Wall, then \u2013 for all its obvious echoes of Donald Trump and his own wall, of Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his barbed wire fences, of Matteo Salvini and his refusal to allow ships carrying migrants into Italian ports \u2013 is ultimately no more focused on immigration than it is on Brexit.

      "body": "<p>When I was 17, I decided that I\u2019d had enough of being heavier than most of my school friends, and promptly took the decision to limit myself to 1,000 calories a day. Not just that \u2013 I dragged the ancient, rickety exercise bike up from our garage and into my bedroom, positioned it directly in front of my tiny TV, and every day after school I would cycle as fast as I could for the duration of The Simpsons, followed by Malcolm In The Middle on BBC2 (arguably the most perfect hour of television ever curated).</p> <p>I convinced myself that, for the first time, I was taking care of myself. Friends and teachers commented on my drastic weight loss, impressed, and so I knew I must be doing something right. Had it been a commonly used term in 2008, I\u2019d probably have deemed it \u201cself-care\u201d.</p> <p>Much has been written on the subject of self-care, and what truly counts as such; one woman\u2019s double gin and tonic is another woman\u2019s culturally appropriated yoga retreat. But I am neither of those women. (In fact, I\u2019ve muted them both on Instagram.) For me, it\u2019s defined as looking after number one, when it seems like nobody else is.</p> <p>At school, this was born of insecurity and a desire to fit in, but at university, my self-care evolved into a form of self-preservation. University was fun in many ways \u2013 new people, a new town, a bigger Vodka Revs bar. But my three years there also involved navigating a cacophony of questions such as, \u201cBut why isn\u2019t there a White History Month? Like, genuinely? I just wanna know?\u201d I was often the only black woman in the room, and didn\u2019t want to let the side down by not giving an answer that was intelligent enough. Simultaneously, I wanted to be fun. I wanted to be a comedian! I wanted you to fancy me! So I couldn\u2019t be the one who was the most easily offended, the \u201cangry black woman\u201d who would argue that it really wasn\u2019t on to black up just because you were going as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Jay_Okocha\" title=\"\">Jay-Jay Okocha </a>to the student union fancy dress night.</p> <p>Instead I rolled my eyes, laughed it off, didn\u2019t engage. It\u2019s almost impossible to stand up even to hipster racism (disguised as banter from close friends who \u201caren\u2019t really racist\u201d) when you don\u2019t have the language. Terms such as \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d and \u201cwhite privilege\u201d came into my vocabulary later; Solange wouldn\u2019t release <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTtrnDbOQAU\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t Touch My Hair</a> for another five years.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until a few years ago, when I was going through old Facebook pictures with a friend, and happened upon a photo of a monkey at a zoo that had been tagged as me by an old housemate, that I realised I\u2019d normalised so much racism. And so my approach to self-care evolved. Every way in which I\u2019d been wronged came flooding back, and I felt I owed myself a treat in recompense. It was as if I\u2019d realised I\u2019d paid way too much tax, and was giving myself a rebate \u2013 only in wine, chocolate, a new denim jacket when I already owned four of them.</p> <p>For years, I cashed in on this urge to replenish the kindness I hadn\u2019t shown myself for so long. Did I remember being excitedly told by a date that he had \u201cnever slept with a black girl before\u201d? That cake\u2019s got my name on it! Did I recall the guy on my course who told me he didn\u2019t apply to any London universities because there were \u201ctoo many black people\u201d? I should definitely have that third glass of red. All those times a sentence started with the phrase, \u201cI\u2019m just playing devil\u2019s advocate here\u2026\u201d ? Have a fourth! A fifth!</p> <p>It was fun, but let\u2019s face it, fairly unsustainable. It\u2019s not that treating myself was wrong in any way. But even cake doesn\u2019t taste quite so good when consumed in silent, bitter defiance. It\u2019s taken a while for me to realise that calling out prejudice is actually a much more rewarding form of self-care than buying a jumpsuit on Asos that I will immediately return (though each to their own, of course).</p> <p>My friends wonder how I have the patience to engage with people on Twitter about topics such as diversity and why black British history should be taught in schools: surely it\u2019s exhausting? And they\u2019re right. But I feel I <em>need</em> to: now that I can articulate where I\u2019m coming from, I have the armour to dive right in.</p> <p>This year, I\u2019m focusing on finding the right balance: between treats and discipline, self-preservation and self-confidence. So this #selfcaresunday, you\u2019ll find me back in front of The Simpsons. I\u2019ll have swapped the exercise bike for a glass of wine, and I\u2019ll likely be launching into a discussion with strangers on the internet about The Problem With Apu. Each to their own, after all.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Lolly Adefope is a comedian and actor.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When I was 17, I decided that I\u2019d had enough of being heavier than most of my school friends, and promptly took the decision to limit myself to 1,000 calories a day. Not just that \u2013 I dragged the ancient, rickety exercise bike up from our garage and into my bedroom, positioned it directly in front of my tiny TV, and every day after school I would cycle as fast as I could for the duration of The Simpsons, followed by Malcolm In The Middle on BBC2 (arguably the most perfect hour of television ever curated). I convinced myself that, for the first time, I was taking care of myself. Friends and teachers commented on my drastic weight loss, impressed, and so I knew I must be doing something right. Had it been a commonly used term in 2008, I\u2019d probably have deemed it \u201cself-care\u201d. Much has been written on the subject of self-care, and what truly counts as such; one woman\u2019s double gin and tonic is another woman\u2019s culturally appropriated yoga retreat. But I am neither of those women. (In fact, I\u2019ve muted them both on Instagram.) For me, it\u2019s defined as looking after number one, when it seems like nobody else is. At school, this was born of insecurity and a desire to fit in, but at university, my self-care evolved into a form of self-preservation. University was fun in many ways \u2013 new people, a new town, a bigger Vodka Revs bar. But my three years there also involved navigating a cacophony of questions such as, \u201cBut why isn\u2019t there a White History Month? Like, genuinely? I just wanna know?\u201d I was often the only black woman in the room, and didn\u2019t want to let the side down by not giving an answer that was intelligent enough. Simultaneously, I wanted to be fun. I wanted to be a comedian! I wanted you to fancy me! So I couldn\u2019t be the one who was the most easily offended, the \u201cangry black woman\u201d who would argue that it really wasn\u2019t on to black up just because you were going as Jay-Jay Okocha to the student union fancy dress night. Instead I rolled my eyes, laughed it off, didn\u2019t engage. It\u2019s almost impossible to stand up even to hipster racism (disguised as banter from close friends who \u201caren\u2019t really racist\u201d) when you don\u2019t have the language. Terms such as \u201cmicroaggressions\u201d and \u201cwhite privilege\u201d came into my vocabulary later; Solange wouldn\u2019t release Don\u2019t Touch My Hair for another five years. It wasn\u2019t until a few years ago, when I was going through old Facebook pictures with a friend, and happened upon a photo of a monkey at a zoo that had been tagged as me by an old housemate, that I realised I\u2019d normalised so much racism. And so my approach to self-care evolved. Every way in which I\u2019d been wronged came flooding back, and I felt I owed myself a treat in recompense. It was as if I\u2019d realised I\u2019d paid way too much tax, and was giving myself a rebate \u2013 only in wine, chocolate, a new denim jacket when I already owned four of them. For years, I cashed in on this urge to replenish the kindness I hadn\u2019t shown myself for so long. Did I remember being excitedly told by a date that he had \u201cnever slept with a black girl before\u201d? That cake\u2019s got my name on it! Did I recall the guy on my course who told me he didn\u2019t apply to any London universities because there were \u201ctoo many black people\u201d? I should definitely have that third glass of red. All those times a sentence started with the phrase, \u201cI\u2019m just playing devil\u2019s advocate here\u2026\u201d ? Have a fourth! A fifth! It was fun, but let\u2019s face it, fairly unsustainable. It\u2019s not that treating myself was wrong in any way. But even cake doesn\u2019t taste quite so good when consumed in silent, bitter defiance. It\u2019s taken a while for me to realise that calling out prejudice is actually a much more rewarding form of self-care than buying a jumpsuit on Asos that I will immediately return (though each to their own, of course). My friends wonder how I have the patience to engage with people on Twitter about topics such as diversity and why black British history should be taught in schools: surely it\u2019s exhausting? And they\u2019re right. But I feel I need to: now that I can articulate where I\u2019m coming from, I have the armour to dive right in. This year, I\u2019m focusing on finding the right balance: between treats and discipline, self-preservation and self-confidence. So this #selfcaresunday, you\u2019ll find me back in front of The Simpsons. I\u2019ll have swapped the exercise bike for a glass of wine, and I\u2019ll likely be launching into a discussion with strangers on the internet about The Problem With Apu. Each to their own, after all. \u2022 Lolly Adefope is a comedian and actor.",

So I wrote the book.\u201d</p> <p>Yousafzai\u2019s story \u2013 shot by the Taliban in Peshawar in 2012, when she was 15, for speaking out for the rights of girls to go to school \u2013 is surely one of the best known in the world today, and was recounted in the international bestseller <em>I Am Malala</em>, written with the journalist Christina Lamb. As she tells it, in the comfort of a discreetly guarded London hotel room, one minute she was on the school bus with her friends talking about the following day\u2019s exams, the next she was \u201copening my eyes in this hospital in Birmingham and people were speaking in English\u201d. She was deaf in one ear and the left side of her face was badly damaged where the bullet had narrowly missed her eye, but she was lucky to be alive.</p> <p>After she recovered, rather than retreating into anonymity and GCSEs, she stepped up to a role as a global ambassador for female education. On her 16th birthday in July 2013 she gave an address to the UN, which declared the event \u201cMalala Day\u201d, and she appeared on the cover of that <a href=\"http://time.com/4129580/\" title=\"\">year\u2019s Time magazine\u2019s</a> 100 Most Influential People in the World issue (she was on the list three years running). She has joined the ranks of those so famous they are called only by their first names, and is herself on first-name terms with politicians and celebrities (\u201cAngelina was the highlight\u201d). Not to mention being awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2014. Here was a remarkable story and a young woman the world could celebrate \u2013 Malala, a sort of modern-day saint. But, on the dull January morning that we meet, this chatty 21-year-old Oxford undergraduate, in a bright pink headscarf and tunic, seems to have her feet firmly on the ground, albeit in a pair of impressively high heels for 10am. The only external sign of her injuries is a slightly lopsided smile, which she gives often.</p> <p>If there has been criticism, or cynicism, directed towards Yousafzai (in Pakistan there has been a great deal, even including <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/\" title=\"\">theories</a> suggesting she faked being shot), it is in the idea that she is in some way a creation \u2013 of the west, of her father, the education activist Ziauddin Yousafzai, of the media. Others complain that she has been absorbing too much attention (she was accused on social media, she says in <em>I Am Malala</em>, of having \u201ca teen lust for fame\u201d) when so many young Pakistanis, and children around the world, have suffered. So it is fitting that in her first big project since receiving the Nobel (which she likens to being \u201cin a car, rather than a bike\u201d in terms of the reach of her activism), she uses her name to make known those of others \u2013 Zaynab, Muzoon, Najla \u2013 who might otherwise have been ignored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24694e483469e6c7715cb5fe318f1ef5172263b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24694e483469e6c7715cb5fe318f1ef5172263b5/0_1715_4000_4285/933.jpg\" alt=\"Marie-Claire and Najla We Are Displaced, New York UN general assembly.\" width=\"933\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marie-Claire and Najla, contributors to We Are Displaced, in New York to address the UN general assembly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tess Thomas/ Courtesy of Malala Fund</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the US government in shutdown over Donald Trump\u2019s wall, the ongoing \u201cmigrant crisis\u201d in Europe and the endless Brexit debates, the issue of immigration is rarely out of the headlines. But, as Yousafzai says, it is all too easy to forget the individual suffering, something that was brought tragically into focus after the body of Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi washed up on the Greek island of Cos in 2015. Yet as migration figures have grown higher, the ugly rhetoric both in the UK and the US has hardened. As Yousafzai points out, \u201c90% of the refugees\u201d are hosted by developing countries. \u201cSo we need to realise who is actually carrying the burden.\u201d <em>We Are Displaced</em>, co-written with New York journalist Liz Welch, is intended \u201cas a reminder to the world\u201d.</p> <p>She began work on it more than five years ago in the Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, which she was visiting as part of her Malala Fund for girls\u2019 education. It was not possible for Yousafzai to meet all of the women in person, such as Ajida, a young mother from Rohingya, but she felt it was important to include the crisis in Myanmar. While we are sadly all too familiar with the humanitarian catastrophes of Syria and Iraq, she wanted to draw attention to the fact \u201cthat this is happening literally in every corner of the world. It\u2019s happening in Latin America, it\u2019s happening in south-east Asia, it\u2019s happening in south Asia, it\u2019s happening in most parts of Africa.\u201d She wanted to show \u201chow big and broad this issue is\u201d.</p> <p>While she says it is hard to single out one story, the ordeal endured by Marie Claire \u2013 whose family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo when she was nine, only for her mother to be murdered in front of her by an anti-refugee hate mob in Zambia \u2013 is impossible to forget. When she was 16, Marie Claire received news that the visa for which her mother had applied 10 years earlier had finally been accepted: the family were moving to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, \u201cthe refugee capital\u201d of the United States. On 16 June 2016, when she was 19, she graduated from high school, the first person in her family ever to do so. \u201cMy heart was full and cracked at once,\u201d she writes. \u201cThis was my mother\u2019s dream, too. She should have been here to experience it with me.\u201d</p> <p>In the story of 16-year-old Sabreen, forced to leave Yemen and then Egypt, we learn what it really means to try to cross the Mediterranean in an overcrowded fishing boat, and in the plight of Guatemalan orphan Analisa, held in the detention centres, known as the \u201cice box\u201d and the \u201cdog pound\u201d, on the Mexican border, the cruelty of Trump\u2019s immigration policy becomes all too real.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These girls walk for days and nights, all on their own, some in buses with strangers, not knowing if they will be safe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t imagine being in a car and going from Birmingham to London on our own when we are 14 or 15,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cOur parents would be worried about us. And these girls walk for days and nights, all on their own, some are getting in buses with strangers, going through all the security things, not knowing if they will be safe or not.\u201d As the book makes clear, even after surviving perilous journeys, girls are too often greeted with hostility (\u201cWe were truly being treated like animals\u201d is a common refrain), their futures far from certain. \u201cThey are putting their lives at risk and I think this is actual courage and bravery,\u201d says Yousafzai, herself often called \u201cthe bravest girl in the world\u201d.</p> <p>She is keen to stress the distinction between being displaced, forced to move within your own country, and becoming a refugee, hence the book\u2019s title: \u201cI called it \u2018displaced\u2019 because the majority of people are internally displaced rather than refugees. In total there are 68.5 million people who are displaced and only around 24 million are refugees. And I myself became displaced in Pakistan, plus 2 million other people.\u201d</p> <p>In May 2009, several months after the Taliban forbade girls from going to school in Peshawar, Yousafzai\u2019s family left their home in Mingora: it \u201cfelt like having my heart ripped out\u201d, she writes. Although they were able to return after three months, their greatest fear was that they \u201cwould be displaced for ever\u201d. Even as a 12-year-old, Yousafzai says she knew that the home she was returning to \u201cno longer existed except in my dreams\u201d \u2013 a feeling echoed by Maria in the book, who has moved eight times within Colombia, from one makeshift camp to another, but has \u201cnever felt \u2018at home\u2019 in any other place than the one I keep alive in my head from when I was a child\u201d. </p> <p>Then, after the shooting in 2012, Yousafzai\u2019s family had to leave their country for ever. \u201cWe were plucked from our mountain valley in Swat, Pakistan, and transported to a brick house in Birmingham,\u201d she writes in the preface to <em>I Am Malala</em>. Technically, she explains, they are not refugees, but residents in the UK: \u201cFor me it is more than becoming a refugee, it is about displacement, losing your home.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cparadox\u201d of the immigrant experience, as the Pennsylvania volunteer who becomes Marie Claire\u2019s \u201cAmerican mom\u201d describes it, is to be \u201cgrateful for a new life that is based on the painful loss of an old one\u201d. \u201cOftentime\u201d Yousafzai observes, in a quaint expression she uses frequently, \u201cwe forget about how the refugees also want to go back to their home. Every girl has this dream \u2013 they want to see their home, they feel this kind of incompletion in their life.\u201d For her, \u201chome has this sense of belonging. When you become a refugee you feel like you are a stranger to the land, an outsider. But as soon as you feel like you belong you are an insider and you deserve an equal right to it as anyone else. This becomes your home. And you can have many homes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fca90ca8a7408ea064f0538d91b2a7ad0ba99b07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fca90ca8a7408ea064f0538d91b2a7ad0ba99b07/0_267_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US president Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughter Malia meeting with Yousafzai in the Oval Office in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughter Malia meeting with Yousafzai in the Oval Office in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The White House/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With its snow-capped mountains and pine forests, the Swat valley is known as \u201cthe Switzerland of the east\u201d \u2013 \u201cWe think it is better than Switzerland,\u201d she says. While Yousafzai is \u201cvery proud of Birmingham\u201d, which she now regards as her second home, she still misses the sounds and smells and tastes of Peshawar: sweet tea boiled on the stove, her mother\u2019s chicken and rice, somehow \u201ctastier\u201d back home, sharing jokes with her friends \u2013 \u201cThe English sense of humour is different,\u201d she says diplomatically. And she will never get used to the weather (although she ruefully concedes that \u201csummers are getting better, probably because of global warming\u201d) or the fact that drivers don\u2019t honk their horns all the time: before she came to the UK she \u201chad never seen people following traffic rules\u201d.</p> <p>Of course it is not just Malala, but her parents and younger brothers Atal and Khushal who have been uprooted. It has been particularly difficult for her mother, Toor Peksi, whose homesickness was \u201chorrible\u201d at first. It is getting better, Yousafzai says. \u201cShe is happier\u201d, and has made friends with her English teacher, with whom she enjoys a cup of tea. For her mother, getting the lift to the ninth floor of their first Birmingham flat was as terrifying \u201cas boarding a space ship\u201d; she was bothered by the nightclubs on the street where they lived and the fact that the girls didn\u2019t seem to wear many clothes, even in winter. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense to her \u2013 it\u2019s snowing and these girls are not covering their legs. My mum used to say, \u2018I wish I had the same legs as them\u2019,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>Yousafzai was lonely at school, the unfamiliar woolly tights not the only thing making her uncomfortable: \u201cI used to just look at everybody who was talking and laughing and think, should I go and talk to them or not, should I join their gossip or not? Sometimes I thought, OK, I should just go to the library and read a book.\u201d On the day her Nobel was announced she was in a chemistry lesson. The deputy head teacher called her out of the class to tell her she had won. Then she went back to her desk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e4e431586c612e69517490d58b65385808a0a279\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4e431586c612e69517490d58b65385808a0a279/0_441_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yousafzai with her family members at her native home during a visit to Mingora in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yousafzai with her family during their visit to Mingora in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdullah Sherin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last March the family made their first trip back to Pakistan since the shooting, her father always worried that elections or other political events would make it dangerous. \u201cI realised we would never find the right time, there\u2019s always something happening,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it is just better to go now. I was quite stubborn.\u201d They met hundreds of their extended family and friends \u2013 \u201clots of selfies and lots of hugs and prayers and kisses\u201d \u2013 including her childhood best friend and academic rival Moniba, who is now studying medicine. They visited Swat, \u201cthe weather was nice\u201d, and returned to their old home, where the family who now live there have kept her room just as it was: \u201cmy school trophies and drawings and books and cupboard and bed and everything. It was such a beautiful time.\u201d</p> <p>Now she is in her second year studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, something she dreamed of back in Pakistan as a child. She is at Lady Margaret Hall, founded as one of the first female colleges, where her hero Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister who was assassinated in 2007, also studied PPE. She is having fun and \u201cjust living a bit of normal life\u201d. Is that possible? \u201cIn Oxford there are a few famous people already there, so we don\u2019t feel very famous,\u201d she says (she\u2019s too diplomatic to name names). She has made good friends: \u201cThey don\u2019t treat me as \u2018the Malala\u2019, but just their friend Malala.\u201d She was given a hard time after someone posted a photo of her wearing a pair of skinny jeans online but, \u201cIt\u2019s just jeans, what\u2019s wrong with jeans?\u201d she asks breezily, \u201cI just don\u2019t care about those things.\u201d</p> <p>Does she never suffer from self-doubt or anxiety? \u201cIt depends what we are talking about,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is a challenge for girls to believe in themselves and to believe that they can do anything, oftentime they become a hurdle to themselves. There are external challenges, but there are also internal challenges, we give up at the external ones and we say, \u2018OK fine, maybe I\u2019m not capable of becoming a scientist or prime minister or an astronaut or something.\u2019 I think it is important that at first girls develop that confidence in themselves and then together we will fight the external challenges.\u201d</p> <p>She was \u201csurprised\u201d to discover that sexism can still be found in the UK. \u201cWe consider the west as the perfect world where there is equality and democracy,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you talk about the so-called developing countries, the issues are more visible and people talk about them openly. But in the west this is something that is happening, but is often not talked about.\u201d The fact that women are speaking out about sexual harassment with the #MeToo movement, and against the gender pay gap, sends a message to \u201cwomen working in Pakistan or India or Brazil. It is empowering for everyone to see that women in the west are also joining them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c571e81673ce3c1358580fcc26e0e0cb2e2b7ead\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c571e81673ce3c1358580fcc26e0e0cb2e2b7ead/0_234_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malala Yousafzai Justin Trudeau\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malala Yousafzai with Justin Trudeau on a visit to Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does she still want to become the next prime minister of Pakistan? \u201cI was very little!\u201d she says, in the way of someone who is often asked the same thing (anyone who has watched the 2009 New York Times documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000001835296/class-dismissed-malala-yousafzais-story.html\" title=\"\">Class Dismissed</a></em> can\u2019t help but wonder if perhaps this preternaturally articulate child might one day fulfil her ambition). And PPE students do have a habit of going on to run the world. \u201cPeople always focus on the politics. It\u2019s also philosophy and it\u2019s also economics,\u201d she reminds me. No, she doesn\u2019t have any plans or interest in politics, right now, she says.

But it is politics and you do not agree with everything they say.\u201d She is currently reading Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir <em>Becoming</em>. And though she hasn\u2019t met Trump, she hopes he will read her book. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy read,\u201d she shoots back, when I point out he\u2019s not a big reader. \u201cHe could tweet it,\u201d she laughs. More seriously, she says she would invite him to visit a refugee camp. \u201cI could help him to organise that.\u201d</p> <p>On the day we meet, she is taking part in a GuardianLive event at the Barbican in London. All her family are gathered in the green room \u2013 her teenage brothers presiding over snacks and pastries. The event has sold out, yet still feels lively and intimate, with teachers and friends from Oxford in the audience. When the chair asks if Yousafzai ever felt too afraid to speak out, she replies that she was more scared about what would happen if nobody did. But she does admit to being frightened of animals: \u201cI hope things will be better one day,\u201d she jokes, and she brings the house down with her best Brummie accent. Questions from the floor come from fans, girls and boys, one as young as nine. At the end she gets a standing ovation.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes we think about refugees as the victims,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThat they must have sad stories, and they are sad indeed, but they also show us how much courage they have and how brave they are.\u201d Despite the horrors, <em>We </em><em>Are Displaced</em> is also hopeful: many of the girls featured are now studying for degrees. \u201cThese young girls are activists.

But we do not hear from them, especially when it comes to young women and girls. So I wrote the book.\u201d Yousafzai\u2019s story \u2013 shot by the Taliban in Peshawar in 2012, when she was 15, for speaking out for the rights of girls to go to school \u2013 is surely one of the best known in the world today, and was recounted in the international bestseller I Am Malala, written with the journalist Christina Lamb. As she tells it, in the comfort of a discreetly guarded London hotel room, one minute she was on the school bus with her friends talking about the following day\u2019s exams, the next she was \u201copening my eyes in this hospital in Birmingham and people were speaking in English\u201d. She was deaf in one ear and the left side of her face was badly damaged where the bullet had narrowly missed her eye, but she was lucky to be alive. After she recovered, rather than retreating into anonymity and GCSEs, she stepped up to a role as a global ambassador for female education. On her 16th birthday in July 2013 she gave an address to the UN, which declared the event \u201cMalala Day\u201d, and she appeared on the cover of that year\u2019s Time magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in the World issue (she was on the list three years running). She has joined the ranks of those so famous they are called only by their first names, and is herself on first-name terms with politicians and celebrities (\u201cAngelina was the highlight\u201d). Not to mention being awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2014. Here was a remarkable story and a young woman the world could celebrate \u2013 Malala, a sort of modern-day saint. But, on the dull January morning that we meet, this chatty 21-year-old Oxford undergraduate, in a bright pink headscarf and tunic, seems to have her feet firmly on the ground, albeit in a pair of impressively high heels for 10am. The only external sign of her injuries is a slightly lopsided smile, which she gives often. If there has been criticism, or cynicism, directed towards Yousafzai (in Pakistan there has been a great deal, even including theories suggesting she faked being shot), it is in the idea that she is in some way a creation \u2013 of the west, of her father, the education activist Ziauddin Yousafzai, of the media. Others complain that she has been absorbing too much attention (she was accused on social media, she says in I Am Malala, of having \u201ca teen lust for fame\u201d) when so many young Pakistanis, and children around the world, have suffered. So it is fitting that in her first big project since receiving the Nobel (which she likens to being \u201cin a car, rather than a bike\u201d in terms of the reach of her activism), she uses her name to make known those of others \u2013 Zaynab, Muzoon, Najla \u2013 who might otherwise have been ignored. With the US government in shutdown over Donald Trump\u2019s wall, the ongoing \u201cmigrant crisis\u201d in Europe and the endless Brexit debates, the issue of immigration is rarely out of the headlines. But, as Yousafzai says, it is all too easy to forget the individual suffering, something that was brought tragically into focus after the body of Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi washed up on the Greek island of Cos in 2015. Yet as migration figures have grown higher, the ugly rhetoric both in the UK and the US has hardened. As Yousafzai points out, \u201c90% of the refugees\u201d are hosted by developing countries. \u201cSo we need to realise who is actually carrying the burden.\u201d We Are Displaced, co-written with New York journalist Liz Welch, is intended \u201cas a reminder to the world\u201d. She began work on it more than five years ago in the Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, which she was visiting as part of her Malala Fund for girls\u2019 education. It was not possible for Yousafzai to meet all of the women in person, such as Ajida, a young mother from Rohingya, but she felt it was important to include the crisis in Myanmar. While we are sadly all too familiar with the humanitarian catastrophes of Syria and Iraq, she wanted to draw attention to the fact \u201cthat this is happening literally in every corner of the world. It\u2019s happening in Latin America, it\u2019s happening in south-east Asia, it\u2019s happening in south Asia, it\u2019s happening in most parts of Africa.\u201d She wanted to show \u201chow big and broad this issue is\u201d. While she says it is hard to single out one story, the ordeal endured by Marie Claire \u2013 whose family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo when she was nine, only for her mother to be murdered in front of her by an anti-refugee hate mob in Zambia \u2013 is impossible to forget. When she was 16, Marie Claire received news that the visa for which her mother had applied 10 years earlier had finally been accepted: the family were moving to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, \u201cthe refugee capital\u201d of the United States. On 16 June 2016, when she was 19, she graduated from high school, the first person in her family ever to do so. \u201cMy heart was full and cracked at once,\u201d she writes. \u201cThis was my mother\u2019s dream, too. She should have been here to experience it with me.\u201d In the story of 16-year-old Sabreen, forced to leave Yemen and then Egypt, we learn what it really means to try to cross the Mediterranean in an overcrowded fishing boat, and in the plight of Guatemalan orphan Analisa, held in the detention centres, known as the \u201cice box\u201d and the \u201cdog pound\u201d, on the Mexican border, the cruelty of Trump\u2019s immigration policy becomes all too real. \u201cWe can\u2019t imagine being in a car and going from Birmingham to London on our own when we are 14 or 15,\u201d Yousafzai says. \u201cOur parents would be worried about us. And these girls walk for days and nights, all on their own, some are getting in buses with strangers, going through all the security things, not knowing if they will be safe or not.\u201d As the book makes clear, even after surviving perilous journeys, girls are too often greeted with hostility (\u201cWe were truly being treated like animals\u201d is a common refrain), their futures far from certain. \u201cThey are putting their lives at risk and I think this is actual courage and bravery,\u201d says Yousafzai, herself often called \u201cthe bravest girl in the world\u201d. She is keen to stress the distinction between being displaced, forced to move within your own country, and becoming a refugee, hence the book\u2019s title: \u201cI called it \u2018displaced\u2019 because the majority of people are internally displaced rather than refugees. In total there are 68.5 million people who are displaced and only around 24 million are refugees. And I myself became displaced in Pakistan, plus 2 million other people.\u201d In May 2009, several months after the Taliban forbade girls from going to school in Peshawar, Yousafzai\u2019s family left their home in Mingora: it \u201cfelt like having my heart ripped out\u201d, she writes. Although they were able to return after three months, their greatest fear was that they \u201cwould be displaced for ever\u201d. Even as a 12-year-old, Yousafzai says she knew that the home she was returning to \u201cno longer existed except in my dreams\u201d \u2013 a feeling echoed by Maria in the book, who has moved eight times within Colombia, from one makeshift camp to another, but has \u201cnever felt \u2018at home\u2019 in any other place than the one I keep alive in my head from when I was a child\u201d. Then, after the shooting in 2012, Yousafzai\u2019s family had to leave their country for ever. \u201cWe were plucked from our mountain valley in Swat, Pakistan, and transported to a brick house in Birmingham,\u201d she writes in the preface to I Am Malala. Technically, she explains, they are not refugees, but residents in the UK: \u201cFor me it is more than becoming a refugee, it is about displacement, losing your home.\u201d The \u201cparadox\u201d of the immigrant experience, as the Pennsylvania volunteer who becomes Marie Claire\u2019s \u201cAmerican mom\u201d describes it, is to be \u201cgrateful for a new life that is based on the painful loss of an old one\u201d. \u201cOftentime\u201d Yousafzai observes, in a quaint expression she uses frequently, \u201cwe forget about how the refugees also want to go back to their home. Every girl has this dream \u2013 they want to see their home, they feel this kind of incompletion in their life.\u201d For her, \u201chome has this sense of belonging. When you become a refugee you feel like you are a stranger to the land, an outsider. But as soon as you feel like you belong you are an insider and you deserve an equal right to it as anyone else. This becomes your home. And you can have many homes.\u201d With its snow-capped mountains and pine forests, the Swat valley is known as \u201cthe Switzerland of the east\u201d \u2013 \u201cWe think it is better than Switzerland,\u201d she says. While Yousafzai is \u201cvery proud of Birmingham\u201d, which she now regards as her second home, she still misses the sounds and smells and tastes of Peshawar: sweet tea boiled on the stove, her mother\u2019s chicken and rice, somehow \u201ctastier\u201d back home, sharing jokes with her friends \u2013 \u201cThe English sense of humour is different,\u201d she says diplomatically. And she will never get used to the weather (although she ruefully concedes that \u201csummers are getting better, probably because of global warming\u201d) or the fact that drivers don\u2019t honk their horns all the time: before she came to the UK she \u201chad never seen people following traffic rules\u201d. Of course it is not just Malala, but her parents and younger brothers Atal and Khushal who have been uprooted. It has been particularly difficult for her mother, Toor Peksi, whose homesickness was \u201chorrible\u201d at first. It is getting better, Yousafzai says. \u201cShe is happier\u201d, and has made friends with her English teacher, with whom she enjoys a cup of tea. For her mother, getting the lift to the ninth floor of their first Birmingham flat was as terrifying \u201cas boarding a space ship\u201d; she was bothered by the nightclubs on the street where they lived and the fact that the girls didn\u2019t seem to wear many clothes, even in winter. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense to her \u2013 it\u2019s snowing and these girls are not covering their legs. My mum used to say, \u2018I wish I had the same legs as them\u2019,\u201d she laughs. Yousafzai was lonely at school, the unfamiliar woolly tights not the only thing making her uncomfortable: \u201cI used to just look at everybody who was talking and laughing and think, should I go and talk to them or not, should I join their gossip or not? Sometimes I thought, OK, I should just go to the library and read a book.\u201d On the day her Nobel was announced she was in a chemistry lesson. The deputy head teacher called her out of the class to tell her she had won. Then she went back to her desk. Last March the family made their first trip back to Pakistan since the shooting, her father always worried that elections or other political events would make it dangerous. \u201cI realised we would never find the right time, there\u2019s always something happening,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it is just better to go now. I was quite stubborn.\u201d They met hundreds of their extended family and friends \u2013 \u201clots of selfies and lots of hugs and prayers and kisses\u201d \u2013 including her childhood best friend and academic rival Moniba, who is now studying medicine. They visited Swat, \u201cthe weather was nice\u201d, and returned to their old home, where the family who now live there have kept her room just as it was: \u201cmy school trophies and drawings and books and cupboard and bed and everything. It was such a beautiful time.\u201d Now she is in her second year studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, something she dreamed of back in Pakistan as a child. She is at Lady Margaret Hall, founded as one of the first female colleges, where her hero Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister who was assassinated in 2007, also studied PPE. She is having fun and \u201cjust living a bit of normal life\u201d. Is that possible? \u201cIn Oxford there are a few famous people already there, so we don\u2019t feel very famous,\u201d she says (she\u2019s too diplomatic to name names). She has made good friends: \u201cThey don\u2019t treat me as \u2018the Malala\u2019, but just their friend Malala.\u201d She was given a hard time after someone posted a photo of her wearing a pair of skinny jeans online but, \u201cIt\u2019s just jeans, what\u2019s wrong with jeans?\u201d she asks breezily, \u201cI just don\u2019t care about those things.\u201d Does she never suffer from self-doubt or anxiety? \u201cIt depends what we are talking about,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is a challenge for girls to believe in themselves and to believe that they can do anything, oftentime they become a hurdle to themselves. There are external challenges, but there are also internal challenges, we give up at the external ones and we say, \u2018OK fine, maybe I\u2019m not capable of becoming a scientist or prime minister or an astronaut or something.\u2019 I think it is important that at first girls develop that confidence in themselves and then together we will fight the external challenges.\u201d She was \u201csurprised\u201d to discover that sexism can still be found in the UK. \u201cWe consider the west as the perfect world where there is equality and democracy,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you talk about the so-called developing countries, the issues are more visible and people talk about them openly. But in the west this is something that is happening, but is often not talked about.\u201d The fact that women are speaking out about sexual harassment with the #MeToo movement, and against the gender pay gap, sends a message to \u201cwomen working in Pakistan or India or Brazil. It is empowering for everyone to see that women in the west are also joining them.\u201d Does she still want to become the next prime minister of Pakistan? \u201cI was very little!\u201d she says, in the way of someone who is often asked the same thing (anyone who has watched the 2009 New York Times documentary Class Dismissed can\u2019t help but wonder if perhaps this preternaturally articulate child might one day fulfil her ambition). And PPE students do have a habit of going on to run the world. \u201cPeople always focus on the politics. It\u2019s also philosophy and it\u2019s also economics,\u201d she reminds me. No, she doesn\u2019t have any plans or interest in politics, right now, she says. But who knows in 15 or 20 years? She feels she can make more of a difference through the Malala Fund, which she wants to \u201cmake even bigger\u201d, setting her sights on more than 1 million girls, most of them refugees or displaced, who are out of school. Like a true politician, she will not be drawn on which of the prime ministers or presidents that she has met, from Gordon Brown to Barack Obama, has most impressed her. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like them or anything. But it is politics and you do not agree with everything they say.\u201d She is currently reading Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir Becoming. And though she hasn\u2019t met Trump, she hopes he will read her book. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy read,\u201d she shoots back, when I point out he\u2019s not a big reader. \u201cHe could tweet it,\u201d she laughs. More seriously, she says she would invite him to visit a refugee camp. \u201cI could help him to organise that.\u201d On the day we meet, she is taking part in a GuardianLive event at the Barbican in London. All her family are gathered in the green room \u2013 her teenage brothers presiding over snacks and pastries. The event has sold out, yet still feels lively and intimate, with teachers and friends from Oxford in the audience. When the chair asks if Yousafzai ever felt too afraid to speak out, she replies that she was more scared about what would happen if nobody did. But she does admit to being frightened of animals: \u201cI hope things will be better one day,\u201d she jokes, and she brings the house down with her best Brummie accent. Questions from the floor come from fans, girls and boys, one as young as nine. At the end she gets a standing ovation. \u201cSometimes we think about refugees as the victims,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThat they must have sad stories, and they are sad indeed, but they also show us how much courage they have and how brave they are.\u201d Despite the horrors, We Are Displaced is also hopeful: many of the girls featured are now studying for degrees. \u201cThese young girls are activists. They have dreams for their futures.\u201d As she says, \u201cIf one girl with an education can change the world, what can 130 million do?\u201d \u2022 We Are Displaced is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.

It was a bit harsh to get a straight red, but Hoffman didn\u2019t complain too much about it. </p> <p>Adam Le Fondre could, and should have ended the Newcastle resistance with three minutes to go, but his miss will go down as one of the howler\u2019s of the season. He was in the six yard box, no one was on him, Jets keeper Moss was on the ground, and Le Fondre somehow manages to kick it straight to Moss.</p> <p>There were further shots and misses from Le Fondre and substitute Ivanovic in added time, but it made no difference. Sydney have maintained their long, long run of being unbeaten at home to the Jets \u2013 the last time they lost this fixture was in 2012. That\u2019s five prime ministers ago. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c42dfb2e4b00173154a73f9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-19T08:29:04.661Z\">8.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sydney beat Newcastle</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Final score: Sydney 1-0 Newcastle.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c42df6ee4b058cfe6d93117\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-19T08:28:18.314Z\">8.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>90 + 4 mins: corner for Sydney in the dying moments of the game.

      "bodyText": "A classic game of two halves. The first half was a fine ad for the quality of the A-League, the second half less so. Far less so. After dominating play, Sydney deservedly took the lead in the 44th minute. O\u2019Neill made a pass from the right, bound for Brosque, but the unfortunate Boogaard got to it first and sent it into his own net. Interviewed at half-time, Sydney coach Steve Corica was asked what his side needed to do in the second half. \u201cScore more goals,\u201d he said. But he was not to get his wish. Newcastle started out much brighter in the second half, but in the 74th minute Hoffman was sent off for kicking O\u2019Neill while he (Hoffman) was on the ground. It was a bit harsh to get a straight red, but Hoffman didn\u2019t complain too much about it. Adam Le Fondre could, and should have ended the Newcastle resistance with three minutes to go, but his miss will go down as one of the howler\u2019s of the season. He was in the six yard box, no one was on him, Jets keeper Moss was on the ground, and Le Fondre somehow manages to kick it straight to Moss. There were further shots and misses from Le Fondre and substitute Ivanovic in added time, but it made no difference. Sydney have maintained their long, long run of being unbeaten at home to the Jets \u2013 the last time they lost this fixture was in 2012. That\u2019s five prime ministers ago. Final score: Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 90 + 4 mins: corner for Sydney in the dying moments of the game. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 90 + 3 mins: yellow card for Devlin followed shortly after by shots, and misses, by Ivanovic and Le Fondre. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 90 mins: some of the fans are heading for their cars or whatever public transport is available in Kogarah. But it\u2019s not over yet. Four minutes of added time to come. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 87 mins: Oh. My. God. How did Le Fondre miss? He\u2019s in the six yard box, no one is on him, Moss is on the ground, and he kicks it straight to Moss. That should have been the end of it. But it\u2019s not. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 86 mins: De Jong is off and Ivanovic is on for Sydney. We\u2019re in the wind the clock down zone. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 84 mins: the one player advantage is helping Sydney dominate the closing stages. Newcastle have not beaten Sydney away since 2012 and that does not look like changing here. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 82 mins: Caceres hits a wild shot from about 40 metres out and skys it. A waste of time, but with just minutes to go and his side leading, he won\u2019t be too concerned. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 81 mins: Sydney make a change, with 20-year-old Cameron Devlin on for Daniel De Silva. 80 mins: Le Fondre sent a pass into the box, hoping to find Brosque, but Topor-Stanley got to it first. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 77 mins: Ernie Merrick\u2019s men have about 13 minutes to get something out of this game. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 74 mins: Hoffman is off for kicking O\u2019Neill while he (Hoffman) was on the ground. It was a bit harsh to get a straight red for that, I think, but Hoffman didn\u2019t complain too much about it. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 71 mins: good free from Petratos, Hoffmann gets his head to it and it\u2019s wide. But he was offside anyway. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 68 mins: Champness is on for Jair. The Jets have 20ish minutes to rescue this game. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 66 mins: Sheppard on for Vargas. 66 mins: nice shot from O\u2019Neill, but it just went left of the post. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 64 mins: De Jong was in possession in a good spot just outside the Jets\u2019 box. And then he passes it out left to ... no one. Maybe he got a shout from someone who intended to receive the pass, but did not have the pace. Maybe. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 62 mins: birthday boy Glen Moss (36 today) can\u2019t find a Jet to get the ball too, and so, in rugby parlance, finds touch. Today is not turning out to be the birthday present he would have wanted. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 61 mins: shot from Petratos from about 35 minutes, but it swerves right and wide. He might have done better there. 60 mins: the home fans look happiest. And why wouldn\u2019t they? Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 58 mins: great ball from Zullo to Le Fondre, but he blazed it over. Got a bit too excited at the prospect of a goal, I think. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 57 mins: lovely run from Jair down the left for the Jets, but a great tackle from Calver saved the day. 56 mins: good run from Hoffman but he couldn\u2019t connect properly with in and it was little trouble for Redmayne. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 55 mins: Newcastle have started the second half stronger than Sydney, but it\u2019s still Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 53 mins: free given against Vargas for a push. He\u2019s not happy. 50 mins: Calver took down Vargas. He needs to be careful. He\u2019s already on a yellow. Petratos takes the resulting free and kicks is straight at Redmayne. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 49 mins: in a half-time interview, Steve Corica was asked what Sydney needed to do in the second half. \u201cScore more goals,\u201d he said. 46 mins: Warland takes down Vargas with a late tackle. I\u2019ve seen people booked for that, but he wasn\u2019t. In fairness to Vargas, he could have made more out it, but didn\u2019t. The free comes to nought. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. For more on the al-Araibi story, see here: Nice to see a banner about Hakeem al-Araibi at Jubilee Stadium. 45 + 2 mins: Vargas was unmarked after a corner but his shot went just over. And that\u2019s it for the first half. I\u2019ll be back soon after taking care of a WBBL story. 45 + 1 mins: a free from the left by Zullo amounts to nothing. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 45 mins: there will be two minutes of added time. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 44 mins: well, it was coming. O\u2019Neill made a pass from the right, bound for Brosque, but Boogaard got to it first and sent it into his own net. Sydney 1-0 Newcastle. 42 mins: I neglected to point out earlier that Milos Ninkovic is also out for Sydney, with a cold. Their injury list is a bit of a worry for Steve Corica, but they are still controlling this match. 39 mins: Sydney playing some dull keep-the-ball passes near their own goal. Perhaps trying to bore the Jets into submission. 37 mins: another cross cum shot, with Moss palming away from Calver. It must be windy at Jubilee. 36 mins: just over nine minutes left in the first half and it\u2019s still 0-0 in Kogarah. 35 mins: good comment from below the line, with a reader saying: A couple of fine efforts from Le Fondre so far. What a great buy, I thought we\u2019d miss Bobo badly but Le Fondre has been an excellent replacement. 31 mins: great counter from Sydney with Ugarkovic clearing off the line from a shot by De Silva. 31 mins: Redmayne makes a good save from a shot from Jair which I\u2019m pretty sure was intended as a pass but got caught by the wind. 29 mins: another yellow card for Sydney, with Zullo booked for a heavy tackle on O\u2019Donovan. 26 mins: long ball to Jair, who was trying, but failing, to angle it down to O\u2019Donovan. Accuracy of shots and passing are not the Jets\u2019 strong suit in recent times. 24 mins: yellow card for Sydney\u2019s Aaron Calver for a nastyish tackle on Koutroumbis. Calver\u2019s third yellow of the season. 23 mins: this has been a fine game so far, and a good advertisement for the A-League. 19 mins: super save by Moss from Le Fondre. It was headed into the top right corner, but Moss got a hand to it at full stretch. 18 mins: Boogaard denies Brosque a shooting chance, but you get the feeling he will have more chances to come. 16 mins: Newcastle have settled down now and are giving as good as they get, while Sydney\u2019s initial tempo has slowed down. 14 mins: Tratt\u2019s substitution turns out to be a groin injury, which he initially aggravated during the warm up. 12 mins: a great move from the Jets sees O\u2019Donovan with the ball in the box, but Redmayne, well off his line, did enough to interrupt him and a shot into the side netting results. 11 mins: the pitch at Kogarah has quite a few dry patches. That\u2019ll happen when you play summer football in the driest continent on the planet. 10 mins: it\u2019s all Sydney at the moment. It looks very much like their riding orders were to score early. 8 mins: Brosque has a shot from within the box but it just crashes into Topor-Stanley and the danger is averted. 7 mins: I\u2019m not sure what happened there, but Jacob Tratt is off and Ben Warland is on. Very bad luck for Tratt there, whatever happened. 6 mins: Tratt makes a good run down the right, gets the ball to Le Fondre, who wastes it with an odd backheel. 4 mins: some nice work from Brosque on the left, but it comes to nothing ultimately. Jets stringing a few passes together now. 2 mins: Le Fondre has a good early shot from the left, letting the Jets know who\u2019s boss. Good save from Moss. The Jets are playing in their third choice black kit. An odd choice, given the heat, though it\u2019s not as muggy as it was last night. We are under way in Kogarah. 2,289. That\u2019s the number of days since the Jets last beat Sydney FC away. And it\u2019s not looking too likely, at least on form, that that\u2019s going to change any time soon. And for the Jets, Daniel Georgievski is out, suspended for a week, but Ronald Vargas returns from suspension. For Sydney, Josh Brillante is out, suspended for one game, and Rhyan Grant is, of course, with the Socceroos at the Asian Cup. And the Newcastle Jets starting XI: Sydney FC starting XI: Good evening, night, morning or afternoon, depending on where in the world you are reading this blog from. Just four spots on the A-League ladder separate Sydney FC from Newcastle Jets, but there is also a 14 points and 14 goals difference. While Sydney are hoping for a win to keep pace with Perth Glory and Melbourne Victory, the Jets are just looking to put some space between themselves and a potential wooden spoon.",

Please, Guardian, help us to break out beyond our anglophone world and show us what we are missing regardless of our political status. Jackie, 71, Southampton, UK I really like your reporting on global cities and urban crises and solutions facing environmental and economic changes. I would like to see more on this, as it is a central issue to our present and future \u2013 it can be inspiring and at the same time prepare us. Andr\u00e9 Bail\u00e3o, 32, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Latin America; we are facing new socialism in the form of authoritarianism, censorship, centralised government and repression by many countries\u2019 presidents. Ivan Padilla, US Global politics with emphasis on India and African nations such as South Africa and Botswana. Raj Bhaumik, 14, Glasgow, Scotland, UK Animal rights Animal meat \u2013 show the story behind intensive farming (which is now normalised), the lifecycle of these animals from being born to the dinner table. The need for humans to reduce their meat intake to save the planet. Jo, Nottinghamshire, UK Wildlife crime and animal welfare, particularly in relation to hunting and flouting of the law. Amanda, 52, Brighton, UK I\u2019d like 2019 to be the year that veganism and the animal rights movement are seen as a logical extension of other social justice movements. Bryce, New Zealand Mental Health I would like you to cover the mental health crisis in the UK. Maria Grazia, 49, Cardiff Coping with cancer: how to develop mental resilience and ease depression in those who have had a cancer diagnosis. Rajanikanth Logishetty, 57, Teesside, UK The general state of mental health provision. Dilys Cordingley, 76, Teddington, UK The rights of people with no voice due to any kind of mental impairment. How to make them visible, heard, respected and understood as individuals. These are the most dehumanised, abused and neglected people in our society. They are invisible at best. Their rights depend on society\u2019s willingness to acknowledge them as equal \u2013 which it does not. Kathryn, Hertfordshire, UK Mental health awareness \u2013 what can communities do to help? What are the worst policies and actions for the vulnerable and traumatised? What should families be responsible for, and what resources are available to them? Kathleen Goldingay, 64, Oxford, UK Preparing for and enjoying the later stages of life. All life stages require awareness, advance preparation, culture change and financial competency. Douglas Pigg, 69, Dorset, UK Trans rights I would like to see the Guardian give a more balanced perspective to both sides of the debate surrounding reform of the Gender Recognition Act. Lucy, Sheffield, UK Trans people\u2019s voices, especially trans women. Josephine, London I\u2019d like to see more coverage exploring the issue of gender identity. Barry Shell, 67, Vancouver, Canada A critical look at medically transitioning young people and their complex psychological needs. Kathryn, York, UK Positive news I\u2019d like you to try and emphasise more positive stories. The world is in a dreadful situation, and more and more are turning to wilful ignorance in order to cope. There are good things happening though, and I would love to hear about them. James McDonagh, 45, Worcester, UK Reporting the positive statistics as well as the negative ones \u2013 especially for the NHS. Gillian Dunn, 65, Northumberland, UK Even more material on positive possibilities for our future \u2013 reporting on people and communities with new ideas, new ways of thinking about how we can respond creatively to the challenges we face environmentally, socially and politically. The piece from Ai Weiwei this morning on the need for unity around human rights is excellent. Please bring us fine examples from artists and political philosophers, social activists and pragmatists who are making meaningful progress amongst all the chaos and divisions. Carol Culshaw, Guernsey, UK We need more positive stories and examples for inspiration and optimism. We need to see how individuals, small businesses and NGOs create local positive impact and change \u2013 and perhaps ideas can spread and become global. Malene B\u00f8dker Leerberg, 48, Denmark International stories about normal people not being sidelined. Stories about people from Asia, South America and Africa are often about all the tragic things which are happening to them (which is important of course!) but it makes a very one-sided view of how diverse lifestyles are in those continents.

      "bodyText": "The scale of ticket touts\u2019 grip on access to live music and sports has been revealed, after the Viagogo website published details of its most prolific sellers, under the terms of a court order secured against the company by regulators. Information released by Viagogo showed that touts have grabbed thousands of pounds worth of tickets to see artists such as Ariana Grande and Fleetwood Mac, which they then advertise to music fans at vast markups. For a single gig by Fleetwood Mac at Wembley Stadium, touts listed at least 84 tickets with a combined price of \u00a353,364 \u2013 equal to an average of \u00a3635 each \u2013 despite the fact that the resale of tickets for the show is prohibited, leaving buyers at risk of being turned away at the turnstile. A show by Ariana Grande at the O2 in London, for which resale is also prohibited, had at least 52 listings by touts, at a combined price of \u00a323,098 \u2013 or an average of \u00a3444 each. Touts listed \u00a314,978 of tickets for one night of Take That\u2019s homecoming shows at Manchester Arena, with one seller, ATN Spencer, who gave their address as the Shard skyscraper in London, posting tickets with a total asking price of \u00a312,520. Traders using Viagogo were also offering tickets for a talk by Michelle Obama at the O2, with one on sale \u2013 again by ATN Spencer \u2013 at \u00a32664. Gigs by Bastille, Elton John and the Spice Girls were also targeted by touts. The latest data disclosed by Viagogo offers more insight into the power wielded by touts than ever before. In practice, however, the number and value of tickets sold by traders on the site is likely to be far higher because the information released on Friday only covers a single day\u2019s worth of ticket listings. Viagogo released the information under the terms of a court order obtained by the Competition and Markets Authority last year, demanding the firm give more information to consumers. The company said on Friday that it was compliant with the CMA\u2019s demands, but music industry figures and critics of the website said they believe it is still withholding some information from fans about what they are buying \u2013 such as seat numbers and the touts\u2019 full company details. The data that has been released makes it possible to trace dozens of touts, described by the website as \u201ctraders\u201d. They include firms whose owners and directors can be viewed at Companies House, such as North Financial Group, whose owner Andrew Newman is the super-tout exposed in an Observer investigation in 2016. Other Companies House-listed ticket firms include White Widget Ltd, Enjoy The Show Ltd, JSK Entertainment, Greatest Show Events and JCP Hospitality, most of which appear to be small operations or sole traders. Thumpers, a company in West Sussex, was offering two tickets to see Fleetwood Mac at Wembley Stadium for \u00a32,391, including VAT and fees. When the Guardian rang the company, the person who answered the phone, who did not identify themselves, said: \u201cI deal a lot in Goodwood and other stuff,\u201d adding that he sometimes sells tickets at face value. He added: \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything illegal. I\u2019m not doing anything wrong.\u201d Ticketing expert Reg Walker, of the Iridium Consultancy, said: \u201cNow that Viagogo is having to show whether a seller is a tout or not, it is becoming apparent at how they dominate ticket resale. \u201cThe sheer numbers of tickets on Viagogo annotated as being sold by a \u2018trader\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a tout in plain English \u2013 paints a grim picture of the massive numbers of tickets harvested in bulk, then offered at hiked up prices back to consumers.\u201d Despite the extra information published by Viagogo on Friday, campaigners said it was still not complying with the CMA\u2019s demands. Stuart Camp, who manages Ed Sheeran, said Viagogo, which has threatened to sue the musician\u2019s promotion company over ticket restrictions, was \u201cmaking a mockery of the law\u201d. Adam Webb, the campaign manager of anti-touting music industry group FanFair Alliance, said: \u201cAs of this morning, Viagogo was under strict instruction to overhaul its business practices.

Viagogo declined to comment on whether it had appointed a company to perform the review but the CMA said it would also be analysing the website\u2019s compliance. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are now undertaking our own checks of Viagogo, and if we find breaches of the court order we will not hesitate to take action.

Anyone can do it \u2013 it is as easy as changing a light bulb!\u201d Households, in the long term, have no choice but to switch to LEDs. In September last year, old-style halogen bulbs were removed from sale as part of an EU-wide programme that began in 2009 with the removal of incandescent bulbs. Retailers are allowed to sell off old stock, but not buy in new ones. What irks Birks is that while the government has funded schemes such as solar power feed-in tariffs (FITs), it is not doing enough to publicise the far greater environmental and economic savings that come from an early LED switchover. Birks is far from anti-solar. His home is itself a beneficiary of FITs after he installed panels on his roof. \u201cAll those who signed up have got the FITs for 25 years. I\u2019m getting \u00a3600 a year back from the government for 25 years. By my calculations, LEDs are 136 times more cost-effective,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t even need to subsidise LEDs. They should be doing a major advertising campaign and telling people to switch.\u201d The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says energy labels and energy efficiency standards for products such as light bulbs are helping with the transition to a low-carbon society. \u201cBy 2020, these standards are expected to save the average dual-fuel household \u00a3100 on annual energy bills,\u201d it adds.",

      "body": "<p>Over the last three years, I\u2019ve gained a new annual tradition. In the drained days of the new year, with the Christmas lights packed away and no reason to leave the house, I go to ground with the latest instalment of Tim Pears\u2019s West Country trilogy. His project \u2013 a layered, lyrical portrait of early-20th-century England, begun in January 2017 with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/07/the-horseman-by-tim-pears-review\" title=\"\">The Horseman</a></em> and continued in January 2018 with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/20/the-wanderers-by-tim-pears-review\" title=\"\">The Wanderers</a></em> \u2013 concludes this year with <em>The Redeemed</em>, in which he draws the stories of his protagonists, Leo and Lottie, to something like a close. These are novels that, in their attentive, slow-building descriptions of a seasonal, rural world, attempt to reconnect us with something we\u2019ve mostly lost: a sense of the rhythm of the natural realm and our place in it. By tying the publication of his books to a singular point on the calendar, Pears manages the neat trick of creating a physical connection between form and content; of amplifying the message of his books through the act of reading them. And with <em>The Redeemed</em>, that connection is intensified: the sense of homecoming that came with picking up the latest volume this month is echoed and augmented by the story between its covers. In the final book of Pears\u2019s trilogy, his wanderers are returning.</p> <p>Leo\u2019s road, in particular, has been winding. A carter\u2019s son with a rare affinity for horses, he was born in 1900 on an estate tucked into a Somerset valley on which the landowner\u2019s daughter, Lottie, was growing up, too. The first volume absorbs its readers into a long-vanished landscape in which Leo \u2013 silent, watchful \u2013 exists as a kind of spirit of the place, observing every creature, every leaf, every ripple in the weather with profound attention. Only Lottie is able to rouse him: a product of her environment too, she\u2019s nevertheless quicker, brighter, less accepting than he. The bond they form is deep, but it transgresses social hierarchies that are, in their way, as fixed and dictatorial as the seasons. Book two sees them forcibly sundered; exiled from Eden and thrown into a wider world from which, until then, they\u2019d been sheltered. While Lottie\u2019s journey is largely metaphorical, a voyage from innocence to experience that reveals to her the limits imposed on her as a young woman, Leo\u2019s is literal. Ejected from his home, rejected by his family, he takes to the road, and encounters a colourful cast of fellow travellers (kindly Gypsies, brutal farmers, a philosopher-tramp, a shepherd who castrates lambs with his teeth) who open his eyes to possibilities and perils previously unimagined. By the end of the book, however, the tide of history has overtaken them. The first world war is upon Leo and Lottie, and the time for personal voyages is over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e434859fe898f4735474a1810c0fb16443e9994c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e434859fe898f4735474a1810c0fb16443e9994c/0_131_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feats of perception and description \u2026 Tim Pears.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feats of perception and description \u2026 Tim Pears.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Redeemed</em> begins with Leo farther from home than ever. It\u2019s 1916, he\u2019s as old as the century and, like nearly every able-bodied boy, he\u2019s a tiny cog in the country\u2019s great war machine. Rather than churning over the mud of the trenches where, given Leo\u2019s skill with horses, he might easily have fetched up, Pears elects to send him north, to take the stage in a less mythologised theatre of war. Water swirls and swells through Pears\u2019s trilogy, frequently taking on additional meaning, and Leo begins the final instalment literally and figuratively at sea, as a deckhand on the HMS Queen Mary on the eve of the Battle of Jutland. For a series that trades on the intimate and the natural, the battle scene represents a whiplashing change of pace, and Pears dispatches it expertly, conveying its sound and fury through Leo\u2019s eyes, his outlook shaped by the countryside and the Bible. The sinking of the Queen Mary, in a frenzy of \u201cfire and smoke and sulphur\u201d, calls to mind scenes from Revelation, while in the crackle of the deck\u2019s heat-scorched resin he hears \u201ca noise like burning holly\u201d. In Somerset, meanwhile, though the fighting feels distant, its reverberations are deeply felt. Lottie manages to parlay the absence of young men into a job for herself as the local vet\u2019s assistant, a role in which she thrives until an encounter that serves as a violent reminder that not even war has eroded all the disadvantages of being born female.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The trilogy earns Pears a place among a pantheon that stretches from Thomas Hardy to Flora Thompson</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While both protagonists survive their battles, they are irrevocably transformed by them.

But it is also exceedingly intimidating: you wouldn\u2019t want to be the person who kicked at the wrong angle and put someone else\u2019s back out; indeed, if your partner did put their back out, it would be impossible not to hold yourself responsible, whatever the truth; and it does take a huge amount of trust to do anything at all. I guess this is why everyone there had brought a friend with them, rather than just picking one up at random. It\u2019s not for yoga purists, as the postures themselves take second place to the balancing. It\u2019s not for people who prefer hot yoga, as it\u2019s not hot. And it\u2019s definitely not for people who customarily try to ingratiate themselves with modest remarks about their uselessness. It\u2019s a world in which you\u2019re chosen for competence, not charm, maybe a little bit like joining the TA or having a parachute partner. Not for me, in short \u2013 not ever. Back at my normal yoga studio, I persist in my solitude and wonder if I really mind. Do I need to be talking about everything, all the time? Could this be the one thing I do that I never talk about? What I learned About that crow: it\u2019s not lack of balance that\u2019s stopping me, it\u2019s a fear of pitching forward and landing on my forehead. \u2022 To find a class near you, go to acroyoga.org/events",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m sitting on a concrete floor watching water droplets as they skitter across the smooth surface. Around me, other people seem equally transfixed. They stand in silent contemplation staring at beads of water bubbling up from tiny holes in the floor, or lie gazing at the vast domed roof, where two oval openings let natural light flood in. The slightest movement echoes around the space. I take a pen out to make some notes and a member of staff suddenly appears at my side and indicates that I should put it away. Phones are also a strict no-no.</p> <p>Teshima Art Museum turns the standard idea of what a museum is on its head. For a start it\u2019s empty. Or to be precise, there is nothing on display. Instead of looking at art works or objects, the visitor is invited to contemplate nature in its purest form: light, water, air. The effect is deeply calming. After 20 minutes, I practically float out.</p> <p>Outside, the museum is just as arresting. Curved and low lying, it looks both other-worldly and somehow part of the surrounding landscape. But perhaps the strangest aspect of the museum is its location \u2013 next to a rice terrace on a small island nearly two hours from the nearest city, Okayama, in western Japan. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c2b749da8c9c5d2241138ad33502fe3a2810646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c2b749da8c9c5d2241138ad33502fe3a2810646/0_248_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benesse Art Site Naoshima blends in with the surrounding landscape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teshima Art Museum blends in with the surrounding landscape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noboru Morikawa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it\u2019s not the only arty attraction in the area. This is one of 18 museums, galleries, installations and projects across three islands that together form a unique rural art paradise.</p> <p>The story behind the <a href=\"http://benesse-artsite.jp/en/\" title=\"\">Benesse Art Site Naoshima</a>, to give the project its full name, is intriguing too. It started in the late 1980s when billionaire businessman Soichiro Fukutake began exploring the smaller islands of the Seto Inland Sea, the body of water that separates three of Japan\u2019s four main islands. Fukutake wanted to transform three<em> </em>islands that had borne more than their fair share of the country\u2019s rapid industrialisation \u2013 refineries were built on Naoshima and Inujima, and illegal waste was dumped on Teshima \u2013 and had then been forgotten.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b03e63f13c4cabb802a5f8b1fa570bbbcd224b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b03e63f13c4cabb802a5f8b1fa570bbbcd224b0/0_196_2538_1523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Time Exposed installation at Benesse Art Site Naoshima.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time Exposed installation at Benesse House Museum on Naoshima.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shigeo Anzai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He decided to do it through contemporary art, and persuaded architect Tadao Ando, AKA \u201cthe king of concrete\u201d, to collaborate on Benesse House Museum on Naoshima. The museum signalled the scale of Fukutake\u2019s vision, which went beyond economic reboot to create a utopia showcasing not only world-class art but also a simpler, slower way of life, far removed from \u201cmonstrous cities\u201d.</p> <p>High on a hill overlooking the sea, the museum is filled with modern art greats: Andy Warhol, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Cy Twombly, but its most iconic piece is on the beach below: a giant yellow pumpkin by Japanese pop artist Yayoi Kusama, a surreal beacon jutting out into the sea. Another, red, pumpkin greets visitors as they disembark at the harbour, smart phone cameras at the ready \u2013 even the Naoshima ferry bears Kusama\u2019s signature motif of dots. It\u2019s close to the wacky I Love Yu public bathhouse, a collage of junkyard scrap and neon signs. Forgot your towel? You can buy one from the vending machine outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9aab40d0f01fee31e88fe0c0cd74b03f4adce6c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9aab40d0f01fee31e88fe0c0cd74b03f4adce6c8/0_0_3932_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of Naoshima Bath I Love Yu public bath house, or sento.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naoshima Bath, a \u2018sento\u2019 (bathhouse) for locals and visitors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Osamu Watanabe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ando went on to create more architectural masterpieces, including <a href=\"http://benesse-artsite.jp/en/art/chichu.html\" title=\"\">Chichu Art Museum</a>, a set of interlinked, half-buried buildings that house Fukutake\u2019s personal collection of five Monet water lily paintings. For me, the most striking work at Chichu is the Walter de Maria room, a temple-like space with golden pillars mounted on the walls and steps leading up to a giant granite sphere. Here, as in other museums, the reverence for art \u2013 among both the young staff and visitors \u2013 is palpable. And after a while I\u2019m relieved to step onto the cafe terrace and reconnect with simpler pleasures \u2013 the view of sea and distant land that looks like it\u2019s been painted onto the horizon in shades of grey \u2013 and to choose between a coffee or a bright blue Sora-Iro Cola.</p> <p>There is enough art on Naoshima alone to fill two days. Yet most visitors tick it off on a day trip as they whiz between Osaka, to the east, and Hiroshima, to the west. But it\u2019s madness to make the epic journey and not see Teshima and Inujima, too. It may take a bit of planning to reach all the islands by ferry (see <a href=\"https://setouchi-artfest.jp/en/\" title=\"\">setouchi-artfest.jp</a> for tips) but the reward is huge. And this year there is even more reason to linger. The 2019 <a href=\"https://setouchi-artfest.jp/en/\" title=\"\">Setouchi Triennale art festival</a> will ramp up the creativity with an astonishing array of artworks \u2013 200 in total, around half of them permanent \u2013 across 12 islands and two ports, Takamatsu and Uno. Unlike some art fairs, where glamour and wealth are on display as much as art and design, the Setouchi Triennale is firmly rooted in the history and character of the region. Projects will transform abandoned buildings, highlight artisanship and involve locals, including children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d7ef9825c13387f14a155fab8f27b4197814ee91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7ef9825c13387f14a155fab8f27b4197814ee91/0_0_7217_5411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teshima Yokoo House on Teshima,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teshima Yokoo House, set in an old cedar-wood house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tadasu Yamamoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a flight to Osaka, two train rides, and an hour\u2019s drive, my first day in the region is a short, intense dip into Japanese culture at a serene <a href=\"http://www.ryokan-kurashiki.jp/en/top.php\" title=\"\">ryokan, in the old town of Kurashiki</a> on the mainland, an immaculately preserved cluster of 300-year-old wooden houses on the banks of a canal. Dazed by lack of sleep I\u2019m grateful for the gentle guidance of the kimono-clad staff, who seem to glide about as if on casters, and lead me through a marathon nine-course meal of exquisite dishes almost too pretty to eat.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m sitting on a concrete floor watching water droplets as they skitter across the smooth surface. Around me, other people seem equally transfixed. They stand in silent contemplation staring at beads of water bubbling up from tiny holes in the floor, or lie gazing at the vast domed roof, where two oval openings let natural light flood in. The slightest movement echoes around the space. I take a pen out to make some notes and a member of staff suddenly appears at my side and indicates that I should put it away. Phones are also a strict no-no. Teshima Art Museum turns the standard idea of what a museum is on its head. For a start it\u2019s empty. Or to be precise, there is nothing on display. Instead of looking at art works or objects, the visitor is invited to contemplate nature in its purest form: light, water, air. The effect is deeply calming. After 20 minutes, I practically float out. Outside, the museum is just as arresting. Curved and low lying, it looks both other-worldly and somehow part of the surrounding landscape. But perhaps the strangest aspect of the museum is its location \u2013 next to a rice terrace on a small island nearly two hours from the nearest city, Okayama, in western Japan. And it\u2019s not the only arty attraction in the area. This is one of 18 museums, galleries, installations and projects across three islands that together form a unique rural art paradise. The story behind the Benesse Art Site Naoshima, to give the project its full name, is intriguing too. It started in the late 1980s when billionaire businessman Soichiro Fukutake began exploring the smaller islands of the Seto Inland Sea, the body of water that separates three of Japan\u2019s four main islands. Fukutake wanted to transform three islands that had borne more than their fair share of the country\u2019s rapid industrialisation \u2013 refineries were built on Naoshima and Inujima, and illegal waste was dumped on Teshima \u2013 and had then been forgotten. He decided to do it through contemporary art, and persuaded architect Tadao Ando, AKA \u201cthe king of concrete\u201d, to collaborate on Benesse House Museum on Naoshima. The museum signalled the scale of Fukutake\u2019s vision, which went beyond economic reboot to create a utopia showcasing not only world-class art but also a simpler, slower way of life, far removed from \u201cmonstrous cities\u201d. High on a hill overlooking the sea, the museum is filled with modern art greats: Andy Warhol, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Cy Twombly, but its most iconic piece is on the beach below: a giant yellow pumpkin by Japanese pop artist Yayoi Kusama, a surreal beacon jutting out into the sea. Another, red, pumpkin greets visitors as they disembark at the harbour, smart phone cameras at the ready \u2013 even the Naoshima ferry bears Kusama\u2019s signature motif of dots. It\u2019s close to the wacky I Love Yu public bathhouse, a collage of junkyard scrap and neon signs. Forgot your towel? You can buy one from the vending machine outside. Ando went on to create more architectural masterpieces, including Chichu Art Museum, a set of interlinked, half-buried buildings that house Fukutake\u2019s personal collection of five Monet water lily paintings. For me, the most striking work at Chichu is the Walter de Maria room, a temple-like space with golden pillars mounted on the walls and steps leading up to a giant granite sphere. Here, as in other museums, the reverence for art \u2013 among both the young staff and visitors \u2013 is palpable. And after a while I\u2019m relieved to step onto the cafe terrace and reconnect with simpler pleasures \u2013 the view of sea and distant land that looks like it\u2019s been painted onto the horizon in shades of grey \u2013 and to choose between a coffee or a bright blue Sora-Iro Cola. There is enough art on Naoshima alone to fill two days. Yet most visitors tick it off on a day trip as they whiz between Osaka, to the east, and Hiroshima, to the west. But it\u2019s madness to make the epic journey and not see Teshima and Inujima, too. It may take a bit of planning to reach all the islands by ferry (see setouchi-artfest.jp for tips) but the reward is huge. And this year there is even more reason to linger. The 2019 Setouchi Triennale art festival will ramp up the creativity with an astonishing array of artworks \u2013 200 in total, around half of them permanent \u2013 across 12 islands and two ports, Takamatsu and Uno. Unlike some art fairs, where glamour and wealth are on display as much as art and design, the Setouchi Triennale is firmly rooted in the history and character of the region. Projects will transform abandoned buildings, highlight artisanship and involve locals, including children. After a flight to Osaka, two train rides, and an hour\u2019s drive, my first day in the region is a short, intense dip into Japanese culture at a serene ryokan, in the old town of Kurashiki on the mainland, an immaculately preserved cluster of 300-year-old wooden houses on the banks of a canal. Dazed by lack of sleep I\u2019m grateful for the gentle guidance of the kimono-clad staff, who seem to glide about as if on casters, and lead me through a marathon nine-course meal of exquisite dishes almost too pretty to eat. Breakfast continues my immersion therapy, with a spread of rice, mackerel and a pickled plum that\u2019s such a powerful hit of salty sourness it instantly wakes me up. Across the canal from Ryokan Kurashiki is the Ohara Museum of Art, which was the first in Japan to show western art when it opened in 1930 but we head for a very different museum.

The progress of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement has stalled in parliament, where a majority of MPs are opposed to it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/corbyn-defends-refusal-to-talk-to-may-without-no-deal-pledge\">Jeremy Corbyn has refused to enter talks</a> with the prime minister until she rules out a no-deal Brexit, a demand she describes as \u201can impossible condition\u201d. So how do our political representatives get themselves out of this impasse?</p> <p>\u201cNegotiation is an art, not a science,\u201d says Dr J Simon Rofe, a reader in diplomatic and international studies<strong> </strong>at Soas, University of London, who teaches a course called \u201cthe art of negotiation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no manual and some people are better at it than others,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The best approach to political arbitration has been theorised over for thousands of years \u2013 from Thucydides and Plato to Cardinal Richelieu \u2013 and the fact we haven\u2019t come up with a set of definitive guidelines is a testament to the complexity of the matter, said Rofe.</p> <p>But there are some things that experts in negotiation can agree are vital. \u201cThe first and most overriding one is listening to the other party, which is perhaps common sense,\u201d said Rofe. \u201cThere has to be mutual respect. You have to listen [to the person you are negotiating with] and not talk over them and be prepared to take on board their point of view. That is not something that has been very evident in the debate in this country in the past couple of years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/may-will-stick-to-brexit-principles-in-cross-party-talks-says-no-10\">May tells Corbyn it is 'impossible' to rule out no deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Philip Williams, a senior consultant at the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (<a href=\"https://www.cedr.com/about_us/people/?p=Philip-Williams\">CEDR</a>), is a former director of the UK\u2019s Hostage and Crisis Negotiation programme. \u201cThere is not an incident that I have been involved in in the past \u2013 whether it be suicide intervention, kidnap, hijacking or a big siege \u2013 where there has not been deadlock, and not just one period of deadlock, but many, many periods of deadlock, big and small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about keeping going and being creative and flexible.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people say: \u2018How did you talk them into doing that?\u2019, we would say: \u2018We didn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "Westminster is in deadlock. The progress of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement has stalled in parliament, where a majority of MPs are opposed to it. Jeremy Corbyn has refused to enter talks with the prime minister until she rules out a no-deal Brexit, a demand she describes as \u201can impossible condition\u201d. So how do our political representatives get themselves out of this impasse? \u201cNegotiation is an art, not a science,\u201d says Dr J Simon Rofe, a reader in diplomatic and international studies at Soas, University of London, who teaches a course called \u201cthe art of negotiation\u201d. \u201cThere is no manual and some people are better at it than others,\u201d he said. The best approach to political arbitration has been theorised over for thousands of years \u2013 from Thucydides and Plato to Cardinal Richelieu \u2013 and the fact we haven\u2019t come up with a set of definitive guidelines is a testament to the complexity of the matter, said Rofe. But there are some things that experts in negotiation can agree are vital. \u201cThe first and most overriding one is listening to the other party, which is perhaps common sense,\u201d said Rofe. \u201cThere has to be mutual respect. You have to listen [to the person you are negotiating with] and not talk over them and be prepared to take on board their point of view. That is not something that has been very evident in the debate in this country in the past couple of years.\u201d Philip Williams, a senior consultant at the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR), is a former director of the UK\u2019s Hostage and Crisis Negotiation programme. \u201cThere is not an incident that I have been involved in in the past \u2013 whether it be suicide intervention, kidnap, hijacking or a big siege \u2013 where there has not been deadlock, and not just one period of deadlock, but many, many periods of deadlock, big and small,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about keeping going and being creative and flexible. \u201cWhen people say: \u2018How did you talk them into doing that?\u2019, we would say: \u2018We didn\u2019t. We listened them into it\u2019,\u201d he said. Amid criticism of Corbyn\u2019s hardline approach, the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott insisted on Thursday night her party was \u201cprepared to be flexible on everything\u201d. \u201cWe are not being rigid like the prime minister,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only thing we are saying is she has to take no-deal off the table.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very common in very difficult negotiations for parties to want to set parameters before they have the conversation and sometimes you can see justification for it,\u201d said Dr Karl Mackie, chief executive of CEDR and an internationally recognised mediator in commercial disputes. \u201cBut in my experience, most of the time, the key thing is to treat it holistically, have the conversation, get all the issues on the table, like them or not, because that\u2019s the reality of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like, at the moment, the condition that has been set is already implicitly agreed by everyone, so why spend time putting people in a position where someone has to lose face.\u201d Cathie Jo Martin, professor of political science at Boston University who co-edited the Political Negotiation Handbook, said there were similarities between the crisis in Westminster and the government shutdown in the US in the apparent lack of interest in compromise displayed by key players. \u201cIf our children behaved in this way, we mothers would give them a time-out,\u201d she said. \u201cToo bad that one cannot do the same for unruly politicians.\u201d She said good negotiation required those involved to avoid \u201csibling rivalries\u201d, ie a preoccupation with the idea that the other party could get more from a proposed deal, and sacrificing something that would leave everyone better off to prevent that. Rofe said one thing required for effective negotiation, which Westminster politicians do not necessarily have, is time. \u201cBeing given the opportunity to have those conversations is important. Having to do it now under these circumstances and under this timeframe is not ideal.\u201d MPs should set aside two or three days for intensive discussion, rather than having hurried meetings in the evening, said Mackie. \u201cTheresa May had her Chequers moment with her own party. She also needs to extend that kind of intensive get-together to other parties.\u201d And Westminster needs outside help to reach an agreement \u2013 preferably from an impartial international politician with good diplomacy and negotiation experience, who is supported by professional mediators. \u201cGood football teams need coaches and good negotiators need coaches too,\u201d said Mackie. \u201cThey need people there who could keep the momentum going in the negotiation without a stake in the outcome \u2026 and it would take some of the burden off the shoulders of Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May.\u201d \u201cWe have got limited time,\u201d said Mackie. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a crisis negotiation.

      "body": "<p>Scraping together a deposit on a new flat is always tough for tenants, with the average amount demanded now more than \u00a31,400 in England and Wales. Would you rather pay an insurance fee of about \u00a3300 \u2013 which you won\u2019t get back \u2013 or find the money for the deposit? That\u2019s the deal being dangled in front of tenants by some of Britain\u2019s biggest letting agents.</p> <p>Rental deposits have soared in recent years, with tenants frequently asked to put down the equivalent of two months\u2019 rent, which they won\u2019t see returned for possibly years \u2013 and then with possible deductions.</p> <p>But a growing number of agents are being offered \u201czero deposit\u201d schemes. Since last April, new tenants renting property through Haart have been offered the chance to sign up to the Flatfair scheme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jan/17/uk-house-prices-fall-at-fastest-rate-in-six-years-on-back-of-brexit-rics\">UK house prices fall at fastest rate in six years on back of Brexit \u2013 Rics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead of paying a traditional deposit, the scheme charges a one-off premium, typically worth just one week\u2019s rental payment. This buys a kind of insurance for the landlord, offering to cover any costs at the end of the tenancy. </p> <p>Now Haart is extending the offer to existing tenants. They will be asked if they want to get back their deposit, typically \u00a31,407, according to the firm, and sign up with Flatfair.</p> <p>Alongside Flatfair, there are a number of other schemes including Zero Deposit and Canopy. The basic principle of each is the same. The tenant pays a premium, which buys protection for the landlord. At the end of the tenancy the tenant can move on with no more fees to pay, unless the landlord makes a claim for damage. If that happens, the landlord receives money from the scheme, which will then pursue the tenant to recover some cash.</p> <p>Critics say that tenants, after paying the insurance premium, can potentially be left with having to fork out again if the landlord claims on it. What\u2019s more, the agents pushing the scheme receive a commission from the insurance company, worth about 20% of whatever the tenant has paid.</p> <p>It is also apparent that these schemes have only appeared after it emerged that high deposits demanded by landlords were going to be capped. The cap comes into force on 1 June ), limiting deposits to five weeks\u2019 rent.</p> <p>\u201cFlatfair was founded more than two years ago and the amount we\u2019ve saved tenants from being frozen during their tenancy is into seven figures,\u201d says Franz Doerr, who set up the scheme. \u201cThe majority of tenants who are well behaved will benefit from a membership discount for future tenancies.\u201d </p> <p>Zero Deposit says its scheme is underwritten and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Jon Notley, co-founder of Zero Deposit, says: \u201cUnfortunately, some providers are launching products that do not fall under FCA regulation. This is dangerous, with landlords and tenants potentially being misled about the cover they are being provided, and certainly without the protections that regulated products provide.\u201d</p> <p>Groups representing tenants say they cannot see the benefits for most of their members.</p> <p>Dan Wilson Craw from Generation Rent says zero-deposit schemes are an unnecessary expense for tenants.</p> <p>\u201cThis is money that you will never see again, whereas with a standard deposit if you take care of the property you should get all that money back,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to realise that it\u2019s not taking away their responsibility for keeping the home in good condition and paying the rent. If there are problems you will have to pay what they ask for.\u201d</p> <p>Even landlord groups are concerned. John Stewart, policy manager at the Residential Landlords Association, says he can see the potential for a loss-loss situation with this type of scheme.</p> <p>For tenants, he says \u201cit might cut the upfront fees but it is an absolute cost at the end of the day\u201d, while for landlords it was unclear how long claims would take to be paid and what would happen if a scheme went bust.</p> <p>\u201cThe deposit can be held by a landlord if they use the insured scheme, and a lot of landlords would prefer the cash,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Stewart says that in some cases there would be an advantage in using this type of scheme after the new deposits cap comes into effect.</p> <p>\u201cMost deposits are set at the five- week level but there are some times when the landlord asks for more \u2013 for instance, if there are pets, or there are high-risk tenants who have a history of arrears.\u201d</p> <p>David Cox, the chief executive of Arla Propertymark, says his group is not recommending the schemes to members. \u201cWe are not endorsing any of these schemes \u2013 the market needs to prove itself first,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are telling agents that they need to be careful to explain what they are to tenants. In most cases they are not insurance policies and tenants will be pursued for any costs at the end.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Cap on letting fees and deposits from June</strong></h2> <p>Long-promised restrictions on the charges landlords and agents are allowed to levy on tenants in England and Wales are set to come into force on 1 June after the House of Lords approved the government\u2019s Tenant Fees Bill. The bill still needs to be approved by the House of Commons and the rules will only apply to tenancies signed from 1 June. The new regulations will:</p> <p>\u2022 Ban landlords and agents from charging for credit checks, inventories or references.</p> <p>\u2022 Cap the cost of varying a tenancy at the tenant\u2019s request (such as a name change) at \u00a350, unless the landlord can show it cost them more.</p> <p>\u2022 Cap the amount that tenants can be charged as security deposit at a sum equal to five weeks\u2019 rent.</p> <p>\u2022 Cap the amount tenants can be charged for a holding deposit at one week\u2019s rent.</p> <p>\u2022 Only allow \u201cdefault fees\u201d for the cost of replacing lost keys or recovering missed rent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tenants, after paying the insurance premium, can be left with having to fork out again if the landlord claims on it</p> </blockquote> </aside>",

Rental deposits have soared in recent years, with tenants frequently asked to put down the equivalent of two months\u2019 rent, which they won\u2019t see returned for possibly years \u2013 and then with possible deductions. But a growing number of agents are being offered \u201czero deposit\u201d schemes. Since last April, new tenants renting property through Haart have been offered the chance to sign up to the Flatfair scheme. Instead of paying a traditional deposit, the scheme charges a one-off premium, typically worth just one week\u2019s rental payment. This buys a kind of insurance for the landlord, offering to cover any costs at the end of the tenancy. Now Haart is extending the offer to existing tenants. They will be asked if they want to get back their deposit, typically \u00a31,407, according to the firm, and sign up with Flatfair. Alongside Flatfair, there are a number of other schemes including Zero Deposit and Canopy. The basic principle of each is the same. The tenant pays a premium, which buys protection for the landlord. At the end of the tenancy the tenant can move on with no more fees to pay, unless the landlord makes a claim for damage. If that happens, the landlord receives money from the scheme, which will then pursue the tenant to recover some cash. Critics say that tenants, after paying the insurance premium, can potentially be left with having to fork out again if the landlord claims on it. What\u2019s more, the agents pushing the scheme receive a commission from the insurance company, worth about 20% of whatever the tenant has paid. It is also apparent that these schemes have only appeared after it emerged that high deposits demanded by landlords were going to be capped. The cap comes into force on 1 June ), limiting deposits to five weeks\u2019 rent. \u201cFlatfair was founded more than two years ago and the amount we\u2019ve saved tenants from being frozen during their tenancy is into seven figures,\u201d says Franz Doerr, who set up the scheme. \u201cThe majority of tenants who are well behaved will benefit from a membership discount for future tenancies.\u201d Zero Deposit says its scheme is underwritten and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Jon Notley, co-founder of Zero Deposit, says: \u201cUnfortunately, some providers are launching products that do not fall under FCA regulation. This is dangerous, with landlords and tenants potentially being misled about the cover they are being provided, and certainly without the protections that regulated products provide.\u201d Groups representing tenants say they cannot see the benefits for most of their members. Dan Wilson Craw from Generation Rent says zero-deposit schemes are an unnecessary expense for tenants. \u201cThis is money that you will never see again, whereas with a standard deposit if you take care of the property you should get all that money back,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to realise that it\u2019s not taking away their responsibility for keeping the home in good condition and paying the rent. If there are problems you will have to pay what they ask for.\u201d Even landlord groups are concerned. John Stewart, policy manager at the Residential Landlords Association, says he can see the potential for a loss-loss situation with this type of scheme. For tenants, he says \u201cit might cut the upfront fees but it is an absolute cost at the end of the day\u201d, while for landlords it was unclear how long claims would take to be paid and what would happen if a scheme went bust. \u201cThe deposit can be held by a landlord if they use the insured scheme, and a lot of landlords would prefer the cash,\u201d he adds. Stewart says that in some cases there would be an advantage in using this type of scheme after the new deposits cap comes into effect. \u201cMost deposits are set at the five- week level but there are some times when the landlord asks for more \u2013 for instance, if there are pets, or there are high-risk tenants who have a history of arrears.\u201d David Cox, the chief executive of Arla Propertymark, says his group is not recommending the schemes to members. \u201cWe are not endorsing any of these schemes \u2013 the market needs to prove itself first,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are telling agents that they need to be careful to explain what they are to tenants. In most cases they are not insurance policies and tenants will be pursued for any costs at the end.\u201d Cap on letting fees and deposits from June Long-promised restrictions on the charges landlords and agents are allowed to levy on tenants in England and Wales are set to come into force on 1 June after the House of Lords approved the government\u2019s Tenant Fees Bill. The bill still needs to be approved by the House of Commons and the rules will only apply to tenancies signed from 1 June. The new regulations will: \u2022 Ban landlords and agents from charging for credit checks, inventories or references. \u2022 Cap the cost of varying a tenancy at the tenant\u2019s request (such as a name change) at \u00a350, unless the landlord can show it cost them more. \u2022 Cap the amount that tenants can be charged as security deposit at a sum equal to five weeks\u2019 rent. \u2022 Cap the amount tenants can be charged for a holding deposit at one week\u2019s rent. \u2022 Only allow \u201cdefault fees\u201d for the cost of replacing lost keys or recovering missed rent.",

But sometimes sports stars just don\u2019t play ball. With his drop kick in the final minute of extra time, Jonny Wilkinson won the 2003 Rugby World Cup final \u2013 held in Sydney on 22 November \u2013 for England. But this introverted young man was a reluctant hero, says Tom Jenkins, uncomfortable seeing himself as anything but doing a day\u2019s work for the team. This made Jenkins\u2019s job a little tricky. \u201cHe was the only player who didn\u2019t go anywhere near the trophy,\u201d says the photographer. \u201cHe was the man, the story, and I was thinking: \u2018God, what can I do?\u2019\u201d Wilkinson was the first player to leave the pitch. As he walked towards the tunnel with his head bowed, Jenkins followed him and shot a single frame before the press officer \u2013 seen on the right \u2013 bundled him away. It\u2019s one of Jenkins\u2019s favourite photographs. \u201cI felt I\u2019d really illustrated the story and layered it with deeper meaning. You didn\u2019t need to see his face: everyone knew who No 10 was. Instead, the joy was lit up on the faces of the fans.\u201d <em>Hannah Booth</em></p> <p><strong>Buy your exclusive print <a href=\"https://guardianarchive.theprintspace.co.uk/collections/the-big-picture\">here</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Price</strong> <br>\u00a350, including free delivery</p> <p><strong>Prints<br></strong>Photographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not hard to photograph someone lifting a trophy. But sometimes sports stars just don\u2019t play ball. With his drop kick in the final minute of extra time, Jonny Wilkinson won the 2003 Rugby World Cup final \u2013 held in Sydney on 22 November \u2013 for England. But this introverted young man was a reluctant hero, says Tom Jenkins, uncomfortable seeing himself as anything but doing a day\u2019s work for the team. This made Jenkins\u2019s job a little tricky. \u201cHe was the only player who didn\u2019t go anywhere near the trophy,\u201d says the photographer. \u201cHe was the man, the story, and I was thinking: \u2018God, what can I do?\u2019\u201d Wilkinson was the first player to leave the pitch. As he walked towards the tunnel with his head bowed, Jenkins followed him and shot a single frame before the press officer \u2013 seen on the right \u2013 bundled him away. It\u2019s one of Jenkins\u2019s favourite photographs. \u201cI felt I\u2019d really illustrated the story and layered it with deeper meaning. You didn\u2019t need to see his face: everyone knew who No 10 was. Instead, the joy was lit up on the faces of the fans.\u201d Hannah Booth Buy your exclusive print here Price \u00a350, including free delivery Prints Photographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.

The 75-year-old walks two miles to town twice a week and usually calls in to the store. \u201cMarks &amp; Spencer is a part of every town, said Lowe . \u201cIt\u2019s good value, the food is amazing and the staff are always good. I come here for the clothes too. I would buy sweaters, trousers and T-shirts, and I buy all my underwear here.\u201d Inside the store, several elderly people bump into each other.</p> <p>Jessica Farmer, 30, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been here since I was a little girl. I used to come with my nan. I\u2019ll definitely miss it and for the older generation, it\u2019s where they\u2019re comfortable. It\u2019s really sad.\u201d The store is in the middle of the main shopping drag, a typical UK high street featuring WH Smith, Boots, Waterstones, New Look, Debenhams, Primark, a large empty unit that used to be home to BHS, and other empty shops. Passing by were Saffron Jarvis and Steph Radcliffe, who are mooching around town on a late Thursday morning fresh from their last A-level mock exam. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a big loss but it was kind of nice to have it there,\u201d said Jarvis, 18. \u201cRadcliffe, 17, was less concerned: \u201cIf I was to go shopping with my mates I\u2019d go to Milton Keynes because there are more shops there for my age.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Boston<br>Opened: 1914<br></strong>\u201cBoston is slowly being stripped of major retailers and we should have a voice!\u201d say the creators of a Facebook group called Save our Boston M&amp;S. Like other provincial towns, Boston is struggling to adapt to changing shopper habits. \u201cRetail is changing at an unprecedented rate,\u201d Richard Broadhead, the managing director of a long-established local department store chain, Oldrids, told the Boston Standard. \u201cWe have been trading in Boston for over 200 years. However, the simple fact is that stores such as our own will only exist whilst people support us by shopping locally.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41bf5f66447734f9713c3e29ecf3b5ae07b04849\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41bf5f66447734f9713c3e29ecf3b5ae07b04849/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marks & Spencer store in Buxton, Derbyshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Marks &amp; Spencer store in Buxton, Derbyshire, one of 17 that the company has earmarked for closure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Buxton<br>Opened: 1934<br></strong>\u201cWe Buxtonians have always had Marks &amp; Spencer. It\u2019s very sad,\u201d said Jean Bell, 77, leaving the Derbyshire store. Megan Middleton, 20, only pops in for meal deals, but she is also concerned its closure will hasten the decline of the pretty high street. Where specialist stores once traded, charity shops have opened. Teaching assistant Andrea Harris, 46, brings her mum here regularly \u2013 the closest store is 12 miles away. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve said: \u2018I\u2019ll meet you outside M&amp;S\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s heritage. I went to school in M&amp;S uniform, I still put my children in M&amp;S uniform.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Cwmbran<br>Opened: 1977<br></strong>M&amp;S\u2019s store in Ebbw Vale will close on Saturday and Cwmbran will be next \u2013 leaving the retailer with just 23 stores in Wales. The Torfaen MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds, and AM, Lynne Neagle, have asked for an urgent meeting with the company to discuss its decision to quit the 170-store Cwmbran mall. \u201cThis is terrible news both for the staff and the local community,\u201d they said in a joint statement. </p> <p><strong>Deal<br>Opened: 1937<br></strong>More than 4,000 people have already <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/marks-and-spencer-keep-deal-marks-and-spencer-open?fbclid=IwAR0TG3t55sCg0GvCZZJT26K7rr5bd1nSX455zLVvUluow4UA5bfPqehL3wo\">signed a petition</a> calling for the Kent store to be saved. The signatories make a strong case: \u201cDeal would be lost without M&amp;S on the high street,\u201d wrote Jenny Egelnick. \u201cThere is a large elderly population unable to travel far, poor public transport and M&amp;S caters for so many needs under one roof. They also keep the other high street shops open.\u201d Jane Francis claimed the store was always busy, adding: \u201cDeal is a destination of choice for the wealthy bohos of London, who will be horrified not to have a quality food shop in their town. Not to mention us locals who all love it and use the hell out of it. People before profits.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Felixstowe<br>Opened: 1937<br></strong>Residents of this seaside town have also started a \u201csave it\u201d petition. Suffolk Coastal council\u2019s deputy leader, Geoff Holdcroft, described Felixstowe as \u201cvery much on the up\u201d. He pointed to record visitor numbers in 2018 and plans for several thousand new homes: \u201cI hope that this prime site will be snapped up by a far-sighted new business.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71faa56c3f97401f1aec3a5f9709efc6516651e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71faa56c3f97401f1aec3a5f9709efc6516651e4/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marks & Spencer in Huddersfield, Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marks &amp; Spencer in Huddersfield, Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Huddersfield<br>Opened: 1894</strong><strong>, relocated 1934<br></strong>\u201cHas M&amp;S gone mad?\u201d asked the Huddersfield MP, Barry Sheerman. \u201cHuddersfield is a typical town of Britain and if they can\u2019t make it work in a thriving university town like Huddersfield they are in deep trouble.\u201d The MP told the Huddersfield Examiner he would put a \u201cstrong case\u201d in favour of keeping the store open. But with Leeds on its doorstep, Huddersfield\u2019s shops struggle to compete; BHS has gone while the future of the House of Fraser and HMV are uncertain. </p> <p><strong>Hull<br>Opened: pre-1900<br></strong>After the success of the city\u2019s stint as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/nov/19/what-next-hull-year-uk-city-culture-2017\">City of Culture</a> the decision by M&amp;S to quit its historic Whitefriargate was described as devastating by Kathryn Shillito, the boss of its business improvement district. \u201cThere is a real sense of nostalgia around Whitefriargate and the M&amp;S building particularly.\u201d The closure will mean the nearest big M&amp;S is on the other side of the Humber Bridge in Scunthorpe. Hull Daily Mail readers were quick to offer their views: \u201cWe need less retail and more city centre housing,\u201d wrote one. Another added: \u201cHouse of Fraser has been saved. Hopefully M&amp;S will see the light.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Luton Arndale<br>Opened: 1906, relocated 2009<br></strong>The closure of the M&amp;S branch in the Arndale will leave a big hole in a town already scarred by empty shops. For Irene and Bill Saul the news is a blow. \u201cWe\u2019re down here quite a lot, two or three times a week,\u201d said Irene, 71. \u201cI\u2019m a very loyal Marks customer..\u201d Bill, 68, added: \u201cIf that goes, what are they going to put in its place? It\u2019s going to be an eyesore. All the empty shops. It\u2019s a disgrace this high street, isn\u2019t it?\u201d But Manisha Thakur, 22, who moved to Luton four years ago, was more upbeat. \u201cI love this place. M&amp;S is a bit expensive for me. The clothing isn\u2019t good, but I like the cakes. I\u2019ll miss those.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Newark<br>Opened: 1933<br></strong>Last year M&amp;S backed out of moving to a bigger store in a new local retail park. Now the town centre store is closing, forcing shoppers to visit Lincoln instead. \u201cWe\u2019re adapting to changing customer habits and this means taking some tough decisions,\u201d said Paula Varley, the M&amp;S head of region for South Yorkshire and East Midlands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9113ef649a16a7ef9b8cc6a0af2e63565a77b4ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9113ef649a16a7ef9b8cc6a0af2e63565a77b4ee/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvia Goulborn at the Marks & Spencer store in Northwich, Cheshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvia Goulborn at the Marks &amp; Spencer store in Northwich, Cheshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Northwich<br>Opened: 1909<br></strong>\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since I was a lad,\u201d lamented Dennis Woodward, 80, before heading inside to buy groceries. \u201cIf they close this, what\u2019s going to go in it?\u201d he added, pointing towards the empty units in Barons Quay, a neighbouring shopping complex. Chester council plans to set up a meeting with the company to encourage it to stay, but not everyone will be sad to see M&amp;S go. \u201cThe thing with M&amp;S is that it\u2019s a bit of an older generation\u2019s shop,\u201d said 44-year-old Denise Bradley. \u201cUnless they get rid of that stigma I suppose it\u2019s always going to be that way.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Rotherham<br>Opened: 1894, relocated 1934 and 2004<br></strong>M&amp;S moved out of the town centre and into a huge new store on a retail park, but is now quitting that location too. Some locals say they favour cheaper neighbouring stores such as Primark and Morrisons but 62-year-old driver Steve Taylor will miss it: \u201cIt\u2019s sad.

It\u2019s really sad.\u201d The store is in the middle of the main shopping drag, a typical UK high street featuring WH Smith, Boots, Waterstones, New Look, Debenhams, Primark, a large empty unit that used to be home to BHS, and other empty shops. Passing by were Saffron Jarvis and Steph Radcliffe, who are mooching around town on a late Thursday morning fresh from their last A-level mock exam. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a big loss but it was kind of nice to have it there,\u201d said Jarvis, 18. \u201cRadcliffe, 17, was less concerned: \u201cIf I was to go shopping with my mates I\u2019d go to Milton Keynes because there are more shops there for my age.\u201d Boston Opened: 1914 \u201cBoston is slowly being stripped of major retailers and we should have a voice!\u201d say the creators of a Facebook group called Save our Boston M&amp;S. Like other provincial towns, Boston is struggling to adapt to changing shopper habits. \u201cRetail is changing at an unprecedented rate,\u201d Richard Broadhead, the managing director of a long-established local department store chain, Oldrids, told the Boston Standard. \u201cWe have been trading in Boston for over 200 years. However, the simple fact is that stores such as our own will only exist whilst people support us by shopping locally.\u201d Buxton Opened: 1934 \u201cWe Buxtonians have always had Marks &amp; Spencer. It\u2019s very sad,\u201d said Jean Bell, 77, leaving the Derbyshire store. Megan Middleton, 20, only pops in for meal deals, but she is also concerned its closure will hasten the decline of the pretty high street. Where specialist stores once traded, charity shops have opened. Teaching assistant Andrea Harris, 46, brings her mum here regularly \u2013 the closest store is 12 miles away. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve said: \u2018I\u2019ll meet you outside M&amp;S\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s heritage. I went to school in M&amp;S uniform, I still put my children in M&amp;S uniform.\u201d Cwmbran Opened: 1977 M&amp;S\u2019s store in Ebbw Vale will close on Saturday and Cwmbran will be next \u2013 leaving the retailer with just 23 stores in Wales. The Torfaen MP, Nick Thomas-Symonds, and AM, Lynne Neagle, have asked for an urgent meeting with the company to discuss its decision to quit the 170-store Cwmbran mall. \u201cThis is terrible news both for the staff and the local community,\u201d they said in a joint statement. Deal Opened: 1937 More than 4,000 people have already signed a petition calling for the Kent store to be saved. The signatories make a strong case: \u201cDeal would be lost without M&amp;S on the high street,\u201d wrote Jenny Egelnick. \u201cThere is a large elderly population unable to travel far, poor public transport and M&amp;S caters for so many needs under one roof. They also keep the other high street shops open.\u201d Jane Francis claimed the store was always busy, adding: \u201cDeal is a destination of choice for the wealthy bohos of London, who will be horrified not to have a quality food shop in their town. Not to mention us locals who all love it and use the hell out of it. People before profits.\u201d Felixstowe Opened: 1937 Residents of this seaside town have also started a \u201csave it\u201d petition. Suffolk Coastal council\u2019s deputy leader, Geoff Holdcroft, described Felixstowe as \u201cvery much on the up\u201d. He pointed to record visitor numbers in 2018 and plans for several thousand new homes: \u201cI hope that this prime site will be snapped up by a far-sighted new business.\u201d Huddersfield Opened: 1894, relocated 1934 \u201cHas M&amp;S gone mad?\u201d asked the Huddersfield MP, Barry Sheerman. \u201cHuddersfield is a typical town of Britain and if they can\u2019t make it work in a thriving university town like Huddersfield they are in deep trouble.\u201d The MP told the Huddersfield Examiner he would put a \u201cstrong case\u201d in favour of keeping the store open. But with Leeds on its doorstep, Huddersfield\u2019s shops struggle to compete; BHS has gone while the future of the House of Fraser and HMV are uncertain. Hull Opened: pre-1900 After the success of the city\u2019s stint as City of Culture the decision by M&amp;S to quit its historic Whitefriargate was described as devastating by Kathryn Shillito, the boss of its business improvement district. \u201cThere is a real sense of nostalgia around Whitefriargate and the M&amp;S building particularly.\u201d The closure will mean the nearest big M&amp;S is on the other side of the Humber Bridge in Scunthorpe. Hull Daily Mail readers were quick to offer their views: \u201cWe need less retail and more city centre housing,\u201d wrote one. Another added: \u201cHouse of Fraser has been saved. Hopefully M&amp;S will see the light.\u201d Luton Arndale Opened: 1906, relocated 2009 The closure of the M&amp;S branch in the Arndale will leave a big hole in a town already scarred by empty shops. For Irene and Bill Saul the news is a blow. \u201cWe\u2019re down here quite a lot, two or three times a week,\u201d said Irene, 71. \u201cI\u2019m a very loyal Marks customer..\u201d Bill, 68, added: \u201cIf that goes, what are they going to put in its place? It\u2019s going to be an eyesore. All the empty shops. It\u2019s a disgrace this high street, isn\u2019t it?\u201d But Manisha Thakur, 22, who moved to Luton four years ago, was more upbeat. \u201cI love this place. M&amp;S is a bit expensive for me. The clothing isn\u2019t good, but I like the cakes. I\u2019ll miss those.\u201d Newark Opened: 1933 Last year M&amp;S backed out of moving to a bigger store in a new local retail park. Now the town centre store is closing, forcing shoppers to visit Lincoln instead. \u201cWe\u2019re adapting to changing customer habits and this means taking some tough decisions,\u201d said Paula Varley, the M&amp;S head of region for South Yorkshire and East Midlands. Northwich Opened: 1909 \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since I was a lad,\u201d lamented Dennis Woodward, 80, before heading inside to buy groceries. \u201cIf they close this, what\u2019s going to go in it?\u201d he added, pointing towards the empty units in Barons Quay, a neighbouring shopping complex. Chester council plans to set up a meeting with the company to encourage it to stay, but not everyone will be sad to see M&amp;S go. \u201cThe thing with M&amp;S is that it\u2019s a bit of an older generation\u2019s shop,\u201d said 44-year-old Denise Bradley. \u201cUnless they get rid of that stigma I suppose it\u2019s always going to be that way.\u201d Rotherham Opened: 1894, relocated 1934 and 2004 M&amp;S moved out of the town centre and into a huge new store on a retail park, but is now quitting that location too. Some locals say they favour cheaper neighbouring stores such as Primark and Morrisons but 62-year-old driver Steve Taylor will miss it: \u201cIt\u2019s sad. I always pop in after to work to get a few bits \u2013 you build a bit of a rapport with the checkout girls.\u201d Sutton Coldfield Opened: 1932 Locals say the closure of the store in the Gracechurch shopping centre would be a tragedy for a town centre where the future of House of Fraser is also uncertain. \u201cI\u2019m member of staff and I\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d said Sapna Kumari on Facebook. \u201cWe are all like family at Sutton Marks.\u201d But some shoppers offer tough love: \u201cIf I was a director I wouldn\u2019t keep it open,\u201d wrote Alice Foley. \u201cCar parking charges put people off, and the opening hours are outdated. I hundred per cent prefer Tamworth.\u201d Weston-super-Mare Opened: 1907, relocated 1954 The seaside town was given a shot in the arm in 2015 when visitors flocked to Banksy\u2019s Dismaland and there is local optimism about regeneration, billing it as Bristol\u2019s answer to Margate. The Weston MP, John Penrose, insisted its \u201ceconomic rebirth\u201d was going well: \u201cWe can\u2019t let a single store \u2013 even one as well-known as M&amp;S \u2013 derail it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A subclause of a European Union directive has inadvertently prompted a spate of preteen mass hysteria, after fans of popular TV shows became convinced that Brussels legislation is responsible for a mysterious purge of their favourite meme accounts. \u201cI had heard about \u2018article 13\u2019 and been warned that lots of Instagram accounts were going to be deleted,\u201d said 12-year-old Julie, from London. \u201cI didn\u2019t really take it that seriously, but when I woke up to lots of deleted accounts I realised it was a big deal.\u201d \u201cArticle 13\u201d refers to a subclause of the proposed EU directive on copyright in the digital single market. One draft of that clause will impose regulation on \u201conline content sharing service providers\u201d, requiring them to work harder to prevent copyright infringement on their sites. Internet giants are battling against the legislation in a very public lobbying campaign, spreading the word that memes \u2013 defined by the Collins dictionary as an image or video that is spread widely online, often altered for humorous effect \u2013 could vanish from the internet if it is passed. But their warnings may have been slightly too effective, prompting fears among young people that the EU is planning to remove much-loved parts of the internet \u2013 a lobbying campaign that eventually filtered down to Julie and users like her. Julie\u2019s mum, Fiona, said her daughter was on the verge of tears when she, and the rest of the Instagram community she is a part of, concluded that their fears were coming true. Julie is part of the Stranger Things fandom, a close-knit collection of Instagram users linked by their love of the Netflix teen horror series. They share \u201cedits\u201d \u2013 videos, stills and gifs based on footage from the show which they loop, cut with a new soundtrack or overlay with text. Fansites such as hers are built around creative but unlicensed reuse of copyrighted material. Cory Doctorow of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US-based not-for-profit organisation that fights for internet rights, said the proposed article 13 \u201cwill subject huge swaths of online expression to interception and arbitrary censorship\u201d and is \u201ca catastrophe for freedom of expression\u201d. Of the three current versions of the directive \u2013 which will be merged into one next week \u2013 opponents have the biggest problem with the one written by the European parliament. Article 13 of that draft would require YouTube and other sites that allow user-generated content to build tools that proactively block anything that appears to infringe on copyright. They would face fines for whatever slips through the net. \u201cYouTube would be forced to block millions of videos (existing and new ones) in the European Union,\u201d the company said. \u201cIt could drastically limit the content that one can upload to the platform in Europe.\u201d But the deletion of a Stranger Things fan account last week did not have anything to do with article 13.

Form into a rectangular shape with your hands and on a well-floured surface, roll out in one direction, away from you, so you have a rectangle about one centimetre thick. Fold the two short ends into the middle so they overlap. Give the pastry a quarter turn, and repeat the rolling-and-folding process five more times. Wrap the pastry in clingfilm, then rest it in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Put a heavy-based casserole over a high heat. Add half the dripping. When hot, add the venison (you might need to do this in batches). Season well. Avoid shaking the pan too much at this point: you want the meat to begin to caramelise on the outside, so let it sizzle for several minutes before turning. When golden, transfer the meat to a plate.</p> <p>Add the remaining dripping to the pot, then the onion, mushrooms, garlic, bay, juniper, rosemary and thyme, and seasoning. Cook, stirring regularly, for 10-12 minutes, or until the onions are soft and the mushrooms have given up their juices. Return the venison to the casserole, turn down the heat, and stir in the flour. Cook for two to three minutes, pour in the stock, and bring to a simmer. Put in the oven with the lid ajar for two and a half to three hours, until the meat is tender and the sauce thickened. Let it cool.</p> <p>Cut the pastry into two pieces of two-thirds and one-third. Roll out the larger piece and line a lightly greased pie dish (about 1.2 litres). Don\u2019t worry if you have some overhang, this gets trimmed off. Spoon in the venison and pan juices, but remove the bay leaves and herb stalks. Roll out the small piece of pastry to form a lid. Brush the edges of the pastry base with some egg wash, lay on the lid and crimp together the edges. Trim away excess pastry. Brush with more egg, and cut a vent in the centre of the pie. Bake for 45-50 minutes, until golden brown. Leave to cool for 15 minutes, then serve with mash, greens and English mustard.</p> <h2><strong>Lamb, barley and kale broth</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d507f25e7c9442f23e74def24910ce156186fdcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d507f25e7c9442f23e74def24910ce156186fdcd/0_0_3467_3467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gill Meller\u2019s lamb, barley and kale broth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gill Meller\u2019s lamb, barley and kale broth</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prep<strong> 1 hr</strong><br>Cook <strong>3 hr 30 min</strong><br>Serves<strong> 4</strong></p> <p><strong>2 lamb or mutton or mutton shanks</strong><br><strong>1 onion</strong>, peeled and halved<br><strong>2 large carrots</strong>, peeled but left whole<br><strong>2 sticks of celery</strong>, halved<br><strong>3 </strong><strong>garlic cloves</strong>, peeled<br><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br><strong>6\u20138 sprigs thyme</strong><br><strong>1 sprig rosemary</strong><br><strong>75g </strong><strong>pearl</strong><strong> barley</strong>, soaked for an hour and rinsed<br><strong>1 small bunch kale</strong>, stripped from its stalk and roughly chopped<br><strong>\u00bd small bunch of parsley</strong>, chopped<br><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p>Put everything except the barley, kale and parsley in a large casserole pot.

      "body": "<p>Comedy is in a period of extraordinary flux. The past two years have witnessed the reputations of revered comics, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/02/too-soon-rehabilitate-louis-ck-mockery-metoo\" title=\"\">Louis CK</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/16/aziz-ansari-story-missed-opportunity\" title=\"\">Aziz Ansari</a>, implode in the wake of #MeToo allegations. Then there is the culture of unearthing old tweets, with standups being held to account for problematic \u201cjokes\u201d they\u2019ve made online (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/kevin-hart-not-returning-to-host-oscars\" title=\"\">for Kevin Hart</a>, it even cost him his most high-profile gig to date, hosting the Oscars). There are also increasing fears around political comedy and censorship. This month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/03/netflix-row-hasan-minhaj-pokes-fun-at-removal-of-show-criticising-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">Hasan Minhaj\u2019s Netflix special</a> was pulled because he criticised the Saudi regime over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/01/michelle-wolf-its-weird-that-trump-doesnt-have-a-sense-of-humour\" title=\"\">Michelle Wolf\u2019s</a> searing political set at the White House Correspondents Association dinner in 2018 led to the board announcing that 2019 will be the first time in 15 years that a comic would not be presenting the event. Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2018/12/23/41965/jim_davidson_reported_for_hate_speech\" title=\"\">Jim Davidson</a>, a man once so vile he was almost immune to judgment, was reported for hate speech, at his own birthday party no less (although no action was taken). The comedy goalposts are shifting and there is a demand that the art form gets more socially conscious. But can you be woke and funny? And are we living in a time of such change and heightened awareness that the two can now never be mutually exclusive?</p> <p>\u201cWhen comedians say: \u2018Oh you can\u2019t say ANYTHING these days!\u2019, what they are actually saying is, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to be funny without stomping on people.\u2019 Which is fair enough: not everyone has those skills,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/01/sofie-hagen-danish-standup-comedy-edinburgh-newcomer-award-interview\" title=\"\">Danish standup and podcaster Sofie Hagen</a>. \u201cBut a lot of comedians do and they\u2019re doing well based on that. Hannah Gadsby, Nish Kumar, Sara Pascoe, Mark Watson, Sophie Duker, Mae Martin: there are loads who manage to say a lot of things without repercussions; who are really, really funny while doing it. It sometimes takes a bit of extra work; you have to be aware of your own privilege and you have to educate yourself so you don\u2019t use damaging language.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5d32014be28a30af4e469da2762a593faabe674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5d32014be28a30af4e469da2762a593faabe674/0_0_2016_1209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louis CK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gag reflex... disgraced former funnyman Louis CK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Comic James Meehan agrees. \u201cThe thing about standup is you can joke about absolutely anything. Nothing is off limits. It\u2019s just how well you can write and frame the joke. I know lazy comics who only complain about political correctness because they don\u2019t want to update their material. The other people who complain are those who want a platform to spout hateful rhetoric.\u201d</p> <p>But it is not just about laziness; sometimes there is a deliberate attempt to rile. Before the allegations, Louis CK\u2019s comedy was subversive: poking fun at the inequalities of American society, while simultaneously acknowledging the ways they benefited him.

      "bodyText": "Comedy is in a period of extraordinary flux. The past two years have witnessed the reputations of revered comics, such as Louis CK and Aziz Ansari, implode in the wake of #MeToo allegations. Then there is the culture of unearthing old tweets, with standups being held to account for problematic \u201cjokes\u201d they\u2019ve made online (for Kevin Hart, it even cost him his most high-profile gig to date, hosting the Oscars). There are also increasing fears around political comedy and censorship. This month, Hasan Minhaj\u2019s Netflix special was pulled because he criticised the Saudi regime over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, while Michelle Wolf\u2019s searing political set at the White House Correspondents Association dinner in 2018 led to the board announcing that 2019 will be the first time in 15 years that a comic would not be presenting the event. Elsewhere, Jim Davidson, a man once so vile he was almost immune to judgment, was reported for hate speech, at his own birthday party no less (although no action was taken). The comedy goalposts are shifting and there is a demand that the art form gets more socially conscious. But can you be woke and funny? And are we living in a time of such change and heightened awareness that the two can now never be mutually exclusive? \u201cWhen comedians say: \u2018Oh you can\u2019t say ANYTHING these days!\u2019, what they are actually saying is, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to be funny without stomping on people.\u2019 Which is fair enough: not everyone has those skills,\u201d says Danish standup and podcaster Sofie Hagen. \u201cBut a lot of comedians do and they\u2019re doing well based on that. Hannah Gadsby, Nish Kumar, Sara Pascoe, Mark Watson, Sophie Duker, Mae Martin: there are loads who manage to say a lot of things without repercussions; who are really, really funny while doing it. It sometimes takes a bit of extra work; you have to be aware of your own privilege and you have to educate yourself so you don\u2019t use damaging language.\u201d Comic James Meehan agrees. \u201cThe thing about standup is you can joke about absolutely anything. Nothing is off limits. It\u2019s just how well you can write and frame the joke. I know lazy comics who only complain about political correctness because they don\u2019t want to update their material. The other people who complain are those who want a platform to spout hateful rhetoric.\u201d But it is not just about laziness; sometimes there is a deliberate attempt to rile. Before the allegations, Louis CK\u2019s comedy was subversive: poking fun at the inequalities of American society, while simultaneously acknowledging the ways they benefited him. After allegations of sexual misconduct appeared last year, however, the comic seemed to react with horror at a new world that threatened his unexamined patriarchal mindset. According to reports, at a recent New York show CK made jokes about survivors of gun violence and minorities such as non-binary teens. When some listeners appeared shocked, he allegedly responded: \u201cFuck it, what are you going to take away, my birthday? My life is over, I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d It was as if CK had reacted to the new wave of wokeness by indicting political correctness; he became an almost Trump-like figure, amplifying for shock value and catering to an audience who probably felt as if accusations about him were false or insignificant. However, there is a new generation of comics retaliating against the old template of comedy. Nights such as The LOL Word (for queer women and non-binary performers) and FOC It Up!, standing for \u201cfemmes of colour\u201d, have emerged, along with the new comic voices including Chloe Petts, Jodie Mitchell, Kemah Bob and Sara Barron. Hagen is also emblematic of this new kind of comedian. Last year, she demanded that every venue on her Dead Baby Frog tour was \u201canxiety safe\u201d (meaning audience members with anxiety could be allowed into the venue before others arrived, or be warned of any words or topics that might be triggering for them), had gender-neutral bathrooms and were wheelchair accessible. She had a positive response from fans, but faced an inevitable backlash online. \u201cThe people who come to my shows, the people who enjoy my standup and my podcasts, they\u2019re on the right side of history. They get it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I know that a lot appreciated it. The negativity I got was mostly online: loads and loads of hateful tweets and comments from people who were never going to go see my show anyway.\u201d Is this the future of funny? Perhaps it is the only way to survive. Comic Dane Baptiste thinks it could be detrimental to a comic\u2019s career to plough on with problematic humour: \u201cIt\u2019s not an obligation for comedians to be socially aware in their narrative but I feel that if you have no commentary on the mechanics that affect your life and lives of others, you might find yourself rather detached, and eventually irrelevant.\u201d When it comes to how people balance freedom of speech versus social responsibility in their comedy, there is, perhaps, a generational divide. \u201cThe received wisdom would probably be that there is,\u201d says comedy writer and actor Liam Williams. \u201cThough it would be complacent just to assume that any backlash to increased nuance, consideration, and empathy in comedy is just coming from nearly-dead Daily Mail readers.

The resignation of one of the government\u2019s most senior women is a serious blow to the Coalition, already expected to lose the federal election in May. O\u2019Dwyer, who is the minister for women and for jobs and industrial relations, said she could not commit to another three-year term and there had been \u201ctoo many byelections of late\u201d and she had no intention of causing another one. \u201cIn composing photo books and looking at the special moments over the Christmas period I\u2019ve seen how many I have missed and I know how many I will miss,\u201d she told the media on Saturday. \u201cI no longer want to consistently miss out on seeing my children when I wake up in the morning and when I got to bed at night.\u201d O\u2019Dwyer, who turns 42 this year, said she and her husband also wanted to grow their family and for that to happen \u201ceverything would have to go right\u201d. \u201cLike so many families, our journey to parenthood has not been straightforward and my husband and if I want to give ourselves the opportunity for a third child we have to be realistic,\u201d she said.

In his play Alone It Stands, at <a href=\"https://59e59.org/\">59E59</a> in New York City until the end of the month, the Irishman turns a maul into a screaming birth. God knows what he could do with a ruck.</p> <p>Like rugby union itself, the play is very simple and hugely complicated.

Rugby may look like brutal chaos, but each player has many roles to play.</p> <p>Alone It Stands is set in rugby-loving Limerick. In less rugby-loving Manhattan, that might pose a problem. But in the line outside, the Upper East Side-looking gentleman behind me, tall, patrician silver 70s, turns to his wife and says: \u201cI vividly remember watching my first rugby game. It was in DC, on the Mall, and there was an ambulance there.

There was also a middle-aged Irishman in the row in front of me who looked at his program, turned to his wife and sighed: \u201cAh, Tony Ward.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cb784b76ac0d16106d92d954df887a9267d1b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cb784b76ac0d16106d92d954df887a9267d1b9b/0_0_4321_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob McDermott in All Black guise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rob McDermott in All Black guise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heidi Bohnenkamp</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rob McDermott plays Ward, the Munster and Ireland fly-half of dashing good looks who kicked eight points in the 12-0 win. McDermott captures the strut of the star. He also plays All Blacks manager Russ Thomas, All Black Wayne Graham and Monica, a 13-year-old girl who kisses the character modelled on Breen\u2019s younger self. He is played by Henry Raber, an American who must also embody the revered Munster coach Tom Kiernan and one of the greatest All Blacks, captain Graham Mourie. That he makes it work, like the rest of the cast just about getting away with a larcenous assault on the Kiwi accent, makes an audience slightly slow to warm increasingly quick to laugh.</p> <p>The more I think of it, the more I think there was something profound in that sigh from the man who remembered Ward, who is now 64 and himself a <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/champions-cup/tony-ward-club-success-gives-joe-schmidt-some-massive-selection-dilemmas-in-pivotal-year-37707735.html\">writer</a>. Like all sport, rugby is about stories, which means it is as much about memory, and its mutability, as Proust. The miracle of Munster 12-0 New Zealand is now legend, the 14,000 or so who were really there joined by multitudes who say they were, or wish they were, or will after seeing this play. Rugby is about tall tales that grow taller in the telling.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZDtN1OwfVY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZDtN1OwfVY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Christy Cantillon\u2019s try.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s also, as Breen has Kiernan say, only a game. But Alone It Stands has a long and even romantic story of its own. Alighting in New York 20 years after its Dublin debut, in Ireland it\u2019s taught in schools. I have reviewed it before, when I wasn\u2019t long out of school myself. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/jan/04/theatre.artsfeatures1\">2002</a> and the play was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/03/rugbyunion.sport\">at the Duchess Theatre in the West End of London</a>. I was a reporter at Rugby News magazine, two floors up on the Tottenham Court Road and a hell of a job at the top of them. I was still playing, in the second row of the scrum for Rosslyn Park, which made my knees stiffen in the tight theatre seats. Age does the same trick now.</p> <p>Then, I picked out Breen\u2019s re-enactment of Seamus Dennison\u2019s famous try-saving <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbP5IaDxyQk\">tackle on the flying All Black Stu Wilson</a>, a smash hit that brought Thomond Park to its feet, landed the New Zealand star on his back and practically put the diminutive Dennison into an early grave. It\u2019s just as thrilling and funny here, Wilson (the wildly expressive Chase Guthrie Knueven, all eyeballs and All Black pride) and Dennison (the bullet-shaped David O\u2019Hara, who also shines as Gerry, a father-to-be in the stands) colliding in a blur of slo-mo violence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbP5IaDxyQk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wbP5IaDxyQk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Seamus Dennison\u2019s tackle.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Breen is strong on the meaning and theory of rugby. Early on, he has Kiernan discourse on the violent poetry of the tackle. Late on, as the desperate All Blacks pound the Munster line, the hits rise to a crescendo, each ugly smash a touch more stylised than the one before. There\u2019s also, true to the quoted Munsterism about playing rugby with \u201cboot, bite and bollock\u201d, a brief proverb about the benefits of good, old-fashioned rucking: \u201cSure, you wouldn\u2019t feel it during the game anyway.\u201d</p> <p>There is plenty to feel here. Class, as Irish a preoccupation as British, threads through the script like a centre through a crowded midfield, represented by the rivalry between the Shannon club (working) and Garryowen (middle). There is that birth, screamed out by the only woman in the cast, Sarah Street, who also packs a mean All Black and a loitering Limerick urchin. There is death, met with touching stillness by Ed Malone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/rugby/donal-canniffe-a-huge-win-and-a-huge-loss-i-cant-separate-them-431396.html\">Munster captain, Donal Canniffe</a>.</p> <p>There is also a lot of sheer bloody life: running, passing, dodging, singing, drinking, swearing, punching, gouging, biting. All the old rugby pleasures.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Alone It Stands <a href=\"https://59e59.org/\">plays at 59E59 until 27 January</a>, as part of Origin\u2019s 1st Irish, New York\u2019s annual festival of Irish theatre</em></p></li> </ul>",

There was also a middle-aged Irishman in the row in front of me who looked at his program, turned to his wife and sighed: \u201cAh, Tony Ward.\u201d Rob McDermott plays Ward, the Munster and Ireland fly-half of dashing good looks who kicked eight points in the 12-0 win. McDermott captures the strut of the star. He also plays All Blacks manager Russ Thomas, All Black Wayne Graham and Monica, a 13-year-old girl who kisses the character modelled on Breen\u2019s younger self. He is played by Henry Raber, an American who must also embody the revered Munster coach Tom Kiernan and one of the greatest All Blacks, captain Graham Mourie. That he makes it work, like the rest of the cast just about getting away with a larcenous assault on the Kiwi accent, makes an audience slightly slow to warm increasingly quick to laugh. The more I think of it, the more I think there was something profound in that sigh from the man who remembered Ward, who is now 64 and himself a writer. Like all sport, rugby is about stories, which means it is as much about memory, and its mutability, as Proust. The miracle of Munster 12-0 New Zealand is now legend, the 14,000 or so who were really there joined by multitudes who say they were, or wish they were, or will after seeing this play. Rugby is about tall tales that grow taller in the telling. It\u2019s also, as Breen has Kiernan say, only a game. But Alone It Stands has a long and even romantic story of its own. Alighting in New York 20 years after its Dublin debut, in Ireland it\u2019s taught in schools. I have reviewed it before, when I wasn\u2019t long out of school myself. It was 2002 and the play was at the Duchess Theatre in the West End of London. I was a reporter at Rugby News magazine, two floors up on the Tottenham Court Road and a hell of a job at the top of them. I was still playing, in the second row of the scrum for Rosslyn Park, which made my knees stiffen in the tight theatre seats. Age does the same trick now. Then, I picked out Breen\u2019s re-enactment of Seamus Dennison\u2019s famous try-saving tackle on the flying All Black Stu Wilson, a smash hit that brought Thomond Park to its feet, landed the New Zealand star on his back and practically put the diminutive Dennison into an early grave. It\u2019s just as thrilling and funny here, Wilson (the wildly expressive Chase Guthrie Knueven, all eyeballs and All Black pride) and Dennison (the bullet-shaped David O\u2019Hara, who also shines as Gerry, a father-to-be in the stands) colliding in a blur of slo-mo violence. Breen is strong on the meaning and theory of rugby. Early on, he has Kiernan discourse on the violent poetry of the tackle. Late on, as the desperate All Blacks pound the Munster line, the hits rise to a crescendo, each ugly smash a touch more stylised than the one before. There\u2019s also, true to the quoted Munsterism about playing rugby with \u201cboot, bite and bollock\u201d, a brief proverb about the benefits of good, old-fashioned rucking: \u201cSure, you wouldn\u2019t feel it during the game anyway.\u201d There is plenty to feel here. Class, as Irish a preoccupation as British, threads through the script like a centre through a crowded midfield, represented by the rivalry between the Shannon club (working) and Garryowen (middle). There is that birth, screamed out by the only woman in the cast, Sarah Street, who also packs a mean All Black and a loitering Limerick urchin. There is death, met with touching stillness by Ed Malone\u2019s Munster captain, Donal Canniffe. There is also a lot of sheer bloody life: running, passing, dodging, singing, drinking, swearing, punching, gouging, biting. All the old rugby pleasures. Alone It Stands plays at 59E59 until 27 January, as part of Origin\u2019s 1st Irish, New York\u2019s annual festival of Irish theatre",

It would barely matter at this stage if it turned out that pint seemingly welded to the former Ukip leader\u2019s hand was actually made of water and food colouring, just as it has never seemed to matter to his supporters that he\u2019s a ex-public schoolboy turned City gent and politician. He will always be an anti\u2011establishment hero in some eyes because Nigel Farage says things \u201cthe establishment\u201d does not. If he just keeps on saying those things, ripping into unpopular truths that politicians who actually care about the consequences of their actions feel obliged to defend, then he and his allies will thrive as long as \u201cestablishment\u201d remains an insult. And that\u2019s what any remainer longing for a second referendum needs to confront head-on.</p> <p>Last week I chaired a panel at an emergency conference in Westminster on prospects for a people\u2019s vote, at which good people grappled impressively hard with the question of how to look more like the insurgents next time. There was widespread agreement when the political organiser Paul Hilder, co-founder of the social action platform Crowdpac, one speaker pointed out that remain would need its own answer to the obvious leave message of \u201cTell them again\u201d, but louder. For people who only voted Leave because they wanted someone to listen for once, an invitation to show those patronising bastards they can\u2019t ignore you could resonate just like \u201ctake back control\u201d. So what\u2019s the comeback?</p> <p>There were plenty of sensible ideas tossed around, about rooting the campaign in local communities rather than sending celebrities on the train up from London to lecture the people of Hull and Hartlepool, and using tech entrepreneurs or music industry bosses rather than stuffy CEOs to represent the voice of business. But the difficulty second-referendum campaigners have in countering anti-establishment rage is firstly that they generally <em>are</em> the establishment \u2013 a fact that would be obvious no matter how many former prime ministers are locked in a cupboard next time \u2013 and secondly that there is a glaring problem for any potential cross-party campaign in agreeing on how that establishment has failed some voters in the past.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t failed them anywhere near as badly as Farage did, obviously. Remainers were remainers precisely because they didn\u2019t want to wake up to news that pharmacists are already running out of some drugs due to Brexit stockpiling. They voted for the status quo because they worried that promising the voters moonshine while energetically fuelling anti-immigrant hatred would not end well. And \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 it hasn\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One way or another, the arguments that led us here have to be confronted once the immediate crisis is over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But nobody loves a smartarse. And that, in a nutshell, is the problem. You\u2019re not going to win an argument to stay in the European Union, or even anything close to it, without offering a better answer to the underlying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-welcome-to-the-divided-angry-kingdom-video\" title=\"\">grievances that drove the leave vote</a> and acknowledging the past failures that have discredited conventional politicians, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/29/why-we-stopped-trusting-elites-the-new-populism\" title=\"\">allowing populists their opening</a>. The problem for a cross-party remain campaign is that both parties have fundamentally different answers to those challenges.</p> <p>Partly that\u2019s because they are talking to different people. Brexit wasn\u2019t won only in Barnsley and Middlesbrough and Hartlepool, in the downtrodden Labour-voting towns conjured up every time this argument arises. It was won in bits of rural Buckinghamshire that are not remotely left behind, and in retirement homes on the Dorset coast, and among golf club bores in blazers who wouldn\u2019t remotely see a problem with Nigel Farage chartering a plane to Strasbourg.</p> <p>This kind of leave voter was more attracted by the romance of the argument, the sound of freedom, the thrill of the wind in their hair; having personally done rather nicely out of the conventional political orthodoxy, they rebelled against it largely for rebellion\u2019s sake. The last Remain campaign, with all its dreary warnings about what could go wrong, will have sounded nagging and nannyish to them.</p> <p>Some of them have admittedly gone a little quiet now that it looks as if Nanny might have known best. The appeals to common sense from Tory soft Brexiters arguing that not long ago they could barely have dreamed of getting this far away from Brussels, are aimed at this mildly sheepish demographic. Others might just about heed a remain campaign if it was led by Jeremy Clarkson, say. But they would double down in outrage if confronted by the argument many remainers on the left are most comfortable making, which is that working-class leavers in neglected northern towns were conned into laying wholly legitimate grievances at the wrong door.</p> <p>What many in the audience of last week\u2019s conference longed to hear from a People\u2019s Vote campaign was a no holds barred case against Tory austerity, making clear that the hardships many are suffering have nothing to do with the EU and everything to do with choices made at home. David Lammy showed how to do it recently in a powerful parliamentary intervention, arguing people have been conned. In its party political broadcasts, Labour too has begun constructing an argument that people were right to want change but that the change they actually need is Corbynomics. It\u2019s as hard to imagine Jeremy Corbyn joining in a campaign where he wasn\u2019t free to make that argument as Theresa May going along with a campaign where he was.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/theresa-may-do-anything-for-love-brexit\">Theresa May will do anything for love, but she won\u2019t do that, or that, or that \u2026 | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the one thing May and Corbyn do agree on is that they don\u2019t want a second referendum, it may simply never happen. (As one Labour MP who has held private discussions with Downing Street over Brexit puts it, in some ways they\u2019re oddly similar characters; both as stubborn as they are mistrustful.) Perhaps parliament will reach around them to produce a compromise soft Brexit of its own devising.</p> <p>But that still leaves room for a Ukip 2.0 movement to emerge, cynically blaming the wicked establishment\u2019s failure to deliver on \u201ctrue\u201d Brexit for everything that goes wrong over the next decade. One way or another, the arguments that led us here have to be confronted once the immediate crisis is over. And we\u2019re going to need better answers than calling the other guy a hypocrite, even if it\u2019s true.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Short of being photographed skiing at Davos with Bono, nothing says \u201cglobal elite\u201d like trotting up the steps to your very own private plane. So no wonder Channel 4 pounced delightedly on the revelation that Nigel Farage recently chartered a private jet to reach Strasbourg, in an interview with the man himself that swiftly went viral. Who\u2019s the man of the people now, eh? Which is all very amusing, but ultimately changes nothing much. It would barely matter at this stage if it turned out that pint seemingly welded to the former Ukip leader\u2019s hand was actually made of water and food colouring, just as it has never seemed to matter to his supporters that he\u2019s a ex-public schoolboy turned City gent and politician. He will always be an anti\u2011establishment hero in some eyes because Nigel Farage says things \u201cthe establishment\u201d does not. If he just keeps on saying those things, ripping into unpopular truths that politicians who actually care about the consequences of their actions feel obliged to defend, then he and his allies will thrive as long as \u201cestablishment\u201d remains an insult. And that\u2019s what any remainer longing for a second referendum needs to confront head-on. Last week I chaired a panel at an emergency conference in Westminster on prospects for a people\u2019s vote, at which good people grappled impressively hard with the question of how to look more like the insurgents next time. There was widespread agreement when the political organiser Paul Hilder, co-founder of the social action platform Crowdpac, one speaker pointed out that remain would need its own answer to the obvious leave message of \u201cTell them again\u201d, but louder. For people who only voted Leave because they wanted someone to listen for once, an invitation to show those patronising bastards they can\u2019t ignore you could resonate just like \u201ctake back control\u201d. So what\u2019s the comeback? There were plenty of sensible ideas tossed around, about rooting the campaign in local communities rather than sending celebrities on the train up from London to lecture the people of Hull and Hartlepool, and using tech entrepreneurs or music industry bosses rather than stuffy CEOs to represent the voice of business. But the difficulty second-referendum campaigners have in countering anti-establishment rage is firstly that they generally are the establishment \u2013 a fact that would be obvious no matter how many former prime ministers are locked in a cupboard next time \u2013 and secondly that there is a glaring problem for any potential cross-party campaign in agreeing on how that establishment has failed some voters in the past. It hasn\u2019t failed them anywhere near as badly as Farage did, obviously. Remainers were remainers precisely because they didn\u2019t want to wake up to news that pharmacists are already running out of some drugs due to Brexit stockpiling. They voted for the status quo because they worried that promising the voters moonshine while energetically fuelling anti-immigrant hatred would not end well. And \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 it hasn\u2019t. But nobody loves a smartarse. And that, in a nutshell, is the problem. You\u2019re not going to win an argument to stay in the European Union, or even anything close to it, without offering a better answer to the underlying grievances that drove the leave vote and acknowledging the past failures that have discredited conventional politicians, allowing populists their opening. The problem for a cross-party remain campaign is that both parties have fundamentally different answers to those challenges. Partly that\u2019s because they are talking to different people. Brexit wasn\u2019t won only in Barnsley and Middlesbrough and Hartlepool, in the downtrodden Labour-voting towns conjured up every time this argument arises. It was won in bits of rural Buckinghamshire that are not remotely left behind, and in retirement homes on the Dorset coast, and among golf club bores in blazers who wouldn\u2019t remotely see a problem with Nigel Farage chartering a plane to Strasbourg. This kind of leave voter was more attracted by the romance of the argument, the sound of freedom, the thrill of the wind in their hair; having personally done rather nicely out of the conventional political orthodoxy, they rebelled against it largely for rebellion\u2019s sake. The last Remain campaign, with all its dreary warnings about what could go wrong, will have sounded nagging and nannyish to them. Some of them have admittedly gone a little quiet now that it looks as if Nanny might have known best. The appeals to common sense from Tory soft Brexiters arguing that not long ago they could barely have dreamed of getting this far away from Brussels, are aimed at this mildly sheepish demographic. Others might just about heed a remain campaign if it was led by Jeremy Clarkson, say. But they would double down in outrage if confronted by the argument many remainers on the left are most comfortable making, which is that working-class leavers in neglected northern towns were conned into laying wholly legitimate grievances at the wrong door. What many in the audience of last week\u2019s conference longed to hear from a People\u2019s Vote campaign was a no holds barred case against Tory austerity, making clear that the hardships many are suffering have nothing to do with the EU and everything to do with choices made at home. David Lammy showed how to do it recently in a powerful parliamentary intervention, arguing people have been conned. In its party political broadcasts, Labour too has begun constructing an argument that people were right to want change but that the change they actually need is Corbynomics. It\u2019s as hard to imagine Jeremy Corbyn joining in a campaign where he wasn\u2019t free to make that argument as Theresa May going along with a campaign where he was. Since the one thing May and Corbyn do agree on is that they don\u2019t want a second referendum, it may simply never happen. (As one Labour MP who has held private discussions with Downing Street over Brexit puts it, in some ways they\u2019re oddly similar characters; both as stubborn as they are mistrustful.) Perhaps parliament will reach around them to produce a compromise soft Brexit of its own devising. But that still leaves room for a Ukip 2.0 movement to emerge, cynically blaming the wicked establishment\u2019s failure to deliver on \u201ctrue\u201d Brexit for everything that goes wrong over the next decade. One way or another, the arguments that led us here have to be confronted once the immediate crisis is over. And we\u2019re going to need better answers than calling the other guy a hypocrite, even if it\u2019s true. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

Sometimes given the slightly clunky titles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/may-i-have-a-word-about-flexitarian-diets\">flexitarian</a> or reducetarianism, advocates of this approach are not especially bothered if you eat a bowl of chicken soup every now and again. What is more important to them is encouraging people to think about what they can do to reduce meat consumption worldwide.</p> <p>One of the leaders of this movement is a man called Brian Kateman, who coined the term reducetarian and now runs a foundation bearing that name. Speaking to the Guardian via Skype, he paces his office eating a bowl of vegetables from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/cashless-retail-stores-new-jersey-law\">salad chain</a> Sweetgreen. He says there is no one thing behind his desire to motivate people to eat less meat: he is worried about heart disease, animal cruelty, high food prices and environmental destruction. Reducing meat intake can solve a lot of problems, but he says people need to be less puritanical.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f2aee23a57192bfb97240adf6f7bd78789e8a97e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2aee23a57192bfb97240adf6f7bd78789e8a97e/144_0_1329_1661/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Kateman.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Kateman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrei Severny</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His own inspiration came from a bout of sibling score-settling. \u201cI remember one Thanksgiving, I ate a small piece of turkey and in that moment my sister, as siblings will do, said to me: \u2018I thought you were a vegetarian Brian.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t articulate then as well as I can now, but I thought about how the average person in the developed world eats around 200lb [90kg] of meat a year, and I\u2019m eating let\u2019s say 5lb of meat a year. That\u2019s a lot better. We need to be mindful of how challenging that can be for people and we need to create systems where the default choice is the moral one.\u201d Brian also says that not all meat is the same. High quality, organic meat produced in cruelty free conditions is preferable.</p> <p>The foundation he set up aims to encourage society at large to reduce its intake. \u201cWe\u2019re used to thinking about food as a personal choice so in our brain we\u2019re accustomed to it being in this different category. But once you understand that factory farming and the products it produces are so connected to so many issues that are detrimental not just to ourselves but to others, it allows us to recognise that what comes out of your mouth is just as important as what goes into your mouth.\u201d He suggests supporting policy initiatives and encouraging restaurants to broaden their menus as small actions that can help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"056802dfcf0d56fd3e5de68132e440ac5ea71b29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/056802dfcf0d56fd3e5de68132e440ac5ea71b29/0_205_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chickens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK consumes 12.9bn eggs each year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While there has been some light government intervention around food when it comes to personal health, including improvements to school dinners and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/08/sugar-drinks-tax-only-partly-effective-institute-fiscal-studies\">levy on sugary drinks</a>, food ethics has traditionally been outside the realm of parliamentary politics.</p> <p>Dr Marco Springmann, who led the research group that published the report in Nature, says the stakes are too high for politicians to remain squeamish about regulation. \u201cJust yesterday I had a meeting with civil servants from Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] and they were commenting that dietary change is a contentious topic and politicians don\u2019t want to get close to that. We saw similar statements from some politicians after we released the report. I think they\u2019re just so afraid of not being electable if it appears to be trying to prescribe what people eat. If there is not a substantial change within society first, politicians won\u2019t lead the way because it\u2019s too controversial.\u201d</p> <p>He says he is hopeful there will be a groundswell of change, particularly in big cities where restaurants specialising in plant-based dishes are popular. But millennials cannot make the change on their own. \u201cThe challenge is to make it not only a very trendy thing for young folks but also to make it accessible for the older generation.\u201d</p> <p>A big problem with relying on vegetables becoming increasingly fashionable, though, is that it is a global issue that needs a global solution. Even if it becomes cool to eat less meat in western metropolitan cities, will that offset increases in meat consumption elsewhere in the world? Since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, pork demand in China has increased by an average of 5.7% each year. It is now the biggest per-capita consumer of pork products in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bfacffcf069e4664b6ca2e4ded9bd2796fb7413\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bfacffcf069e4664b6ca2e4ded9bd2796fb7413/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A customer builds a salad at a supermarket in Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A customer builds a salad at a supermarket in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Springmann says small local changes can still have a global impact. \u201cIf you look at why people in China eat the way they eat, for one they have a huge rise in income levels so they can afford more meat, but why do they even want to eat meat? Well they very often look towards the west to see what rich people eat,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you talk to a Chinese person and you say you\u2019re vegetarian for example they don\u2019t get it. But if there is a large enough group that eats that way and it\u2019s clear that it is progressive rather [than] a sacrifice, then it would be a strong signal to rapidly industrialising countries like China that want to catch up.\u201d</p> <p>Even in the west, people switching from animal to plant products does not necessarily mean an immediate reduction in meat and dairy production. In the US, a decrease in dairy consumption has led to lower milk prices, meaning that farmers are now overproducing to try to offset their loses. Thousands of gallons of unwanted milk have been turned into processed cheese and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/10/america-cheese-surplus-production-dairy-farmers\">sitting in warehouses across the US, uneaten</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/may-i-have-a-word-about-flexitarian-diets\">May I have a word about\u2026 flexitarian diets | Jonathan Bouquet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there are reasons to be optimistic. In California, campaigners petitioned for a ballot measure that would make intense factory farming of caged chickens illegal. It passed during the most recent midterm elections and although Peta and others say it does not go far enough, itis a step in the right direction.</p> <p>If, in the UK, councils fine people for not recycling and high-emissions cars can be banned from the centre of London, it is time for individuals, companies and governments to actively work to reduce people\u2019s meat intake, whether they want to or not, campaigners say.</p> <p>Springmann says if we do not get over our squeamishness about making these changes quickly, things are going to get a lot worse. \u201cIf we continue with our current levels of meat consumption, it\u2019s very likely that we will have more flooding, more hurricanes, extreme weather that is associated with exceeding the two-degree target for climate change ... if nothing is done then those pressures could increase by 50 to 90% and by that time it will basically exceed all environmental limits or so-called planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity.\u201d</p>",

That is why many are now calling for a shift in approach: towards a regime that can involve more people and be less rigid about the rules of meat consumption. Sometimes given the slightly clunky titles flexitarian or reducetarianism, advocates of this approach are not especially bothered if you eat a bowl of chicken soup every now and again. What is more important to them is encouraging people to think about what they can do to reduce meat consumption worldwide. One of the leaders of this movement is a man called Brian Kateman, who coined the term reducetarian and now runs a foundation bearing that name. Speaking to the Guardian via Skype, he paces his office eating a bowl of vegetables from the salad chain Sweetgreen. He says there is no one thing behind his desire to motivate people to eat less meat: he is worried about heart disease, animal cruelty, high food prices and environmental destruction. Reducing meat intake can solve a lot of problems, but he says people need to be less puritanical. His own inspiration came from a bout of sibling score-settling. \u201cI remember one Thanksgiving, I ate a small piece of turkey and in that moment my sister, as siblings will do, said to me: \u2018I thought you were a vegetarian Brian.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t articulate then as well as I can now, but I thought about how the average person in the developed world eats around 200lb [90kg] of meat a year, and I\u2019m eating let\u2019s say 5lb of meat a year. That\u2019s a lot better. We need to be mindful of how challenging that can be for people and we need to create systems where the default choice is the moral one.\u201d Brian also says that not all meat is the same. High quality, organic meat produced in cruelty free conditions is preferable. The foundation he set up aims to encourage society at large to reduce its intake. \u201cWe\u2019re used to thinking about food as a personal choice so in our brain we\u2019re accustomed to it being in this different category. But once you understand that factory farming and the products it produces are so connected to so many issues that are detrimental not just to ourselves but to others, it allows us to recognise that what comes out of your mouth is just as important as what goes into your mouth.\u201d He suggests supporting policy initiatives and encouraging restaurants to broaden their menus as small actions that can help. While there has been some light government intervention around food when it comes to personal health, including improvements to school dinners and the levy on sugary drinks, food ethics has traditionally been outside the realm of parliamentary politics. Dr Marco Springmann, who led the research group that published the report in Nature, says the stakes are too high for politicians to remain squeamish about regulation. \u201cJust yesterday I had a meeting with civil servants from Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] and they were commenting that dietary change is a contentious topic and politicians don\u2019t want to get close to that. We saw similar statements from some politicians after we released the report. I think they\u2019re just so afraid of not being electable if it appears to be trying to prescribe what people eat. If there is not a substantial change within society first, politicians won\u2019t lead the way because it\u2019s too controversial.\u201d He says he is hopeful there will be a groundswell of change, particularly in big cities where restaurants specialising in plant-based dishes are popular. But millennials cannot make the change on their own. \u201cThe challenge is to make it not only a very trendy thing for young folks but also to make it accessible for the older generation.\u201d A big problem with relying on vegetables becoming increasingly fashionable, though, is that it is a global issue that needs a global solution. Even if it becomes cool to eat less meat in western metropolitan cities, will that offset increases in meat consumption elsewhere in the world? Since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, pork demand in China has increased by an average of 5.7% each year. It is now the biggest per-capita consumer of pork products in the world. But Springmann says small local changes can still have a global impact. \u201cIf you look at why people in China eat the way they eat, for one they have a huge rise in income levels so they can afford more meat, but why do they even want to eat meat? Well they very often look towards the west to see what rich people eat,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you talk to a Chinese person and you say you\u2019re vegetarian for example they don\u2019t get it. But if there is a large enough group that eats that way and it\u2019s clear that it is progressive rather [than] a sacrifice, then it would be a strong signal to rapidly industrialising countries like China that want to catch up.\u201d Even in the west, people switching from animal to plant products does not necessarily mean an immediate reduction in meat and dairy production. In the US, a decrease in dairy consumption has led to lower milk prices, meaning that farmers are now overproducing to try to offset their loses. Thousands of gallons of unwanted milk have been turned into processed cheese and is sitting in warehouses across the US, uneaten. But there are reasons to be optimistic. In California, campaigners petitioned for a ballot measure that would make intense factory farming of caged chickens illegal. It passed during the most recent midterm elections and although Peta and others say it does not go far enough, itis a step in the right direction. If, in the UK, councils fine people for not recycling and high-emissions cars can be banned from the centre of London, it is time for individuals, companies and governments to actively work to reduce people\u2019s meat intake, whether they want to or not, campaigners say. Springmann says if we do not get over our squeamishness about making these changes quickly, things are going to get a lot worse. \u201cIf we continue with our current levels of meat consumption, it\u2019s very likely that we will have more flooding, more hurricanes, extreme weather that is associated with exceeding the two-degree target for climate change ... if nothing is done then those pressures could increase by 50 to 90% and by that time it will basically exceed all environmental limits or so-called planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On the morning of 20 January 2017, the 938 citizens of Roberts county awoke to a new era. In this flat, rural expanse in northern Texas, routine remained mostly the same. Ranchers tended to their cattle. Children went to school. The oil pump jacks continued to rotate. But 1,540 miles away, on the steps of the capitol building in Washington DC, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Though he did not thank the voters here in the Texas panhandle \u2013 his shock election victory was mostly down to swinging the vote in communities throughout America\u2019s rust belt \u2013 Roberts county had already become synonymous with Trump\u2019s outsider triumph. Here, 95% of voters backed the Republican, the highest margin of any county in America. Broadcast vans from throughout the US arrived shortly after the result, as television crews and international newspapers sought to understand the answer to one question: why? Two years later, residents recall the influx of media outsiders with disdain. \u201cPeople overgeneralized who we are,\u201d says Lindy Thompson, owner of the Sage Matt cafe, the county\u2019s only diner, on its only high street, in Miami, its only town. \u201cThey assume we\u2019re a bunch of uneducated hillbillies, without actually learning who we are and what our community is about.\u201d Some here, Thompson included, now refuse to discuss politics in any real depth after the onslaught of coverage. In truth, the answer to the question is simple. Roberts county, in the heart of America\u2019s Bible belt, has voted Republican with giant margins for decades. No Democrat since Harry Truman in 1948 has even come close to taking this area, which swung red years before the racist politics of the Southern Strategy secured Republican control of America\u2019s south. But at the midpoint of the Trump presidency, the Texas panhandle goes some way to show the extent of unwavering loyalty that remains among his base. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big family here, everybody knows everybody and they\u2019d give each other the shirt off their backs if they needed to,\u201d Thompson, 38, says as she prepares ribeyes for the lunch crowd. \u201cWe needed Trump to help us survive.\u201d Tax cuts, deregulation and national security are the core mantras in Miami. And the president is deemed a success on all three. This is an affluent part of the state that has long reaped the rewards of big oil mining in the area. Only 7% of residents live below the poverty line, over 80% of high school graduates go on to further education. The county is 96% white. Trump\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment, a sweeping new federal tax bill that cuts taxes across the board, most for the super wealthy, was cited almost universally as the most important work the president has done since taking office. \u201cI love the tax plan he has,\u201d said the county\u2019s top official, Judge Rick Tennant. \u201cEveryone I\u2019ve talked to says they\u2019re making more money now.\u201d Tennant reels off a list of attributes he admires in Trump. \u201cI like that he gets involved in everything [on foreign policy]. That he tells you right out front what he likes, what he doesn\u2019t like,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like everything he\u2019s done. I don\u2019t like him getting on Twitter and all that other stuff.\u201d As the county\u2019s top jurist, perhaps Tennant is referring to the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia? \u201cNo. To me they need to end that deal. What if he was talking to the Russians? You tell me where the United States hasn\u2019t been involved in Russia\u2019s politics, Britain\u2019s politics, I mean they all do the same things. Move on. If there was something really bad, they\u2019d have found it out by now.\u201d The current president has not always been the county\u2019s preferred candidate. In the 2016 Republican primary, Senator Ted Cruz beat Trump by 30%. In the 2018 midterm elections, the Texas panhandle rejected an extreme rightwing insurgency that bore similarity to the brand of Republicanism embodied by the Trump presidency with its nods to white nationalism and racist politics. The region voted overwhelmingly to re-elect state senator Kel Seliger, deemed the most centrist Republican in the Texas state senate, against two primary opponents pushing an extremist platform. \u201cThis was a very conservative and Republican part of the state while Trump was still a Democrat,\u201d Seliger said. \u201cSo did he affect things here? Yeah, he might have increased turnout among Republicans but other than that \u2026\u201d There are signs that Republicans are relying more heavily on this region to maintain a grasp on Texas as a whole. Cruz canvassed in the panhandle twice during his campaign for re-election in November. The region rarely attracts national politicians as the vote is so reliably red, and Cruz\u2019s appearance was seen as testament to how close he came to losing. When you ask people in Roberts county what they expect from the Trump presidency in the next two years the answer is not really about policy but values. \u201cI would love to see people being more accepting of people\u2019s views and thoughts,\u201d says Lindy Thompson. \u201cJust agree to disagree. And that applies to both sides.\u201d \u201cI think term limit would be a great thing,\u201d says Tennant. \u201cYou have some politicians in Washington \u2013 on both sides \u2013 that\u2019s been in there 30-something years. You need new blood in there.\u201d In a move that might appear at odds with the celebrations over Trump\u2019s federal tax cuts, Roberts county voted for a local tax increase in 2014 to fund the construction of a modern school building. Public education is central to the county\u2019s continued prosperity. \u201cIf we lose the school, we\u2019d lose the town,\u201d says Tennant. So what do educators make of the administration\u2019s attempts to slash the federal education budget and installing Betsy DeVos, a billionaire Republican donor and ardent supporter of charter schooling, as education secretary? \u201cI didn\u2019t support that particular decision,\u201d says Mark Driscoll, principal of Miami independent school district, the county\u2019s only school. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be honest with you it hasn\u2019t really impacted us.\u201d Driscoll, 56, has never voted for a Democrat in his life, despite acknowledging that \u201cDemocrats give you raises, makes sure the schools are funded properly, all that kind of stuff. \u201cI\u2019m just conservative in my values and views and a lot of the things Mr Trump believes, I agree with.\u201d It is game night at the school\u2019s impressive new basketball court. Celie Locke watches her 14-year-old daughter on the court and cheers with pride. Locke comes from a long line of cattle ranchers in this region and is keen to celebrate significant roll backs of environmental protection regulations that Trump instigated through his first two years. \u201cThe country needs to be run as a business not by a politician,\u201d says Locke who backed Trump almost as soon as he announced his candidacy. \u201cThe border wall is very important. Being a Texan, we need border security. Why do you allow illegal immigrants in? The word \u2018illegal\u2019 should be a red flag.\u201d Trump has suggested he will keep the ongoing federal government shutdown for years if he is not given funds to build what became the banner promise in his campaign (albeit with the kicker that Mexico would pay for it). For Locke, despite the president saying he would \u201cown\u201d the shutdown last year, the blame for stasis in Washington lies squarely with Democrats. \u201cHe [Trump] is staying in there and holding on to what he believes,\u201d she says. \u201cThey [Democrats] are just holding out because they don\u2019t like Trump. And it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for the country.\u201d And yet, there are signs that the protracted shutdown, which Trump has the power to end, is having an effect on the community here. Dozens of local farmers in Roberts county and the neighboring Gray county have taken millions of dollars in federal loans for seed and grain over the past 10 years, according to public records. Due to the shutdown, these loans are no longer being processed as crop sowing season fast approaches. Calls to the region\u2019s 10 largest recipients of federal money were either not returned or met with a refusal to comment. \u201cThey both just need to get their houses in order,\u201d said one farmer who hung up the phone straight after. There is, of course, little to no chance of Roberts county swinging the other way in 2020 \u2013 irrespective of how long this shutdown continues. But, that says little about Trump\u2019s prospects at the next election. Locke already had a message for her Democratic opponents in 2020: \u201cWe lived through Obama\u2019s administration for eight years and we didn\u2019t like any minute of it. But we survived it. You can survive it for the next [two] years and do it with grace and dignity and common sense. \u201cAnd then, you know, it\u2019s the turning of the tide.\u201d",

The report cited two federal law enforcement sources and said the special counsel\u2019s office had learned of Trump\u2019s alleged directive from multiple witnesses, Trump Organization emails, text messages and other documents. But a spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office issued a rare comment on Friday evening disputing the report. \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate,\u201d the spokesman said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. The special counsel\u2019s office had previously declined to comment on the report, according to BuzzFeed\u2019s original article. The BuzzFeed News editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, wrote on Twitter: \u201cWe stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he\u2019s disputing.\u201d The statement from the special counsel\u2019s office is notable for its very existence.

At the time of the sentencing, Mueller\u2019s office asked the judge to give consideration to the fact that Cohen was cooperating with the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The allegation that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress \u2013 a potential felony \u2013 highlighted the significance of the Republican party\u2019s loss of the House in the midterm elections.

A perfect storm, or rather the lack of one, is partly to blame for the extreme temperatures, with neither the northern monsoons nor the southern cool fronts making their usual appearances. \u201cFor pretty much most locations in the southern part of Australia, the heatwave is over,\u201d said the Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Dean Narramore. \u201cSo it should be a much cooler weekend for many areas, but then we\u2019ll start seeing the heat return at least in Adelaide as we move into Monday, back into the high 30s. \u201cThe rest of South Australia will be much much hotter, getting into the mid 40s probably from around Tuesday.\u201d Perth is expected to reach 39 to 40C, and the inland area will have temperatures in the low-to-mid 40s, which will then head east. \u201cWe could see widespread low-to-mid 40s for many areas again and possibly some of that heat reaching the [east] coast,\u201d said Narramore. Melbourne would possibly reach 40C later in the week, he added. Parts of the country were still hot on Saturday, reaching 42.1C in Bourke, New South Wales, and 42.5C in Birdsville, Queensland. Temperatures in Menindee, the site of devastating mass fish kills, were hovering a few degrees below 30C after hitting 47C on Wednesday and Thursday. The Bureau of Meteorology was still analysing the heatwave event, but Narramore said it appeared that the last week had been \u201cone of the biggest and most intense heatwaves we\u2019ve seen in a long time\u201d. He estimated that at least 20 records had been broken. Previous climate change analysis by the CSIRO and BoM has found that every part of Australia will see increasingly longer hot spells, rises in average temperature, and more frequent hot days. Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will continue to climb. Temperature records were broken across the country over the past week, and Australia\u2019s highest ever overnight minimum was recorded in Noona at 35.9C. In South Australia, Tarcoola and Port Augusta had their hottest days on record (49C and 48.9C respectively), and the NSW town of Tibooburra had its highest minimum temperature on record of 34.2C. Canberra had four consecutive days above the 40C mark and Broken Hill had three \u2013 both for the first time in recorded history. The already hot central desert region also experienced record heat, although not worse than the last heatwave. Ernabella set a new high at 44.5C. At midday on Saturday, there were 68 fires burning across NSW with 26 uncontained, the state\u2019s rural fire service said. Fire bans remained in place across parts of the state. In the Northern Territory, firefighters worked to put out a blaze at Standley Chasm on Friday, which closed roads and several sections of the Larapinta trail. The bureau\u2019s last climate statement noted that December had Australia\u2019s warmest Christmas Day and Boxing Day on record. Narramore said there were two main reasons for the back-to-back heatwaves. \u201cOne is the very late monsoon, which normally covers northern Australia with clouds and showers, and cools the top of the country down.

      "bodyText": "President Trump is set to make a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d on Saturday regarding the border and the federal government partial shutdown. Amidst the fallout over BuzzFeed\u2019s explosive story reporting that President Trump directed ex-fixer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, Special counsel Robert Mueller issued a rare statement, saying that the article\u2019s \u201cdescription of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate.\u201d As the federal government partial shutdown enters a record Day 29 tomorrow, some state governors have begun to fight back with unemployment benefits for federal employees still working without pay. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis will permit federal workers required to work without pay to file for unemployment. \u201cThose federal employees who are required to report for work are feeling the same economic squeeze as those who have been furloughed. They should not be denied the immediate financial assistance provided by unemployment benefits while being mandated to show up to work,\u201d Polis said in a statement. \u201cI have authorized an emergency rule that makes all unpaid federal workers eligible for unemployment benefits, whether they are reporting for work or not.\u201d Polis made the announcement on Day 28 of the federal government shutdown. Federal employees not working during the shutdown can collect unemployment, while those who are on the job without pay cannot, according to the Labor Department. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state will also provide benefits for federal workers who are still working. Democratic state governors of Michigan, New York and Washington are also asking the Trump administration to let states offer unemployment benefits to federal employees who are working without pay. Special counsel Robert Mueller issued a rare statement refusing the explosive BuzzFeed report that the president directed ex-fixer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz may launch an independent bid for president, the Washington Post is reporting. Advisers to the billionaire Democrat are exploring the possibility. Former Ohio governor John Kasich, a 2016 Republican candidate for president, is also considering an independent run. Former President George W. Bush delivered pizza to his Secret Service agents, who are working without pay during the shutdown. He wrote that he and former First Lady Laura Bush are \u201cgrateful to our Secret Service personnel and the thousands of Federal employees who are working hard for our country without a paycheck.\u201d California Senator Kamala Harris may not have announced her candidacy for president (it\u2019s being speculated that she will make the announcement in her hometown of Oakland on Monday), but she appears to have already selected her campaign headquarters, The Baltimore Sun is reporting. \u201cHarris picked Baltimore because of its diversity, its proximity to Washington and because it is in the Eastern time zone, the sources said, who requested anonymity because Harris has not yet announced her plans.\u201d Fallout continues over BuzzFeed\u2019s explosive story reporting that President Trump directed ex-fixer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Hello, this is Vivian Ho with the west coast bureau, taking over for Joanna Walters. Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un will hold a second nuclear summit, near the end of next month, the White House announced, after the president held an Oval Office meeting with a North Korean emissary. The next three days will see a flurry of activity from Democratic figures who have already declared they are running for the White House in 2020 and those who may be about to. The federal government partial shutdown will enter a record Day 29 tomorrow, as a brief session of the Senate earlier saw the GOP block a Dem attempt to reopen Homeland Security, while increasing numbers of federal workers are claiming unemployment benefit. In the latest news on the government shutdown, the Associated Press reports that the Democratic state governors of Michigan, New York and Washington have asked the Trump administration to let states offer unemployment benefits to federal employees who are working without pay. Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Andrew Cuomo and Jay Inslee said in a joint statement that their states are providing the benefits to furloughed workers. But federal regulations prevent those who are on the job without pay from eligibility. They called on the Labor Department immediately to provide \u201cclear, unambiguous\u201d guidance on whether states have flexibility to waive the rules to help those working without pay. That includes Transportation Security Administration officers, air traffic controllers, Coast Guard members, among others. \u201cThere is no rational justification to deny these employees the same short-term relief being offered to furloughed federal employees across the country,\u201d the governors said. They said they are \u201cprofoundly distressed\u201d by the 28-day shutdown, which is \u201cbadly hurting\u201d federal employees in their states and across the country. The Labor Department says federal employees not working during the shutdown can collect unemployment, while those who are on the job without pay cannot. California Governor Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, said Thursday that his state will give benefits to people still on the job despite the guidance prohibiting it. As rising Florida Democrat Andrew Gillum says of the MLK holiday: \u201cIt\u2019s not a day off, it\u2019s a day on.\u201d He may have tweeted it last year, before he narrowly lost his bid to become state governor in November, but it doesn\u2019t grow old. He added: \u201cWe should have conversations about race, racism, sexism, and all the other -isms, because if it sits unconscious, we\u2019ll allow it to continue to perpetuate.\u201d Gillum and that other loser-cum-hero of the Democratic midterms effort, Beto O-Rourke, are not going away and the 2020 field is only going to widen dramatically in the coming months. Juli\u00e1n Castro popped up in New Hampshire earlier in the week and Kirsten Gillibrand is zooming into Iowa this weekend, on Warren\u2019s heels. All three are formally running. But the Monday holiday, marking what would have been Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s 90th birthday, is the all-you-can-eat buffet of the maybes as well as the definite. Speculation continues to build that Kamala Harris will announce her candidacy \u201cin or around\u201d MLK Day. Joe Biden is making his first public appearance of the year at Al Sharpton\u2019s civil rights breakfast in Washington on the day. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg will also be there. And Gillibrand is joining Sharpton at an event in New York City\u2019s Harlem neighborhood later on. Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders are both attending events in South Carolina. The Guardian is marking Trump\u2019s two-year mark in office with a series of articles over the next few days. The first one was published today. It examines the effects the Trump administration has had on key issues: the environment, the economy, foreign policy, immigration and the judiciary. What do you mean \u201cit\u2019s Friday afternoon can\u2019t I switch off now and crack a beer like Elizabeth Warren?\u201d Buckle up, America! The anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration coincides with the deafening sonic booms of declared and soon-to-declare candidates for the White House in 2020 hitting the campaign trail at the speed of sound. Here\u2019s our new interactive feature of the who\u2019s who of the Democratic race, the unofficial Dem primary field, which is about to get a lot larger. The empress of soul, Gladys Knight, has defended her decision to perform the American national anthem at the Super Bowl, after receiving criticism from supporters of former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who used football\u2019s pre-game tradition to protest racial injustice, especially police brutality against people of color. But Knight, a 74-year-old native of Atlanta, where the game will be played, has agreed to sing \u201cthe Star Spangled Banner\u201d, Reuters reports. Her decision was blasted on social media today by supporters of the \u201ctake a knee\u201d stance championed by NFL players who kneel during the anthem as a form of activism. Donald Trump, who lobbied for rebels to be fired, has led a chorus of conservative voices calling such actions unpatriotic. Knight argued that she wanted to \u201cgive the anthem back its voice\u201d in order to include Americans struggling for racial justice. She said she did not need to prove her commitment to civil rights. \u201cI have fought long and hard for all my life, from walking back hallways, from marching with our social leaders, from using my voice for good,\u201d the \u201cMidnight Train to Georgia\u201d singer said in a statement. She added: \u201cI have been in the forefront of this battle longer than most of those voicing their opinions to win the right to sing our country\u2019s anthem on a stage as large as the Super Bowl,\u201d Knight added. The Super Bowl is on February 3 (which, lest we forget, is four days before Michael Cohen testifies to Congress) It\u2019s a big weekend for presidential hopefuls \u2013 with many potential candidates using the upcoming three-day weekend to take the first steps in the 2020 campaign. Senator Kristen Gillibrand, a Democrat in New York, has landed in Iowa: Hello, this is Joanna Walters again, taking over the reins from Amanda Holpuch. Michael Fuchs, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said Trump is heading into the second North Korea summit with \u201cno sense.\u201d Fuchs, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said: Once again, President Trump is rushing into a summit meeting with Kim Jong Un with no sense of what it will achieve other than showering a brutal dictator with more international acceptance. Diplomacy with North Korea is necessary, but what Trump has done so far is more of a show than real diplomacy. With North Korea, we can\u2019t trust \u2013 we must verify. So far, Trump\u2019s engagement with North Korea has produced nothing for America while North Korea continues to expand its nuclear program. Let\u2019s hope the second summit produces real results, but don\u2019t hold your breath as we wait for episode two of the Trump-Kim show. More on the North Korea news from the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger: This week the vice-president, Mike Pence, conceded that Washington was still \u201cwaiting for concrete steps\u201d from the Kim\u2019s regime, and the US unveiled a plan for a significantly expanded missile defence system, much of it designed to counter what the Pentagon termed \u201can extraordinary threat\u201d from North Korea. For its part, the Pyongyang regime has insisted that it will not unilaterally disarm, and has demanded the relaxation of international sanctions before offering any more concessions on its nuclear programme. Kim Jong-un is also demanding security guarantees from the US, and a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean conflict. The last time Kim Yong-chol, whose official title is vice-chairman of the Workers\u2019 party, was in Washington, to finalise arrangements for Singapore, he presented Trump with a letter from the North Korean leader in an outsized envelope. Trump and Kim Jong-un have already exchanged letters in recent weeks, and the US president at one point claimed that they were so positive, the two men had \u201cfallen in love\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with North Korean envoy, Kim Yong Choi, has ended, according to the White House pool report. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders sent this readout from the meeting: President Donald J Trump met with Kim Yong Chol for an hour and half, to discuss denuclearization and a second summit, which will take place near the end of February. The President looks forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at a place to be announced at a later date. The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, said despite Trump\u2019s claim North Korea would substantially dismantle its nuclear programme, that hasn\u2019t happened since their first summit in June 2018. As the longest government shutdown in US history drags on, the president is encouraging his supporters to donate to his 2020 campaign. In return, his campaign claims it will send \u201cred faux bricks\u201d to Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and House majority leader, Nancy Pelosi. We don\u2019t know whether Trump\u2019s border wall will be made of steel or concrete and we don\u2019t know if the faux bricks will be made of foam or plaster (or polyurethane!) It\u2019s also not clear this will be a big fundraiser... A basic, red, prop foam brick is $20 a pop on this prop website. And to get a brick sent to Chuck and Nancy, donors must spend at least $20.20 - which would not leave much of a profit, even with a steep brick discount. Maybe Mexico is paying for the faux red bricks. This weekend is the third annual Women\u2019s March, but it is going forward under a cloud of controversy because of ties between its top organizers and anti-semite, Louis Farrakhan. The Guardian\u2019s Erin Durkin writes that the controversy has seen march sponsors withdraw and led local chapters of the group to disaffiliate from the central organization. The result is that there will be two major women\u2019s marches taking place on the streets of New York and many other cities around the country on Saturday \u2013 the original one, which emphasizes leadership by women of color, and another \u2013 March On \u2013 formed in opposition to antisemitism. \u201cFounded by the leaders of many of the marches across the country, March On is women-led, but open to all, and will employ a sophisticated political strategy to coordinate concrete actions at the federal, state, and local level through the joint efforts of millions of marchers,\u201d the March On website states. Lee Weal, an activist based in New York City, told the Guardian that while she went to the second Women\u2019s March and had been planning to go to the third this year, the group\u2019s ties to Farrakhan put her off. \u201cIf we insist that Trump disavow people like David Duke, you can\u2019t have a different rule for those on the left,\u201d she said, adding she thought leaders were \u201churting the movement\u201d by aligning with him. Women in more than 30 countries around the world are also expected to gather on Saturday as part of the global Women\u2019s March, to protest against violence against women and the impact of policies of austerity. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, has asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to see if she committed perjury while testifying under oath about family separation. Last night, the senator published a leaked memo that showed the Trump administration had been planning the family separation policy in December 2017. Nielsen, however, said while under oath in testimony before Congress: \u201cI\u2019m not a liar, we\u2019ve never had a policy for family separation.\u201d Donald Trump and Mike Pence made surprise remarks at the country\u2019s largest demonstration against abortion, the March for Life, this afternoon. While Pence attended the rally in-person, Trump addressed the march in videotaped remarks. \u201cWhen we look into the eyes of a newborn child, we see the beauty and the human soul and the majesty of God\u2019s creation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe know that every life has meaning.\u201d He then touted the administration\u2019s work to restrict abortion access in the US. A bombshell report in Buzzfeed that Donald Trump directed his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a real estate deal in Moscow has impeachment chatter at a fever pitch. There are 14 members of the Senate who were in Congress in 1999 during the Clinton impeachment trial and voted to remove him from office: Senators who voted for impeachment Charles Grassley Michael Crapo Mike Enzi James Inhofe Mitch McConnell Pat Roberts Richard Shelby House members who voted for impeachment who are now in the Senate Lindsey Graham Roy Blunt Richard Burr Jerry Moran Rob Portman John Thune Roger Wicker While hard to say how they would vote if the House would pass articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, many of the senators are among the president\u2019s closest allies. Yet their past pronouncements on impeachment against a Democratic president might suggest support for the process, should it be proven Trump obstructed justice or submitted false testimony. It is also true that many Republicans stood by Richard Nixon until public opinion swung sharply against him. With little public or political support, he resigned before an impeachment vote took place. Washington is abuzz with the Buzzfeed bombshell report overnight that Donald Trump personally directed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about an effort to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Top Democrats have vowed to investigate the serious allegation, which would amount to obstruction of justice by the president, especially given their new power in key House committees since winning control of the House in the midterm elections. Trump has been meeting a top North Korean official at the White House to talk nukes. Melania Trump is at Mar-a-Lago and flew there on a government plane, although the government shutdown apparently caused POTUS to nix a trip by Nancy Pelosi to Afghanistan on a...government plane. The Senate convened just long enough this morning for the Dems to try to squeeze through legislation to reopen the Department of Homeland Security for a few weeks, and for the GOP to block it. The White House sent a statement to the press pool earlier, without naming the person quoted. It accuses Pelosi\u2019s camp of a \u201cflat out lie\u201d in accusing the WH of leaking her plans to fly commercial after Trump blocked her war-zone trip on government flights. Requests from the pool for a named statement on the record have so far gone unanswered. \u201cWhen the Speaker of the house and about 20 others from Capitol Hill decide to book their own commercial flights to Afghanistan, the world is going to find out. The idea we would leak anything that would put the safety and security of any American at risk is a flat out lie,\u201d said the statement from a senior WH official. Pelosi said the White House exposed her plans and made the trip to Afghanistan too risky. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to go because we had a report from Afghanistan that the president outing out trip had made feet on the ground much more dangerous because it\u2019s a signal to bad actors that we were coming,\u201d Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. Mitch McConnell lends himself to cartoons almost as well as Trump. Rob Rogers has skewered the Senate majority leader today. Rogers has become more seething, less subtle, in his art since being ousted from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last year. Here\u2019s his offering on Mitch today. The US Senate was very briefly in session this morning. Just a handful of senators rattling around the chamber, but enough for the Democratic side to attempt to advance legislation re-opening the Department of Homeland Security and the GOP side to block it. The Hill reported that Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine asked to take up a bill passed by the Dem-dominated House that would fund the DHS until February 8 (lest we forget, the day after Michael Cohen is due to testify on Capitol Hill). James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, blocked the request, objecting \u201con behalf of the majority leader\u201d, referring to Kentucky Republican and Senate leviathan Mitch McConnell. McConnell has vowed not to allow a vote in the GOP-dominated Senate on bills Trump won\u2019t sign, which so far covers anything aimed at reopening the federal government but without Trump\u2019s requested $5.7 billion funding for his wall. Donald Trump is reportedly at this minute meeting in the White House with North Korean envoy Kim Yong-choi. Reuters reported that press sec Sarah Sanders announced the meeting. We await further details. \u201cPelosi told reporters that WH leaking of their travel plans scrapped their trip, calling it \u201cvery irresponsible\u201d and saying it endangered lawmakers traveling there,\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju just tweeted, after Pelosi addressed a media huddle in the halls of Congress. She\u2019s accused Trump of leaking her plans to fly commercial as an alternative to using government-provided aircraft, which the president blocked yesterday afternoon just as Pelosi and a congressional entourage was about to leave for the airport. Trump cited the shutdown, but most saw an upping of the ante in the bitter shutdown battle between Republicans and Democrats and now, specifically, Trump and Pelosi. Critics were already pointing out that exposing plans in advance that a high-profile delegation would visit a war zone, using taxpayer-funded government aircraft, could endanger the politicians, troops on the ground and security personnel. Nancy Pelosi was asked if she believed Trump\u2019s White House may have leaked details of her trip as \u201cretaliation\u201d for her request on Wednesday that the president delay his State of the Union speech, due January 29, because of security concerns during the government shutdown. \u201cI would hope not,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the president would be that petty, do you?\u201d Pelosi is so practiced at earnest smooth-talking you can\u2019t even see the tongue jammed into the cheek. Nancy Pelosi is speaking with reporters this minute on Capitol Hill. She\u2019s slamming the White House for, as she believes, \u201cleaking\u201d details of her planned trip to Afghanistan - a war zone, which breaks protocol. The White House has denied leaking anything. \u201cWe\u2019ll go again. We\u2019ll go another time,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, World Affairs! The Associated Press reports that the US and North Korea began fresh talks today aimed at resuming stalled efforts to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program. So the buzz is all about arranging a second summit between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, following the fanfare around what the Guardian figured was littel more than a glorified photo-op in June last year. AP continues: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea\u2019s former spy chief, Kim Yong Chol, did not respond to reporters\u2019 questions before their meeting at a Washington hotel today. Pompeo, Kim and Steve Biegun, the special US envoy for North Korea negotiations, stood silently as photographers took photos. Pompeo and Kim had plans to go to the White House later for a possible meeting with Trump. Veep Mike Pence said earlier that the Trump-Kim dialogue was \u201cpromising\u201d but that \u201cwe still await concrete steps by North Korea to dismantle the nuclear weapons that threaten our people and our allies in the region.\u201d A planned meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol in New York last November was called off abruptly. US officials said at the time that North Korea had canceled the session. Kim Jong Un expressed frustration in an annual New Year\u2019s address over the lack of progress in negotiations. But on a visit to Beijing last week, he said North Korea would pursue a second summit \u201cto achieve results that will be welcomed by the international community,\u201d according to China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency. A slightly different take from Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who said on Twitter: \u201cListen, if Mueller does have multiple sources confirming Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress, then we need to know this ASAP. Mueller shouldn\u2019t end his inquiry, but it\u2019s about time for him to show Congress his cards before it\u2019s too late for us to act.\u201d Got it. But in this hyper-speed, information saturation, 24-7 connectivity news time warp we now live in, a little shy of two years is really not long for an investigation of the complexity and scale of Robert Mueller\u2019s. He\u2019s shown plenty of cards, defying the norm that most packs have only two jokers (Manafort, Cohen, Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, Russian hackers, need we go on?) But curious to hear more about what Murphy means when he said \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late for us to act\u201d. Here\u2019s the full statement: Chairman Schiff Statement on BuzzFeed Report Washington, DC \u2014 Today, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement: \u201cOn October 24, 2017, Michael Cohen testified before the House Intelligence Committee under oath. We now know that he made false statements about the efforts to consummate the Trump Tower Moscow deal during the campaign. Contrary to Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony, and notwithstanding Donald Trump\u2019s many public denials of business dealings with the Russians during the campaign, those negotiations continued through at least the middle of 2016. Most significantly, and while espousing the relaxation of sanctions on Russia, Trump was seeking the Kremlin\u2019s help to make this multimillion dollar project possible. \u201cIt is now alleged that the President of the United States directed Michael Cohen to lie under oath to Congress about these matters in an effort to impede the investigation and to cover up his business dealings with Russia. These allegations may prove unfounded, but, if true, they would constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice. Our committee is already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters. As a counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude, and given that these alleged efforts were intended to interfere with our investigation, our Committee is determined to get to the bottom of this and follow the evidence wherever it may lead.\u201d Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House intelligence committee, has put out a statement pledging in strong terms to investigate allegations that Donald Trump had business dealings with Russia during the 2016 election campaign and has since directed ex-fixer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about it. He calls the latest revelations and claims: \u201cA counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude\u201d and pledges that the powerful committee will \u201cget to the bottom of this.\u201d If presidential crime and punishment discussions aren\u2019t going away any time soon, neither is the issue of the US-Mexico border. Starting off in the \u2018you have to laugh or you\u2019d cry\u2019 zone, here is the latest cover of the New Yorker. One of those most wonderfully-drawn zingers, it shows Trump in the Oval Office grimly bricking himself in with a literal wall. Razor wire looping along the top and all balanced as precariously as this authority, atop the Resolute desk. As the New Yorker says itself, the cartoon is by the artist John Cuneo, who last year depicted the President enjoying a day of golfing in the swamp. \u201cWhen it comes to drawing Trump, I\u2019ve kind of hit the wall myself,\u201d Cuneo said. \u201cHalf of a face is more than enough.\u201d Cuneo\u2019s image nods to a magazine cover from another era\u2014the drawing, by Boris Artzybasheff, for the August 31, 1962, issue of Time, depicting the Berlin Wall. We won\u2019t sidetrack for more than a moment on Cohen\u2019s father-in-law Fima Shusterman, but as Trump keeps bringing him up, here\u2019s a quick recap. Shusterman, was charged with two other men in 1993 with conspiring to defraud the IRS in connection with his New York taxi business. He pleaded guilty to a related charge that same year, and was placed on probation for two years. He reportedly loaned at least $20 million to a Chicago taxi business mogul referred to in FBI search warrants for Michael Cohen, according to this CNBC report. Trump told Fox News in a phone interview last weekend that be believed that Cohen decided to give prosecutors information on him, in order to get a reduced sentence from his crimes. He told Fox: \u201cHe should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that\u2019s the one that people want to look at.\u201d Michael Cohen\u2019s background is certainly colorful, or shady, whichever way you\u2019d like to put it. Here\u2019s one of the Guardian\u2019s profiles of \u201cthe lawyer who rose from the taxi business to fixing the future president\u2019s messiest problems\u201d to conviction in a New York courtroom. Cohen was convicted of campaign finance violation, tax fraud and bank fraud, last August and convicted of lying to Congress, last November. He\u2019s been sentenced to three years in prison. The man who once said he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump but has now directly and repeatedly implicated the president in criminal conduct. Donald Trump has responded to the BuzzFeed story. By quoting Fox News! And repeating his odd reference to Michael Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, while, again, accusing his former close friend and lawyer Cohen of lying. More high-level reaction to the account that Donald Trump is said to have directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Jerry Nadler, representative of New York and chairman of the House judiciary committee, tweeted this morning that directing a subordinate to lie to Congress is a federal crime. \u201cWe know that the President has engaged in a long pattern of obstruction. Directing a subordinate to lie to Congress is a federal crime. The @HouseJudiciary Committee\u2019s job is to get to the bottom of it, and we will do that work.\u201d The heat in Washington doesn\u2019t seem to lessen whether Congress is in session or not, these days. The public record noting that Donald Trump has no public events scheduled and Congress isn\u2019t sitting makes no different to the red hot stream of volcanic news gushing down Pennsylvania Avenue. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has just issued a statement, following the chaos triggered yesterday afternoon when the president escalated his feud with her by canceling her previously undisclosed trip abroad, denying her the use of a military aircraft to visit American troops in Afghanistan. The spectacular snub came a day after Pelosi suggested the president either postpone or submit in writing his 29 January State of the Union address, citing security concerns stemming from the partial shutdown of the federal government. Hours after Pelosi said Trump had been \u201csilent\u201d in response to her request, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders posted a letter from Trump to the House speaker postponing her travel, while dripping in sarcasm. \u201cIn light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate ... It would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me,\u201d the letter said in part. Trump also said Pelosi was welcome to purchase tickets on a commercial flight ... (Let it be noted that on Thursday night, Melania Trump flew to their private club and resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago, on a government plane.) Pelosi has now issued a statement, which says, in large part: \u201cAfter President Trump revoked the use of military aircraft to travel to Afghanistan, the delegation was prepared to fly commercially to proceed with this vital trip to meet with our commanders and troops on the front lines. \u201cIn the middle of the night, the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service provided an updated threat assessment detailing that the President announcing this sensitive travel had significantly increased the danger to the delegation and to the troops, security, and other officials supporting the trip.\u201d The statement was issued by Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, Drew Hammill. It went on to say: \u201cIn light of the grave threats caused by the President\u2019s action, the delegation has decided to postpone the trip so as not to further endanger our troops and security personnel, or the other travelers on the flights.\u201d Casting your mind back ... oh, just a couple of days ... Donald Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, William Barr, told senators at his confirmation hearing that it would be a crime for a president to try to coach a Congressional witness. South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham asked Barr if it was a crime if \u201cthe president tried to coach somebody not to testify, or testify falsely?\u201d Barr didn\u2019t obfuscate or equivocate. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder an obstruction statute, yes.\u201d For avoidance of doubt, Democrat Amy Klobuchar said to Barr: \u201cYou wrote ... that a president persuading a person to commit perjury would be obstruction, is that right?\u201d Barr replied, yes. Here\u2019s the clip: David Axelrod, long-time Democratic party insider and Barack Obama\u2019s former senior adviser, said on CNN on Friday morning that if the Buzzfeed story was true then Trump was \u201cin a new type of trouble, no question about it.\u201d Other commentators called the article a \u201cbombshell\u201d, in the already-cratered legal landscape surrounding the president. As special counsel Robert Mueller continues the Trump-Russia investigation and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani suddenly switches to say he \u201cnever said there was no collusion\u201d between the campaign and Russia, is this what \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d begins to look like? Axelrod went on to say: \u201cIt sets up an extraordinary event\u201d when Cohen testifies to Congress. \u201cIt reminds me of 1973,\u201d he said. Michael Cohen is due to testify to Congress next month. Prior to the latest allegations, there had been some doubts around it as he expressed concerns for the safety of his family. But the latest signs are that he appears to be bracing himself to go ahead and appear before the House Oversight Committee on February 7. Democrats have come flying out of the gate over the BuzzFeed story that Trump directed his ex-fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. A very sober-sounding Adam Schiff, California Democrat and the new chairman of the House intelligence committee, whom Trump has delighted in calling puerile names, went straight for the P-word. He posted on Twitter: \u201cThe allegation that the President of the United States may have suborned perjury before our committee in an effort to curtail the investigation and cover up his business dealings with Russia is among the most serious to date. We will do what\u2019s necessary to find out if it\u2019s true.\u201d Texas Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro, who\u2019s brother Juli\u00e1n Castro has announced he\u2019s running for president in the 2020 election, immediately went for the \u201cI\u201d word. \u201cIf the @BuzzFeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached,\u201d he tweeted briskly. Good morning. The Guardian US team plans to take you through what promises to be another action-packed day in American politics. There\u2019s no sense of TGIF when Donald Trump\u2019s in the White House. The president is apparently in a \u201cwhole new type of trouble\u201d today after BuzzFeed broke an explosive story reporting that he directed ex-fixer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. As reaction pours in, everyone is still reeling from Trump\u2019s one-upmanship of Nancy Pelosi, when he nixed her government trip to Afghanistan as she was about to head to the airport yesterday afternoon. Partisan warring over the government shutdown, which today enters a record day 28, just gets deeper and darker. This as today\u2019s anti-abortion protest and tomorrow\u2019s Women\u2019s March fill the streets with voices arguing opposite messages \u2013 and Democratic presidential wannabes get ready for a long weekend of speeches heading into Martin Luther King Day. Watch this spot for US politics live!",

After the firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/06/nhs-boss-calls-on-superdrug-to-screen-botox-customers\">announced last September</a> that it was making Botox available in its outlets, he had demanded it do everything possible to protect potentially vulnerable customers.</p> <p>In a letter this week to Peter Macnab, the company\u2019s chief executive, Powis said that at a recent meeting between the two about the issue \u201cSuperdrug acknowledged that further, specific protections could be put in place to safeguard people whose motivation to undergo cosmetic treatment was driven by, linked to or could trigger mental health issues like body dysmorphic disorder.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is encouraging to hear that you are taking this matter seriously and have agreed to put in place these additional protections.\u201d</p> <p>Superdrug said its enhanced screening would draw on a questionnaire approved by the <a href=\"https://bddfoundation.org/\">Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation</a>, but would not use it in its entirety.</p> <p>Kitty Wallace, a trustee of the foundation, said most people with BDD remain unsatisfied with their appearance even after paying for steps to try to improve it.</p> <p>\u201cStudies show that fewer than 10% of patients with BDD are satisfied with the results of cosmetic procedures,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important that these measures are in place to protect such individuals from potentially damaging and unnecessary procedures. </p> <p>\u201cAlthough their anxiety might ease temporarily, they will often find themselves fixating on another part of their body that they want to change.\u201d</p> <p>Wallace suggested Superdrug should refer anyone identified through its new screening process as having BDD to their GP and Mind, the mental health charity.</p> <p>Superdrug said nurses specialising in \u201caesthetic medicine\u201d would undertake an hour-long \u201cfull and extensive consultation\u201d with anyone seeking anti-ageing treatments such as Botox, examining their motivation, before they could start treatment.</p> <p>\u201cThis enables us to ensure we understand our patients\u2019 reasons for wanting aesthetic treatments. It also flags to our team any risks or concerns related to a patient\u2019s mental health.\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing a productive meeting with the NHS, and as part of the ongoing development of our Skin Review service, we have added additional questioning specific to body dysmorphic disorder, in line with NHS recommendations.

      "bodyText": "Superdrug is tightening its screening for people seeking Botox, to ensure that those with mental health problems are not having injections because they are dissatisfied with their body. The high-street beauty and pharmacy chain has acted after NHS bosses criticised it for not conducting \u201cmedically responsible\u201d checks before customers start treatment. It has agreed to introduce enhanced screening specifically designed to see if those asking to have Botox or similar anti-ageing procedures have body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). People with BDD worry obsessively about their appearance and some may seek cosmetic treatments or surgery to correct what they they see as flaws. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s medical director, welcomed Superdrug\u2019s move. After the firm announced last September that it was making Botox available in its outlets, he had demanded it do everything possible to protect potentially vulnerable customers. In a letter this week to Peter Macnab, the company\u2019s chief executive, Powis said that at a recent meeting between the two about the issue \u201cSuperdrug acknowledged that further, specific protections could be put in place to safeguard people whose motivation to undergo cosmetic treatment was driven by, linked to or could trigger mental health issues like body dysmorphic disorder.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is encouraging to hear that you are taking this matter seriously and have agreed to put in place these additional protections.\u201d Superdrug said its enhanced screening would draw on a questionnaire approved by the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, but would not use it in its entirety. Kitty Wallace, a trustee of the foundation, said most people with BDD remain unsatisfied with their appearance even after paying for steps to try to improve it. \u201cStudies show that fewer than 10% of patients with BDD are satisfied with the results of cosmetic procedures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important that these measures are in place to protect such individuals from potentially damaging and unnecessary procedures. \u201cAlthough their anxiety might ease temporarily, they will often find themselves fixating on another part of their body that they want to change.\u201d Wallace suggested Superdrug should refer anyone identified through its new screening process as having BDD to their GP and Mind, the mental health charity. Superdrug said nurses specialising in \u201caesthetic medicine\u201d would undertake an hour-long \u201cfull and extensive consultation\u201d with anyone seeking anti-ageing treatments such as Botox, examining their motivation, before they could start treatment. \u201cThis enables us to ensure we understand our patients\u2019 reasons for wanting aesthetic treatments. It also flags to our team any risks or concerns related to a patient\u2019s mental health.\u201d it said. \u201cFollowing a productive meeting with the NHS, and as part of the ongoing development of our Skin Review service, we have added additional questioning specific to body dysmorphic disorder, in line with NHS recommendations. These inclusions far exceed current standards.\u201d Last year NHS England\u2019s chief executive, Simon Stevens, criticised ITV for screening advertisements for cosmetic surgery in breaks during Love Island. He has also called for a new levy on social media platforms to help fund the rising cost to the NHS of treating children and young people with mental health problems. Powis voiced concern that the cosmetic treatment industry was self-regulated. \u201cThe lack of tough checks on cosmetic procedures means that the public is dependent on businesses taking voluntary steps to get their house in order, leaving people avoidably exposed to dangerous practices,\u201d he said.
