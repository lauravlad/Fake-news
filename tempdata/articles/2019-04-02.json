Any delay would end if and when a deal was struck, she said. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, appeared to indicate the EU was minded to accede.</li> \n   <li><strong>Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are to meet to discuss a way to break the Brexit impasse.</strong> In the same address, the prime minister invited the Labour leader to talks on Tuesday after seven hours of cabinet discussions. Corbyn accepted the offer soon afterwards. It followed MPs\u2019 failure to find an alternative way forward on Monday.</li> \n   <li><strong>May\u2019s plan called for the two leaders to agree a unified approach to put to MPs.</strong> If they couldn\u2019t do so, the prime minister said she\u2019d put forward a series of options and abide by MPs\u2019 choice \u2013 as long as Corbyn also agreed to do the same.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cabinet ministers were tight-lipped after their marathon meeting, amid reports of a split.</strong> Afterwards, the environment secretary Michael Gove spoke publicly in support of the prime minister\u2019s approach.</li> \n   <li><strong>But many senior Brexiters were unimpressed with May\u2019s plan.</strong> Some members of the Tory backbench ERG attacked it, as did the DUP. Other senior parliamentarians, however, applauded the prime minister\u2019s decision to try \u2013 after nearly three years \u2013 to find a consensus across the aisle.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Business leaders offered a cautious welcome.</strong> But many said they wanted to see Westminster get on with offering certainty over Brexit.</li> \n   <li><strong>Earlier in the day, the Irish prime minister had said May must have a clear plan to be granted a further delay.</strong> Speaking alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Leo Varadkar said the EU wanted to avoid a rolling Brexit.</li> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister was accused of putting her party before the country.</strong> Nick Boles spoke out a day after quitting the Tory party over what he characterised as its intransigence over Brexit. But he was one of those to cautiously welcome May\u2019s change of approach after her speech in the evening.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you want to read more, my colleagues <strong>Rowena Mason, Peter Walker, Rajeev Syal</strong> and <strong>Heather Stewart</strong> have the full story:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/02/theresa-may-calls-for-talks-with-jeremy-corbyn-in-bid-to-save-brexit\">May calls for talks with Corbyn in bid to save Brexit</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca3cfdde4b0b4d18bde4ff4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-02T21:19:10.135Z\">10.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The hard Brexit-supporting DUP have released a statement on Theresa May\u2019s offer to Jeremy Corbyn and, like the assessments of members of the similarly positioned ERG, it is scathing:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister\u2019s lamentable handling of the negotiations with the EU means she has failed to deliver a sensible Brexit deal that works for all parts of the United Kingdom.

But leaving with a deal is the best solution. So, we will need a further extension of article 50 \u2013 one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal. And we need to be clear what such an extension is for \u2013 to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way.</p> \n   <p>This debate, this division, cannot drag on much longer. It is putting members of Parliament and everyone else under immense pressure and it is doing damage to our politics.</p> \n   <p>Despite the best efforts of MPs, the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer. So, today, I am taking action to break the logjam: I am offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan \u2013 that we would both stick to \u2013 to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal.</p> \n   <p>Any plan would have to agree the current withdrawal agreement \u2013 it has already been negotiated with the 27 other members, and the EU has repeatedly said that it cannot and will not be reopened.</p> \n   <p>What we need to focus on is our future relationship with the EU. The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the house for approval, and which I could then take to next week\u2019s European council.</p> \n   <p>However, if we cannot agree on a single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the house in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. Crucially, the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the house. But, to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too.</p> \n   <p>The government would then bring forward the withdrawal agreement bill. We would want to agree a timetable for this bill to ensure it is passed before 22 May so that the United Kingdom need not take part in European parliamentary elections.</p> \n   <p>This is a difficult time for everyone. Passions are running high on all sides of the argument. But we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for. This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands. And it requires national unity to deliver the national interest.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-02T17:44:13.611Z\">at 6.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca39b36e4b0347f70e7855f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-02T17:27:38.754Z\">6.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the minutes since <strong>Theresa May </strong>finished delivering her statement, cabinet ministers have been filing out of Downing Street.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt, Liz Truss, James Brokenshire, Amber Rudd, Chris Grayling </strong>and <strong>Damian Hinds</strong> left via the front door of Number 10.

He told the Guardian: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A long extension will happen. I\u2019m not just saying that: we know that will happen. We\u2019ve been speaking to people in the EU and the EU is desperate for the signal to be given by parliament which gives them the excuse for a long extension. It will happen, I\u2019m pretty clear on that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Blackford said intensive cross-party talks were now under way among MPs anxious to find a compromise deal on a far softer Brexit which would be good enough to win a Commons majority following the failure of all four alternative options on Monday night. That would then present the EU with the pretext for delaying Brexit for months.</p> \n  <p>He defended the SNP\u2019s decision to abstain on the Ken Clarke proposal to require customs union membership, insisting it failed to meet the SNP\u2019s key tests on freedom of movement and free access for the banking, finance and services sector to the EU.</p> \n  <p>Clarke\u2019s motion came the closest to success, losing by just three votes on Monday. The SNP, which has the greatest voting discipline of the parties on Brexit, commands 35 votes.

There was a stage, shortly before the government lost meaningful vote two (MV2), when ministers like David Gauke and Greg Clark sounded genuinely hopeful that an indicative votes process might generate parliamentary support for a softer Brexit. But, in the light of the 12 no votes on Wednesday last week and last night, that optimism seems to be fading.</p> \n  <p>And when you ask Number 10 about alternatives to May\u2019s, you quickly hit a brick wall. Re-negotiating the backstop? They don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. A customs union? But the UK would not be able to strike its own trade deal? Norway? Ending free movement is a firm red line. And a second referendum? God forbid.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca34f36e4b0347f70e781e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-02T12:25:48.194Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oliver Letwin says passing Cooper bill will be 'difficult' (and why he's right)</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sir Oliver Letwin, </strong>who is supporting the Cooper bill (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/apr/02/brexit-latest-news-live-cabinet-theresa-may-barnier-says-extending-article-50-again-to-help-uk-would-pose-significant-risks-to-eu-live-news?page=with:block-5ca34a93e4b0347f70e78196#block-5ca34a93e4b0347f70e78196\">12.56pm)</a>, has also issued a statement about the bill. But he sounds a bit more downbeat about its chances than Yvette Cooper herself. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a last-ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no-deal exit. We realise this is difficult. But it is definitely worth trying.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Why is Letwin saying passing the bill will be difficult? Because this move is unprecedented, and it could easily flounder in the House of Lords.</p> \n  <p>There is nothing unusual about parliament passing a backbench bill. There is an established system for this,<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/bills/private-members/\"> the private members\u2019 bills system</a>, and several bills get published this way every year.</p> \n  <p>But what Cooper and Letwin are trying is different. They have used an amendment to a business motion to seize control of the Commons timetable to create time for MPs to pass a bill against the wishes of the government. There is no precedent for this in modern times.</p> \n  <p>One problem for Cooper and Letwin is that MPs may feel they are abusing the process. On Monday last week, when originally passed the Letwin amendment allowing him to take control of Commons business for one day, it was to allow an indicative votes debate on Wednesday 27 March. But it has become a self-perpetuating process, and on the Wednesday Letwin grabbed a second day (yesterday), yesterday he grabbed a third day (tomorrow) and tomorrow he will grab a fourth (Thursday). Until now Letwin has maintained his 40-odd majority for all the business motions he has to pass, but some MPs may argue that he is abusing the process.</p> \n  <p>But the main problem is that Cooper cannot be sure to fast-track her bill through the House of Lords. The Commons cannot tell the Lords what to do, and in the upper chamber bills cannot be subject to programme motions saying they have to pass within a certain time limit. In theory, peers can drag on proceedings as long as they like. In practice this tends not to happen, but there are some hardline Brexiters in the chamber and they could decide to disrupt the Cooper bill, arguing that they are entitled to hold it up because it is setting a new constitutional precedent.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"218f77da97ce31653b55f40a885358d25009db20\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/218f77da97ce31653b55f40a885358d25009db20/0_33_1595_957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Letwin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Letwin</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-02T12:29:14.412Z\">at 1.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ca34a93e4b0347f70e78196\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-02T11:56:07.726Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yvette Cooper unveils plan to let MPs vote for bill forcing May to extend article 50</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong> has now published the text of her EU (withdrawal) (no 5) bill (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/apr/02/brexit-latest-news-live-cabinet-theresa-may-barnier-says-extending-article-50-again-to-help-uk-would-pose-significant-risks-to-eu-live-news?page=with:block-5ca34374e4b0347f70e78123#block-5ca34374e4b0347f70e78123\">12.20pm) </a>- her attempt to legislate to force Theresa May to request an extension to article 50.

It is not entirely clear how this would work, because the Fixed-term Parliaments Act means a prime minister can no longer simply declare that a vote is a confidence issue, and if the government does lose a confidence vote under the FTPA, an election would only happen if no one else can form an administration capable of winning a confidence vote within 14 days.</p> \n  <p>But that has not stopped the idea being discussed at Westminster.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with the BBC, <strong>David Davis</strong>, who resigned as Brexit secretary last summer because he opposed Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan, said that if May sought a long extension to article 50, that would \u201ctear apart\u201d the Tories. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019d only make one warning to the cabinet ... don\u2019t be sure that every Conservative MP would vote for you if it was made a confidence vote. </p> \n   <p>One or two of them have said already ... and, I think, probably about 20 of them would say, this, actually, is so important, it\u2019s the future of our country. </p> \n   <p>It\u2019s our destiny at stake.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening, so here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister said she planned to ask the European Union for a further delay to Brexit. Speaking from Downing Street, Theresa May said she understood some people\u2019s desire for a no-deal Brexit but that she wanted time to find a settlement. Any delay would end if and when a deal was struck, she said. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, appeared to indicate the EU was minded to accede. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are to meet to discuss a way to break the Brexit impasse. In the same address, the prime minister invited the Labour leader to talks on Tuesday after seven hours of cabinet discussions. Corbyn accepted the offer soon afterwards. It followed MPs\u2019 failure to find an alternative way forward on Monday. May\u2019s plan called for the two leaders to agree a unified approach to put to MPs. If they couldn\u2019t do so, the prime minister said she\u2019d put forward a series of options and abide by MPs\u2019 choice \u2013 as long as Corbyn also agreed to do the same. Cabinet ministers were tight-lipped after their marathon meeting, amid reports of a split. Afterwards, the environment secretary Michael Gove spoke publicly in support of the prime minister\u2019s approach. But many senior Brexiters were unimpressed with May\u2019s plan. Some members of the Tory backbench ERG attacked it, as did the DUP. Other senior parliamentarians, however, applauded the prime minister\u2019s decision to try \u2013 after nearly three years \u2013 to find a consensus across the aisle. Business leaders offered a cautious welcome. But many said they wanted to see Westminster get on with offering certainty over Brexit. Earlier in the day, the Irish prime minister had said May must have a clear plan to be granted a further delay. Speaking alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Leo Varadkar said the EU wanted to avoid a rolling Brexit. The prime minister was accused of putting her party before the country. Nick Boles spoke out a day after quitting the Tory party over what he characterised as its intransigence over Brexit. But he was one of those to cautiously welcome May\u2019s change of approach after her speech in the evening. If you want to read more, my colleagues Rowena Mason, Peter Walker, Rajeev Syal and Heather Stewart have the full story: The hard Brexit-supporting DUP have released a statement on Theresa May\u2019s offer to Jeremy Corbyn and, like the assessments of members of the similarly positioned ERG, it is scathing: The prime minister\u2019s lamentable handling of the negotiations with the EU means she has failed to deliver a sensible Brexit deal that works for all parts of the United Kingdom. That is why she has not been able to get it through parliament. Her announcement therefore tonight comes as little surprise. Though it remains to be seen if subcontracting out the future of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn, someone whom the Conservatives have demonised for four years, will end happily. We want the result of the referendum respected and, just as we joined the common market as one country, we must leave the EU as one country. We will continue to use our position within Parliament and with the government to argue strongly the case for Northern Ireland and the integrity of the United Kingdom. We remain consistent in judging all Brexit outcomes against our clear unionist principles. Boris Johnson has told the BBC that people want politicians in Westminster \u201cnot to focus on themselves, but to focus on the needs of the country\u201d. The European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, damns May with faint praise: A little more from Gove\u2019s interview on Sky News: He insisted the Tory party would not split over May\u2019s decision today. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re splitting \u2013 I think what we\u2019re doing is ensuring everybody is focused on making sure we leave the EU at the earliest possible point. On the DUP saying they could not back the current deal, he said: We want the DUP to support our approach. I think it\u2019s important we leave the EU as one UK. And, on his own leadership ambitions, he added: I\u2019m concentrating on making sure we leave the EU, that is front and centre of my mind and everything else is secondary. There is now a conflicting report on the split in the cabinet, with another source telling the Press Association that ministers voted 17 to four in favour of the limited extension sought by the prime minister. Gavin Williamson, Penny Mordaunt, Chris Grayling and Liz Truss opposed the extension, according to the source. Of the 17 who backed it, Jeremy Wright and James Brokenshire made a point of saying they only wanted a short extension to the Article 50 process. The source said: \u201cThis is a pragmatic way forward. PM clear that we won\u2019t leave with no deal in April.\u201d The environment secretary, Michael Gove, is now on Sky News defending the proposal, saying its most important facet is that it is limited and ends, unequivocally, with Brexit. His former Vote Leave colleague, Boris Johnson, is less enthused: The director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, Carolyn Fairbairn, has echoed the words of other business leaders this evening, saying: Welcome steps must be breakthrough, not false dawn. Business confidence slumping, growth stalled and UK reputation in tatters. Tories must compromise on red lines and Labour come to table in good faith. No excuses, no time wasting, no party politics. Enough is enough. Dr Adam Marshall, the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: The clock is still ticking and avoiding a messy and disorderly exit from the EU is still the top priority for our business communities. The government must take firm action now to ensure that this is not allowed to happen by default. Yet businesses need to see outcomes, not just more process. Ongoing uncertainty is having a real and negative impact on business confidence and investment all across the UK. Our own quarterly survey of businesses is concrete evidence of this, with the worst figures across the board in nearly a decade. The prime minister may have issued a revised road map, but business communities still have little sense of the destination. It\u2019s like being asked to follow a sat-nav to an unknown location \u2013 with the nagging worry that the directions may yet lead to a cliff. The chair of the parliamentary home affairs select committee, Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, has welcomed what she called the prime minister\u2019s \u201crecognition that she needs to avoid a damaging no-deal on April 12th\u201d. When the cabinet secretary and national security adviser to the government had advised the cabinet that no-deal would make the country less safe, it would have been irresponsible of them not to listen. We do need a sensible approach and the prime minister needs to find a way to bring the country together, not just Parliament. We are waiting to find out further details on how the government\u2019s proposed process will work, including how decisions will be taken about the length and purpose of an extension, and how indicative votes will work to make sure we don\u2019t just end up with no-deal a bit later on. The Labour party has just put out Corbyn\u2019s response to May\u2019s statement: I\u2019m very happy to meet the prime minister. I don\u2019t want to set any limits, one way or the other, ahead of those meetings. We recognise that she has made a move. I recognise my responsibility to represent the people who supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn\u2019t support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future. And that\u2019s the basis on which we will meet her and have those discussions. Labour has put forward our proposals to ensure there is a customs union with the EU, access to vital markets and protections of our standards of consumer, environmental and workers\u2019 rights. And we\u2019ll ensure that those are on the table. We\u2019re also very clear that there has to be an absolute guarantee that the Good Friday Agreement is maintained for peace in Northern Ireland. So far, the prime minister hasn\u2019t shown much sign of compromise but I\u2019m pleased that today she\u2019s indicated she\u2019ll accept the view of Parliament and is prepared to reach out and have that discussion. I have been meeting MPs from all parties over the past weeks. And there is some common ground; there are some areas it\u2019s difficult to agree on. But, however people voted in the referendum of 2016, they didn\u2019t vote for lower living standards or to lose their jobs. And there\u2019s far more that unites people on both sides than divides them. Corbyn has refused to put limits on the talks and it appears May is making similar noises: Asked whether the prime minister would be willing to discuss proposals with Corbyn that would breach her \u201cred lines\u201d \u2013 such as taking the UK out of the customs union or ruling out a second referendum \u2013 a Downing Street source told reporters: You know the prime minister\u2019s views, but unless there is compromise on both sides, it is unlikely we can find a way forward. Jeremy Corbyn has to understand that too. The source pointed out that the Commons had rejected a second referendum already. Downing Street is hoping that a meeting will happen \u201cas soon as possible\u201d but could give no timetable for the proposed votes. Corbyn said: However people voted in the referendum in 2016, whether they voted remain or they voted leave, they didn\u2019t vote for lower living standards, they didn\u2019t vote to lose their jobs. And, actually, there\u2019s far more that unites people on both sides about the kind of society we can be than divides them. The Labour leader added that the question of whether the UK takes part in the EU elections was not the most important, rather that the most prominent issue was \u201cto make sure we don\u2019t crash out of the EU next week with no deal, and what I believe would be a degree of chaos that would follow as a result\u201d. Corbyn also said that he would not set any \u201climits\u201d ahead of the meeting with the prime minister, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the \u201cneeds of the people that elected all MPs to parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out\u201d. He said that Labour would \u201chold in reserve\u201d the option of tabling a confidence motion in the government if it \u201cproves it is incapable of commanding a majority in the House of Commons\u201d, PA said. Corbyn has told the Press Association: We will meet the prime minister. We recognise that she has made a move; I recognise my responsibility to represent the people that supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn\u2019t support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future, and that\u2019s the basis on which we will meet her and we will have those discussions. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said he is \u201cvery happy\u201d to meet Theresa May after she offered to sit down with him to agree a plan that will allow the UK to leave the EU with a deal. The hard Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers in the ERG watched the prime minister\u2019s announcement in a committee room 15 in the House of Commons. There was audible gasp when she said she would open discussions with Corbyn, said one attendee. The Tory MP, Conor Burns, added: The UK no longer has a functioning government of executive control. The PM has handed the future decisions over Brexit to the Labour party. It will now be for Corbyn, Diane Abbott and John Mcdonnell to decide if the Conservative party implements its manifesto. It is a very bleak day. The ERG chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, warned history did not show success for political leaders who tried to get policy through the Commons \u201con the back of opposition votes\u201d. This approach to government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy. People did not vote for a Corbyn-May coalition government \u2013 they voted for a Conservative government, which became a confidence and supply with the DUP. This is a deeply unsatisfactory approach. It\u2019s not in the interests of the country; it fails to deliver on the referendum result and history doesn\u2019t bode well for it. Rees-Mogg criticised the prime minister for planning to work with with a \u201cknown Marxist\u201d and said the move would lose Tory votes. You do find that leaders who decide to go with the opposition rather than their own party find their own party doesn\u2019t plainly follow. I\u2019m not sure this is the way to conciliate people to persuade them if they haven\u2019t moved already to move at this stage. I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives. There are reports around that not everyone in the cabinet was thrilled with the prime minister\u2019s approach. In her speech (see: 6.36pm), May did not claim to have reached unanimous agreement with ministers. Of course, disagreements around the table are not unusual, though the convention is that ministers are expected, eventually, to agree to abide by a collective decision. And, as yet, no cabinet minister has been willing to publicly discuss their thoughts on May\u2019s statement. Edwin Morgan, the interim director general of the business group, the Institute of Directors, has welcomed the prime minister\u2019s step,while warning that there are \u201cstill many obstacles on the path ahead\u201d. There was a clear indication of how the government sees the next steps unfolding but time is of the essence and the outcome of all this is still far from clear. The brinkmanship has gone on for far too long and business leaders want our politicians to put an end to this miserable uncertainty. We urge the leader of the opposition to work with the prime minister to find a solution. Both sides must play ball. Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the country\u2019s political leadership to ensure she comes up with a workable plan quickly: Livelihoods are at stake, jobs are on the line. Food and drink manufacturers are spending money, time and effort trying to plan under a cloud of perpetual uncertainty. A further extension to article 50 must be sufficient to allow for a new plan to emerge. Unless the prime minister can secure the speedy support of the leader of the opposition, another short extension would only prolong the misery for businesses and the country. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, is the latest to studiously ignore the television camera in his face as he leaves Downing Street. Even if cabinet ministers are keeping quiet, we\u2019re getting some political reaction to the PM\u2019s statement. The leader of the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon, accuses the prime minister of kicking the can down the road. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, prefers to put the focus on the Labour party: Alistair Burt, who resigned as a Foreign Office minister last week so that he could vote for the Letwin amendment allowing MPs to take charge of the Commons timetable, had praise for Theresa May: The Liberal Democrats less so. The party\u2019s leader, Vince Cable, said: The prime minister\u2019s statement could be a case of piling more logs onto the logjam. Liberal Democrats are clear \u2013 Brexit, whether Labour-red or Tory-blue would be hugely damaging for the country. Theresa May now finally seems to be accepting that she cannot get support for her deal, though her identifying Jeremy Corbyn as a source of support for Brexit is less surprising. The way forward, to break the impasse, is for the prime minister to compromise and support a People\u2019s Vote, with the option to stay in the European Union. Its Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, tweeted: The remain-supporting former Tory MP, Anna Soubry, was no less critical of the prime minister: And the Tory Brexiter, Andrew Bridgen, dismissed May\u2019s\u2019s statement, telling the Guardian: In effectively putting Jeremy Corbyn in charge of the outcome of Brexit, the prime minister will have further diminished herself in the eyes of her MPs, activists and our supporters. It\u2019s desperate stuff. We\u2019re expecting a response from the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to Theresa May\u2019s offer to meet him for Brexit talks within the next 15 minutes or so. We\u2019ll bring you that when we have it, obviously. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, is apparently indicating that he may be open to Theresa May\u2019s suggestion of a further delay to Brexit: Here is the full text of the prime minister\u2019s statement, delivered from Downing Street about half an hour ago: I have just come from chairing seven hours of cabinet meetings focused on finding a route out of the current impasse \u2013 one that will deliver the Brexit the British people voted for and allow us to move on and begin bringing our divided country back together. I know there are some who are so fed up with delay and endless arguments that they would like to leave with no deal next week. I have always been clear that we could make a success of no deal in the long term. But leaving with a deal is the best solution. So, we will need a further extension of article 50 \u2013 one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal. And we need to be clear what such an extension is for \u2013 to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way. This debate, this division, cannot drag on much longer. It is putting members of Parliament and everyone else under immense pressure and it is doing damage to our politics. Despite the best efforts of MPs, the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer. So, today, I am taking action to break the logjam: I am offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan \u2013 that we would both stick to \u2013 to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal. Any plan would have to agree the current withdrawal agreement \u2013 it has already been negotiated with the 27 other members, and the EU has repeatedly said that it cannot and will not be reopened. What we need to focus on is our future relationship with the EU. The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the house for approval, and which I could then take to next week\u2019s European council. However, if we cannot agree on a single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the house in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. Crucially, the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the house. But, to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too. The government would then bring forward the withdrawal agreement bill. We would want to agree a timetable for this bill to ensure it is passed before 22 May so that the United Kingdom need not take part in European parliamentary elections. This is a difficult time for everyone. Passions are running high on all sides of the argument. But we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for. This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands. And it requires national unity to deliver the national interest. In the minutes since Theresa May finished delivering her statement, cabinet ministers have been filing out of Downing Street. Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt, Liz Truss, James Brokenshire, Amber Rudd, Chris Grayling and Damian Hinds left via the front door of Number 10. The Tory party chairman, Brandon Lewis, followed soon after. But none offered any comment. Nick Boles, who quit the Conservative party on Monday over what he characterised as its intransigence on Brexit, has had this to say following the prime minister\u2019s statement: May says the extension would be \u201cas short as possible\u201d and would end once a deal was struck. She says any plan both she and Corbyn agreed upon would then be put to MPs for approval with a view to it being taken to next week\u2019s European council meeting. If she and Corbyn cannot agree a unified approach, May says, then a series of options for the future relationship would be put to the Commons in a series of votes. The prime minister adds that the government would abide by the decision of the house \u2013 but only if Labour did so too. May also says she wants the process to be finished by 22 May so that the UK does not have to take part in the European parliament elections. Theresa May says she understands some people are so fed up that they want to leave with no deal. But she supports leaving with one and says we need a short extension to article 50. She says the debate cannot be allowed to drag on and adds that the Commons\u2019 approach has not worked. May says she is offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, to come up with a plan to leave with a deal. But she says that deal must include her withdrawal agreement. The prime minister is starting her speech. We\u2019ve posted a live feed of the prime minister\u2019s speech at the top of the page, so you\u2019ll be able to watch it live once she starts speaking. Good evening. We\u2019re expecting the prime minister to make a statement soon, so we\u2019ll bring you news of that as it happens. In the meantime, it appears ministers who attended the cabinet meeting are still inside Number 10 and there is speculation that the prime minister may be about to soften some of her red lines. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has interviewed Nick Boles, who resigned the Tory whip last night because his party was unwilling to compromise over Brexit. (Boles tabled the common market 2.0 amendment.) Here are the highlights. That is all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. This is from Sky\u2019s Jon Craig. Earlier this afternoon the Commons passed a motion admonishing Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, for contempt of parliament, because he refused to give evidence to a culture committee inquiry into \u201cfake news\u201d and disinformation. Speaking in the debate Damian Collins, the committee chair, said parliament should have the power to fine people or even send them to prison, as is the case in some other countries, for this sort of offence. He said: I do not believe it is good enough for witnesses just to create reasons why they\u2019d rather not give evidence. Otherwise that undermines the whole process, If witnesses decline to give evidence simply because it is unsatisfactory to them, its not appropriate. We have to accept that if we don\u2019t take our own powers seriously other people will behave in the same way. Other people will look at this case and say you can simply ignore it, you can ignore their request, there is nothing they can do. Collins said in other parliaments around the world there are rules that meant people who refused to give evidence, or even sent to jail for a short period. Any decisions of that kind should not be taken by politicians, but by an independent body, he said. Penny Mordaunt has not resigned as international development secretary, the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner reports. See 5.07pm if you are wondering why people thought she might have done. My colleague Jennifer Rankin has written a good article on EU thinking about Brexit. Here is an extract. So no deal is off the table? Not yet. No deal is the legal default, so cannot be ruled out. While the EU would probably grant an extension, officials in Brussels are not certain the prime minister will ask for one. EU leaders will not force the UK into a long extension if it does not seek one or refuses to meet the terms, say people close to the process. Some fear May would placate her party over taking part in European elections. \u201cIf the prime minister said she wanted a no deal, we wouldn\u2019t be able to stop her jumping off the cliff,\u201d the EU diplomat said. And here is the whole thing. These are from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. The senior Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb (he was not far off being elected leader in 2015) has told the BBC that he is considering resigning the party whip because he is so angry about how the Lib Dems acted in the indicative votes last night. Lamb voted for the customs union amendment, but around half of colleagues voted against it along with other MPs who did not want it to succeed because they want a second referendum instead. He said he was worried the Lib Dems were turing into \u201cthe mirror image of the ERG\u201d. Cabinet is finally coming to an end, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. Speaking in Paris alongside Emmanuel Macron, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said Theresa May would have to come up with a \u201cclear pathway to success\u201d to justify another article 50 extension. He explained: At the last European council meeting we gave the UK some time and space to come up with [a] way forward. As it stands they will leave the EU on April 12 without a deal. However, there is still time for the prime minister to come to the council with proposals \u2013 proposals that are credible and have clear pathway to success and we need to be open to any proposals she might bring forward to us. Varadkar also said the EU would want to avoid \u201ca rolling extension\u201d. He went on: Any extension must have a clear purpose and plan. Yvette Cooper is now planning to get MPs to pass her bill tomorrow requiring the PM to request an article 50 extension, the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom reports. Originally the plan was for MPs to debate it on Thursday. Here is the business motion. Cabinet ministers have been in Number 10 for almost seven hours now, and their meeting is still going on. They could be there for another hour, according to ITV\u2019s Adrian Masters. Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, told the Irish parliament today that a no-deal Brexit was now a very real possibility. Speaking in the D\u00e1il, he said: I agree with Michel Barnier and others when they say that, when the days pass, a no-deal Brexit looks like a very real possibility. He also said Ireland was not going to allow a situation where the UK leaving the EU without a deal \u201cdrags Ireland out of the single market with it\u201d. He said: Checks in EU ports on all Irish products - that is not a runner, and will cause significant damage to our economy, so we will not allow it. Coveney said Ireland and the European commission were trying to work out how best to respond to a no-deal scenario to ensure the Good Friday agreement was protected, but also that physical infrastructure on the border was avoided. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, warmly greeted the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for talks at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e promising total \u201cunity and solidarity\u201d towards Ireland by all other EU member states over Brexit. Before the two leaders retired to discuss no-deal planning and next week\u2019s emergency summit, Macron said it was now up to the UK to provide an \u201calternative plan supported by a majority\u201d before 10 April. He warned that a long extension could not be taken for granted, warning it would be neither easy \u201cnor automatic\u201d. He said: A long extension involving the participation of the UK in European elections and European institutions is far from evident and certainly not [to be taken] for granted. Our priority shall be the good functioning of the EU and the single market. The EU cannot sustainably be the hostage to the solution to a political crisis in the UK. We cannot spend the coming months sorting out yet again the terms of our divorce and dealing with the past. Macron said credible justifications for an article 50 extension could include an election, second referendum or alternative proposals for the future relationship, such as a customs union. The EU would be \u201copen\u201d to such proposals, but it was for London to put them forward, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to London to say it, and to say it now.\u201d If there were a no-deal Brexit, it would be the UK\u2019s fault, he added. Should the United Kingdom be unable to \u2013 three years after the referendum \u2013 propose a solution backed by a majority, they will de facto have chosen for themselves to leave without a deal. We cannot avoid failure for them. Macron also said that France and Ireland would be the EU nations most directly affected by no-deal. I\u2019m fully aware of the tremendous difficulties such a situation would bring about for Ireland. We will never abandon Ireland or the Irish people, no matter what happens, because this solidarity is the very purpose of the European project. There again, those rumours may be duff. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party leader at Westminster, has said he is convinced the UK and EU will agree a lengthy extension to article 50 to allow extra time to cope with the Brexit crisis. He told the Guardian: A long extension will happen. I\u2019m not just saying that: we know that will happen. We\u2019ve been speaking to people in the EU and the EU is desperate for the signal to be given by parliament which gives them the excuse for a long extension. It will happen, I\u2019m pretty clear on that. Blackford said intensive cross-party talks were now under way among MPs anxious to find a compromise deal on a far softer Brexit which would be good enough to win a Commons majority following the failure of all four alternative options on Monday night. That would then present the EU with the pretext for delaying Brexit for months. He defended the SNP\u2019s decision to abstain on the Ken Clarke proposal to require customs union membership, insisting it failed to meet the SNP\u2019s key tests on freedom of movement and free access for the banking, finance and services sector to the EU. Clarke\u2019s motion came the closest to success, losing by just three votes on Monday. The SNP, which has the greatest voting discipline of the parties on Brexit, commands 35 votes. Blackford insisted he and Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and first minister, \u201cdon\u2019t want to be obstructive\u201d but Clarke\u2019s motion \u201cdidn\u2019t go nearly far enough\u201d. Blackford said the SNP\u2019s primary goal was either suspending article 50 or forcing a new Brexit referendum but its decision to support the Nick Boles motion, the so-called common market 2.0 option, which involves UK joining the European free trade area Efta, was proof the party was willing to compromise, since the Boles motion was also imperfect, he said. \u201cWe have to have generosity of spirit, but it has to be over things that get us to a better place than where we are,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are an awful lot of conversations going on\u201d focused on finding a new soft Brexit formula which might finally win a Commons majority. These are from the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler about the emergency EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday next week. And here are some lines from what Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, said when he was speaking alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron. These are from my colleagues Lisa O\u2019Carroll. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has been meeting Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, in Paris today to discuss Brexit. Macron stressed that it was not inevitable that the EU would grant the UK a long article 50 extension. These are from my colleague Angelique Chrisafis, RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly and the Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. Jo Maugham, the QC who was one of those behind the case taken to the European court of justice to establish that the UK has the power to revoke article 50 unilaterally, has been looking at the detail of the Cooper bill, and he is not impressed. He explains why in a Twitter thread starting here. Nikki da Costa, the former director of legislative affairs for Theresa May in Downing Street, says she agrees with Maugham\u2019s analysis. Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian MEP who is co-president of the Greens in the European parliament and who sits on the parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, told the World at One that British politicians were wrong if they thought the EU could not accept a no-deal Brexit. Asked if the EU would act to avoid no-deal at all costs, he replied: No, that\u2019s exactly the mistake and a misreading that happens all the time. It\u2019s not at any cost because if the cost of avoiding no deal is substantially bigger damage to the EU, namely to the integrity of the single market, then between two evils we will choose the lesser one. Lamberts also said that MPs who thought the Malthouse compromise (a plan for the UK to effectively have a transition, without agreeing to the backstop) would work were \u201cdeluding themselves\u201d. He went on: I have seen too much of that over the last two years in Westminster. I\u2019m afraid the harsh reality is quite different and if people cannot come to terms with reality then the wake-up will be difficult. Only this morning Damian Green, the Tory pro-European and the former first secretary of state, was claiming that the EU might accept a version of the Malthouse compromise. This is from Sky\u2019s Greg Heffer. The Scottish parliament\u2019s Easter holidays next week could be cancelled if the UK is facing a no-deal Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon told her cabinet this morning. The first minister\u2019s spokesman said after the Scottish cabinet met that the Scottish National party\u2019s business manager at Holyrood, Graeme Dey, had begun talks with opposition parties about suspending the Easter recess, which starts on Saturday and lasts until Sunday 21 April. Philip Sim, a BBC Scotland politics reporter, quoted Sturgeon\u2019s spokesman saying: \u201cMSPs should not be on holiday when the biggest, most momentous, potentially most damaging issue to hit Scotland and the UK since WW2 is about to take place.\u201d A Scottish parliament spokeswoman said there were two options: either cancel recess in advance and timetable parliamentary business for next week, or continue with recess on the basis Holyrood could be urgently recalled if a no-deal Brexit took place. She said the parties\u2019 business managers discussed it today but would decide the best course on Thursday. There is a crucial subtext to this: if the Commons and UK government fail to agree a strategy to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU on Friday 12 April, that will add real urgency to the question of whether Sturgeon should call for a second independence referendum, or at the very least seek the powers to stage one. The ongoing chaos over Brexit has led Sturgeon to repeatedly delay giving her long-promised update to the Scottish parliament on how, if and when she plans to hold that second referendum. The clash in timing of the 12 April deadline and Holyrood\u2019s recess would otherwise deprive Sturgeon of a significant political opportunity to pivot from Brexit to independence. While she knows Theresa May is extremely unlikely to grant Holyrood the powers to do so, and Scottish voters are currently unpersuaded of the case for a new referendum, Sturgeon will want to control the narrative in Scotland as best and as quickly as she can. During Foreign Office questions in the Commons earlier, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said that staying in the customs union would not be seen as a \u201ctrue Brexit\u201d. Responding to a question from Greg Hands, the former international trade minister, who asked what assessment the Foreign Office had made of the customs union option, Hunt said: I think people would see it as very curious that a country that voted to take back control is choosing to cede control in a number of areas of vital national interest. And I think they\u2019d also be concerned that it would not resolve the national debate on Brexit because many of the people who voted for Brexit would not see this as delivering a true Brexit. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason. Alistair Burt, who resigned as a Foreign Office minister last week so that he could vote for the Letwin amendment allowing MPs to take charge of the Commons timetable, told the World at One that he wanted all minsters to be aware of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. He said: I was one of the ministers who quite specifically asked for advice as to whether the UK would be less safe and less secure if there was no deal. That information needs to be available to ministers as they make a decision and my understanding is the cabinet secretary\u2019s view of no deal is it is extremely damaging to the UK and I would hope that will pull many ministers away from that idea. So we must find an alternative and I am very willing to keep trying on that. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand A question from BTL. It is not so much a matter of the government\u2019s language changing; it would be more accurate, I think, to say that different ministers have expressed themselves in different ways, depending on how supportive they are of her strategy. Some of them have said MPs must pass her deal; others (as you say) talk about the need to pass \u201ca\u201d deal. But I\u2019m not picking up any real openness to alternative deals. There was a stage, shortly before the government lost meaningful vote two (MV2), when ministers like David Gauke and Greg Clark sounded genuinely hopeful that an indicative votes process might generate parliamentary support for a softer Brexit. But, in the light of the 12 no votes on Wednesday last week and last night, that optimism seems to be fading. And when you ask Number 10 about alternatives to May\u2019s, you quickly hit a brick wall. Re-negotiating the backstop? They don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. A customs union? But the UK would not be able to strike its own trade deal? Norway? Ending free movement is a firm red line. And a second referendum? God forbid. Sir Oliver Letwin, who is supporting the Cooper bill (see 12.56pm), has also issued a statement about the bill. But he sounds a bit more downbeat about its chances than Yvette Cooper herself. He says: This is a last-ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no-deal exit. We realise this is difficult. But it is definitely worth trying. Why is Letwin saying passing the bill will be difficult? Because this move is unprecedented, and it could easily flounder in the House of Lords. There is nothing unusual about parliament passing a backbench bill. There is an established system for this, the private members\u2019 bills system, and several bills get published this way every year. But what Cooper and Letwin are trying is different. They have used an amendment to a business motion to seize control of the Commons timetable to create time for MPs to pass a bill against the wishes of the government. There is no precedent for this in modern times. One problem for Cooper and Letwin is that MPs may feel they are abusing the process. On Monday last week, when originally passed the Letwin amendment allowing him to take control of Commons business for one day, it was to allow an indicative votes debate on Wednesday 27 March. But it has become a self-perpetuating process, and on the Wednesday Letwin grabbed a second day (yesterday), yesterday he grabbed a third day (tomorrow) and tomorrow he will grab a fourth (Thursday). Until now Letwin has maintained his 40-odd majority for all the business motions he has to pass, but some MPs may argue that he is abusing the process. But the main problem is that Cooper cannot be sure to fast-track her bill through the House of Lords. The Commons cannot tell the Lords what to do, and in the upper chamber bills cannot be subject to programme motions saying they have to pass within a certain time limit. In theory, peers can drag on proceedings as long as they like. In practice this tends not to happen, but there are some hardline Brexiters in the chamber and they could decide to disrupt the Cooper bill, arguing that they are entitled to hold it up because it is setting a new constitutional precedent. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper has now published the text of her EU (withdrawal) (no 5) bill (see 12.20pm) - her attempt to legislate to force Theresa May to request an extension to article 50. Here is the plan. Cooper and her allies plan to use tomorrow, which has been set aside for a third day of Oliver Letwin backbench business, not government business, to pass another business motion setting aside Thursday for a debate on Cooper\u2019s bill. The text of that motion will be out tomorrow. If it passes ... MPs would debate all stages of the Cooper bill on Thursday. MPs would also hold more indicative votes on Thursday. The bill would then go to the House of Lords, where a majority of peers have already agreed in principle that a Brexit bill coming from the Commons should be considered as soon as possible. The Cooper bill would require the PM to come forward with a plan to extend article 50 for MPs to vote on. The PM would be able to choose how long the extension should be. And, if the EU were to offer an alternative length for an extension, that would have to come back for a vote. Commenting on her bill, Cooper said: We are now in a really dangerous situation with a serious and growing risk of no deal in 10 days\u2019 time. The prime minister has a responsibility to prevent that happening. She needs to put forward a proposal, including saying how long an extension she thinks we need to sort things out If the government won\u2019t act urgently, then parliament has a responsibility to try to ensure that happens even though we are right up against the deadline. Parliament has tried to jam into two days a process of finding consensus that I wish the prime minister had started two years ago. But right now nothing has been agreed. So that means that whatever happens in the next few days, the UK needs an extension beyond 12 April if we are to avoid the damage and chaos of no-deal. For the sake of jobs, public services and our national security we need to avert no deal. These are from the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne on the political cabinet. It looks as if the Conservative MP Oliver Letwin might be abandoning attempts to use indicative votes to find a Brexit consensus in the Commons. Because of the business motion passed yesterday, Wednesday will still be set aside for backbench Brexit business, instead of government business, but now that could be used for votes designed to stop a no-deal Brexit. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. And this is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Yvette Cooper, who along with Nick Boles and Oliver Letwin has been taking a lead in Commons efforts to block a no-deal Brexit, is presenting a new backbench bill on this topic in the Commons today. It\u2019s the EU (withdrawal) (no 5) bill. You can read all the Guardian\u2019s Brexit coverage here. And here are two Brexit articles around elsewhere this morning that are worth reading. William Hague, the former Conservative leader and former foreign secretary, says in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) that the next party leader could inherit a \u201cruin\u201d. He says: The Conservative party, I sense, is in danger of losing the support of hopeful young people with ambitions, and it cannot win elections without such people. Moreover, the Conservatives are inevitably identified with the Brexit project, for good or ill, and slowly, steadily, the case for Brexit is being lost. I say that with regret, because by far the best course after the 2016 referendum has been to deliver Brexit and make a go of it. Now, however, a slow movement is taking place out there that makes it rather doubtful that people would vote for it again. Perhaps for the first time, everyone is talking about it, and they are beginning to notice that the trade deals are not so easy, the process of leaving extremely complicated and the keenest Brexiteers deeply divided among themselves. Most people haven\u2019t changed their minds, but I meet some who have, as shown in polls as well. The Conservatives thus face the terrible double prospect of voters shifting away from supporting their central policy, while those who do support it become enraged by the failure to deliver it. That\u2019s why there is nothing guaranteed about having 316 seats in the Commons, nothing at all certain about having a Conservative government, and every possibility of leadership candidates finding they are leading not very much at all. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief and a prominent People\u2019s Vote campaigner, has written in the New European a speech he thinks Theresa May should give. He would like her to abandon her deal, and act as a neutral umpire in a referendum. He imagines May saying: The Brexit side must be obliged to submit a plan that is clear, credible, deliverable, negotiable in Europe, rooted in the real world. And those who argue for staying in must also address the concerns people have that led so many to want to leave the EU. I shall be, now and in any referendum which follows, neutral as this straight choice is developed. Real plans have to be brought forward and agreed by both sides as the choice we put to the country. This process needs time. The worst thing we could do is snatch at a solution based on the indicative votes process, which has failed to deliver the clarity many hoped it would. I shall therefore be requesting a long extension from the EU. I have indicated my intentions to several of my fellow leaders and I am confident we will get the time needed. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. This would be no great surprise in the light of the repeated hints being dropped in the chamber by John Bercow, the Speaker, about how he is going to apply a hardline interpretation of the rule about not putting the same proposition to a vote twice. Last week he said he would not allow a repeat vote on the PM\u2019s deal just because support for it had gone up, and that he thought MPs needed protection from being asked to take the same difficult voting decision more than once. Yesterday, after the Tory Brexiter Richard Drax used a point of order to say he bitterly regretted voting for the PM\u2019s deal on Friday and that it must \u201cnever ever see the light of day again\u201d, Bercow responded by saying: [Drax] is a person of integrity and a man of principle. I respect what he said, and I think it stands for others to judge, but I appreciate his saying so candidly what he wanted to say. We\u2019ve had the regular No 10 morning briefing, but with a lengthy cabinet meeting (it will \u201clast as long as it lasts\u201d, we were told) still going on, there was not much new to learn. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman was asked for the reaction to last night\u2019s indicative votes, and he told reporters: It is the second time that the house has considered a wide variety of options for a way forward, and it once again failed to find a clear majority in favour of any of those options. The government continues to believe it\u2019s in the best interests of the country to leave with a deal. As you know, cabinet is meeting today to give further consideration to the results and how we should proceed. And that was pretty much it. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has responded to Michel Barnier\u2019s comment about Farage and some fellow Brexiters wanting to \u201cdestroy the EU\u201d. (See 9.28am.) He is not saying that Barnier was wrong ... The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has called for EU member states to remain united as the UK grapples with Brexit. \u201cYou saw that the British parliament was unable to make a decision yesterday that would move towards a solution agreed by all,\u201d he said after a meeting with the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, in Rome on Tuesday. \u201cThe government is in session this morning ... we await the outcome of this meeting,\u201d he added, while referring back to his comments last week comparing the British parliament to an Egyptian sphinx. \u201cIf we compare the sphinx and Great Britain, the sphinx would look like an open book,\u201d he said. Conte said Italy was preparing for a no-deal scenario. \u201cWe still have no clarity from the UK\u2019s position on how to manage such a complex process,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this reason, Italy is preparing for the unwelcome prospect of a no-deal.\u201d One \u201cminor benefit\u201d of the Brexit crisis, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw revealed last night, is that people no longer berate him on the tube, accusing him of being a \u201cwar criminal\u201d. Nowadays, he told a public meeting on Peace vs Justice at Inner Temple Hall in central London, they buttonhole him and tell him that politics wasn\u2019t so chaotic in his day. Straw, who was in the Labour cabinet during the Iraq war, defended the legality of the conflict and also disclosed that he regretted having to release General Augusto Pinochet after he was given evidence that the Chilean dictator was not medically fit to stand trial. Here is more on what Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told the European parliament\u2019s committee on foreign affairs this morning. I have taken the quotes from the Press Association. Barnier said the crisis in the UK went beyond Brexit. He said: I don\u2019t think I need to go on at great length about the nature of what is going on in the UK, the impasse or political crisis they might be experiencing. More deeply, it is not just about the question of Brexit. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just about the question of Brexit and the agreement that\u2019s on the table and the backstop for Ireland. It is more broad than that. Somewhere along the line, it is a crisis that equally could have sprung up in another country. In my country [France] as well, there are questions about what our relationship is to the world, what is our place in the EU, what is our economic model. These are all things coming out as a result of the British debate as well. He said a no-deal Brexit would threaten UK-EU cooperation on security. He said: We need to be aware of the implications of a no-deal for our security partnership. There will be a break in the level of talks, less mutual commitment, risks to intelligence pooling. There might be inconsistencies in applying sanctions regimes because of a low level of cooperation. The UK would no longer be taking part in EU operations or in the European Defence Agency\u2019s capacity-building programmes ... No deal for some time poses the threat of there being no organised framework... Come what may, we must fend off the risk of strategic divergence. He said a no-deal Brexit would sour relations between the UK and the EU. He said: If there is no deal, the atmosphere will be different. The lack of a deal means a lack of faith, a lack of a deal means a rupture in confidence between us. He said a no-deal Brexit would not remove issues like Ireland and the UK\u2019s financial contribution to the EU from the debate because as soon as the UK opened trade talks with the EU, these issues would reappear. In response to a question from a British MEP, he said: [After no deal] there won\u2019t be many months passing before the UK will start asking for negotiations on a free trade agreement or other issues, like transport. The topics of Brexit will still be there \u2013 Ireland, the financial resolution, the legal obligations of the UK, the issues of citizens and citizens\u2019 rights. These are questions we will put again and again. If there is no deal and the UK wants to discuss trade or other subjects, we will put the same subjects back on the table. There has been speculation about Theresa May trying to get her Brexit deal through parliament by linking it somehow to a confidence motion, ie, threatening a general election if she is defeated. It is not entirely clear how this would work, because the Fixed-term Parliaments Act means a prime minister can no longer simply declare that a vote is a confidence issue, and if the government does lose a confidence vote under the FTPA, an election would only happen if no one else can form an administration capable of winning a confidence vote within 14 days. But that has not stopped the idea being discussed at Westminster. In an interview with the BBC, David Davis, who resigned as Brexit secretary last summer because he opposed Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan, said that if May sought a long extension to article 50, that would \u201ctear apart\u201d the Tories. He went on: I\u2019d only make one warning to the cabinet ... don\u2019t be sure that every Conservative MP would vote for you if it was made a confidence vote. One or two of them have said already ... and, I think, probably about 20 of them would say, this, actually, is so important, it\u2019s the future of our country. It\u2019s our destiny at stake. It\u2019s more important than the Tory party. Yesterday both Steve Baker (here) and Crispin Blunt (here) suggested they would be willing to vote against the government in a confidence motion if May backed the UK staying in a customs union. The Daily Mail, which is supportive of Theresa May at the moment, has an exclusive story about a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, to cabinet ministers about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. It may not have been one of those letters written deliberately so that it would be leaked, but one assumes Downing Street will not be too upset about its appearance in the public domain. Here is an extract from Jason Groves\u2019 story in the Mail. Sir Mark\u2019s 14-page letter warns: No-deal would result in a 10 per cent spike in food prices and the collapse of some businesses that trade with the EU; The government would come under pressure to bail out companies on the brink; It would hamper the ability of the police and security services to keep people safe; It would lead to the reintroduction of direct rule in Northern Ireland for the first time since 2007; A recession will hit the UK and the pound\u2019s depreciation will be \u2018more harmful\u2019 than in 2008. Our legal authorities and judicial system would be put under \u2018enormous pressure\u2019 ... The letter will now be kept in the government\u2019s files and could be released in the event of a public inquiry into the handling of Brexit. Sir Mark, who also serves as the government\u2019s national security adviser, warns that no-deal would affect our security services. \u2018Our national security would be disrupted,\u2019 he says. \u2018The UK would forfeit access to criminal justice levers. None of our mitigation measures would give the UK the same security capabilities as our current ones. \u2018A no-deal exit would enormously increase pressure on our law and security authorities and on our judicial system. The UK would be less safe as a result of this.\u2019 Sir Mark warns no-deal could lead to the break-up of the UK, saying: \u2018The stability of the union would be dislocated.\u2019 He says Northern Ireland would face \u2018more severe\u2019 consequences, particularly as the lack of devolved government would require direct rule from London. \u2018The running of Northern Ireland under No Deal is a sensitive issue,\u2019 he says. \u2018The current powers granted to the Northern Irish secretary would not be adequate for the pace, breadth or controversy of the decisions needed to be taken through a no-deal exit. Therefore we would have to introduce direct rule. According to the Times\u2019 Sam Coates, cabinet is not going to run for five hours. It will be more like three and a half hours, he says. Today\u2019s cabinet started at 9.30am, not 9am as we had previously been told, Sky reports. Here are some of the ministers arriving. Barnier says some outside the EU, and some people within it too, see Brexit as a means of weakening the EU. The EU must respond, he says. He says this came up at at meeting he held with Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader. He says he asked Farage how he saw the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU after Brexit. Farage said, after Brexit, the EU would \u201cno longer exist\u201d. Barnier goes on: So these people want to destroy the European Union from inside, and others from outside. Barnier says that is why people have to defend the European Union. EU countries must stick together,. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking in the European parliament now. He says in the House of Commons there have only been majorities against things. That is not how an orderly withdrawal can be managed, he says. If the UK is to avoid a no-deal Brexit, there is only one way forward: to vote for a deal. And there is only one treaty available, he says. He holds up a copy of the withdrawal agreement. He says the option of no deal looks \u201cvery likely\u201d. It is not the option he would have gone for, he says. You do not need a negotiator for no deal. But the EU has spent a lot of time over the last few months preparing for this. He says that at the start of this process, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the future of the EU was more important than Brexit. He agrees, he says. Barnier says the future of the EU is more important than Brexit. Good morning. As the Brexit crisis deepens, Theresa May is just starting to chair what is scheduled to be a five-hour cabinet, where ministers will discuss what can be done to avert a looming no-deal Brexit on Friday week. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reports, in Brussels Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has said a no-deal Brexit is becoming \u201cday after day more likely\u201d. Barnier said that, if the Commons did not vote for the withdrawal agreement within the next few days, only two options would remain: \u201cLeaving without an agreement or requesting a longer extension of the article 50 period\u201d. On Friday May hinted that, if she could not get her deal through parliament, her preference would be to go for a longish article 50 extension, requiring the UK to take part in the European elections. But this morning Barnier insisted the EU would need a \u201cstrong justification\u201d for such a move. EU leaders are due to discuss Brexit at a summit a week tomorrow, and Barnier\u2019s comments implied that they might refuse another delay to Brexit. He said: The UK may ask for another extension. Such an extension would carry significant risks for the EU. Therefore a strong justification would be needed. He said businesses in the EU had warned Brussels \u201cagainst the cost of extending uncertainty\u201d. The UK prolonging its status as a member state while still seeking to leave with a negotiated deal \u201ccould pose a risk on our decision-making autonomy\u201d, he added. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs a lengthy cabinet meeting. First there will be a political cabinet, lasting for perhaps two hours, and after that there will be a normal cabinet. 11.30am: Foreign Office questions in the Commons. After 12.30pm: MPs debate a report admonishing Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, for contempt of parliament because he refused to give evidence to a Commons inquiry into \u201cfake news\u201d and disinformation. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up in the afternoon. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. UPDATE: I\u2019ve amended the entry about the timings of cabinet after reports that it was going to last five hours were dismissed.",

The Ministry of Defence has twice as many submarines in storage as it does in service and has not disposed of any of the 20 vessels decommissioned since 1980, the National Audit Office (NAO) said. Nine of the vessels still contained radioactive fuel, it said. The failure to address the issue risked damaging the UK\u2019s international reputation as a \u201cresponsible nuclear power\u201d, the auditors concluded. The damning findings will increase the pressure on the MoD over its management. An NAO report in January identified a \u00a321bn funding gap in the department over the next decade. Ministers could be questioned about the findings at a parliamentary debate on the continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent, which is scheduled for Wednesday. Decommissioned submarines are being stored at Devonport in Plymouth and Rosyth in Fife while arrangements are made to safely dispose of their radioactive waste. Seven of the submarines have been in storage for longer than they were in service with the Royal Navy. Auditors said the estimated overall cost of disposing of a submarine was \u00a396m. The MoD has estimated its total future liability for maintaining and disposing of the 20 stored and 10 in-service nuclear-powered submarines at \u00a37.5bn over the next 120 years. No submarines have been defuelled since 2004, when regulators said facilities did not meet required standards, and the process is not due to start again until 2023. Auditors said the MoD did not have a fully developed plan to dispose of the operational Vanguard and Astute submarines or its future Dreadnought-class vessels, which have different types of nuclear reactor. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, which oversees government spending, said the issues of safety and costs must be addressed: \u201cFor more than 20 years the Ministry of Defence has been promising to dismantle its out-of-service nuclear submarines and told my committee last year that it would now address this dismal lack of progress. \u201cIt has still not disposed of any of the 20 submarines decommissioned since 1980 and does not yet know fully how to do it. The ministry needs to get a grip urgently before we run out of space to store and maintain submarines and we damage our reputation as a responsible nuclear power.\u201d Since April 1969 the Royal Navy has maintained a continuous at-sea presence of nuclear submarines, which house the UK\u2019s nuclear weapons system. The vessels being stored include the first submarines used to carry the UK\u2019s nuclear deterrent \u2013 the Polaris boats HMS Revenge, Renown, Repulse and Resolution. Also in storage is the attack submarine HMS Conqueror, which sank the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands War. Wednesday\u2019s parliamentary debate has been scheduled to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UK\u2019s continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent. John Woodcock, the independent MP for Barrow-in-Furness, who called for the debate, said the lack of a decommissioning plan was storing up problems for the future. \u201cThis lack of progress reflects and is partially caused by the country\u2019s paralysis on finding a geological disposal site for waste nuclear material. Ministers cannot continue with their head in the sand on this important issue,\u201d he said. An MoD spokesman said: \u201cThe disposal of nuclear submarines is a complex and challenging undertaking. We remain committed to the safe, secure and cost-effective defuelling and dismantling of all decommissioned nuclear submarines as soon as practically possible.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There is a shrill overtone of hypocrisy in the sound of MPs who supported a customs union or \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d in Monday night\u2019s indicative votes condemning second referendum supporters who did not vote for these options (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/01/soft-brexiters-hope-brexit-fatigue-could-sway-tory-mps\" title=\"\">Soft Brexiters lay blame for defeat on backers of second referendum</a>, 2 April). You quote Stephen Kinnock, referring to the 33 referendum supporters who did not support Common Market 2.0, as saying that: \u201cIt appears that some of us were acting in good faith and in a spirit of compromise whilst others were not.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, of those MPs who supported Kinnock\u2019s preferred option, 29 (including five Labour MPs) voted against a second referendum while a further 22 (including 14 Labour) abstained. Similarly, of those who voted for a customs union 43 (including 18 Labour) opposed a second referendum while another 27 (including 16 Labour) abstained.</p> <p>So the lack of good faith and compromise appears to have been at least as much on the side of the proponents of a soft Brexit. Let us pray that by Wednesday diehards on either side of this latest divide can swallow their amour-propre, put their country\u2019s future first and steer us to a situation where one or other (or both) of these Brexit options can be put to the people alongside an option to remain. Sanity still has a small chance to prevail.<br><strong>Rob Sykes</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 The people\u2019s vote brigade in parliament got this completely wrong. It was imperative on Monday that an alternative \u2013 any alternative \u2013 to May\u2019s deal emerged. It\u2019s very unlikely that May would have chosen to endorse it, but whichever way she jumped, it would have fractured the cabinet and probably brought down the government. This would have opened up all sorts of new possibilities, freeing the soft Brexiters and remainers in the Conservative ranks to support other approaches and forge new alliances. The opposition remainers have in all probability lost the war by insisting on fighting a losing battle.<br><strong>Mike Shearing</strong><br><em>Southall, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is right: \u201cOnly the public can end the debate, either choosing an actual Brexit deal laid before them, or coming to the conclusion that there is no deal better than the one we have\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/01/no-time-for-compromise-brexit-no-middle-way\" title=\"\">Pay no heed to calls for a compromise Brexit: out is out</a>, 2 April). It\u2019s a view shared by a growing coterie of moderate Tories. On Newsnight, Huw Merriman said: \u201cParliament has failed, can\u2019t deliver, so let\u2019s be realistic and ask the people if they will put the PM\u2019s deal through.\u201d Significantly, a confirmatory public vote also received the highest number of positive votes, with 280, in the second set of indicative votes. A customs union may eventually achieve a Commons majority. However, David Davis warned the cabinet that if it accepts a softer Brexit, it cannot assume \u201cevery Conservative MP would vote for you if it was made a confidence vote\u201d. Combined with a Labour party eager for a general election, this might bring down Mrs May\u2019s government. A second referendum is rapidly emerging for all sides as the least worst option and best face-saving way out of the current debacle.<br><strong>Joe McCarthy</strong><br><em>Dublin</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee\u2019s trip to Hastings has provided her with a hook on which to hang an all-too-familiar message, but does not mention that the constituency voted 56-44 in favour of leaving the EU. It may be possible to stop Brexit, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right to do so, regardless of the social and political costs. Few leave voters in Hastings will agree with her, while many remain voters (like me) think that democracy takes precedence over our own wish to stay in the EU, and that a soft Brexit is therefore greatly preferable to her uncompromising, unrealistic, and unhelpful resistance. <br><strong>Jon Griffith</strong><br><em>Hastings, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Dawn Foster is right: opinion on the EU is not a dichotomy but a spectrum (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/02/newport-west-byelection-labour-brexit-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Newport West could vindicate Jeremy Corbyn</a>, 2 April).

      "bodyText": "There is a shrill overtone of hypocrisy in the sound of MPs who supported a customs union or \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d in Monday night\u2019s indicative votes condemning second referendum supporters who did not vote for these options (Soft Brexiters lay blame for defeat on backers of second referendum, 2 April). You quote Stephen Kinnock, referring to the 33 referendum supporters who did not support Common Market 2.0, as saying that: \u201cIt appears that some of us were acting in good faith and in a spirit of compromise whilst others were not.\u201d In fact, of those MPs who supported Kinnock\u2019s preferred option, 29 (including five Labour MPs) voted against a second referendum while a further 22 (including 14 Labour) abstained. Similarly, of those who voted for a customs union 43 (including 18 Labour) opposed a second referendum while another 27 (including 16 Labour) abstained. So the lack of good faith and compromise appears to have been at least as much on the side of the proponents of a soft Brexit. Let us pray that by Wednesday diehards on either side of this latest divide can swallow their amour-propre, put their country\u2019s future first and steer us to a situation where one or other (or both) of these Brexit options can be put to the people alongside an option to remain. Sanity still has a small chance to prevail. Rob Sykes Oxford \u2022 The people\u2019s vote brigade in parliament got this completely wrong. It was imperative on Monday that an alternative \u2013 any alternative \u2013 to May\u2019s deal emerged. It\u2019s very unlikely that May would have chosen to endorse it, but whichever way she jumped, it would have fractured the cabinet and probably brought down the government. This would have opened up all sorts of new possibilities, freeing the soft Brexiters and remainers in the Conservative ranks to support other approaches and forge new alliances. The opposition remainers have in all probability lost the war by insisting on fighting a losing battle. Mike Shearing Southall, London \u2022 Polly Toynbee is right: \u201cOnly the public can end the debate, either choosing an actual Brexit deal laid before them, or coming to the conclusion that there is no deal better than the one we have\u201d (Pay no heed to calls for a compromise Brexit: out is out, 2 April). It\u2019s a view shared by a growing coterie of moderate Tories. On Newsnight, Huw Merriman said: \u201cParliament has failed, can\u2019t deliver, so let\u2019s be realistic and ask the people if they will put the PM\u2019s deal through.\u201d Significantly, a confirmatory public vote also received the highest number of positive votes, with 280, in the second set of indicative votes. A customs union may eventually achieve a Commons majority. However, David Davis warned the cabinet that if it accepts a softer Brexit, it cannot assume \u201cevery Conservative MP would vote for you if it was made a confidence vote\u201d. Combined with a Labour party eager for a general election, this might bring down Mrs May\u2019s government. A second referendum is rapidly emerging for all sides as the least worst option and best face-saving way out of the current debacle. Joe McCarthy Dublin \u2022 Polly Toynbee\u2019s trip to Hastings has provided her with a hook on which to hang an all-too-familiar message, but does not mention that the constituency voted 56-44 in favour of leaving the EU. It may be possible to stop Brexit, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right to do so, regardless of the social and political costs. Few leave voters in Hastings will agree with her, while many remain voters (like me) think that democracy takes precedence over our own wish to stay in the EU, and that a soft Brexit is therefore greatly preferable to her uncompromising, unrealistic, and unhelpful resistance. Jon Griffith Hastings, East Sussex \u2022 Dawn Foster is right: opinion on the EU is not a dichotomy but a spectrum (Newport West could vindicate Jeremy Corbyn, 2 April). There are extremes at both ends of that spectrum seeking to impose their will, including Polly Toynbee\u2019s \u201cno compromise\u201d demand that the referendum result should simply be ignored. In austerity Britain, EU membership is not in itself a core issue: whether in or out, governments do not have to close care centres. The need to resume normal politics is urgent. Peter McKenna Liverpool \u2022 Dawn Foster asserts that \u201cLabour voters were as split as the rest of the country on whether we should leave the EU\u201d. We all know the national figures were 52:48. However, among Labour voters the remain vote was 64%. Moreover, currently 73% Labour voters think it was wrong to leave (and 89% of Labour members); 57% support a second referendum; and 83% of Labour members voted remain.

      "bodyText": "MPs will mount an audacious bid to legislate against a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday by rushing an emergency bill through parliament to force Theresa May to request a delay to leaving the EU. A cross-party group opposed to a no-deal Brexit will bring forward a bill requiring the prime minister to put forward a proposal to extend article 50 to ensure the UK cannot leave the bloc with no deal by default. The effort is being led by Yvette Cooper, a senior Labour MP, and Sir Oliver Letwin, a Tory former minister, who want to get their one-line bill through the House of Commons in just one day on Wednesday. The legislation may then be debated in the House of Lords as soon as Friday or Monday, where it is likely to encounter attempts to frustrate its progress by Eurosceptic peers. Labour sources in the House of Lords said peers against a no-deal Brexit were preparing to stay up all night to ensure any attempts to filibuster the legislation were not successful. Meanwhile, it is understood there is a plan led by Hilary Benn, the senior Labour MP, to lay an amendment in favour of more indicative votes narrowing the options next Monday, following parliament\u2019s failure to coalesce around one of four soft Brexit options on Monday. A new option is likely to be put to MPs combining support for a Brexit deal plus customs union with a confirmatory second referendum, which could win new supporters among campaigners for a people\u2019s vote. There is growing speculation that May could be poised to request an extension to article 50 from the EU of her own accord. However, it still remains possible that the government could try bring back a third meaningful vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal later this week, if the Speaker, John Bercow, permits it. An amendment passed by MPs last week gives them the power to take control of the order paper on certain dates, which they are hoping will give parliament time to debate and pass the bill before May attends an EU summit in Brussels next Wednesday. This is the natural point at which the prime minister would have to request an extension to article 50 in order to stop the UK crashing out without a deal on April 12. Cooper said the government could decide how long an extension to propose. \u201cWe are now in a really dangerous situation with a serious and growing risk of no deal in 10 days\u2019 time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prime minister has a responsibility to prevent that happening.

It would then be sent to the House of Lords. Cooper and Letwin brought forward their legislation against no deal after MPs failed to alight on a consensus for an alternative to May\u2019s Brexit deal in indicative votes on Monday. The Labour MP Lucy Powell, one of the key movers behind the Norway-style deal pushed by a cross-party group of MPs during the indicative votes process, said parliament needed to take on an even bigger role. \u201cWe\u2019ve put the government back in the driving seat \u2013 but it can\u2019t drive,\u201d she said. \u201cA motley crew of backbenchers without the resource and power of the government have actually achieved more consensus in a few weeks than government has in many months.\u201d MPs backing a second referendum may attempt to amend any motion or bill to add a provision for a fresh poll, though several said they were working with a compromising spirit after a bitter row between soft Brexiters and People\u2019s Vote supporters over the inconclusive results of the indicative votes on Monday night. Supporters of a customs union \u2013 which lost by just three votes \u2013 blamed Lib Dems, the Independent Group and Labour backers of a referendum for withholding their support and denying parliament the opportunity to force May to compromise. Referendum supporters claimed their offers of a compromise composite motion bringing together soft Brexit options and a referendum had been repeatedly rebuffed. A source close to the Independent Group said there was a real risk that a win for a customs union in the House of Commons could have scuppered the chances of a new poll and that referendum supporters had already compromised by supporting the indicative votes process, which put their preferred option at risk. Several senior MPs backing a referendum said there had been attempts to reset the tone of engagement on Tuesday morning, with one describing the mood as \u201cpragmatic and cooperative\u201d.",

But it is worth remembering that he voted against extending the Brexit deadline \u2013 even after making the government case for doing so in the Commons.</p> <p><strong>Gavin Williamson*</strong></p> <p>Another minister whose views are perhaps best viewed through the prism of his political ambitions. The defence secretary is reported as being among cabinet members who would choose no deal over a customs union, and again he voted against extending article 50.</p> <p><strong>Liam Fox</strong></p> <p>A Brexiter before the term was invented, Fox is, as you would expect, in the cabinet camp that favours no deal over a softer departure. That said, he is something of a pragmatist among cabinet leavers, having stayed to argue his case while others resigned.</p> <p><strong>Penny Mordaunt*</strong></p> <p>An enthusiastic Brexiter, Mordaunt has said publicly that voters would prefer no deal and that a customs union \u201cwouldn\u2019t fly with the public\u201d. And she has previously advocated a \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d, which would see the UK leave without an agreement in place.</p> <p><strong>Chris Grayling</strong></p> <p>A long-time Brexiter, the transport secretary would be expected to favour no deal over a softer option. But he is very loyal to May, not least as she has stuck by him amid a series of departmental disasters, and that cannot be discounted as a factor.</p> <p><strong>Liz Truss*</strong> (attends cabinet)</p> <p>A contributor to the bible for small-state Tories, Britannia Unchained, Truss has long been more relaxed about no deal than many of her cabinet colleagues, believing it could usher in radical reforms she believes would kickstart the economy.</p> <p><strong>Andrea Leadsom*</strong> (attends cabinet)</p> <p>Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is robustly opposed to a softer Brexit deal, and would prefer the government go for no deal. In the Commons in recent days she has been stressing the importance of abiding by the Tories\u2019 2017 general election manifesto, which ruled out customs union membership.</p> <h2>Could favour a customs union</h2> <p><strong>David Lidington</strong></p> <p>A senior cabinet remainer who does not like no deal: last week he told business leaders this was not government policy and would cause disruption and threaten the integrity of the UK. But Lidington is also a pragmatist, and loyal to the prime minister.</p> <p><strong>Philip Hammond</strong></p> <p>The cabinet minister the leavers love to hate. As chancellor, his primary cabinet concern is the welfare of the economy, and he has repeatedly warned against the consequences of no deal. He might not be central to plotting for a softer Brexit, but don\u2019t be surprised if he happily accepted one.</p> <p><strong>David Gauke</strong></p> <p>Gauke, a key member of the \u201cGaukward squad\u201d of ministers who would prefer to see a soft Brexit compromise, has suggested he could resign if May decides to pursue no deal.</p> <p><strong>Matt Hancock*</strong></p> <p>A minister who has somewhat kept his head down amid the current Brexit debate, Hancock is seen as more on the remain side of the cabinet. As health secretary, he is at the centre of emergency planning for the possibility of no deal and has said he does not believe it will happen.</p> <p><strong>Greg Clark</strong></p> <p>Another central member of the supposed customs union squad, the business secretary was among the trio of ministers who openly said they would defy Theresa May to seek a delay to Brexit rather than risk no deal.</p> <p><strong>Amber Rudd*</strong></p> <p>Another leading remain-minded minister, the work and pensions secretary was among the cabinet members who publicly urged May to extend the departure deadline, and would be expect to resign rather than take part in an open policy of no deal.</p> <p><strong>Damian Hinds</strong></p> <p>The education secretary has also suggested he is wary of no deal, telling the BBC on Tuesday it was \u201cnot an optimal outcome\u201d.</p> <p><strong>David Mundell</strong></p> <p>One of the most remain-minded members of the cabinet, the Scotland secretary is a paid-up member of the anti-no-deal camp and would be among those expected to quit if no deal became the desired option.</p> <h2>Waverers</h2> <p><strong>Michael Gove*</strong></p> <p>A leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, Gove is known to have considerable doubts about May\u2019s deal \u2013 turning down the job of Brexit secretary last year when she refused to reconsider the backstop \u2013 but he has reportedly told Tory MPs he would now be willing to consider a softer deal rather than risk losing Brexit altogether.</p> <p><strong>James Brokenshire</strong></p> <p>The position of the communities secretary remains unclear. He has not been at the centre of any public debates on Brexit, even while his role involves pushing local authorities to prepare for a no-deal departure. He has been named as in the camp favouring this option over a customs union.</p> <p><strong>Karen Bradley</strong></p> <p>Officially a remainer, Bradley has stayed relatively under the radar in terms of Brexit arguments. As Northern Ireland secretary she would be expected to be more mindful than most of the risks of no deal, but time will tell.</p>",

Could favour no deal Sajid Javid* As a born-again leaver (not to mention an eager would-be successor to May), the home secretary this week came out firmly against a customs union, tweeting that while it might seem a comfort blanket it was in fact \u201cmore of a straitjacket\u201d. Yet it remains unclear whether he would, instead, openly support no deal, despite reports he is now in this camp. Jeremy Hunt* The foreign secretary has been bullish in public about Britain\u2019s ability to withstand a no-deal exit but has stopped short of fully endorsing such an outcome, though he is known to be deeply opposed to the UK joining a customs union. Stephen Barclay* Yet another vehement leaver brought in to run the Brexit department, Barclay has been a loyal advocate of May\u2019s plan, and told MPs on Monday night that with parliament set against no deal it was the only viable option. But it is worth remembering that he voted against extending the Brexit deadline \u2013 even after making the government case for doing so in the Commons. Gavin Williamson* Another minister whose views are perhaps best viewed through the prism of his political ambitions. The defence secretary is reported as being among cabinet members who would choose no deal over a customs union, and again he voted against extending article 50. Liam Fox A Brexiter before the term was invented, Fox is, as you would expect, in the cabinet camp that favours no deal over a softer departure. That said, he is something of a pragmatist among cabinet leavers, having stayed to argue his case while others resigned. Penny Mordaunt* An enthusiastic Brexiter, Mordaunt has said publicly that voters would prefer no deal and that a customs union \u201cwouldn\u2019t fly with the public\u201d. And she has previously advocated a \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d, which would see the UK leave without an agreement in place. Chris Grayling A long-time Brexiter, the transport secretary would be expected to favour no deal over a softer option. But he is very loyal to May, not least as she has stuck by him amid a series of departmental disasters, and that cannot be discounted as a factor. Liz Truss* (attends cabinet) A contributor to the bible for small-state Tories, Britannia Unchained, Truss has long been more relaxed about no deal than many of her cabinet colleagues, believing it could usher in radical reforms she believes would kickstart the economy. Andrea Leadsom* (attends cabinet) Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is robustly opposed to a softer Brexit deal, and would prefer the government go for no deal. In the Commons in recent days she has been stressing the importance of abiding by the Tories\u2019 2017 general election manifesto, which ruled out customs union membership. Could favour a customs union David Lidington A senior cabinet remainer who does not like no deal: last week he told business leaders this was not government policy and would cause disruption and threaten the integrity of the UK. But Lidington is also a pragmatist, and loyal to the prime minister. Philip Hammond The cabinet minister the leavers love to hate. As chancellor, his primary cabinet concern is the welfare of the economy, and he has repeatedly warned against the consequences of no deal. He might not be central to plotting for a softer Brexit, but don\u2019t be surprised if he happily accepted one. David Gauke Gauke, a key member of the \u201cGaukward squad\u201d of ministers who would prefer to see a soft Brexit compromise, has suggested he could resign if May decides to pursue no deal. Matt Hancock* A minister who has somewhat kept his head down amid the current Brexit debate, Hancock is seen as more on the remain side of the cabinet. As health secretary, he is at the centre of emergency planning for the possibility of no deal and has said he does not believe it will happen. Greg Clark Another central member of the supposed customs union squad, the business secretary was among the trio of ministers who openly said they would defy Theresa May to seek a delay to Brexit rather than risk no deal. Amber Rudd* Another leading remain-minded minister, the work and pensions secretary was among the cabinet members who publicly urged May to extend the departure deadline, and would be expect to resign rather than take part in an open policy of no deal. Damian Hinds The education secretary has also suggested he is wary of no deal, telling the BBC on Tuesday it was \u201cnot an optimal outcome\u201d. David Mundell One of the most remain-minded members of the cabinet, the Scotland secretary is a paid-up member of the anti-no-deal camp and would be among those expected to quit if no deal became the desired option. Waverers Michael Gove* A leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, Gove is known to have considerable doubts about May\u2019s deal \u2013 turning down the job of Brexit secretary last year when she refused to reconsider the backstop \u2013 but he has reportedly told Tory MPs he would now be willing to consider a softer deal rather than risk losing Brexit altogether. James Brokenshire The position of the communities secretary remains unclear. He has not been at the centre of any public debates on Brexit, even while his role involves pushing local authorities to prepare for a no-deal departure. He has been named as in the camp favouring this option over a customs union. Karen Bradley Officially a remainer, Bradley has stayed relatively under the radar in terms of Brexit arguments. As Northern Ireland secretary she would be expected to be more mindful than most of the risks of no deal, but time will tell.",

That could help the government to circumvent the Speaker\u2019s ruling that May cannot bring her deal back unchanged.</p> \n<p>May said last Friday that she would accept the Snell-Nandy amendment, and Conservative whips hope it could attract the support of a string of Labour MPs from pro-Brexit seats this week.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May will summon her warring cabinet to Downing Street for a five-hour showdown on Tuesday after parliament once again failed to coalesce behind any alternative to her rejected Brexit deal. Three options \u2013 a common market, a customs union and a second referendum \u2013 were all narrowly rejected in the process of indicative votes, prompting renewed talk of a swift general election. After Conservative MPs failed to support any option in sufficient numbers, there were immediate recriminations in the House of Commons chamber. The Tory MP Nick Boles declared that he had failed to persuade his colleagues to compromise with his \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d plan and announced his departure from the party. Supporters of a second referendum from across parliament were also accused of increasing the risk of a no-deal by refusing to back soft Brexit options. With just 10 days left until Britain is due to leave the EU without a deal unless the government secures a fresh delay from Brussels, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said the cabinet would have to decide the way forward. \u201cThis house has continuously rejected leaving without a deal, just as it has rejected not leaving at all. Therefore the only option is to find a way through which allows the UK to leave with a deal,\u201d he said. One Downing Street adviser said that a snap election fronted by May was being \u201ctested\u201d and that it was viewed by some in the No 10 bunker as \u201cthe least worst option\u201d. Cabinet ministers were instructed to abstain from Monday\u2019s voting process, which was devised by a cross-party alliance of MPs led by the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin. The customs union motion tabled by the former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke was rejected by a margin of just three votes, by 273 to 276, while a second Brexit referendum fell short of a majority by only 12 votes. The Norway-style \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d Brexit deal championed by Boles was also rejected, by 261 votes to 282, despite Labour frontbench and SNP support. Just 33 Conservative MPs backed it. Boles said: \u201cI have failed, chiefly because my party fails to compromise\u201d \u2013 and made the dramatic announcement to MPs that he would no longer sit in the House of Commons as a Conservative before leaving the chamber. His emotional statement emphasised the toxic atmosphere in the Tory party over Brexit. One outspoken leaver, Mark Francois, told the BBC\u2019s World Tonight he believed the chancellor had been privately encouraging MPs to support a customs union, in what he called a \u201ccoup\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re listening, Mr Hammond,\u201d he added, \u201cmy fraternal message to you is: \u2018Up yours!\u2019\u201d Less outspoken Brexiters were also delighted by Monday night\u2019s deadlock, believing it will lead to a no-deal Brexit. All three alternative Brexit options lost by a significantly narrower margin than the prime minister\u2019s deal, however, which was rejected for a third time by 58 votes last Friday. MPs also declined to back a separate attempt by the SNP MP Joanna Cherry to allow parliament to prevent a no-deal Brexit. After parliament had its say, cabinet ministers will have to decide whether to tack towards a closer future relationship with the EU in an attempt to build a majority; head for a no-deal Brexit on 12 April; or give May\u2019s deal a final shot this week, probably on Wednesday. Several cabinet ministers, including Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox, are adamant that a no-deal exit would be preferable to a customs union \u2013 and they claim the support of more than half of the parliamentary party, many of whom signed a letter to May making the point. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, a contender to succeed May as Conservative leader, made his position clear on Monday, tweeting that a customs union might appear to be \u201csome kind of soft comfort blanket\u201d but was \u201cin reality more of a straitjacket\u201d. However, another well-organised group of ministers, including Amber Rudd and David Gauke, are determined to avoid no deal and believe May should instead seek a cross-party consensus. A cabinet source said: \u201cI honestly just think the prime minister needs to make a firm decision.\u201d Ministers have been told to expect three hours of political cabinet \u2013 excluding civil servants \u2013 on Tuesday morning, and another two hours of full cabinet in the afternoon. May\u2019s official spokesman underlined her continued objections to Britain remaining part of a customs union on Monday. \u201cShe has said on a number of occasions that she believes it is important for the UK to have its own trade policy,\u201d he said. No 10 has not ruled out bringing the prime minister\u2019s deal back to the House of Commons for a fourth time if the Speaker will allow it. May could table it together with an amendment submitted last week by the Labour MPs Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy allowing parliament a greater say in the next stage of the Brexit negotiations. That could help the government to circumvent the Speaker\u2019s ruling that May cannot bring her deal back unchanged. May said last Friday that she would accept the Snell-Nandy amendment, and Conservative whips hope it could attract the support of a string of Labour MPs from pro-Brexit seats this week. But just five voted for her deal last week after hearing that she would back it. If she brings her deal back, the prime minister is likely to seek to pit it against a backbench-led effort to push the government towards a softer deal, sharpening the dilemma for Brexiters, who prefer a cleaner break with the EU. The schools minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: \u201cI would like the option that parliament comes up with put up against the prime minister\u2019s deal. I am confident that the prime minister\u2019s deal would win the day.\u201d She is also expected to point to the risks that failure to agree a solution could result in a risky general election. Many Conservative MPs, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, changed sides to support her deal on Friday after May\u2019s promise to leave Downing Street if she won the vote. May has invited those MPs who switched sides in favour of her deal to meet her, in the latest attempt to shore up support. EU27 leaders have granted Britain an extension to the article 50 deadline to 12 April, but if May wants to avoid no deal she will have to request a longer extension at an emergency EU summit next week. Brussels sources say that would be granted only if the prime minister points to a plausible alternative Brexit plan that could command the support of a stable majority in the Commons. While the backbench-led debate on Brexit options continued on Monday, MPs were also holding a separate discussion triggered by a mass petition calling for article 50 to be revoked, which has gained more than 6m signatures. The petition is the most popular in parliament\u2019s history. The Independent Group MP Chuka Umunna said young people would suffer the worst effects of no deal. \u201cThey are the ones who will never forgive this generation of politicians if we allow this catastrophe to happen,\u201d he said.",
