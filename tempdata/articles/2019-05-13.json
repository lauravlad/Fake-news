He told them Westminster was denying them their birthright, forgetting to mention the reason the UK had not already left the EU was because of Brexiters voting down a deal for which they would have given their back teeth three years ago. He told them a no-deal, World Trade Organization Brexit would turn Yorkshire into the land of milk and honey.</p> <p>Others came and went promising much the same. The local MPs Yvette Cooper and Jon Trickett were booed and openly denounced as traitors. The person to my left to whom I had been chatting before the event advised me not to mention I worked for the Guardian. As if I needed telling. This was the blitz spirit being whipped up into a lynch mob. There was a time when a Farage event always came with an element of humour. As if neither he nor his audiences were expected to take him entirely seriously. This is now something else.

In the past two of the seats have always gone to unionists (the DUP and the UUP), and one to a nationalist or republican (currently Sinn Fein). </p> <p>But a LucidTalk poll suggests that the UUP could be on course to lose the third seat, to be replaced by the non-sectarian Alliance party, the sister party of the Lib Dems in Britain.</p> <p>Northern Ireland uses the single transferable vote for these elections, which means that everything hinges on what voters do with their second preferences. That makes polling these elections tricky. But <strong>James McMordie,</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.northernslant.com/the-long-path-to-brussels/\">a blog for Northern Slant</a>, has written a good analysis of the figures. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This result would also confirm the loss of unionism\u2019s majority, with the combined support for unionist parties falling from <strong>50.9% </strong>in 2014 to <strong>42.3% </strong>in 2019 \u2013 down <strong>8.6 points </strong>in just five years. This poll indicates that much of this loss in support has been born by the UUP, TUV and UKIP who are down <strong>1.5 points, 3.6 points </strong>and <strong>2.2 points </strong>respectively since 2014. This, combined with the rise in nationalist support to <strong>40.3%, </strong>means that the two nationalist parties would only be <strong>2% </strong>shy of the unionist total \u2013 a statistically negligible difference.</p> <p>However, first preferences only tell us part of the story. This is an STV (Single Transferable Vote) election and, as the name of the electoral system tells us, votes can be transferred. In their poll, LucidTalk also asked respondents about their second preferences in this election, data that should allow us to make an educated guess as to who might be best placed to take the third seat \u2013 assuming that the DUP reaches the quota to take the second.</p> <p>What is immediately clear from the data is that that Alliance is exceptionally well placed to pick up transfers from both Sinn F\u00e9in and the Greens. In fact, if this poll were to be replicated in the election, Alliance would receive almost half (<strong>42%</strong>) of Sinn F\u00e9in voters\u2019 second preferences \u2013 <em>almost 20 points more than the SDLP would receive</em>. Green voters are even more likely to transfer to Alliance, with <strong>71.3% </strong>indicating that Naomi Long would receive their second preference. By way of comparison, Danny Kennedy would only receive <strong>0.3% </strong>of Sinn F\u00e9in transfers and <strong>2.8% </strong>of Green transfers, whilst Colum Eastwood would only receive <strong>23.9% </strong>and <strong>5.6% </strong>respectively.</p> <p>This really matters in an election where Sinn F\u00e9in are likely to exceed the quota on first preferences and where the Greens appear likely to be eliminated early on. With Eastwood, Kennedy and Long so close on first preferences, Anderson\u2019s surplus alone could be enough to see Naomi Long overtake the UUP\u2019s Danny Kennedy. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"817de90c7f142fa2428b66bfedbca29c7cecb771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/817de90c7f142fa2428b66bfedbca29c7cecb771/0_0_899_470/500.jpg\" alt=\"LucidTalk polling for Northern Ireland\" width=\"500\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LucidTalk polling for Northern Ireland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Northern Slant</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cd98be28f088c3e913d54ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-13T15:27:06.925Z\">4.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed that he had been told by the head lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry that a no-deal Brexit would not affect the supply of drugs to the UK.

In 2017, after the general election, the government announced that this one would last two years, to allow Brexit legislation to be passed all in one session. But there is still no date for the next Queen\u2019s speech and, a<a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/parliament-and-elections/parliament/is-this-the-longest-parliamentary-session-ever/\">ccording to a House of Commons library blog </a>by <strong>Edward Hicks</strong>, this is now the longest session, measured by days, since the civil war.</p> <p>He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On 7 May 2019 the current parliamentary session reached a striking landmark. It became the longest session by sitting days since the English Civil War (1642-51). It was already unusual, having lasted over three different calendar years, beginning on 13 June 2017. As of Friday (10 May 2019) it has run for 298 sitting days, and 2,657 hours and 56 minutes ...</p> <p>This session is almost certain not to surpass the longest session by days. That was the Long Parliament. It began on the 3 November 1640, and continued, without prorogation, until the 20 April 1653. In total it sat for 3,322 days. Why did that parliament last so long? Simply put, because it was fighting Charles I in the English Civil War. Subsequently it arranged the trial and execution of the king; and was only ended when Cromwell called in his soldiers to forcibly remove MPs.</p> </blockquote> <p>In terms of sitting hours rather than days, this is also the longest session since sitting hours started being recorded in 1831. The previous longest session in terms of hours was 1966-67, when late-night sittings were the norm.</p> <p>The Long Parliament was eventually dissolved by<strong> Oliver Cromwell.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.britpolitics.co.uk/speeches-oliver-cromwell-long-parliament\">In a famous speech, </a>he told those MPs who were left that they had \u201cgrown intolerably odious to the whole nation\u201d.

Here are some of the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Farage said, if the Brexit party held the balance of power after a general election, it would do a deal with one of the main parties to pass a hard Brexit.</strong> Asked if he would do a deal with Labour or the Tories, if he had for example 50 MPs, Farage said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we could save \u00a339bn, come out of the customs union, come out of the single market, come out of the jurisdiction of the European court of justice and be a genuinely independent, self-governing democracy that could choose its own future, I\u2019d do a deal with the devil to get that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/hot-topics/brexit/nigel-farage-confirms-stand-mp-general-election/\"><strong>He said he would see it as his \u201cduty\u201d to stand for parliament himself at the next general election.</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said Brexit allegiances now matter much more than party political allegiances.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think what\u2019s going on here is people\u2019s traditional allegiance, whether they are left of centre or right of centre, is now considered to be irrelevant by most people. People are now identifying as leavers or remainers more than being left or right, more than being Tory or Labour.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly claims the opposite, saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/09/brexit-latest-news-corbyn-manifesto-launch-corbyn-seeks-to-make-euro-elections-about-social-justice-not-brexit-as-he-launches-labour-campaign-live-news?page=with:block-5cd3db378f084f582f896058#block-5cd3db378f084f582f896058\">(as he did in a speech last week)</a> \u201cthe real divide in our country is not how people voted in the EU referendum.\u201d But, as my colleague <strong>Matthew d\u2019Ancona</strong> says<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/12/labour-tories-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may\"> in his column today,</a> polling evidence backs up Farage\u2019s analysis more than Corbyn\u2019s. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Farage rejected claims that a no-deal Brexit would lead to extra delays at borders, saying tariffs could be logged via the internet and mobile phones.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Already as a result of the no-deal preparations, which the EU have done more extensively than we have done ... already the airline potential problem is sorted ... There are disruptions every day with airports. You get fog on an airport, you get disruption.</p> <p>I spoke to the head of the pharmaceutical industry, the head of their lobbyists, and said: \u201cWhat about all these scare stories about drugs?\u201d He said: \u201cAbsolute, total nonsense. Everybody is prepared.\u201d</p> <p>And the president of the port of Calais has said there will be no increased transport times as a result of a WTO Brexit. All of this is doable. You know, business finds a way through every different situation. And, frankly, if you look at trade around the world now, where tariffs are due, this is all logged online, very often done by people on their mobile phones. The idea that somehow we are going to be cut off is utter nonsense.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sky\u2019s <strong>Lewis Goodall</strong> has also posted an interesting Twitter thread about the rally.

This is also an election in which if you want to elect MEPs to send a message to the big two you are opposed to Brexit then you are obviously, demonstrably and objectively better off voting for the Liberal Democrats than Change.</p> <p>The only compelling argument to vote Change is to avert its early extinction: essentially to use your vote as a charitable donation or a down payment on the future, rather than to shape politics in the here and now.</p> <p>If Change can, after the launch it has had, secure anything close to 5 per cent of the vote, that is a remarkable endorsement of their future viability, a sign that if it can cut out the basic incompetence, learn how challenger parties succeed and repair its reputation in the bubble, it has a real prospect of genuine success. If it can do it while the Liberal Democrats are around the 15 per cent mark \u2013 which would equal their best ever showing since the switch to proportinal representation at a European election \u2013 then it will indicate that Change might also be able to bring over the voters that the Liberal Democrats cannot.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cd9629e8f088c3e913d52bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-13T12:28:12.688Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0e9c1b2fa3c4442fd8111c9dc4713bb6595fe17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0e9c1b2fa3c4442fd8111c9dc4713bb6595fe17/0_383_5449_3271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The DUP leader Arlene Foster (left) holding a photocall with Diane Dodds, the party\u2019s MEP candidate, at Seaview football stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DUP leader Arlene Foster (left) holding a photocall with Diane Dodds, the party\u2019s MEP candidate, at Seaview football stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cd9607f8f08d2b474ebac56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-13T12:26:16.344Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brexit party on course to get more than Labour and Lib Dems combined, with Tories heading for 5th place, in Euros, poll suggests</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>YouGov has also released<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/05/13/european-parliament-voting-intention-brex-34-lab-1\"> some GB-wide polling for the European elections today.</a> It suggests the Brexit party is on course to get more than Labour and the Lib Dems combined, and it suggests the Tories are on course to come fifth, also behind the Greens. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c970fa25b73d1c754cbfe23d5b0f5900d2a82dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c970fa25b73d1c754cbfe23d5b0f5900d2a82dd/0_0_655_393/500.jpg\" alt=\"Euro elections poll\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Euro elections poll</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cd95e1f8f08d2b474ebac38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-13T12:10:34.982Z\">1.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37594f0f07c2a7eb8fe756d66435ad11f81adc2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37594f0f07c2a7eb8fe756d66435ad11f81adc2c/0_35_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, with Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit party candidate, at a rally near Pontefract earlier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, with Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit party candidate, at a rally near Pontefract earlier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cd95c718f088c3e913d5282\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-13T12:06:09.825Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nigel Evans</strong>, the Tory Brexiter, told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live this morning that Tom Watson\u2019s Today interview this morning (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/may/13/brexit-latest-news-developments-crossparty-talks-labour-is-a-remain-and-reform-party-says-tom-watson-live-news?page=with:block-5cd91efa8f08ea3978d85766#block-5cd91efa8f08ea3978d85766\">9.21am)</a> showed why the cross-party Brexit talks were just \u201ca cosmetic exercise\u201d.

The talks resume this afternoon at 5pm. Asked about claims that cabinet ministers want to abandon them because getting a deal that would pass the Commons seems impossible (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/may/13/brexit-latest-news-developments-crossparty-talks-labour-is-a-remain-and-reform-party-says-tom-watson-live-news?page=with:block-5cd92d4a8f088c3e913d50d9#block-5cd92d4a8f088c3e913d50d9\">9.50am)</a>, the spokesman replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The PM tried to secure passage of the withdrawal agreement on three separate occasions in order to be able to deliver Brexit with the votes of Conservative MPs and with DUP confidence and supply partners. That was not possible. So, in order to try to find a way through to deliver upon the result of the referendum, cabinet decided to go into talks with the opposition. Those talks have been serious. They have also been difficult. There are more discussions taking place this evening. So, let\u2019s see how they go. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman played down the prospect of MPs being asked to vote for the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill before the European elections on Thursday next week.</strong> The spokesman said that, if the cross-party talks made progress, the government was looking to bring the bill to the Commons before next Thursday. Asked whether that meant just publishing the bill, or holding the second reading debate and vote, the spokesman said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It means putting it before the House of Commons.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is ambiguous, but it seems to imply just publishing the bill, something that normally coincides with the bill getting a first reading (a formality that does not involve a debate or a division).</p> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman rejected the proposal from Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, for the bill to be amended with a clause saying the backstop could never be used.</strong> Brady floated this idea <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-talks-latest_uk_5cd6be83e4b054da4e8a04ce\">in an interview for the BBC\u2019s Week in Westminster on Saturday.</a> But the spokesman said this plan would not be acceptable to the EU. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are clear that if we are to secure ratification of the withdrawal agreement, then we obviously need to abide by the agreement that we reached with the EU.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman said May remained committed to holding indicative votes in the Commons on Brexit if the cross-party talks failed.</strong> But the spokesman also said that May herself had not used the term \u201cindicative votes\u201d to refer to the process, which would involve MPs voting on several options until one emerged as the winner. Asked if May would only go ahead with this if Labour agreed to be bound by the result, which is something May has previously said would be necessary, the spokesman said \u201cideally\u201d Labour would back the plan. But he did not rule out it going ahead without Labour\u2019s endorsement.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5ca1762a83123201e9dbad75d60ac7a117e225e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5ca1762a83123201e9dbad75d60ac7a117e225e/0_732_2355_1412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Downing Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cd93e3e8f08ea3978d8582c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-13T09:57:44.733Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Only route to no-deal Brexit is via second referendum, Osborne claims</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>George Osborne,</strong> the Conservative former chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard, thinks that Brexiters who want no-deal will end up having to back a second referendum.

He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The difficulty is just parliamentary arithmetic and Keir Starmer has alluded to this today as well, and John McDonnell did last week. The whipping arrangements for these deals is very difficult because MPs have hardened their positions within their parties so I think it would be very difficult ...</p> <p>If a deal could be found that inspires enough votes in Westminster then fine, but it seemed to me that that\u2019s very, very difficult. </p> <p>And so my idea of a confirmatory ballot is not a religious point or a point of ideology, it\u2019s just how do you get an outcome, how do you sort this out? </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to say whether Labour would insist on a Labour-style Brexit deal being put to a referendum.</strong> When asked what he wanted to happen, as opposed to what he expected to happen, Watson replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I want to happen is, I think the way out of this is a confirmatory ballot on Theresa May\u2019s deal, whatever that looks like.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, when asked what would happen if MPs were voting on a deal that included all Labour\u2019s demands, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think, if there is a Labour deal, then the shadow cabinet need to look at the detail of it. And we will consider it. I\u2019m not ruling it out, but not ruling it in. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He described Jeremy Corbyn as \u201ca great man\u201d and said he had faith in him. </strong>Today Watson is giving <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/john-smith-ex-labour-leader-would-have-backed-a-second-referendum-says-tom-watson_uk_5cd896e6e4b054da4e8b6110\">a speech to mark the 25th anniversary of John Smith\u2019s death.</a> When it was put to Watson that he said he had faith in Smith, and when he was asked if he would say the same about Corbyn, Watson replied: \u201cYes, of course.

Asked if a deal was still possible, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These talks are very serious.

It might be a simplistic message, and a relatively hollow message (beyond \u2018we want a WTO Brexit\u2019, the party does not seem to have any other positions at all), but you can summarise on a poster where the party stands on the main issue for the European elections.</p> <p>The same cannot be said for some of the other parties and Labour\u2019s equivocation on the issue was illustrated this morning in an interview on the Today programme given by <strong>Tom Watson</strong>, the Labour deputy leader. Watson said he agreed with what Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/12/keir-starmer-brexit-deal-unlikely-pass-without-confirmatory-referendum-interview\"> told the Guardian in an interview </a>about how any cross-party Brexit deal without a confirmatory referendum would struggle to pass through the Commons because up to 150 MPs are insisting on one. But Watson was evasive as to whether he would want a deal on a Labour-style Brexit to be put to a confirmatory vote.</p> <p>Then the presenter, <strong>Justin Webb</strong>, asked Watson to sum up Labour\u2019s Brexit position. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For someone thinking of voting in the European elections, and wondering whether or not to vote Labour, are you a Brexit party or a non-Brexit party?</p> </blockquote> <p>Watson replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are a remain and reform party but obviously, when it comes to a deal, people can form their own view.</p> <p>But when it comes to that European election, remain is not on the ballot paper in that election. </p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cRemain and reform\u201d sums up Labour\u2019s position in the referendum in 2016. But it is not how all Watson\u2019s colleagues describe its position now. There have been at least two other answers to this question.</p> <p><em>1) Labour not a remain party</em></p> <p>Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the person who has said this most directly. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-47721160/brexit-labour-not-a-remain-party-barry-gardiner-says\">\u201cLabour is not a remain party now,\u201d</a> he said in March.

      "bodyText": "Cross-party talks between the government and Labour aimed at finding a Brexit compromise have resumed at Westminster this afternoon. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has said that party political allegiances are becoming \u201cirrelevant\u201d compared to people\u2019s views on Brexit at a triumphalist rally near Pontefract. (See 2.42pm.) He also said his party would only present a \u201cfull slate\u201d of policy ideas once next week\u2019s European elections are over. The Brexit Party has distanced itself from its national election agent after it emerged he had defended Tommy Robinson, BuzzFeed has revealed. Sinn Fein has urged Northern Ireland\u2019s voters to back pro-remain candidates in the European election. At the party\u2019s European elections campaign launch, Mary Lou McDonald, the party president, called for her party\u2019s candidate, Martina Anderson, to be given the number one preference, before transferring to \u201cpro-remain, progressive candidates\u201d. McDonald said: Brexit changes everything for all of us, and it\u2019s for that reason that we identify this as maybe a unique and unifying moment of solidarity for people who want what is best for all of us right across Ireland. The only thing to do is to vote for pro-remain parties and reject Brexit. Martina Anderson [the Sinn Fein candidate] is the strongest advocate of the pro-remain position, I think it\u2019s important that a pro-remain candidate tops the poll, but I also think it\u2019s very important that, in the round, the pro-remain argument wins the day. So I would say to everybody, whether they come from unionism or from nationalism, or they are somewhere in between, think long and think hard, and be sure in this European election that we send the right, the accurate and the progressive signal to Brussels, to London, and beyond, that people here are united in a desire for progress to protect our peace process, our peace agreements, to protect our economy, our livelihoods, our agriculture, that\u2019s what a vote for a pro-remain candidate amounts to. The current session of parliament is now the longest since the civil war period as the impasse over Brexit continues, House of Commons officials have said. Heidi Allen, the leader of the pro-remain Change UK party, has challenged the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, to a live TV debate before the European elections. More than 800 people were unable to vote during a second trial of compulsory voter ID at this month\u2019s local elections, according to interim figures. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has told ITV he is considering introducing fines for companies that waste food. Theresa May has vowed to end the postcode lottery for those escaping domestic abuse. As Aamna Mohdin reports, thousands of people seeking refuge from abusive and violent relationships will be better protected by a new legal duty for councils to provide secure homes for them and their children. The prime minister said the policy aimed to end variations in provision across the country and bolster protection in the domestic abuse bill being considered by MPs. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. My colleague, John Crace, was at Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party rally this morning. His sketch is exceptionally good - although the word \u201csketch\u201d does not do justice to the bleak tone running through his analysis. Here is an extract. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t make this stuff up,\u201d yelled the next speaker, John Longworth, the former head of the British Chambers of Commerce and Brexit party candidate for the north-east. Except he did make it up. He lied through his teeth. He told the crowd Brexit had won an overwhelming majority at the referendum, rather than a 52%-48% majority. He told them Westminster was denying them their birthright, forgetting to mention the reason the UK had not already left the EU was because of Brexiters voting down a deal for which they would have given their back teeth three years ago. He told them a no-deal, World Trade Organization Brexit would turn Yorkshire into the land of milk and honey. Others came and went promising much the same. The local MPs Yvette Cooper and Jon Trickett were booed and openly denounced as traitors. The person to my left to whom I had been chatting before the event advised me not to mention I worked for the Guardian. As if I needed telling. This was the blitz spirit being whipped up into a lynch mob. There was a time when a Farage event always came with an element of humour. As if neither he nor his audiences were expected to take him entirely seriously. This is now something else. Ice-cold calculation tapping into a crowd worn down by austerity and waiting on deliverance. No retreat, baby, no surrender. And here is John\u2019s article in full. Do read it. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, has endorsed the Green party\u2019s lead candidate in the eastern region for the European elections. In a statement he said: It is harder and harder to pretend that we\u2019re not living in the middle of the most serious environmental crisis in recorded history. We desperately need people in British and indeed global politics who are not afraid to name this challenge for what it is, and to look at what needs to change in our lives if we are to avoid terrible cost to future generations and to the most vulnerable people of our own generation across the world. Catherine Rowett is someone with the honesty, the courage and the clarity to speak out and think hard on these matters, and I sincerely wish there were more like her in our public life. I have deep confidence in her integrity and vision. This is from the Green MP Caroline Lucas. Northern Ireland elects three MEPs. In the past two of the seats have always gone to unionists (the DUP and the UUP), and one to a nationalist or republican (currently Sinn Fein). But a LucidTalk poll suggests that the UUP could be on course to lose the third seat, to be replaced by the non-sectarian Alliance party, the sister party of the Lib Dems in Britain. Northern Ireland uses the single transferable vote for these elections, which means that everything hinges on what voters do with their second preferences. That makes polling these elections tricky. But James McMordie, in a blog for Northern Slant, has written a good analysis of the figures. Here\u2019s an extract. This result would also confirm the loss of unionism\u2019s majority, with the combined support for unionist parties falling from 50.9% in 2014 to 42.3% in 2019 \u2013 down 8.6 points in just five years. This poll indicates that much of this loss in support has been born by the UUP, TUV and UKIP who are down 1.5 points, 3.6 points and 2.2 points respectively since 2014. This, combined with the rise in nationalist support to 40.3%, means that the two nationalist parties would only be 2% shy of the unionist total \u2013 a statistically negligible difference. However, first preferences only tell us part of the story. This is an STV (Single Transferable Vote) election and, as the name of the electoral system tells us, votes can be transferred. In their poll, LucidTalk also asked respondents about their second preferences in this election, data that should allow us to make an educated guess as to who might be best placed to take the third seat \u2013 assuming that the DUP reaches the quota to take the second. What is immediately clear from the data is that that Alliance is exceptionally well placed to pick up transfers from both Sinn F\u00e9in and the Greens. In fact, if this poll were to be replicated in the election, Alliance would receive almost half (42%) of Sinn F\u00e9in voters\u2019 second preferences \u2013 almost 20 points more than the SDLP would receive. Green voters are even more likely to transfer to Alliance, with 71.3% indicating that Naomi Long would receive their second preference. By way of comparison, Danny Kennedy would only receive 0.3% of Sinn F\u00e9in transfers and 2.8% of Green transfers, whilst Colum Eastwood would only receive 23.9% and 5.6% respectively. This really matters in an election where Sinn F\u00e9in are likely to exceed the quota on first preferences and where the Greens appear likely to be eliminated early on. With Eastwood, Kennedy and Long so close on first preferences, Anderson\u2019s surplus alone could be enough to see Naomi Long overtake the UUP\u2019s Danny Kennedy. Earlier Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed that he had been told by the head lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry that a no-deal Brexit would not affect the supply of drugs to the UK. (See 2.42pm.) A reader has been in touch to point out that that is not what the industry has been saying in public. This is what Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said in March, after Theresa May\u2019s deal was voted down for the second time. He said: Pharmaceutical companies have done everything in their power to prepare for a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit. This includes increasing stocks of medicines, changing and adding new supply routes and duplicating manufacturing processes here and in Europe. Despite these efforts, we have always said that in a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario we could face the very real possibility of disruption to the supply of some medicines. Most sessions of parliament - the period between a Queen\u2019s speech and prorogation, a few days before the next Queen\u2019s speech - last around a year. In 2017, after the general election, the government announced that this one would last two years, to allow Brexit legislation to be passed all in one session. But there is still no date for the next Queen\u2019s speech and, according to a House of Commons library blog by Edward Hicks, this is now the longest session, measured by days, since the civil war. He explains: On 7 May 2019 the current parliamentary session reached a striking landmark. It became the longest session by sitting days since the English Civil War (1642-51). It was already unusual, having lasted over three different calendar years, beginning on 13 June 2017. As of Friday (10 May 2019) it has run for 298 sitting days, and 2,657 hours and 56 minutes ... This session is almost certain not to surpass the longest session by days. That was the Long Parliament. It began on the 3 November 1640, and continued, without prorogation, until the 20 April 1653. In total it sat for 3,322 days. Why did that parliament last so long? Simply put, because it was fighting Charles I in the English Civil War. Subsequently it arranged the trial and execution of the king; and was only ended when Cromwell called in his soldiers to forcibly remove MPs. In terms of sitting hours rather than days, this is also the longest session since sitting hours started being recorded in 1831. The previous longest session in terms of hours was 1966-67, when late-night sittings were the norm. The Long Parliament was eventually dissolved by Oliver Cromwell. In a famous speech, he told those MPs who were left that they had \u201cgrown intolerably odious to the whole nation\u201d. These days you only encounter that much contempt for parliamentarians at a Nigel Farage rally. Here is Ben Bradshaw, the Labour pro-European, on today\u2019s YouGov polling for the European elections. The Brexit party chose somewhere near Pontefract as the venue for their rally this morning deliberately. Nigel Farage has said the party wants to target Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, because he claims she is trying to block Brexit when her constituents voted for it by almost 70%. (Although the party said the venue, a working men\u2019s club, was in Pontefract, in fact it was in the neighbouring parliamentary constituency, Hemsworth, represented by Jon Trickett.) Cooper did introduce the bill intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit by requiring the PM to seek an article 50 extension. But Cooper is only opposed to no-deal; she is not campaigning to stop Brexit in all circumstances. In a statement responding to the rally, Cooper said: It won\u2019t be Nigel Farage and right wing hardliners who suffer if manufacturing jobs are lost and food prices go up as a result of the divisive no-deal chaos they want, it will be hard-working families in manufacturing towns like ours. Nigel Farage still defends Margaret Thatcher\u2019s policies yet coalfield communities haven\u2019t forgotten the damage she did to towns across the country. We cannot let them undermine our public services and manufacturing industry again. We need some common sense and for the cross-party talks to bring people together and get a workable deal in place, not just people shouting at each other and putting local jobs at risk. BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham says the message sent to Tory MPs saying they would be on a three-line whip on Thursday (ie, obliged to be in the Commons, implying an important vote could be in the offing) was sent in error. After the Brexit party rally near Pontefract this morning, Nigel Farage, the party leader, did a Facebook live interview with LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood. Here are some of the main points. Farage said, if the Brexit party held the balance of power after a general election, it would do a deal with one of the main parties to pass a hard Brexit. Asked if he would do a deal with Labour or the Tories, if he had for example 50 MPs, Farage said: If we could save \u00a339bn, come out of the customs union, come out of the single market, come out of the jurisdiction of the European court of justice and be a genuinely independent, self-governing democracy that could choose its own future, I\u2019d do a deal with the devil to get that. He said he would see it as his \u201cduty\u201d to stand for parliament himself at the next general election. He said Brexit allegiances now matter much more than party political allegiances. He said: I think what\u2019s going on here is people\u2019s traditional allegiance, whether they are left of centre or right of centre, is now considered to be irrelevant by most people. People are now identifying as leavers or remainers more than being left or right, more than being Tory or Labour. Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly claims the opposite, saying (as he did in a speech last week) \u201cthe real divide in our country is not how people voted in the EU referendum.\u201d But, as my colleague Matthew d\u2019Ancona says in his column today, polling evidence backs up Farage\u2019s analysis more than Corbyn\u2019s. Farage rejected claims that a no-deal Brexit would lead to extra delays at borders, saying tariffs could be logged via the internet and mobile phones. He said: Already as a result of the no-deal preparations, which the EU have done more extensively than we have done ... already the airline potential problem is sorted ... There are disruptions every day with airports. You get fog on an airport, you get disruption. I spoke to the head of the pharmaceutical industry, the head of their lobbyists, and said: \u201cWhat about all these scare stories about drugs?\u201d He said: \u201cAbsolute, total nonsense. Everybody is prepared.\u201d And the president of the port of Calais has said there will be no increased transport times as a result of a WTO Brexit. All of this is doable. You know, business finds a way through every different situation. And, frankly, if you look at trade around the world now, where tariffs are due, this is all logged online, very often done by people on their mobile phones. The idea that somehow we are going to be cut off is utter nonsense. Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall has also posted an interesting Twitter thread about the rally. It starts here. And it includes these. This is from the Manchester Evening News\u2019 Jennifer Williams. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. UPDATE: It was an error, apparently. The Labour pro-European Ben Bradshaw says the Lib Dem surge implied by today\u2019s YouGov polling figures (see 12.36pm and 1.26pm) should be a warning to Labour as to what will happen if it continues to sit on the fence over Brexit. In a statement released by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, he said: It is also good to see Keir Starmer speaking up for the vast majority of Labour MPs, members and voters in supporting a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal. It is long past time we had greater clarity and consistency on this issue. Today\u2019s YouGov poll, showing a surge towards the Lib Dems with the Labour vote falling, is a stark warning about what will happen if we continue to give the impression that we are trying to sit on the fence. Todays\u2019 YouGov polling has Change UK on course to get 5% of the vote in next week\u2019s European elections. (See 1.26pm.) That might look like a very poor result but, in an interesting and counter-intuitive article, the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush argues that, given all the problems its campaign has faced (many self-inflicted, some not), 5% would be an unbelievably good showing for the party. Here\u2019s an extract. This is an election in which most people have not heard from Change, do not know who Change\u2019s MPs are or what they stand for, and those who have heard about Change have largely not heard good things. This is also an election in which if you want to elect MEPs to send a message to the big two you are opposed to Brexit then you are obviously, demonstrably and objectively better off voting for the Liberal Democrats than Change. The only compelling argument to vote Change is to avert its early extinction: essentially to use your vote as a charitable donation or a down payment on the future, rather than to shape politics in the here and now. If Change can, after the launch it has had, secure anything close to 5 per cent of the vote, that is a remarkable endorsement of their future viability, a sign that if it can cut out the basic incompetence, learn how challenger parties succeed and repair its reputation in the bubble, it has a real prospect of genuine success. If it can do it while the Liberal Democrats are around the 15 per cent mark \u2013 which would equal their best ever showing since the switch to proportinal representation at a European election \u2013 then it will indicate that Change might also be able to bring over the voters that the Liberal Democrats cannot. YouGov has also released some GB-wide polling for the European elections today. It suggests the Brexit party is on course to get more than Labour and the Lib Dems combined, and it suggests the Tories are on course to come fifth, also behind the Greens. Nigel Evans, the Tory Brexiter, told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live this morning that Tom Watson\u2019s Today interview this morning (see 9.21am) showed why the cross-party Brexit talks were just \u201ca cosmetic exercise\u201d. He said: These talks that are resuming today between the Labour party and the Conservatives are nothing more than a cosmetic exercise, which was displayed by Tom Watson this morning. How can we possibly talk to a Labour party that has its deputy leader of that party saying now they wish to remain and reform the European Union? Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has reaffirmed her opposition to a second referendum. Speaking at the launch of the DUP\u2019s European elections campaign in at Seaview football stadium in north Belfast, she said: We have to deliver on the wishes of the people - democracy is at risk here if we do not respect the wishes of the people in the referendum. And that\u2019s why we believe we should defend the Union and deliver on Brexit. She also accused Theresa May of not having a vision for the UK after Brexit. She said: We have a prime minister frankly who doesn\u2019t have the vision for the United Kingdom post Brexit that we all want to see. We want to see a United Kingdom that is strong post-Brexit and has a close relationship with Europe. And these are from the academic Philip Cowley on the latest YouGov polling for London. (See 12.36pm.) Cowley says Labour got less than 10% of the vote in two regions in the 2009 European elections. It was on 7.7% in the south west, he says, and on 8.2% in the south east. In both cases Labour was in fifth place in the region, he says. The Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy has been tweeting about the results of some new YouGov polling about voting intention in London. The Conservatives are on course to come fifth in the capital in the European election, he says. I\u2019m back from the Number 10 lobby briefing, and I\u2019m afraid it was not fantastically revelatory. On Tuesday last week Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said the cross-party talks had reached \u201ccrunch time\u201d. Now Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, says this week represents \u201ccrunch week\u201d. (See 10.24am.) It is all very Groundhog Day, and the lobby briefing reflected that. Still, a few shreds of information emerged. Here they are. Theresa May has not given up hope of the cross-party talks reaching an agreement, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman suggested. The talks resume this afternoon at 5pm. Asked about claims that cabinet ministers want to abandon them because getting a deal that would pass the Commons seems impossible (see 9.50am), the spokesman replied: The PM tried to secure passage of the withdrawal agreement on three separate occasions in order to be able to deliver Brexit with the votes of Conservative MPs and with DUP confidence and supply partners. That was not possible. So, in order to try to find a way through to deliver upon the result of the referendum, cabinet decided to go into talks with the opposition. Those talks have been serious. They have also been difficult. There are more discussions taking place this evening. So, let\u2019s see how they go. The spokesman played down the prospect of MPs being asked to vote for the second reading of the EU withdrawal agreement bill before the European elections on Thursday next week. The spokesman said that, if the cross-party talks made progress, the government was looking to bring the bill to the Commons before next Thursday. Asked whether that meant just publishing the bill, or holding the second reading debate and vote, the spokesman said: It means putting it before the House of Commons. That is ambiguous, but it seems to imply just publishing the bill, something that normally coincides with the bill getting a first reading (a formality that does not involve a debate or a division). The spokesman rejected the proposal from Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, for the bill to be amended with a clause saying the backstop could never be used. Brady floated this idea in an interview for the BBC\u2019s Week in Westminster on Saturday. But the spokesman said this plan would not be acceptable to the EU. He said: We are clear that if we are to secure ratification of the withdrawal agreement, then we obviously need to abide by the agreement that we reached with the EU. The spokesman said May remained committed to holding indicative votes in the Commons on Brexit if the cross-party talks failed. But the spokesman also said that May herself had not used the term \u201cindicative votes\u201d to refer to the process, which would involve MPs voting on several options until one emerged as the winner. Asked if May would only go ahead with this if Labour agreed to be bound by the result, which is something May has previously said would be necessary, the spokesman said \u201cideally\u201d Labour would back the plan. But he did not rule out it going ahead without Labour\u2019s endorsement. George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard, thinks that Brexiters who want no-deal will end up having to back a second referendum. He explains why in an editor\u2019s reply letter in today\u2019s Standard, setting out why he disagrees with those proposing a three-question referendum (on Theresa May\u2019s deal, no-deal or remain). He explains: My guess is that we\u2019ll end up with just two: no deal or no Brexit. For leaving with a deal is dead. The numbers in the Commons aren\u2019t there for Theresa May\u2019s deal; and the EU won\u2019t negotiate a new deal with a new Tory leader, whatever the various candidates may claim. That\u2019s why more and more Tory MPs support no deal, a position most would have regarded as reckless just a year ago. But there isn\u2019t a majority in the Commons to allow it to happen. You could try to change the composition of the Commons with a general election, but the Tories won\u2019t risk that \u2014 even with a new leader. So here\u2019s the emerging truth: the only way to deliver a no-deal Brexit in the next couple of years is with a second referendum. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. Here are the main points from Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s LBC phone-in this morning. Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, said most Conservative activists he met were voting for the Brexit party. As LBC reports, he said: Normally when you go and speak to Conservative associations and you\u2019re not fully supportive of the leader of the party, whoever that leader happens to be, you\u2019re not the most popular person in the room. At the moment, nobody is saying anything supportive of the leader or of the leader\u2019s policy. The majority of the people at associations I\u2019m addressing \u2013 and these are members of the party \u2013 tell me they\u2019re voting for the Brexit party. This is in line with the findings of a ConservativeHome survey of members last month that found that 60% of them said they would vote for the Brexit party in the Euro elections. He said he did not see how Theresa May could continue with so little support from the members. He said: I don\u2019t see how a leader can go on so removed from the support base of the party membership. He said he was urging people to vote for the Conservatives in the European elections for the sake of May\u2019s successor. Referring to disillusioned Tories, he said: I would appeal to their loyalty, to their tradition and to say that the Conservative party will get a new leader at some point. We want that new leader to have a base on which he or she can build and if we find that we are getting under 15% of the vote, if we are coming fifth behind the Greens, then it will be harder for that figure to rebuild. He said the BBC was biased in favour of remain. As LBC reports, he said: The partiality of the BBC has become clearer and clearer. It is a pro-remain organisation, it regularly has more pro-remain interviewees on its programmes. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said that the cross-party Brexit talks are in a \u201ccrunch week\u201d but that agreement on a confirmatory referendum on a deal would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Speaking in Brussels ahead of a regular meeting of ministers from the EU\u2019s 28 member states, Hunt said: We are talking to the Labour leadership, we have had very detailed discussions. People have been pessimistic that these discussions won\u2019t go anywhere but they have continued, this is a crunch week. From the Conservative point of view, we have always said that [a second referendum] would be a betrayal of what people voted for and we want to implement the first referendum. Here are the main points from Tom Watson\u2019s Today interview. Watson said Labour was a \u201cremain and reform party\u201d. (See 9.21am.) He said he thought it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d for Labour to pass a compromise Brexit deal without a confirmatory referendum attached. That was because a large number of Labour MPs would insist on one, he said. He explained: The difficulty is just parliamentary arithmetic and Keir Starmer has alluded to this today as well, and John McDonnell did last week. The whipping arrangements for these deals is very difficult because MPs have hardened their positions within their parties so I think it would be very difficult ... If a deal could be found that inspires enough votes in Westminster then fine, but it seemed to me that that\u2019s very, very difficult. And so my idea of a confirmatory ballot is not a religious point or a point of ideology, it\u2019s just how do you get an outcome, how do you sort this out? He refused to say whether Labour would insist on a Labour-style Brexit deal being put to a referendum. When asked what he wanted to happen, as opposed to what he expected to happen, Watson replied: What I want to happen is, I think the way out of this is a confirmatory ballot on Theresa May\u2019s deal, whatever that looks like. Then, when asked what would happen if MPs were voting on a deal that included all Labour\u2019s demands, he said: I think, if there is a Labour deal, then the shadow cabinet need to look at the detail of it. And we will consider it. I\u2019m not ruling it out, but not ruling it in. He described Jeremy Corbyn as \u201ca great man\u201d and said he had faith in him. Today Watson is giving a speech to mark the 25th anniversary of John Smith\u2019s death. When it was put to Watson that he said he had faith in Smith, and when he was asked if he would say the same about Corbyn, Watson replied: \u201cYes, of course. Jeremy is a great man.\u201d Watson went on: I\u2019ve got differences with him, like we all have in all parties. But we\u2019ve never raised our voice to each other. We have different views, and I think that\u2019s the kind of Labour party he wants. Sometimes I get irritated with the decisions his political grouping make, but it wouldn\u2019t be the Labour party if we [didn\u2019t have disagreements]. Today\u2019s Times splashes on a story by Oliver Wright (paywall) saying Theresa May is coming under pressure from cabinet colleagues to abandon the cross-party talks on Brexit, with even Philip Hammond, one of the most pro-compromise members of the government, reportedly convinced they are doomed to fail. The story says: Theresa May was under pressure from cabinet ministers last night to scrap formal Brexit talks with Labour and launch a final attempt to secure a compromise in parliament. Supporters of a deal with the European Union are preparing to use tomorrow\u2019s cabinet meeting to urge the prime minister to set a timetable for indicative votes by MPs after the European elections. The move comes amid growing criticism from Conservatives of the talks, which are due to begin again today, as ministers who previously supported them lose faith. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is understood to have told colleagues that, while \u201camiable\u201d, they are being held on the \u201cfalse premise\u201d that a politically acceptable deal could ever be struck. On the Today programme this morning James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, insisted that he did believe a deal with Labour was still possible. Asked if a deal was still possible, he replied: These talks are very serious. Yes, we would not have committed all of the time and effort on all sides in relation to this [if we did not think a deal was possible]. They have been constructive, they have been detailed, and obviously they will resume later today. And I very much want to see them concluding positively. Here is some Twitter comment on Tom Watson\u2019s Today interview. From MPs From the Labour pro-European Ben Bradshaw From Nick Boles, the former Conservative now sitting as an independent who wants a Norway-style Brexit compromise From Anna Soubry, the former Conservative who is now a Change UK MP From journalists From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn Here is the clip of Tom Watson on Today. One of the reasons why Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party is doing so well in the polls at the moment is that it has a very clear message. It might be a simplistic message, and a relatively hollow message (beyond \u2018we want a WTO Brexit\u2019, the party does not seem to have any other positions at all), but you can summarise on a poster where the party stands on the main issue for the European elections. The same cannot be said for some of the other parties and Labour\u2019s equivocation on the issue was illustrated this morning in an interview on the Today programme given by Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader. Watson said he agreed with what Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Guardian in an interview about how any cross-party Brexit deal without a confirmatory referendum would struggle to pass through the Commons because up to 150 MPs are insisting on one. But Watson was evasive as to whether he would want a deal on a Labour-style Brexit to be put to a confirmatory vote. Then the presenter, Justin Webb, asked Watson to sum up Labour\u2019s Brexit position. He said: For someone thinking of voting in the European elections, and wondering whether or not to vote Labour, are you a Brexit party or a non-Brexit party? Watson replied: We are a remain and reform party but obviously, when it comes to a deal, people can form their own view. But when it comes to that European election, remain is not on the ballot paper in that election. \u201cRemain and reform\u201d sums up Labour\u2019s position in the referendum in 2016. But it is not how all Watson\u2019s colleagues describe its position now. There have been at least two other answers to this question. 1) Labour not a remain party Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, is the person who has said this most directly. \u201cLabour is not a remain party now,\u201d he said in March. But John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, has said much the same thing. 2) Labour a party for remain and leave Jeremy Corbyn insists Labour is a party for people who have supported remain and leave. He set out this argument most recently on Thursday, when he said he made no apology for saying Labour was \u201ctrying to offer something to everyone over Brexit\u201d. I will post more from the Watson interview soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, hosts his LBC phone-in. 9.30am: Labour MP Yvette Cooper gives a speech at the launch of a Resolution Foundation report on the impact of the economic downturn on young workers. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, holds a rally in Pontefract. 2.30pm: Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. Afternoon: The government/Labour talks on a possible Brexit compromise resume. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Many London churches were designed to accommodate well over 600 worshipers and are underused. Most have replaced their forward-facing pews with chairs. The churches are used mostly on Saturdays and Sundays when parliament is away. So the solution is to find a large church with chairs, turn them to face the nave in the week and forward for weddings and services at the weekend. It might even have the benefit of making MPs show more respect for the institution they sit in, instead of shouting as though they were still in the playground.

Many London churches were designed to accommodate well over 600 worshipers and are underused. Most have replaced their forward-facing pews with chairs. The churches are used mostly on Saturdays and Sundays when parliament is away. So the solution is to find a large church with chairs, turn them to face the nave in the week and forward for weddings and services at the weekend. It might even have the benefit of making MPs show more respect for the institution they sit in, instead of shouting as though they were still in the playground.

But it seemed to me that that\u2019s very difficult.</p> <p>\u201cMy idea of a confirmatory ballot is not a religious point, or a point of ideology, it\u2019s just \u2013 how do you get an outcome, how do you sort this out.\u201d</p> <p>Later on Monday, Watson was due to make a speech marking the 25th anniversary of John Smith\u2019s death in which he was to argue that the former Labour leader, as a pro-European internationalist, would have also backed a second referendum.</p> <p>\u201cIf John was alive today, to witness the great damage this process is wreaking on country and our public debate, I have no doubt that he would have taken a stand very similar to that of his deputy, Margaret Beckett, and backed a people\u2019s vote as a way out of this destructive mess,\u201d Watson was to say.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/12/keir-starmer-brexit-deal-unlikely-pass-without-confirmatory-referendum-interview\">In an interview with the Guardian,</a> Starmer said a second referendum would be needed to buoy up any deal with the government.</p> <p>\u201cA significant number of Labour MPs, probably 120 if not 150, would not back a deal if it hasn\u2019t got a confirmatory vote,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the point of the exercise is to get a sustainable majority, over several weeks or months of delivering on the implementation, you can\u2019t leave a confirmatory vote out of the package.\u201d</p> <p>He said finding a parliamentary majority for any deal, whatever the circumstances, was \u201cvery difficult\u201d, and suggested he could not sign up to any agreement if he feared it would fail.</p> <p>\u201cIt has got to be something truly deliverable,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many of my colleagues, they have made it clear that they will not vote for a deal without a confirmatory vote attached to it. So if you want that stable majority, that has to be taken into account. And without it, it is impossible to see how the numbers would stack up.\u201d</p> <p>Also speaking on the Today programme on Monday, the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, dismissed reports that the talks with Labour were doomed.</p> <p>\u201cThese talks are very serious, yes \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have committed all of the time and effort on all sides in relation to this.

In an interview with the Guardian, Starmer said a second referendum would be needed to buoy up any deal with the government. \u201cA significant number of Labour MPs, probably 120 if not 150, would not back a deal if it hasn\u2019t got a confirmatory vote,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the point of the exercise is to get a sustainable majority, over several weeks or months of delivering on the implementation, you can\u2019t leave a confirmatory vote out of the package.\u201d He said finding a parliamentary majority for any deal, whatever the circumstances, was \u201cvery difficult\u201d, and suggested he could not sign up to any agreement if he feared it would fail. \u201cIt has got to be something truly deliverable,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many of my colleagues, they have made it clear that they will not vote for a deal without a confirmatory vote attached to it. So if you want that stable majority, that has to be taken into account. And without it, it is impossible to see how the numbers would stack up.\u201d Also speaking on the Today programme on Monday, the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, dismissed reports that the talks with Labour were doomed. \u201cThese talks are very serious, yes \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have committed all of the time and effort on all sides in relation to this. They have been constructive, they have been detailed,\u201d he said. Starmer\u2019s comments were, Brokenshire added, \u201ca slightly different message to the core message that the Labour party has been giving about a second referendum\u201d. Brokenshire said he believed a second vote was a bad idea: \u201cThese talks are about how to give effect to the referendum, how we give effect to leave the EU, not somehow reopening the debate all over again.\u201d",
