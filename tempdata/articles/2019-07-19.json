The jurors have been assembled to listen to briefings, pose questions, assess facts, debate and discuss, and then ultimately recommend action to Camden council. The big question before them is what action the district can take to limit global heating and its impact.</p> \n<p>The hope is that the series of deliberations this summer will have a bearing not just on the climate crisis but on the crisis in democracy too. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/20/uk-citizens-assembly-on-climate-emergency-announced\">national climate assembly</a> is planned for Westminster this autumn and Camden is being closely watched for the dos and don\u2019ts of this relatively new form of public engagement.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am interested in the idea of citizens assemblies and not just for climate change,\u201d said the local MP Keir Starmer, a Labour frontbencher. \u201cI think they might turn out to be a way to have a different kind of political dialogue to avoid the shouty tribalism of the last few years.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

The opening session, something of a factfinding exercise, is held on a muggy summer night in the semi-basement rotunda of Swiss Cottage public library. The room swelters, as if to make a point. A woman wafts a fan. Facilitators urge brevity, inquiry, civility. One helpful juror draws a smiley face on a paper cup to keep a restless child amused.</p> \n<p>Climate experts such as Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London, set out the indisputable science of the climate emergency. Participants have yellow and red cards to slow him down or stop him if they get lost. (\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been red-carded during a presentation,\u201d he says later.)</p> \n<p>Not everyone finds it easy. One young woman is on the verge of walking out because progress is slow. For others it\u2019s all a bit fast. And one juror, Neil Chappell, who works in construction, wonders who chose the experts and how they chose the facts. \u201cThe people they had talking were good at getting their agenda over but didn\u2019t give us enough information to make informed decisions,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"438675884c743b19a9b8ef5741f206a9d9e06ce3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/438675884c743b19a9b8ef5741f206a9d9e06ce3/0_160_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Information boards at a Citizens Assembly session\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Information boards at a citizens\u2019 assembly session.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanessa Berberian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A gulf in knowledge between jurors is exposed when they are invited to pose questions. One wondered: \u201cHow many people in Camden die from air pollution each year?\u201d. Another asked: \u201cCan wind farms change the direction of the wind?\u201d</p> \n<p>But council officials are enthusiastic about the process and adamant they will act on its recommendations in a new environmental plan to be drawn up for 2020.</p> \n<p>Georgia Gould, the council leader, said she hoped the outcome would be \u201csome concrete action that we can take forward as a council. That\u2019s the idea of it being an open process \u2013 you are letting go of that control. There has been a complete breakdown in trust in our political system, we need to create new democratic mechanisms to break through that and this is it.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What is to be done?</h2> \n<p>After an initial fact-finding phase, the 56 panellists get into the nitty-gritty. What is to be done? What works?</p> \n<p>A pair of local trailblazers talk through their own personal carbon \u201chygiene\u201d measures: an electric car for their horticultural business; rail travel for holidays; meat as a treat, not a staple; double glazing, solar panels, and \u2013 perhaps less convincingly \u2013 \u201cwarm\u201d wallpaper.</p> \n<p>They even approach idling cars on the street and tell drivers to switch off their engines. \u201cMost people respond politely,\u201d Stephen Evans tells the audience.</p> \n<p>Campaigners and experts lay out the pros and cons of certain measures. Refitting all Camden\u2019s buildings with greener heating such as air source heat pumps and insulation would cost at least \u00a31.3bn. Is that a bargain or a burden? Who would pay?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8fa1e840d1a48cbaf0cae75178ec01384c511f78\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa1e840d1a48cbaf0cae75178ec01384c511f78/187_481_1345_807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Dunham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Dunham: \u2018In the age of austerity it\u2019s a real challenge for councils.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanessa Berberian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What about pedestrianising streets, a zero-emissions motoring zone, greening driveways, <a href=\"https://www.grasscrete.com/\">grasscrete</a> \u2013 would that make enough of a difference? And is there any space to plant more trees? (Answer: not really.)</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very interesting but I\u2019ve been wondering quite a bit about where it\u2019s going to lead,\u201d said Chris Dunham, the director of Carbon Descent, an eco-consultancy, who spoke as an expert at the sessions. \u201cMy concerns are that in the age of austerity it\u2019s a real challenge for councils which don\u2019t have the money or power to do the things that are needed to complete the piece.\u201d </p> \n<h2>Panel action</h2> \n<p>Citizens\u2019 assemblies have been rising to prominence since an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/how-99-strangers-in-a-dublin-hotel-broke-irelands-abortion-deadlock\">Irish experiment in 2016</a> to convene randomly selected laypeople to thrash out the abortion issue broke the deadlock and paved the way for a national referendum in 2018.</p> \n<p>Camden has debated social care and its 2025 borough plan. Its climate assembly will be followed by similar exercises in Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Lambeth, Devon and Hertfordshire this autumn, and a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-energy-industrial-strategy/news-parliament-2017/climate-change-and-net-zero-chairs-comments-17-19/\">national climate assembly</a> is also scheduled to take place. Scotland will <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/citizens-assembly-of-scotland/\">debate its future</a> in a citizens assembly.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the last six months the interest in the idea has risen exponentially,\u201d said Tim Hughes, who helped to facilitate the Camden exercise. As the director of Involve, a public participation charity, Hughes has worked on a range of assemblies. What makes them work well?</p> \n<p>\u201cYou want a good range of expertise, time and space for assembly members to reflect and reach recommendations,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not looking for complete consensus because that could be false consensus. You also want a good sense of where people disagree.\u201d</p> \n<p>Debate at the six tables in the library rotunda produces plenty of disagreement but participants say it is good-natured. Rupert Cruise, who is originally from Johannesburg and has lived in Camden since 2001, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic. The only surprise we\u2019ve had is that there are no climate change deniers. There are differing views on where we should focus but it\u2019s done in a respectful tone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some have suggested participation in such assemblies could be made mandatory in the same way that jury service is. Simon Burall, an expert in public participation who also helped to facilitate the Camden assembly, said that may be some way off.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is significant distrust in government already, and if you force people to be here and don\u2019t listen to them you will alienate them even further,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you tell them they have to come to learn how to be better citizens, they\u2019ll feel patronised.\u201d</p> \n<p>Still, the scope for more citizens assemblies on divisive issues seems broad enough. Indeed, a rigorously instituted panel to discuss the pros and cons of leaving the EU might have been useful in the run-up to the 2016 referendum.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it might still be useful as a tool to elevate debate, restore the primacy of indisputable fact and return civility and respect to political dialogue.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor the past few years we have had two or more groups of people talking past each other, whether on Brexit or climate change,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cI\u2019m supportive of the idea.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

The jurors have been assembled to listen to briefings, pose questions, assess facts, debate and discuss, and then ultimately recommend action to Camden council. The big question before them is what action the district can take to limit global heating and its impact. The hope is that the series of deliberations this summer will have a bearing not just on the climate crisis but on the crisis in democracy too. A national climate assembly is planned for Westminster this autumn and Camden is being closely watched for the dos and don\u2019ts of this relatively new form of public engagement. \u201cI am interested in the idea of citizens assemblies and not just for climate change,\u201d said the local MP Keir Starmer, a Labour frontbencher. \u201cI think they might turn out to be a way to have a different kind of political dialogue to avoid the shouty tribalism of the last few years.\u201d Things take a while to get going. The opening session, something of a factfinding exercise, is held on a muggy summer night in the semi-basement rotunda of Swiss Cottage public library. The room swelters, as if to make a point. A woman wafts a fan. Facilitators urge brevity, inquiry, civility. One helpful juror draws a smiley face on a paper cup to keep a restless child amused. Climate experts such as Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London, set out the indisputable science of the climate emergency. Participants have yellow and red cards to slow him down or stop him if they get lost. (\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been red-carded during a presentation,\u201d he says later.) Not everyone finds it easy. One young woman is on the verge of walking out because progress is slow. For others it\u2019s all a bit fast. And one juror, Neil Chappell, who works in construction, wonders who chose the experts and how they chose the facts. \u201cThe people they had talking were good at getting their agenda over but didn\u2019t give us enough information to make informed decisions,\u201d he said. A gulf in knowledge between jurors is exposed when they are invited to pose questions. One wondered: \u201cHow many people in Camden die from air pollution each year?\u201d. Another asked: \u201cCan wind farms change the direction of the wind?\u201d But council officials are enthusiastic about the process and adamant they will act on its recommendations in a new environmental plan to be drawn up for 2020. Georgia Gould, the council leader, said she hoped the outcome would be \u201csome concrete action that we can take forward as a council. That\u2019s the idea of it being an open process \u2013 you are letting go of that control. There has been a complete breakdown in trust in our political system, we need to create new democratic mechanisms to break through that and this is it.\u201d What is to be done? After an initial fact-finding phase, the 56 panellists get into the nitty-gritty. What is to be done? What works? A pair of local trailblazers talk through their own personal carbon \u201chygiene\u201d measures: an electric car for their horticultural business; rail travel for holidays; meat as a treat, not a staple; double glazing, solar panels, and \u2013 perhaps less convincingly \u2013 \u201cwarm\u201d wallpaper. They even approach idling cars on the street and tell drivers to switch off their engines. \u201cMost people respond politely,\u201d Stephen Evans tells the audience. Campaigners and experts lay out the pros and cons of certain measures. Refitting all Camden\u2019s buildings with greener heating such as air source heat pumps and insulation would cost at least \u00a31.3bn. Is that a bargain or a burden? Who would pay? What about pedestrianising streets, a zero-emissions motoring zone, greening driveways, grasscrete \u2013 would that make enough of a difference? And is there any space to plant more trees? (Answer: not really.) \u201cI think it\u2019s very interesting but I\u2019ve been wondering quite a bit about where it\u2019s going to lead,\u201d said Chris Dunham, the director of Carbon Descent, an eco-consultancy, who spoke as an expert at the sessions. \u201cMy concerns are that in the age of austerity it\u2019s a real challenge for councils which don\u2019t have the money or power to do the things that are needed to complete the piece.\u201d Panel action Citizens\u2019 assemblies have been rising to prominence since an Irish experiment in 2016 to convene randomly selected laypeople to thrash out the abortion issue broke the deadlock and paved the way for a national referendum in 2018. Camden has debated social care and its 2025 borough plan. Its climate assembly will be followed by similar exercises in Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Lambeth, Devon and Hertfordshire this autumn, and a national climate assembly is also scheduled to take place. Scotland will debate its future in a citizens assembly. \u201cIn the last six months the interest in the idea has risen exponentially,\u201d said Tim Hughes, who helped to facilitate the Camden exercise. As the director of Involve, a public participation charity, Hughes has worked on a range of assemblies. What makes them work well? \u201cYou want a good range of expertise, time and space for assembly members to reflect and reach recommendations,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not looking for complete consensus because that could be false consensus. You also want a good sense of where people disagree.\u201d Debate at the six tables in the library rotunda produces plenty of disagreement but participants say it is good-natured. Rupert Cruise, who is originally from Johannesburg and has lived in Camden since 2001, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic. The only surprise we\u2019ve had is that there are no climate change deniers. There are differing views on where we should focus but it\u2019s done in a respectful tone.\u201d Some have suggested participation in such assemblies could be made mandatory in the same way that jury service is. Simon Burall, an expert in public participation who also helped to facilitate the Camden assembly, said that may be some way off. \u201cThere is significant distrust in government already, and if you force people to be here and don\u2019t listen to them you will alienate them even further,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you tell them they have to come to learn how to be better citizens, they\u2019ll feel patronised.\u201d Still, the scope for more citizens assemblies on divisive issues seems broad enough. Indeed, a rigorously instituted panel to discuss the pros and cons of leaving the EU might have been useful in the run-up to the 2016 referendum. Perhaps it might still be useful as a tool to elevate debate, restore the primacy of indisputable fact and return civility and respect to political dialogue. \u201cFor the past few years we have had two or more groups of people talking past each other, whether on Brexit or climate change,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cI\u2019m supportive of the idea.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

      "body": "<p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>One more thing to tick off my bucket list. England\u2019s men have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">won a cricket World Cup final</a> at the fourth time of asking. I can die just a little less unhappy. But God it was stressful. We were staying with friends in Somerset and I watched the first six hours planted in front of the TV. Then, at about five in the afternoon, with England struggling on about 100-4 and the overs ticking by, my wife said it was time for us to leave to go back to London. And I didn\u2019t put up a fight. In fact I was grateful. I couldn\u2019t take it any more, as I was convinced that all the next few hours had in store was an inexorable slide to a narrow defeat and that I would have contributed to the loss by having stayed to watch it. I couldn\u2019t even listen to the game on the radio on the journey home as I was too tense. So as my wife dozed I half-heartedly listened to Radio 4, making sure to switch off for every news bulletin, and just willed the clock to tick past to a time when the match would definitely be over. Then I could switch on, get the result and deal with the disappointment. It didn\u2019t quite work out that way. I held out until about 7.30pm and then I noticed I had a text from a friend saying \u2018Incredible match\u2019. Assuming this must mean it was over and that England had won, I turned on the radio to find that New Zealand required two runs from the final ball of the super over. The best laid plans ... Somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/jul/14/england-beat-new-zealand-in-lords-epic-to-win-their-first-cricket-world-cup-video-report\">England and I got over the line</a>. After a few tears of joy, my main feeling was relief. The good stuff is always so fleeting with me. If we\u2019d lost, I\u2019d still be depressed.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>You can tell quite a lot about the state of any leadership campaign from who turns up to the spin room. For the final Sun-TalkRadio head-to-head <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/hunt-and-johnson-the-backstop-is-dead-and-cant-be-in-any-eu-deal\">debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt</a>, Dominic Raab from Team Boris had arrived long before the start and could not have been more charming. When he was both Brexit secretary and challenging for the leadership himself, Raab was a knot of barely repressed anger and looked like a man hoping no one would find out about his eight road rage convictions. Now he was Mr Smiley, happy to take the piss out of himself and looking every bit the man who wasn\u2019t expecting to be taking public transport for much longer. This time next week he will be back in the cabinet. Twenty minutes before the debate began I asked if he could save us both a bit of time and tell me now why Boris had easily won the debate. For a moment, he even looked tempted. Tellingly, only one MP, Steve Brine, from Team Hunt made an appearance, and he only made it to the spin room about halfway through. Probably just as well, as Hunt already appeared to have conceded he\u2019d lost and was more interested in not pissing Johnson off and was pitching for a job in his cabinet. Moments before the debate ended, Iain Duncan Smith and Priti Patel from Team Boris swanned into the room to authoritatively declare their man to have delivered all the killer lines, despite not having heard any of them. There\u2019s going to be a lot of disappointed faces when the jobs are divvied up next week.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>The election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/who-is-ursula-von-der-leyen-the-new-eu-commission-president\">Ursula von der Leyen</a> as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/ursula-von-der-leyen-elected-first-female-european-commission-president\">new president of the European Commission</a> drew a predictably snarky response from the Brexit party. Nigel Farage tweeted: \u201cUrsula von der Leyen has scraped in by nine votes. Power but no legitimacy,\u201d while MEP Claire Fox was similarly appalled. \u201cJeez \u2013 standing ovation for #UrsulaVonDerLeyen who won in an election against herself by \u2013 wait for it \u2013 9 votes. Craven,\u201d she tweeted. As it happened, Von der Leyen won almost exactly 52% of the vote, a result that the Brexit party normally describe as an overwhelming majority but which on this occasion was treated as the narrowest of narrow victories. The Brexiters\u2019 other objection \u2013 that there was no one standing against Von der Leyen \u2013 seemed almost as wilfully dim. The vote was actually a ratification of a decision previously taken by the 28 EU leaders and if Von der Leyen had not achieved the necessary votes then she would not have got the job and the EU would have had to begin the process of choosing a new president all over again. So although there was no other candidate on the ballot, every vote still counted. All of which was rather more democratic than the Brexit party\u2019s election of its own leader which basically consisted of Farage declaring himself as leader after his predecessor disqualified herself by being outed as a racist. No one in the Brexit party even got to ratify Farage\u2019s appointment. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fb950550b8b476c01d4f19a2f3c0ea822cf14ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fb950550b8b476c01d4f19a2f3c0ea822cf14ec/0_743_11013_6608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel Beckett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samuel Beckett: if only he had moisturised.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>A mental health warning.

She also made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/17/theresa-may-hits-out-at-populists-in-farewell-speech\">one of the most bizarre farewell speeches </a>at Chatham House, in which she lamented the lack of compromise and teamwork in modern politics. It rather sounded as if she was talking to herself. Chris Grayling, who has redefined the meaning of uselessness during his years in cabinet, chose to mark his last outing on the government front benches at transport questions by remaining almost entirely silent, letting junior ministers do almost all the talking instead. A tactic he should probably have employed earlier in his career. Philip Hammond, meanwhile, has been treating Twitter as his personal liveblog as he rubbishes every claim Johnson makes about a no-deal Brexit having no economic consequences. I\u2019m fairly certain that May, Grayling and Hammond won\u2019t miss me, but I will miss them. Three years ago, I had no idea they would provide such great material for me.

Asked whether he would rule out voting in favour of a no-confidence motion against Johnson, Hammond told Le Monde and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung: \u201cI will take steps to avoid an exit without agreement apart from an explicit parliamentary approval. \u201cThere should be a new and sincere attempt to reach a consensus.

He also reportedly encouraged others to vote to ensure that parliament continues to sit through September and October.
