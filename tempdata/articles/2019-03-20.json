The Labour leader had been due to meet May to discuss the Brexit crisis alongside the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems\u2019 Vince Cable, and the parliamentary leaders of Plaid Cymru and the Greens. But those present said he quit the meeting once he realised that former Labour MP Umunna, who is not a party leader but the spokesman for the newly formed group of MPs made up of Tory and Labour defectors, had also been invited. A Labour spokesperson said afterwards: \u201cIt was not the meeting that had been agreed \u2026 the terms were broken\u201d and that the party was talking to No 10 about holding a face-to-face meeting that Corbyn had earlier proposed at prime minister\u2019s questions. Umunna, however, claimed it was \u201cextraordinary behaviour\u201d and added: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is what people expect from a leader of the opposition at a time of crisis when the people that elect us to come together and see if there is a way forward.\u201d Cable said: \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s kinder, gentler politics was found wanting as he stomped out of the meeting before it began rather than breathe the same air as Chuka Umunna.\u201d Corbyn subsequently spoke to May on the telephone, and complained that she had offered nothing new beyond a choice between her deal and no deal next week. The Labour leader said the prime minister was \u201cin complete denial about the scale of the crisis we are facing and unable to offer the leadership the country needs\u201d. During the day, there were also signs that a small number of Labour MPs were now prepared to switch sides and back May\u2019s Brexit deal after the EU said it had to pass the Commons next week. Lisa Nandy, the Labour MP for Wigan, said she would be \u201cminded to vote\u201d for May\u2019s Brexit deal if the prime minister accepted an amendment submitted in her name and that of party colleague Gareth Snell on Wednesday evening. Earlier in the day, Snell said he too was considering a switch to backing May. \u201cI\u2019m increasingly coming to the conclusion that the only way to stop no deal may be to vote for her deal.

Other Labour MPs reacted with a mixture of anger and scepticism to Nandy and Snell\u2019s intervention. One said that he and party colleagues were very unhappy with the idea that the pair were willing to engage in discussions with the Tories. The amendment, if accepted, would require May \u2013 or whoever is the prime minister \u2013 to accept three conditions to the next phase of Brexit negotiations on a future trade deal that would begin if the withdrawal agreement is passed by the Commons.

Nandy said she had discussed the idea with May \u201cthree or four times\u201d and said that she would link the amendment to a third meaningful vote next week. Otherwise it would be put forward on Monday, when MPs are due to discuss the next Brexit steps. Earlier in the day, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, secured an emergency Commons debate to discuss the crisis by invoking a procedure that required the support of at least 40 MPs. But a cross-party attempt to submit an amendment to that debate, calling for a long delay to Brexit, collapsed after it emerged that Labour\u2019s leadership was not prepared to support a lengthy extension, sources said.",

Pro-Brexit cabinet ministers including Andrea Leadsom, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling told May a long extension would not be acceptable to them, while anger among other MPs was also growing. Tory MPs were expected to demand the prime minister appear before the 1922 Committee of backbenchers on Wednesday evening.

However, it appears likely that Brussels does expect the government to request a lengthy extension if the deal fails again, to allow time for cross-party talks on a soft Brexit or a general election or second referendum. What can MPs do now? The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, called an emergency debate on the status of the extension in the Commons on Wednesday, but Labour is torn over whether to attempt to force the prime minister to bid for a longer extension. Instead, fresh efforts are likely to be made for parliament to seize control of the process on Monday \u2013 when MPs will get to vote on an amendable motion that the government must table in order to update the house on the state of the negotiations.

      "body": "<p>John Harris suggests that obliging elite universities to admit no more than 7% of their students from private schools would obviate the need to abolish these socially and culturally damaging institutions (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/bitain-brexit-crisis-public-schools\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s crisis is rooted in the power of our public schools</a>, 18 March). This argument assumes that the ability of the most prestigious of these schools to promote their pupils into elite positions in society is based upon the quality of the education they offer when, in fact, their power is essentially social and derives from the kind of pupils who go there in the first place. A landmark research project, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-dogged-persistence-of-the-old-boy/\" title=\"\">carried out by Reeves and Friedman at the LSE in 2017</a>, showed quite conclusively that pupils attending one of the nine original \u201cpublic\u201d schools handed over to the rich by the Clarendon Commission of 1861 are overwhelmingly more likely to join the ruling elite than pupils of other schools, whether private or state, quite regardless of their academic achievements. The quality of education offered by these schools is beside the point.</p> <p>Also, the 7% who attend private schools account for around 30% of A-level grades, chiefly because most private schools are academically selective, so any ceiling set upon the numbers admitted to elite universities from private schools should be set at 30% rather than 7%. Many Oxbridge colleges already admit 70% or more of their students from state schools and it is high time that all of them were required to do so, but Harris is naive if he thinks that this would seriously challenge the power of our ruling elite. The most effective means to tackle the problem is to follow the example of the Finns and make it illegal for any school to charge fees.

However, the negative influence spreads far wider.</p> <p>I spent almost 40 years at a fairly senior level in the civil service and witnessed firsthand this British phenomenon. People so lacking in self-awareness that they were unable to admit failings yet were promoted way beyond their ability. Catastrophic mistakes and errors rewarded with further promotion and bonuses and an inability to understand the needs of the public they served. All of this exhibited by the private-school-educated, who seemed to live a charmed life untroubled by the realities of life affecting the rest of us.

I do not think that that would be the right outcome, but the house needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions that it has taken.\u201d</p> <p>MPs then voted in favour of a government motion saying May would ask for a short extension if her deal passed and acknowledging the EU would want a long delay if it did not.</p> <p>May will now write to Donald Tusk, the European council president setting out her request, but the UK will need the approval of all 27 member states for an extension to be granted. The EU has said the UK needs to set out reasons for the extension.</p> <p>The prime minister will likely make another attempt to get her Brexit deal through parliament next week, if she can find a way of getting round <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/18/brexit-john-bercow-rules-out-third-meaningful-vote-on-same-deal\">a ruling by the Speaker, John Bercow</a>, that she cannot submit substantially the same motion twice.</p> <p>However, MPs will make a fresh attempt to seize control of the process first: the Wirral South MP, Alison McGovern, has tabled a motion under standing order 24, a parliamentary device that would allow a three-hour emergency debate.</p> <p>These are usually on neutral motions, simply saying parliament has debated an issue \u2013 but the Speaker hinted on Monday that more use could be made of them to force the government\u2019s hand.</p> <p>He told the Labour MP Helen Goodman: \u201cI think that she should reflect upon the opportunities that the standing order 24 procedure presents, because the opportunities are fuller than has traditionally been acknowledged or taken advantage of by members of the House of Commons.\u201d</p> <p>McGovern, who has campaigned for Labour to support single market membership, said her aim was to \u201chold the government to account\u201d.</p> <p>Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, said it was important for the UK to seek only a short extension to honour the referendum result. She told LBC Radio: \u201cIt is absolutely essential we are out of the EU before the European elections.\u201d</p> <p>Leadsom did not deny reports that she told colleagues they used to be the cabinet to deliver Brexit but now she was not sure.</p> <p>\u201cI feel the PM\u2019s entire cabinet needs to remain focused on getting us out of the EU,\u201d she said, insisting that the main plan was to get May\u2019s deal through, but she acknowledged different views on what happens if that fails.</p> <p>However, another cabinet source told the Guardian May\u2019s decision to go for a short extension was a strategic misstep and would not help Eurosceptics vote for her deal.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the move that ensures she stays in No 10, avoiding decision. It will not work as a strategy for getting the deal through,\u201d the cabinet source said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not what parliament voted for last week. So many of the rebel holdouts are now holding out because they want no deal, but it\u2019s not available. It never really has been. Time we were honest.\u201d</p> <p>Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and one of the 76 Eurosceptics holding out against a deal, said there was an opportunity for May to get further concessions from the EU this week in order to persuade more MPs to back her withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>He told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme there would be \u201crepercussions from the public\u201d if there was any more delay to Brexit.</p>",

Juncker told Germany\u2019s Deutschlandfunk radio: \u201cMy impression is \u2026 that this week at the European council there will be no decision, but that we will probably have to meet again next week.\u201d He added: \u201cMrs May doesn\u2019t have agreement to anything, either in her cabinet or in parliament.\u201d The text of the letter has not yet been published, so it is still possible the UK could leave open the option of a longer delay if May\u2019s deal does not pass through parliament by 11 April - the point at which Britain would have to prepare to participate in European parliamentary elections. Only last week, the prime minister had threatened a longer extension to article 50 if MPs did not vote for her Brexit deal, which they rejected by a large margin. \u201cThe house must understand and accept that if it is not willing to support a deal in the coming days and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March, it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension to article 50,\u201d she said. \u201cSuch an extension would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Union elections in May 2019. I do not think that that would be the right outcome, but the house needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions that it has taken.\u201d MPs then voted in favour of a government motion saying May would ask for a short extension if her deal passed and acknowledging the EU would want a long delay if it did not. May will now write to Donald Tusk, the European council president setting out her request, but the UK will need the approval of all 27 member states for an extension to be granted. The EU has said the UK needs to set out reasons for the extension. The prime minister will likely make another attempt to get her Brexit deal through parliament next week, if she can find a way of getting round a ruling by the Speaker, John Bercow, that she cannot submit substantially the same motion twice. However, MPs will make a fresh attempt to seize control of the process first: the Wirral South MP, Alison McGovern, has tabled a motion under standing order 24, a parliamentary device that would allow a three-hour emergency debate. These are usually on neutral motions, simply saying parliament has debated an issue \u2013 but the Speaker hinted on Monday that more use could be made of them to force the government\u2019s hand. He told the Labour MP Helen Goodman: \u201cI think that she should reflect upon the opportunities that the standing order 24 procedure presents, because the opportunities are fuller than has traditionally been acknowledged or taken advantage of by members of the House of Commons.\u201d McGovern, who has campaigned for Labour to support single market membership, said her aim was to \u201chold the government to account\u201d. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, said it was important for the UK to seek only a short extension to honour the referendum result. She told LBC Radio: \u201cIt is absolutely essential we are out of the EU before the European elections.\u201d Leadsom did not deny reports that she told colleagues they used to be the cabinet to deliver Brexit but now she was not sure. \u201cI feel the PM\u2019s entire cabinet needs to remain focused on getting us out of the EU,\u201d she said, insisting that the main plan was to get May\u2019s deal through, but she acknowledged different views on what happens if that fails. However, another cabinet source told the Guardian May\u2019s decision to go for a short extension was a strategic misstep and would not help Eurosceptics vote for her deal. \u201cThis is the move that ensures she stays in No 10, avoiding decision. It will not work as a strategy for getting the deal through,\u201d the cabinet source said. \u201cThis is not what parliament voted for last week. So many of the rebel holdouts are now holding out because they want no deal, but it\u2019s not available. It never really has been. Time we were honest.\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and one of the 76 Eurosceptics holding out against a deal, said there was an opportunity for May to get further concessions from the EU this week in order to persuade more MPs to back her withdrawal agreement. He told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme there would be \u201crepercussions from the public\u201d if there was any more delay to Brexit.",

Now he is going to waste even more of the NHS\u2019s scarce resources by booking a completely unnecessary appointment with his GP to discuss a course of action to address a problem which essentially does not exist,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a health secretary, he displays a quite astonishing level of ignorance about the NHS.\u201d </p> <p>Curtis said the value of genetic testing for common diseases had been overstated, since only people at the extremes of the distribution would have significantly higher or lower risk than average.</p> <p>The company that carried out Hancock\u2019s test, Genomics Plc, has developed similar genetic risk tests for a range of other common conditions including coronary heart disease, breast cancer, asthma and diabetes.</p> <p>Prof Peter Donnelly, the company\u2019s founder and CEO, said: \u201cI think this is the area where genetics will have its biggest impact on healthcare because it\u2019s all of the common diseases.\u201d</p> <p>He said that screening programmes for diseases such as breast cancer could be guided by genetic risk, meaning that those at greatest risk would enter screening at a younger age. \u201cA [high risk] women in her early 40s has the same risk as a typical woman in her 60s or a [low risk] woman well into her 70s,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world we\u2019re in where we screen women just based on age and offer mammography at 50 just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d </p> <p>He said there remained critical questions about the extent to which people from minority ethnic backgrounds were disadvantaged when it came to test results. Early tests suggested the company\u2019s tests provided information about risk for ethnic minorities, but with less precision.</p> <p>Donnelly said: \u201cOne has to even think really hard about whether it should be rolled out now when it\u2019s more useful for some individuals than others, or if we should wait until we\u2019ve got better data and better methods that help people from different ancestries.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock has also urged researchers to share more genetic information, saying: \u201cData, funded by the British taxpayer, donated by the public, can\u2019t be used for predictive testing because of bureaucratic blocking or a scientist wanting to have a monopoly: that\u2019s an outrage. We will unlock that data because we must save lives.\u201d</p>",

However, Curtis said the health secretary had \u201cmassively misinterpreted\u201d his score, which he said revealed he had a fairly average risk of prostate cancer. \u201cAs a result of his misunderstanding, he first suffered unnecessary anxiety and then took up valuable medical time having to be counselled about the reality of the situation. Now he is going to waste even more of the NHS\u2019s scarce resources by booking a completely unnecessary appointment with his GP to discuss a course of action to address a problem which essentially does not exist,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a health secretary, he displays a quite astonishing level of ignorance about the NHS.\u201d Curtis said the value of genetic testing for common diseases had been overstated, since only people at the extremes of the distribution would have significantly higher or lower risk than average. The company that carried out Hancock\u2019s test, Genomics Plc, has developed similar genetic risk tests for a range of other common conditions including coronary heart disease, breast cancer, asthma and diabetes. Prof Peter Donnelly, the company\u2019s founder and CEO, said: \u201cI think this is the area where genetics will have its biggest impact on healthcare because it\u2019s all of the common diseases.\u201d He said that screening programmes for diseases such as breast cancer could be guided by genetic risk, meaning that those at greatest risk would enter screening at a younger age. \u201cA [high risk] women in her early 40s has the same risk as a typical woman in her 60s or a [low risk] woman well into her 70s,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world we\u2019re in where we screen women just based on age and offer mammography at 50 just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He said there remained critical questions about the extent to which people from minority ethnic backgrounds were disadvantaged when it came to test results. Early tests suggested the company\u2019s tests provided information about risk for ethnic minorities, but with less precision. Donnelly said: \u201cOne has to even think really hard about whether it should be rolled out now when it\u2019s more useful for some individuals than others, or if we should wait until we\u2019ve got better data and better methods that help people from different ancestries.\u201d Hancock has also urged researchers to share more genetic information, saying: \u201cData, funded by the British taxpayer, donated by the public, can\u2019t be used for predictive testing because of bureaucratic blocking or a scientist wanting to have a monopoly: that\u2019s an outrage. We will unlock that data because we must save lives.\u201d",

Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, will not have the final say over whether the EU grants the UK an article 50 extension, because the decision will be taken by the 27 heads of government on the European council, who are well above Barnier in terms of seniority. But the EU has been very disciplined at maintaining a common line throughout this process (eg, see how what Paris is saying, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/19/brexit-latest-news-bercow-speaker-theresa-may-to-chair-cabinet-as-government-responds-to-bercow-ruling-against-repeat-vote-on-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5c91199ee4b0e8eadf780670#block-5c91199ee4b0e8eadf780670\">4.36pm</a>, echoes Barnier\u2019s language) and Downing Street will be mulling over his words very carefully.</p> \n  <p>Barnier did not seem to be laying down any impossible red lines for Theresa May. But he was more negative about the case for an article 50 extension than Number 10 might have expected, and his comments should quash Brexiter claims from people like David Davis (eg, <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1080062/Brexit-news-update-latest-david-davis-lbc-vote-pmqs\">here</a>)<a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1080062/Brexit-news-update-latest-david-davis-lbc-vote-pmqs\"> </a>and Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/18/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-vote-deal-boris-johnson-tells-may-to-try-again-to-get-eu-to-change-backstop-politics-live?page=with:block-5c8f5566e4b0cf92e5a593f6#block-5c8f5566e4b0cf92e5a593f6\">(</a>eg,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/18/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-vote-deal-boris-johnson-tells-may-to-try-again-to-get-eu-to-change-backstop-politics-live?page=with:block-5c8f5566e4b0cf92e5a593f6#block-5c8f5566e4b0cf92e5a593f6\"> here</a>) that Brussels will blink at the last minute.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Barnier warned Theresa May that she could not take it for granted that the EU will agree to an article 50 extension.</strong> Rather than treat it as a given, Barnier insisted that it would come with disadvantages, and that the EU might seek to attach conditions.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said extending article 50 could bring economic and political costs for the EU.</strong><a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-19-1758_en.htm\"> In his opening statement </a>he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In any case, the European council will need to assess what is in the best interest of the EU.</p> \n   <p>Extending the uncertainty without a clear plan would add to the economic cost for our businesses but could also incur a political cost for the EU.</p> \n   <p>It is for the British government and parliament to decide very quickly what the UK wants to do next.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said, if May asks for an extension, EU leaders will want to know why they should grant one. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>EU leaders will need a concrete plan from the UK in order to be able to make an informed decision.</p> \n   <p>And key questions will be:</p> \n   <p>Does an extension increase the chances for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement?</p> \n   <p>Will the UK request an extension because it wants a bit more time to rework the political declaration?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And then during the Q&amp;A Barnier said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The EU authorities want to know what the underlying political process, which would be the grounds for that extension, would be. Political process within the House of Commons, or within the general political debate within the UK ...</p> \n   <p>All I would say is that is it is our duty to ask whether this extension would be useful. Because an extension will be something that will extend uncertainty, and uncertainty costs. It has a cost for everybody. And we can\u2019t prolong uncertainty without having a good reason for it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He confirmed that the EU would be willing to change the political declaration on the future relationship. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I recall that this political declaration, which sets out the framework for our future relation, could be made more ambitious in the coming days if a majority in the House of Commons so wishes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>By \u201cmore ambitious\u201d, he meant more attuned to a soft Brexit outcome, or more Norwegian.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he thought May would have to offer \u201csomething new\u201d to justify getting a long article 50 extension.</strong> During the Q&amp;A he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My feeling is ... a longer extension needs to be linked to something new. There needs to be a new event.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This has been interpreted as a reference to holding a general election, or a referendum, although May has already said that, if MPs do not pass a Brexit deal this week, next week she will begin a process in the Commons intended to see what Brexit solution they can unite behind. (May made that commitment when she was planning a meaningful vote this week. John Bercow\u2019s ruling yesterday has complicated things, although at lobby this morning the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the commitments given at the despatch box by the PM still stood.)</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Barnier mocked the idea that May could ask for a long extension and a short one too.</strong> When this was put to him, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You said both short and long, well, it\u2019s either one or the other, isn\u2019t it? </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The idea that May could ask for a long extension and a short one refers to the possibility that she could ask for a long extension, with the possibility of shortening it if MPs back her deal next week.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said everyone should \u201cfinalise all preparations for a no-deal scenario.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1108039714387329025\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Michel Barnier: \"Everyone should now finalise all preparations for a no-deal scenario\"<br><br>EU's chief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> negotiator says leaders are ready to consider a delay to Brexit, but MPs \"voting against no-deal does not prevent it happening\"<a href=\"https://t.co/0AC7mqcItP\">https://t.co/0AC7mqcItP</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/EEaYcO1XPR\">pic.twitter.com/EEaYcO1XPR</a></p>\u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1108039714387329025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"478dfa06ed762c68120cdb0e04b6682686d5f043\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/478dfa06ed762c68120cdb0e04b6682686d5f043/0_28_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Barnier holding a news conference after an EU general affairs council in Brussels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Barnier holding a news conference after an EU general affairs council in Brussels.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-20T09:50:15.818Z\">at 9.50am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c911ddee4b0480f6c02209b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-19T16:51:15.315Z\">4.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-19-1758_en.htm\">the full text of <strong>Michel Barnier</strong>\u2019s opening statement</a> at the press conference.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c91199ee4b0e8eadf780670\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/angeliquechrisafis\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-19T16:36:47.375Z\">4.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Paris says UK should not get article 50 extension unless it presents new strategy</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Paris reiterated its tough line on Tuesday afternoon, insisting no extension could be granted to the UK without the government presenting a credible \u201cnew strategy or plan\u201d which would need to have parliament\u2019s backing.

Under the Fixed-terms Parliament Act, the Commons would have 14 days to see if someone else could form a government. (The procedure is not 100% clear, but presumably the Queen would only appoint someone else if she were confident that PM could win a vote of confidence.) If no alternative PM could command a majority, there would be an election - which would mean May staying on for another month or so.</p> \n  <p>2) Unless the Commons suddenly decides to vote for Vince Cable to become PM as head of a cross-party coalition, it is very hard to imagine any likely May replacement revoking article 50. (Corbyn has repeatedly said the result of the referendum must be honoured.)</p> \n  <p>3) Some lawyers argue that, if the PM were to revoke article 50, s/he would need parliamentary approval, which does not seem likely to be forthcoming.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c90fef3e4b0e8eadf780527\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-19T14:39:09.599Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More from cabinet.

Here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that Theresa May will write to Donald Tusk, president of the European council, requesting an article 50 extension.</strong> But the spokesman would not say whether this would happen today or tomorrow, and he refused to comment on what the letter will say. Last week May said that she would request a short extension if MPs had passed her deal before the summit, which starts on Thursday, or a long extension if they had not. But the speaker\u2019s ruling yesterday, which made holding another meaningful vote this week much harder, may have kiboshed that plan, and the spokesman refused to confirm that May would remain bound by this strategy. (One option might be for the PM, instead of just asking for a long extension, to ask for a long extension, with the option of a shorter one if MPs pass her deal next week, but that is speculation - and not something the spokesman confirmed.) Ministers spent 90 minutes discussing all this at cabinet today, the spokesman said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman came close to confirming that there will be no meaningful vote on the Brexit deal this week.</strong> He said that a vote would have to take place tomorrow, that in that case the motion would have to go down today, and that that was \u201cnot something that has happened as of yet\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sajid Javid, the home secretary, that <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2019-03-19/HLWS1395/\">he is announcing more money today for security around mosques and other places of worship</a> in the light of the New Zealand terrorist attack.</strong> There was a substantial discussion of the threat posed by far-right terrorism at cabinet, with ministers also saying social media companies needed to do more to remove videos like the one filmed by attacked in Christchurch last week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21cc8f6abc317f48ec3e958446f6177bb001c422\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21cc8f6abc317f48ec3e958446f6177bb001c422/763_340_1968_1181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c90d95de4b0e8eadf7803b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-19T11:59:27.930Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, <strong>Katya Adler</strong>, has a good Twitter thread on what EU countries think about an article 50 extension.

Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of those familiar with DUP thinking tells me that one concern they have is over the attitude of Theresa May\u2019s successor to the provision that they are negotiating which would see the rest of the UK follow any regulations that Northern Ireland adopted in the backstop.</p> \n   <p>The government is offering to put this measure into the withdrawal agreement bill. This would give it force, particularly given that the WAB will be superior legislation. However, the eventual UK / EU trade deal could end up overriding this lock.

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has warned Theresa May that she should not take it for granted that the EU will agree to an article 50 extension. At a press conference in Brussels, he said that delaying Brexit could bring economic and political costs, that the EU would want reasons for an extension, and that he would only favour agreeing a long extension in return for the UK offering \u201csomething new\u201d. See 5.28pm. May believes the UK has slid into political crisis, her spokesman said, as he confirmed she would be writing to EU leaders to request a delay to Brexit. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said she will fight until the \u201cfinal hour\u201d of 29 March to avoid a no-deal Brexit, but admitted she cannot second-guess the outcome of an EU summit this week due to the chaos in Westminster. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has insisted the prime minister may be able to hold another vote on her Brexit deal if she agrees the terms of an article 50 extension with the EU, believing that would satisfy the objections of the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow. The government has thrown a potential \u00a3500m Brexit lifeline to 180,000 British pensioners in EU countries outside the UK who rely on the NHS to pay for their healthcare. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has announced that he is doubling the money available for the places of worship protective security fund in the light of last week\u2019s terror attacks at two mosques in New Zealand. MPs have voted by 199 to 134, a majority of 65, to remove Ian Austin and Mike Gapes from the foreign affairs committee, following their decision to quit Labour. They were originally elected to the committee to take seats set aside for Labour MPs. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here are the main points from Michel Barnier\u2019s press conference. Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, will not have the final say over whether the EU grants the UK an article 50 extension, because the decision will be taken by the 27 heads of government on the European council, who are well above Barnier in terms of seniority. But the EU has been very disciplined at maintaining a common line throughout this process (eg, see how what Paris is saying, at 4.36pm, echoes Barnier\u2019s language) and Downing Street will be mulling over his words very carefully. Barnier did not seem to be laying down any impossible red lines for Theresa May. But he was more negative about the case for an article 50 extension than Number 10 might have expected, and his comments should quash Brexiter claims from people like David Davis (eg, here) and Boris Johnson (eg, here) that Brussels will blink at the last minute. Here are the main points. Barnier warned Theresa May that she could not take it for granted that the EU will agree to an article 50 extension. Rather than treat it as a given, Barnier insisted that it would come with disadvantages, and that the EU might seek to attach conditions. He said extending article 50 could bring economic and political costs for the EU. In his opening statement he said: In any case, the European council will need to assess what is in the best interest of the EU. Extending the uncertainty without a clear plan would add to the economic cost for our businesses but could also incur a political cost for the EU. It is for the British government and parliament to decide very quickly what the UK wants to do next. He said, if May asks for an extension, EU leaders will want to know why they should grant one. He said: EU leaders will need a concrete plan from the UK in order to be able to make an informed decision. And key questions will be: Does an extension increase the chances for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement? Will the UK request an extension because it wants a bit more time to rework the political declaration? And then during the Q&amp;A Barnier said: The EU authorities want to know what the underlying political process, which would be the grounds for that extension, would be. Political process within the House of Commons, or within the general political debate within the UK ... All I would say is that is it is our duty to ask whether this extension would be useful. Because an extension will be something that will extend uncertainty, and uncertainty costs. It has a cost for everybody. And we can\u2019t prolong uncertainty without having a good reason for it. He confirmed that the EU would be willing to change the political declaration on the future relationship. He said: I recall that this political declaration, which sets out the framework for our future relation, could be made more ambitious in the coming days if a majority in the House of Commons so wishes. By \u201cmore ambitious\u201d, he meant more attuned to a soft Brexit outcome, or more Norwegian. He said he thought May would have to offer \u201csomething new\u201d to justify getting a long article 50 extension. During the Q&amp;A he said: My feeling is ... a longer extension needs to be linked to something new. There needs to be a new event. This has been interpreted as a reference to holding a general election, or a referendum, although May has already said that, if MPs do not pass a Brexit deal this week, next week she will begin a process in the Commons intended to see what Brexit solution they can unite behind. (May made that commitment when she was planning a meaningful vote this week. John Bercow\u2019s ruling yesterday has complicated things, although at lobby this morning the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the commitments given at the despatch box by the PM still stood.) Barnier mocked the idea that May could ask for a long extension and a short one too. When this was put to him, he said: You said both short and long, well, it\u2019s either one or the other, isn\u2019t it? The idea that May could ask for a long extension and a short one refers to the possibility that she could ask for a long extension, with the possibility of shortening it if MPs back her deal next week. He said everyone should \u201cfinalise all preparations for a no-deal scenario. Here is the full text of Michel Barnier\u2019s opening statement at the press conference. Paris reiterated its tough line on Tuesday afternoon, insisting no extension could be granted to the UK without the government presenting a credible \u201cnew strategy or plan\u201d which would need to have parliament\u2019s backing. An Elys\u00e9e official said: Playing for time just for the sake of playing for time would not constitute a project or strategy. Now is not the time for procrastinating. Paris, which is impatient for the EU to turn to other issues of reform rather than facing much more time bogged down in Brexit, has reiterated that it needs concrete solutions from London. France won\u2019t back an extension unless it comes with a clear, new, credible plan which can gain majority parliament support. France has insisted that the withdrawal agreement, which won\u2019t be renegotiated, is a ticket to exit the EU in an \u201corganised\u201d way. The source at the French presidential palace said London must give clarity on the way forward: \u201cAn extension is merely an instrument, it\u2019s not a solution or a strategy in itself ... Now is not the time for pondering or looking at perspectives on Brexit\u201d, instead it was the final hour to find a concrete plan. Paris is adamant that it wants to protect \u201cthe functioning of the EU\u201d. If a longer extension were to be granted, for example 12 months, \u201cwe would have to look at the implications of that\u201d, in terms of how a country planning to leave would have a seat and a say in key future decisions, the official said. Just in case you did not get the message, these are from Daniel Ferrie, Michel Barnier\u2019s press officer. Here is some Twitter reaction to Michel Barnier\u2019s press conference. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Guardian\u2019s Paul Johnson From the Telegraph\u2019s James Rothwell From the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson Barnier says EU countries have rights and obligations with regard to European elections. Citizens have the right to vote in European elections. He says the EU needs also to take into account the amount of time needed to participate in elections. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Barnier\u2019s comments don\u2019t help Theresa May. I will summarise them shortly. Q: There are reports that May might ask for a short extension, and a long one as a backup. Ciamba says he agrees with what Barnier said about an extension having costs. Barnier says the issue of an extension is not a dogmatic issue. The EU has never been dogmatic. And it is not going to change that now. This is a practical issue, he says. He says he fully respects the sovereignty of parliament, and its procedures. Turning to the question, he says: Both short and long? It is either one or the other, isn\u2019t it? Barnier suggests EU would be sceptical about a UK demand for a long extension, with a short one as an alternative. He says a longer extension would have to be \u201clinked to something new\u201d. There would need to be a new event. Barnier says a long article 50 extension would have to be linked to a new development. Q: So are you saying the EU would reject a request of a long extension, with a short one as an alternative? Barnier says that is not what he said. This will be a decision for the heads of government, he says. He says he is a simple soul. Something has to be either short or long. Asked if he knows when May will send her letter, Ciamba says that is for Theresa May to announce. Barnier says he is not here to discuss the duration of an article 50 extension. He is asking what purpose it would serve. It would have to be useful, it says. The EU would want to know what it should grant one. And what the underlying political process behind it would be. He says it is the EU\u2019s duty to ask if the extensikon An extension would extend uncertainty, and uncertainty costs. And the EU should not extend uncertainty without having a good reason, he says. Barnier says all sides should now finalise arrangements for a no-deal Brexit. The EU and the UK should finalise arrangement for a no-deal Brexit, says Banier. Barnier says, if the UK asks for an extension, the EU will need to know its reasons. The key questions will be: Does this increase the chances of the deal passing? Does the UK want more time to change the plan? Barnier says the framework for the future relationship could be made \u201cmore ambitious\u201d if the UK wants that. He says extending uncertainty could add to the economic costs for businesses. And it could bring political costs too. Barnier warns that extending article 50 could increase the economic and political costs of Brexit for the EU. The EU press conference has just started. George Ciamba, the Romanian minister for European affairs (Romania has the rotating presidency of the EU) starts by repeating the point he made this morning about wanting more clarity from the UK. (See 10.08am.) Michel Barnier is speaking now. He says it is a key moment in the talks. We are 10 days from 29 March, he says. He says that was the date the UK chose for Brexit. He says both sides have spent a long time on the negotiation. They have agreed a withdrawal agreement. If the UK wants to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, this withdrawal treaty is the only one available. He says, in the absence of ratification of the treaty, \u201cwe are now faced with genuine uncertainty\u201d. He says the EU now needs choices from the UK. Jeremy Corbyn has held Brexit talks at Westminster with the leaders of the smaller opposition parties in the Commons: the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems\u2019 Sir Vince Cable, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts and the Green\u2019s Caroline Lucas. After the meeting Blackford, Cable, Saville Roberts and Lucas issued a joint statement urging Corbyn to be more positive about a second referendum. They said: We welcome that today we have sat down with Jeremy Corbyn for the first time. In the meeting our message was clear, Labour must move to back a public vote, which includes the option to remain, before the window of opportunity closes. There is no such thing as a good Brexit \u2013 whether it is a Labour or Conservative version of it \u2013 jobs, public services and the environment will suffer. Remaining in the EU is the best deal on offer and with time running out, Labour must now deliver on their promises so that we can avoid a catastrophic Brexit. We hope that we can now work collaboratively and move swiftly to ensure the best possible chance for a fresh referendum to take place. Labour issued its own statement after the meeting, implying that Corbyn was more interested in getting the other parties to support Labour\u2019s Brexit plan. A party spokesman said: This afternoon, Jeremy Corbyn held constructive talks with Ian Blackford, Vince Cable, Liz Saville Roberts and Caroline Lucas about breaking the current Brexit deadlock. The party leaders affirmed their common opposition to the government\u2019s botched deal or a no deal outcome. Should there not be a majority in parliament for May\u2019s deal or a public vote, Corbyn called on the other parties to engage constructively to find a parliamentary majority for a close economic relationship with the EU that can work for the whole country. The party leaders discussed efforts to ensure May\u2019s deal would be put to a public vote if she is able to force it through parliament with threats and phony bribes. The EU/Barnier press conference will start in the next few minutes. In the Commons MPs are currently debating Labour move to replace two members of the foreign affairs committee, Ian Austin and Mike Gapes, who have recently left the party, with two Labour MPs, Conor McGinn and Catherine West. Seats on select committees are allocated on a party basis (each party gets a certain number of seats, depending on overall party strength in the Commons) and so Labour can argue that the Austin/Gapes slots should go to Labour MPs. Sarah Wollaston, who recently left the Tories to join Gapes in the new Independent Group, has tabled an amendment saying Austin and Gapes should be allowed to stay. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has been addressing the EU\u2019s general affairs council meeting this afternoon. He is due to speak at a press conference later. ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, thinks that Theresa May will end up requesting a short extension to the end of June - with a 21-month extension as a backup. As he explains in an ITV blog: Her ministers think she will request a delay until 30 June, predicated on her somehow getting her deal ratified by MPs - with an option of an extension to the end of 2020 in the event she ever concedes her own Brexit plan is definitely an ex-parrot (or dead, for the few of you too young to remember Monty Python). May\u2019s hope is that if this delay schedule is agreed as a legally binding text then it would have the effect of amending her deal - such that the speaker could not then block her holding the meaningful vote for a third time. This would fit with what Number 10 was (or, more importantly, was not) saying at the lobby briefing this morning. (See 1pm.) And this is from Mehreen Khan. This is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. Here is an interesting hypothetical ... In theory, yes. Whoever is PM can revoke article 50 unilaterally, or request an article 50 extension. However, there are several buts. 1) After losing a no confidence vote, Theresa May would remain prime minister until the Queen appointed someone else. Under the Fixed-terms Parliament Act, the Commons would have 14 days to see if someone else could form a government. (The procedure is not 100% clear, but presumably the Queen would only appoint someone else if she were confident that PM could win a vote of confidence.) If no alternative PM could command a majority, there would be an election - which would mean May staying on for another month or so. 2) Unless the Commons suddenly decides to vote for Vince Cable to become PM as head of a cross-party coalition, it is very hard to imagine any likely May replacement revoking article 50. (Corbyn has repeatedly said the result of the referendum must be honoured.) 3) Some lawyers argue that, if the PM were to revoke article 50, s/he would need parliamentary approval, which does not seem likely to be forthcoming. More from cabinet. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary who only yesterday restated his opposition to Theresa May\u2019s deal, has had a meeting with the prime minister. This is from ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, have issued a joint statement after their talks in Dublin earlier. Theresa May recently read the riot act to her cabinet about leaking. It wasn\u2019t an entire success, because some post-cabinet briefing continues. I posted some earlier (see 1.17pm and 1.40pm) and here is some more. (Note: some of these reporters are clearly quoting the same source.) From the Times\u2019 Sam Coates From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said today that she could not predict how the EU would respond to the UK request for an article 50 extension, because \u201ctoo much is in flux\u201d. According to reports from Reuters and the Associated Press, she said: Now, we will see what Theresa May says to us, what her wishes are - we will try to respond to those ... We will watch very attentively how the British government reacts to what was said yesterday in parliament and then deal with the situation. I cannot evaluate what it will be on Thursday - much too much is in flux. Merkel also admitted that she is no expert on Erskine May. She told reporters: I\u2019ll concede that I wasn\u2019t actively aware of the British Parliament\u2019s rules of procedure from the 17th century, so I took note of this with interest yesterday. The general affairs council press conference is now over. Beyond George Ciamba\u2019s comments about a no-deal Brexit (see 1.35pm), nothing else on Brexit came up. According to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuennsberg, some ministers left cabinet today unsure what Theresa May is going to say in her letter to Donald Tusk, the European council president, about the article 50 extension. Ciamba says the EU summit at the end of this week will focus on economic issues. (That\u2019s a helpful reminder that the EU has plenty of things to talk about beyond Brexit.) The EU is holding a press conference about today\u2019s general affairs council meeting. George Ciamba, the Romanian minister for European affairs, is speaking now. He says he and his EU ministers discussed contingency plans that might be needed in the event of a no-deal Brexit. There are details of what was agreed here. The Conservative pro-European Phillip Lee has just told the World at One that he thinks there is now more support in the Commons for a second referendum on Brexit than there is for the PM\u2019s deal. That would certainly be true if you counted all Labour MPs as being in favour, on the grounds that the party is now officially backing the idea of putting Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal to a referendum, although if parliament approved a Labour version of Brexit, the party would not necessarily favour putting that to a public vote. There were 242 MPs voting for May\u2019s Brexit deal last week. Labour currently has 245 MPs, and the SNP (35 MPs), the Lib Dems (11 MPs), the Independent Group (11 MPs), Plaid Cymru (4 MPs) and the Greens (one MP) all favour a second referendum. This is from Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, following his meeting with Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, in Dublin. The two men had been due to hold a press briefing after their talks, but according to Sky News that was cancelled. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The Downing Street lobby briefing was unusually unilluminating (which is normally a sign that they have not decided what to do in Number 10). Here are the key points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that Theresa May will write to Donald Tusk, president of the European council, requesting an article 50 extension. But the spokesman would not say whether this would happen today or tomorrow, and he refused to comment on what the letter will say. Last week May said that she would request a short extension if MPs had passed her deal before the summit, which starts on Thursday, or a long extension if they had not. But the speaker\u2019s ruling yesterday, which made holding another meaningful vote this week much harder, may have kiboshed that plan, and the spokesman refused to confirm that May would remain bound by this strategy. (One option might be for the PM, instead of just asking for a long extension, to ask for a long extension, with the option of a shorter one if MPs pass her deal next week, but that is speculation - and not something the spokesman confirmed.) Ministers spent 90 minutes discussing all this at cabinet today, the spokesman said. The spokesman came close to confirming that there will be no meaningful vote on the Brexit deal this week. He said that a vote would have to take place tomorrow, that in that case the motion would have to go down today, and that that was \u201cnot something that has happened as of yet\u201d. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, that he is announcing more money today for security around mosques and other places of worship in the light of the New Zealand terrorist attack. There was a substantial discussion of the threat posed by far-right terrorism at cabinet, with ministers also saying social media companies needed to do more to remove videos like the one filmed by attacked in Christchurch last week. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has a good Twitter thread on what EU countries think about an article 50 extension. It starts here. I am off to the Downing Street lobby briefing. I will post again after 12.30pm. In an interesting Spectator blog, James Forsyth says that, although the talks between the government and the DUP about the backstop are going on, the DUP are worried that anything Theresa May promises about Great Britain maintaining regulatory alignment with Northern Ireland might not be honoured by her successor. Here is an extract. One of those familiar with DUP thinking tells me that one concern they have is over the attitude of Theresa May\u2019s successor to the provision that they are negotiating which would see the rest of the UK follow any regulations that Northern Ireland adopted in the backstop. The government is offering to put this measure into the withdrawal agreement bill. This would give it force, particularly given that the WAB will be superior legislation. However, the eventual UK / EU trade deal could end up overriding this lock. I understand that yesterday the DUP put out feelers to the leading Brexiteer leadership candidates about how they would approach this issue and were not reassured by the answers that came back. Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe ministers, was also speaking to reporters ahead of the EU general affairs council this morning. She said the uncertainty around Brexit was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. She went on: We need an initiative, we need something new because if it\u2019s an extension to remain in the same deadlock [that would be unacceptable.] How do we get out of this deadlock? This is a question for the British authorities. [The UK] have said \u2018no\u2019 to a no deal and they have said \u2018no\u2019 to a realistic deal. Now they have to change their mind on one or the other. Loiseau also said, if the EU does grant an article 50 extension, it would have to be for a purpose. Grant an extension - what for? Time is not a solution, it\u2019s a method. If there is an objective and a strategy and it has to come from London. This is from the BBC\u2019s Berlin correspondent, Jenny Hill. The Labour MP Andrew Gwynne has posted a nice thread on Twitter illustrating how divided his constituents are on Brexit. Unemployment has hit a new 44-year low of just 3.9%, down from 4% last month, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports on his business live blog. There is full coverage, with reaction and analysis, here. The Conservative MP Nick Boles thinks all the controversy about John Bercow\u2019s ruling is a fuss about nothing. He says, if Theresa May has a majority for her deal, she could also use that majority to change Commons standing orders to allow another vote on the deal notwithstanding the standard \u201cno repeat votes\u201d rule. Boles is right about this, although this plan would mean Theresa May having to win a second, potentially tricky vote. Given her recent record in Brexit votes, you can see why she wants as few of those as possible. George Ciamba, the Romanian minister for European affairs, is chairing this morning\u2019s meeting of the EU general affairs council, because Romania holds the rotating presidency of the EU. We were saying all the time that we need to have more clarity from London. Clearly, there is no clarity. There is less clarity today than ... yesterday. We are still looking forward to the European council and to see what is going to be the political will from London. At the end of the day, be it the speaker of the house, be it the prime minister, be it the members of parliament, I think it\u2019s about the political will and about a little bit more clarity what Europe could do, because we know very well what Europe cannot do. Ciamba also said it would not be up to the general affairs council to discuss the details of an article 50 extension. The EU\u2019s general affairs council is meeting in Brussels this morning. This is where EU foreign ministers will discuss the agenda for the EU summit later this week. On the way in Michael Roth, Germany\u2019s Europe minister, indicated that Berlin is getting fed up with British indecision. Asked about Brexit, he told reporters: The clock is ticking and time is running out. [We are] really exhausted by these negotiations. And I expect clear and precise proposals [from] the British government why such an extension is necessary. It is not just a game. It is an extremely serious situation, not just for the people in the United Kingdom, but for the people in the European Union. For my government, the key priority is to prevent a no-deal Brexit ... I don\u2019t have any appetite for substance-less, very abstract discussions and negotiations on the Brexit. Please deliver, dear friends in London, please deliver. The clock is ticking. This is fun. The BBC\u2019s Joey D\u2019Urso doorstepped John Bercow, the Commons speaker, as Bercow was arriving at the Commons for work this morning. At first Bercow responded to D\u2019Urso\u2019s questions with faux gratitude and a reference to a bobble hat, showing that it is not just MPs who can get the full blast of passive aggressivity from the speaker. But then D\u2019Urso managed to achieve a feat hitherto unknown in parliamentary history; as he persisted with his questioning, he reduced Bercow to silence. Here are some more lines from the interviews that Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has been giving this morning. Barclay suggested that, if a majority of MPs want another vote on a Brexit deal, he would expect John Bercow, the speaker, to agree to one. He dismissed claims that Bercow\u2019s ruling made a no-deal Brexit more likely. Responding to the Tory Brexiter David Jones, who made that claim in an earlier interview on the Today programme, Barley said that Jones was \u201cclutching at straws because the house has already ruled to take no-deal off the table\u201d. Barclay said having no Brexit was becoming more likely. He said: What has become very clear from the speaker\u2019s ruling yesterday is, for my Brexit colleagues, I think they can see that there is a growing risk of no Brexit. He rejected suggestions that ministers could seek a prorogation of Parliament from the Queen in order to get round the ruling. He said: I think the one thing everyone would agree on is involving Her Majesty in any of the issues around Brexit is not the way forward so I don\u2019t see that as a realistic option. Theresa May will chair cabinet this morning, where her ministers will discuss how to respond to John Bercow\u2019s surprise ruling yesterday about not allowing another Commons vote on her Brexit deal unless it changes significantly. There is no consensus yet on quite how significant this decision will turn out to be - Brexiters and remainers have both welcomed it on the grounds that it boosts their respective causes, and they can\u2019t both be right - but we have had a preliminary response from Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, who has been giving interviews this morning. Barclay said it was now \u201cmore unlikely\u201d that there will be another vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal this week, before the EU summit starts on Thursday. But he also said the government was still committed to getting May\u2019s deal through parliament. He said: What we need to do is secure the deal. This is the only deal on the table. The EU is clear it is the only deal on the table. Business need the certainty of this deal and it is time that parliament comes together and gets behind it. And he also said that Bercow\u2019s decision would not absolutely rule out a new meaningful vote. He explained: What the speaker has said in his ruling is there needs to be something that is different. You can have the same motion but where the circumstances have changed. So we need to look at the details of the ruling, we need to consider that in the terms of earlier rulings that don\u2019t particularly align with yesterday\u2019s. The fact a number of members of parliament have said that they will change their votes points to the fact that there are things that are different. On the basis of what Barclay is saying, it may well be that the main effect of Bercow\u2019s ruling will be to kill of all prospect of a third meaningful vote this week (MV3), followed by an MV4 next week, leaving instead just one new meaningful vote before the scheduled exit day on Friday next week. I will post more from Barclay\u2019s various interviews this morning soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. 10am: Robert Chote, the chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the spring statement. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering it on his business live blog. 11.30am: Donald Tusk, president of the European council, meets Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, in Dublin. Afterwards they will hold a press conference. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. Also at some point today Jeremy Corbyn will be meeting the Wesminster leaders of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens to discuss alternative approaches to Brexit. A meeting had been planned for yesterday, but had to be re-arranged. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May will be forced to write to EU leaders on Wednesday and beg them to delay Brexit, with her cabinet deadlocked over the best way out of what Downing Street now concedes is a \u201ccrisis\u201d. The government had maintained until the last possible moment that Brexit could go ahead as planned on 29 March or after a brief \u201ctechnical extension\u201d. But after the Speaker, John Bercow, ruled the prime minister could not put her deal to parliament unchanged for a third \u201cmeaningful vote,\u201d her spokesman conceded it was now too late to leave with a deal. He said May would write to the European council president, Donald Tusk, to ask for an extension to article 50, before EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday. He declined to say how long a delay she would request, or for what purpose, simply insisting: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wait for that letter to be published.\u201d Asked whether May agreed with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, who described the situation after Bercow\u2019s ruling on Monday as a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d, her spokesman said: \u201cIf you were to look back at the speech the prime minister gave, just before meaningful vote two, she said that if MPs did not support meaningful vote two we would be in a crisis. Events yesterday tell you that that situation has come to pass.\u201d Ministers discussed Brexit for about 90 minutes at what several sources said was a testy cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Insiders said opinion was more or less evenly divided, between those who favoured requesting a short, three-month extension, leaving in place the prospect of a no-deal Brexit in the summer, and those who want to see a much longer delay. Several sources said ministers emerged from cabinet unclear about what May\u2019s personal position was on the best way forward. Brexit-backing ministers, including leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, protested strongly about the idea of a long extension. They intend to lobby May again in the next 24 hours in a bid to quash the idea. Leadsom even warned that she now believed her colleagues were trying to thwart Brexit: \u201cThis used to be a cabinet that would deliver Brexit, but now from what I\u2019m hearing it doesn\u2019t seem like it is,\u201d she said. May also met backbench colleagues to sound them out about the next steps, including the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is widely regarded as the potential frontrunner in a leadership contest should the prime minister step aside. One cabinet source said: \u201cThe current position is untenable; if they just accept a long extension the party will split.\u201d Some members of the backbench European Research Group (ERG) at their regular meeting in Westminster on Tuesday nightopenly called for the prime minister to step aside. However, several leave-supporting MPs said they had been reassured that May\u2019s intention was still to push ahead with Brexit as rapidly as possible and that she would only accept a longer extension if forced into it by Brussels. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, hinted on Tuesday that Brussels would demand a clear answer to the question of how the government intended to proceed as the quid pro quo for granting an extension. \u201cThe key questions will be: does an extension increase the chances of the ratification of the withdrawal agreement? Will the UK request an extension because it wants a bit more time to rework the political declaration?\u201d Barnier said. \u201cIf not, what would be the purpose and outcome of an extension? And how can we ensure that at the end of a possible extension we are not back at the same situation as we are today?\u201d Any extension would have to be approved by a vote in both houses of parliament next week because the 29 March date is written into the EU Withdrawal Act. Ministers have promised that parliament will have the opportunity to debate how it could decide on an alternative approach next Monday, but May\u2019s spokesman insisted her priority was to continue to try to win over MPs to her deal. \u201cThe prime minister has set out that she believes that the deal she has secured from the EU is a good one, and that it is the best deal available, and she continues to work on finding a way for parliament to pass that deal, so that we can get on with leaving the EU as quickly as possible,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. Negotiations with the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) have continued since the weekend in the hope that if its leaders signal support for her approach, key Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg could swing their weight behind it. One strand of the talks has involved Philip Hammond discussing post-Brexit options for taxing goods crossing the Irish border. \u201cThe chancellor is a crucial figure in all this because customs and excise comes under his remit,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the negotiations. \u201cThe problem that is being discussed is how to tax goods \u2013 where they might be taxed, away from the border or otherwise \u2013 and how that might be done\u201d. The DUP\u2019s Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Nigel Dodds have also met May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, and the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill. Discussions have centred on how Northern Irish politicians will maintain some political oversight of the backstop, the agreement to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal.",
